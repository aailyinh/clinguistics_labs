      "text": "More than 11,000 homes across the UK have been empty for 10 years or more, research by the Liberal Democrats has found. \nThe figures, from 276 local councils, show there are more than 216,000 homes across the country which have been empty for six months or more.\nLib Dem leader Vince Cable called it a \"national scandal\", at a time when \"the homelessness crisis is worsening\".\nThe number of empty homes is down a third since 2010, the government said. \nDurham had the most empty homes (6,500) followed by Leeds (5,724), Bradford (4,144), Cornwall (3,273) and Liverpool (3,093). \nThe data - obtained through a Freedom of Information request - also reveals only one in 13 councils is making use of Empty Dwelling Management Orders.\nEDMOs allow councils in England and Wales to take over residential properties that have been empty for six months or more.\nJust 19 of the 247 councils in England and Wales that responded (the powers do not apply in Scotland) had used an EDMO in the past five years. \nCouncils did return 23,000 empty homes back into use.\nMeanwhile homelessness in the UK is getting worse. \nIn December, a committee of MPs found more than 78,000 families were living in temporary accommodation in England. The number of people sleeping on the streets had increased by 134% since 2011.  \nMr Cable has called on the government to review the current system \"which is clearly not working\".\n\"Councils need to be given the powers and resources to bring empty homes back into use,\" he said.\n\"This must form part of a wider package to tackle the housing crisis, including building more homes on unused public sector land and clamping down on land-banking.\"\nThe Department for Communities and Local Government pointed out that powers had been given to councils to bring empty homes back into use.\n\"At the same time, we're implementing the major changes to law and investing over \u00a31bn to 2020 to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping,\" a spokesman added."

      "text": "A group of New Zealanders has constructed a sand island in coastal waters, seemingly in a creative attempt to avoid a ban on drinking in public places.\nThe group built the structure at low tide in the Tairua estuary on the Coromandel peninsula on Sunday afternoon, reports said.\nThey then installed a picnic table and ice box for drinks.\nLocals joked that they were in \"international waters\" and thus exempt from an official liquor ban.\nThe group drank into the night on New Year's Eve, watching the fireworks, reported New Zealand website stuff.co.nz - and the construction was still intact on Monday morning.\nA ban on public drinking is in force in Coromandel over the New Year period and those violating the ban face a fine of $250 (\u00a3130; US$180) or arrest.\nBut authorities seemed to be taking the initiative in light-hearted spirit.\n\"That's creative thinking - if I had known [about it] I probably would have joined them,\" said local police commander Inspector John Kelly when told about the sand island. \nThe images were posted in a local Facebook group, Tairua ChitChat, by David Saunders.\nMr Saunders told the BBC: \"It was great to see some Kiwis having a bit of fun.\"\nBut a well-known community organiser Noddy Watts said the ban was not working and was simply resulting in swathes of arrests.\nHe said the police were \"dealing with drunk teens\".\n\"That's not what they are there for. That's what parents are there for,\" he said, according to the New Zealand Herald.\n\"The police and St John were getting frustrated with the result and said it has to change,\" said Mr Watts according to the New Zealand Herald.\nYou may also like:"

      "text": "Israeli authorities have charged a Palestinian teenager with assault after a video of her hitting and pushing Israeli soldiers went viral.\nAhed Tamimi, 16, and her cousin were filmed in a confrontation with the soldiers that was widely shared by Palestinians on social media.\nShe faces 12 charges including aggravated assault and throwing stones.\nBut the family say they were involved in legitimate resistance during protests in the occupied West Bank.\nIsrael's military says the soldiers were preventing Palestinians from throwing stones at nearby motorists.\nThe video, filmed on 15 December, shows a group of women including Tamini shouting at, hitting and kicking two heavily-armed Israeli soldiers.\nIt was widely circulated online, and many Palestinians have hailed Tamimi as a hero of the resistance to Israeli occupation.\nOn Sunday, her cousin, Nour Tamimi, was charged with assault and disturbing soldiers from carrying out their duties. Her mother, who filmed the video and posted it on Facebook, has also been charged.\nAt the time of her arrest, Ahed's father said soldiers had fired tear gas and broken windows at the family's house.\nBassem Tamimi, a prominent activist, added that Ahed's 15-year-old cousin, Mohammed, had also been hit in the face with a rubber bullet fired by Israeli soldiers.\nMohammed was reportedly wounded during a weekly protest in the village of Nabi Salih where the Israeli military said more than 200 Palestinians threw stones.\n\"Several Palestinians entered a nearby home and continued throwing rocks at soldiers from inside the home with its occupants' consent,\" the military said.\n\"Forces removed the rioters from the home and remained standing in the entrance in order to prevent further entry. Later, several Palestinian women came out to face the soldiers in order to incite provocation.\"\nThe military said an investigation had determined that an infantry company commander was one of the two soldiers shown being confronted in the video, and that he had \"conducted himself professionally by not responding in kind\".\nIn the video, the girl identified as Ahed can be heard telling the soldiers to leave the entrance to the home. When they do not move, she punches and kicks the soldiers. A second girl and a woman also push and kick the soldiers later in the video.\nLast month, Mr Tamimi told the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Aharonth that the incident in the video took place after the soldiers \"entered the grounds of the house, started throwing gas grenades around and broke the house's windows\".\n\"Their conduct may seem humane at that instance, but I don't think their general conduct that day was humane. I'm proud of my daughter and what she did\", he said.\nTwo years ago, Ahed Tamimi was in a video which went viral in which she was seen biting the hand of an Israeli soldier holding a Palestinian boy who the army said had been throwing stones.\nPalestinian activists praised her actions, while many in Israel accused her family of using her as a propaganda tool."

      "text": "More than 300 actresses, writers and directors have launched a project to help fight sexual harassment in the film industry and other workplaces.\nThe initiative, which is called Time's Up, was announced via a full-page advert printed in the New York Times. \nThe Hollywood project is described as a \"unified call for change from women in entertainment for women everywhere\". \nIt comes in the wake of sexual abuse allegations by high-profile actresses against film producer Harvey Weinstein.\nThe campaign, which is backed by hundreds of actresses including Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon, Cate Blanchett, Eva Longoria and Emma Stone, has already raised more than $13m (\u00a39.6m) of its $15m target.\nThe money raised will be used to fund legal support for both female and male victims of sexual harassment at work. \nThe project is aimed primarily at those who are unable to meet the payments to defend themselves, such as agricultural or factory workers, caretakers and waitresses.\nIn a \"solidarity letter\" published on its website, Time's Up says the \"struggle for women to break in, to rise up the ranks and to simply be heard\" must end, adding: \"Time's up on this impenetrable monopoly.\"\nThe letter, which is aimed at \"every woman... who has had to fend off sexual advances\", goes on to say that such harassment can often continue because \"perpetrators and employers never face any consequences\".\nIt also calls for \"gender inequality and the imbalance of power\" to be addressed, stressing the need for more women to gain positions of authority and parity of pay.\nIn December, Time magazine named \"the Silence Breakers\" - women and men who spoke out against sexual abuse and harassment - as its \"Person of the Year\" for 2017.\nLast year also saw the rise of the #MeToo hashtag, which inspired a global movement of women and men to share their stories of sexual abuse and harassment.\nThe term gained momentum after actress Alyssa Milano took to Twitter to ask victims of sexual assault to come forward in a show of solidarity.\nBetween October and December 2017, the hashtag was used on Twitter and Facebook more than six million times."

      "text": "The Nigerian army says more than 700 people held by Boko Haram militants in the north-east of the country have escaped captivity. \nAn army spokesperson, Col Timothy Antigha, said they had fled several islands in Lake Chad and arrived in the town of Monguno, in Borno state. \nThere has been no independent verification of the army's claim. \nA BBC correspondent says the escapes are likely to have happened over a period of time, not in one go. \nThe military says a recent armed forces operation, Deep Punch II, has weakened Boko Haram.  \nIn his New Year address, President Muhammadu Buhari said the group had been \"beaten\".\nIn a post on the HQ Nigerian Army Facebook page, Col Antigha said the 700 comprised \"farmers, fishermen and members of their families who were hitherto held by Boko Haram terrorists as farm workers\".\nHe said the recent operation \"was targeted at destroying Boko Haram infrastructure and logistics; such as communication centres, fabrication yards, bomb making equipment, vehicles and other means of sustenance\". \n\"The ensuing collapse of their command structure and means of survival have therefore triggered the abandonment of the islands and escape of the abductees,\" he wrote.\nCol Antigha said the escapees were being profiled to ensure there were no militants hidden among them. \nHe also said two women among the escaped captives had given birth safely at a military holding facility.\nOver eight years, Boko Haram's campaign of Islamist violence has killed more than 20,000 people and displaced some 2.6 million.\nDespite the authorities' insistence that the group has been vanquished, in recent months Boko Haram fighters have stepped up their attacks on military and civilian targets."

      "text": "The UK's recycling industry says it doesn't know how to cope with a Chinese ban on imports of plastic waste.\nBritain has been shipping up to 500,000 tonnes of plastic for recycling in China every year, but now the trade has been stopped.\nAt the moment the UK cannot deal with much of that waste, says the UK Recycling Association. \nIts chief executive, Simon Ellin, told the BBC he had no idea how the problem would be solved in the short term.\n\"It's a huge blow for us... a game-changer for our industry,\" he said. \"We've relied on China so long for our waste\u2026 55% of paper, 25% plus of plastics.\n\"We simply don't have the markets in the UK. It's going to mean big changes in our industry.\"\nChina has introduced the ban from this month on \"foreign garbage\" as part of a move to upgrade its industries.\nOther Asian nations will take some of the plastic, but there will still be a lot left.\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove has admitted that he was slow to spot the problem coming.\nThe UK organisation Recoup, which recycles plastics, said the imports ban would lead to stock-piling of plastic waste and a move towards incineration and landfill.\nPeter Fleming, from the Local Government Association, told the BBC: \"Clearly there's a part to play for incineration but not all parts of the country have incinerators.\n\"It's a challenge - but mostly in the short term\u2026 and we will cope. In the longer term we need a much more intelligent waste strategy.\"\nAny move towards burning more plastic waste, though, would be met with fierce resistance from environmental groups.\nLouise Edge, from Greenpeace, told the BBC: \"The government has got us into this mess by continually putting off decisions and passing the buck.\n\"Incineration is the wrong answer - it's a high-carbon non-renewable form of generating electricity. It also creates toxic chemicals and heavy metals.\n\"If you build incinerators it creates a market for the next 20 years for single-use plastics, which is the very thing we need to be reducing right now.\"\nThe government is consulting with industry over a tax on single-use plastics and a deposit scheme for bottles.\nMr Gove told the BBC his long-term goals were to reduce the amount of plastic in the economy overall, reduce the number of different plastics, simplify local authority rules so people can easily judge what's recyclable and what isn't as well as increase the rate of recycling.\nThe UK must, he said, \"stop off-shoring its dirt\".\nThe Commons Environmental Audit Committee said Britain should introduce a sliding scale tax on plastic packaging with the hardest to recycle being charge most and the easiest to recycle being charged least.\nThere is broad agreement over much of that agenda, but it is not yet clear how the UK will achieve that long-term goal - or how it will solve its short-term China crisis.\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"

      "text": "Protests in Iran continued late into Monday, despite the president saying that the unrest \"is nothing\".\nAnti-government chanting and burning cars were reported on the fifth day of unrest, while police said an officer was killed in a central city and others wounded. \nAt least 13 people are believed to have died in the clashes so far.\nPresident Hassan Rouhani said protests were an \"opportunity, not a threat\" but vowed to crack down on \"lawbreakers\".\nThe US meanwhile stepped up support for the protesters' \"bold resistance\".\nThe protests began last Thursday in the city of Mashhad, initially against price rises and corruption but now with wider anti-government sentiment.\nReports from Monday's events spoke of a heavy police presence in the capital. \nThe Mehr news agency reported a taxi being set alight. Police had used tear gas and water cannon the previous evening to quell a rally in Tehran's Engheleb Square.\nState media were also quoting a police spokesman as saying that shots had been fired at police in Najafabad, near Isfahan in central Iran, killing one officer and wounding three.\nReuters news agency reported that a police station in the town of Qahderijan was partly set on fire amid clashes between security forces and protesters trying to occupy the building. Unconfirmed reports suggested several casualties, it added. \nSocial media postings spoke of fresh protests in Birjand in the east, Kermanshah in the west and Shadegan in the far south-west.\nInitially, state TV said that 10 people had been killed overnight on Sunday, but by Monday evening that figure had been raised to 13 by a regional governor:\nTwo people also died in earlier violence.\nIn a statement on the presidency website, Mr Rouhani sought to play down the violence.\nHe said: \"This is nothing. Criticism and protest are an opportunity not a threat.\"\nBut he also vowed to act against \"rioters and lawbreakers\".\n\"Our nation will deal with this minority who chant slogans against the law and people's wishes, and insult the sanctities and values of the revolution,\" he said.\nA later tweet appeared more conciliatory, saying that the government needed to pay attention to people's demands on livelihood issues and corruption.\nIran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has taken a tough line, warning anti-government protesters they will face the nation's \"iron fist\" if political unrest continues.\nThe IRGC is a powerful force with ties to the country's supreme leader, and is dedicated to preserving the country's Islamic system. Correspondents say it would be a significant escalation were they to become officially involved in policing the protests.\nJudiciary Chief Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli-Larijani on Monday called for a crackdown on \"rioters\" and \"vandals\".\n\"Some individuals are exploiting the situation. This is wrong,\" he said.\nUp to 400 people are reported to have been arrested in recent days.\nPresident Donald Trump stepped his war of words with Iran's leaders on Monday, posting a tweet saying the \"great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food and freedom\".\nHe added in capital letters \"TIME FOR CHANGE!\"\nVice-President Mike Pence took an even stronger tone.\nHe tweeted: \"The bold and growing resistance of the Iranian people today gives hope and faith to all who struggle for freedom and against tyranny. We must not and we will not let them down.\"\nHe spoke of the \"shameful mistake\" of not supporting previous Iranian protesters.\nThe Green Movement in 2009 saw millions of protesters dispute the election victory of incumbent president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\nThe protests were brutally suppressed, with at least 30 people killed and thousands arrested.\nThe latest US approach has infuriated Iran.\nMr Rouhani described the US president as an \"enemy of the Iranian nation from the top of his head to his very toes\".\nThe EU, meanwhile, called on Iran to guarantee its citizens' right to peaceful protest, saying it had been in touch with Iranian authorities and was monitoring the situation.\nMeanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said that \"the UK is watching events in Iran closely\".\n\"We believe that there should be meaningful debate about the legitimate and important issues the protesters are raising and we look to the Iranian authorities to permit this\", he said.\nAnalysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian\nThere is widespread and seething discontent in Iran where repression is pervasive and economic hardship is getting worse - one BBC Persian investigation has found that on average Iranians have become 15% poorer in the past 10 years. \nProtests have remained confined to relatively small pockets of mostly young male demonstrators who are demanding the overthrow of the clerical regime.\nThey have spread to small towns throughout the country and have the potential to grow in size. \nBut there is no obvious leadership. Opposition figures have long been silenced or sent into exile. \nSome protesters have been calling for the return of the monarchy and the former shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the United States, has issued a statement supporting the demonstrations. But there are signs that he is as much in the dark about where these protests are going as anyone else.  \nBBC Persian, which broadcasts on TV, on radio and online from London, is banned in Iran - where staff and their families routinely face harassment and questioning from the authorities."

It's like something that you see on TV but you never think it's possible.\"\nThe fire service was first called at about 16:40 GMT on New Year's Eve. \nCrews remain at the scene to continue investigations into the cause of the fire and are guarding against the risk of the building collapsing.\nAll vehicles in the 1,600-capacity car park were destroyed, Merseyside Police said.\nThose with vehicles in the car park have been told to contact their insurance company quoting reference number 650 of 31 December.\nA spokeswoman for the Echo Arena said the horse show was cancelled and that \"all people and horses are safe and secure\".\nThe four-day event was due to finish with Sunday evening's show, where around 4,000 people were expected."

      "text": "Ten people have been killed overnight in anti-government protests sweeping Iran, according to state TV.\n\"In the events of last night, unfortunately a total of about 10 people were killed in several cities,\" it said. At least 12 people have now died since protests began on Thursday.\nOn Monday, President Hassan Rouhani said the protests and criticism were an opportunity, not a threat.\nHe said the country should work together to fix its economic problems. \nHe said: \"Our nation will deal with this minority who chant slogans against the law and people's wishes, and insult the sanctities and values of the revolution.\"\nMr Rouhani had previously said that citizens were free to protest, but not violently.\nUS President Donald Trump continued his war of words with Iran's leaders on Monday, posting a tweet saying the \"great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food and freedom\".\nSix of those killed died after shots were fired in the western town of Tuyserkan, 300km (185 miles) south-west of Tehran.\nAn official in the south-western town of Izeh said two people had died there. The other two people were reportedly killed in clashes in Dorud in Lorestan province.\nPolice also used tear gas and water cannon overnight to quell a rally in Tehran's Engheleb Square.\nDemonstrations were also reported in Kermanshah and Khorramabad in the west, Shahinshahr in the north-west and in the northern city of Zanjan.\nState TV said armed protesters had tried to take over some police stations and military bases, but faced serious resistance from security forces.\nThe demonstrations, which erupted on Thursday in Iran's second city of Mashhad, are the biggest show of dissent seen since the huge rallies of the Green Movement were brutally suppressed in 2009.\nJudiciary Chief Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli-Larijani called for a crackdown on \"rioters\" and \"vandals\" on Monday, according to state television. \n\"Some individuals are exploiting the situation. This is wrong,\" he said.\nMr Rouhani has acknowledged popular grievances, though he warned that the government would show \"no tolerance for those who damage public properties, violate public order and create unrest in the society\".\nOn Monday he said on Twitter that the government needed to pay attention to people's demands on livelihood issues and corruption.\nIran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) warned anti-government protesters would face the nation's \"iron fist\" if political unrest continued.\nThe IRGC is a powerful force with ties to the country's supreme leader, and is dedicated to preserving the country's Islamic system. Correspondents say it would be a significant escalation were they to become officially involved in policing the protests.\nUp to 400 people are reported to have been arrested in recent days, including 200 in Tehran on Saturday night. \nAnd authorities continue to sporadically suspend social media websites they fear will be used to organise protests, including Telegram and Instagram. \nState media have now begun broadcasting some footage on the protests, though focuses on young men attacking banks and vehicles or burning the Iranian flag, reported AFP news agency.\nOn Sunday police used water cannon to disperse protesters at a major intersection, as captured in a video obtained by BBC Persian. \nAnalysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian\nThere is widespread and seething discontent in Iran where repression is pervasive and economic hardship is getting worse - one BBC Persian investigation has found that on average Iranians have become 15% poorer in the past 10 years. \nProtests have remained confined to relatively small pockets of mostly young male demonstrators who are demanding the overthrow of the clerical regime.\nThey have spread to small towns throughout the country and have the potential to grow in size. \nBut there is no obvious leadership. Opposition figures have long been silenced or sent into exile. \nSome protesters have been calling for the return of the monarchy and the former shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the United States, has issued a statement supporting the demonstrations. But there are signs that he is as much in the dark about where these protests are going as anyone else.  \nBBC Persian, which broadcasts on TV, on radio and online from London, is banned in Iran - where staff and their families routinely face harassment and questioning from the authorities.\nMr Rouhani described the US president as an \"enemy of the Iranian nation from the top of his head to his very toes\".\nHe said the \"man who today in America wants to sympathise with our people has forgotten that a few months ago he called the nation of Iran terrorist\".\nMr Trump has sent various tweets criticising Iran's leaders since the protests began.\nHe said Iranians were \"finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism\".\nHis tweet on Monday said in capital letters \"TIME FOR CHANGE!\"\nMass demonstrations - referred to as the Green Movement - were held by millions of opposition supporters against the disputed election victory of incumbent president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\nAt least 30 people were killed and thousands arrested in the wave of protests, which drew the largest crowds in Iran since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.

I want to be absolutely clear - if you use a knife the full force of the law will be brought down on you. \n\"You will be caught and prosecuted.\""

      "text": "North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has said a nuclear launch button is \"always on my table\" and warned the US it will never be able to start a war.\nIn a televised new year speech, he said the entire US was within range of North Korean nuclear weapons, adding: \"This is reality, not a threat.\"\nBut he also offered a potential olive branch to South Korea, suggesting he was \"open to dialogue\".  \nHe said the North may send a team to the Winter Olympics in South Korea.\nWhen asked by reporters to respond to Mr Kim's latest threats, US President Donald Trump said, \"We'll see, we'll see\".\nHe was speaking at the sidelines of New Year's Eve celebrations at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\nNorth Korea has come under increased criticism and sanctions over the past year because of its nuclear weapons programme and repeated testing of conventional missiles.\nIt claims to have a fully deployable nuclear weapon, though there is still some international scepticism about its true capacity to carry out such an attack.\nIn his speech, Mr Kim re-emphasised his focus on the weapons programme, but implied the country still has a few stages left to go before achieving its ambitions. North Korea must \"mass-produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles and speed up their deployment\", he said. \nHe also said they would not use their weapons unless they felt that peace was threatened. \nWhile his language against the US remained tough, Mr Kim did not employ his typically antagonistic tone when speaking about his neighbours in South Korea.  \n\"The year 2018 is a significant year for both the North and the South, with the North marking the 70th anniversary of its birth and the South hosting the Winter Olympics.\n\"We should melt the frozen North-South relations, thus adorning this meaningful year as a year to be specially recorded in the history of the nation,\" he said.\nA spokesperson for the South Korean president said their office had \"always stated our willingness to talk with North Korea at anytime and anywhere\". \n\"We hope the two Koreas will sit down and find a solution to lower tensions and establish peace on the Korean peninsula.\"\nYoungshik Daniel Bong, a research fellow at Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies, told the BBC that addressing the South was a marked change from the norm for Mr Kim. \n\"North Korea usually ignores South Korea, maintaining the position that as a 'nuclear power' it will deal with the US on its own,\" said Mr Bong. \"It appears that by engaging the South, he hopes to create an estrangement between South Korea and the US.\"\nThe analyst also said that Mr Kim could be seeking to improve ties to offer some respite from the growing economic pressures from the recent UN sanctions. \nMr Kim also said he would also consider sending a delegation to the Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in February - a gesture which South Korea has previously suggested would be welcome.\n\"North Korea's participation in the Winter Games will be a good opportunity to show unity of the people and we wish the Games will be a success,\" he said. \n\"Officials from the two Koreas may urgently meet to discuss the possibility.\"\nThe president of the PyeongChang Games' organising committee, Lee Hee-beom, told South Korea's news agency Yonhap he was delighted to hear of the potential participation. \n\"[The committee] enthusiastically welcomes it. It's like a New Year's gift,\" he said. \nThe only two North Korean athletes who qualified for the Games are figure skaters Ryom Tae-Ok and Kim Ju-Sik. \nAlthough the North has missed the official deadline to confirm their participation, the skaters could still compete with an invitation by the International Olympic Committee.\nSouth Korea's President Moon Jae-in last month suggested delaying an annual joint military drill with US troops until after the Games. The North usually denounces any such exercises as a rehearsal for war. \nRobert Kelly, a political science professor at South Korea's Pusan National University, told the BBC that the Winter Olympics statement was \"a smart move from North Korea\" as it positioned Mr Kim's regime as moving towards its neighbours while the US was seeking to isolate it.

Does anyone care?\" he said.\nHe cited a passage from the Bible's Gospel of John: \"The light shone in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it.\"\nThat light was in the \"resilience of Borough Market\" which was back up and running 10 days after a terror attack in June, in the faces of the hundreds of Grenfell volunteers and in the heroism of the emergency workers, he said. \n\"So often in 2017 the depth of suffering was matched by a depth of compassion as communities came together,\" he added."

I am rejecting the court ruling.\"\nThe 72-year-old then drank from a small brown-glass bottle and announced: \"I have taken poison.\"\nThe confirmation rulings against Praljak and five other defendants brought an end to more than 20 years of work by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).\nPraljak was convicted in 2013 of crimes against humanity, committed while commanding Bosnian Croat forces.\nThough allies against the Bosnian Serbs during the 1992-95 civil war, Bosnian Croats and Muslims also fought each other for a period of 11 months, with the city of Mostar seeing some of the fiercest fighting."

      "tags": "Iran protests,Hassan Rouhani,Iran,Tehran",
      "text": " Iranians are free to protest against the government but must not jeopardise security, President Hassan Rouhani has said after four days of demonstrations.\nSpeaking at a cabinet session, he acknowledged that there were problems that needed to be solved but warned that violence would not be tolerated.\nThe protests have been the biggest show of dissent since huge rallies in 2009.\nThere have been clashes in several cities, and Iran has restricted social networks used to organise protests.\nThe \"temporary\" restrictions on the apps Telegram and Instagram were imposed to \"maintain tranquillity\", state news agency Irib reports.\nThe protests began in the north-east as an outcry against economic hardship and rising prices, but turned political in many places, with slogans chanted against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Mr Rouhani and Iran's interventionist foreign policy in the region. \nIn his latest tweet on the issue, US President Donald Trump said that Iranians were \"finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism\".\nIn his first public comments, Mr Rouhani criticised Mr Trump.\n\"This gentleman in America, who is now trying to sympathise with our nation, appears to have forgotten that he called the Iranian nation terrorists several months ago,\" he was reported to have said.\n\"This man, who is an enemy of the Iranian nation from the top of his head to his very toes, has no right to sympathise with Iranians,\" he added.\nThe Iranian president said that Iranian citizens were \"completely free to express their criticism of the government or stage protests... in a way that would lead to the improvement of the country's conditions\".\nHe acknowledged grievances over the economic situation, a lack of transparency and corruption but defended his record. \nMr Rouhani added that expressing criticism was completely different from being violent or destroying public property.\nViolence flared in many places on Saturday, and videos posted online suggest demonstrations have continued in a dozen or more cities on Sunday.\nSmall crowds have gathered in the capital Tehran chanting \"death to the dictator\" and police have used water cannon to disperse protesters at a major intersection - as captured in a video obtained by BBC Persian. \nIn a tightly controlled media environment, much of the information about the demonstrations has emerged via social media, and platforms like Telegram and Instagram have been used extensively by protesters.\nTelegram in particular is very popular in Iran, with more than 50% of the country's 80m population said to be active on the app.\nThe company's CEO Pavel Durov tweeted that Iranian authorities took action after his company refused to shut down \"peacefully protesting channels\".\nMr Durov explained in a Telegram post that a major foreign-based opposition channel, Amadnews, was blocked on Saturday by Telegram after it called for violence against police.\nHe said a new \"peaceful channel\" - access to which is now being restricted - was set up for hundreds of thousands of their subscribers.\nIranian Communications Minister Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi had earlier accused channels like Amadnews of promoting \"armed uprising and social unrest\".\nAnalysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian\nThere is widespread and seething discontent in Iran where repression is pervasive and economic hardship is getting worse - one BBC Persian investigation has found that on average Iranians have become 15% poorer in the past 10 years. \nProtests have remained confined to relatively small pockets of mostly young male demonstrators who are demanding the overthrow of the clerical regime.\nThey have spread to small towns throughout the country and have the potential to grow in size. \nBut there is no obvious leadership. Opposition figures have long been silenced or sent into exile. \nSome protesters have been calling for the return of the monarchy and the former shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the United States, has issued a statement supporting the demonstrations. But there are signs that he is as much in the dark about where these protests are going as anyone else.  \nBBC Persian, which broadcasts on TV, on radio and online from London, is banned in Iran - where staff and their families routinely face harassment and questioning from the authorities.\nThere were outbreaks of clashes in several cities on Saturday and two protesters died of gunshot wounds in the western city of Dorud. \nThe authorities said security forces did not open fire on demonstrators, and blamed the deaths instead on Sunni Muslim extremists and foreign powers.\nIran's Revolutionary Guards have warned anti-government protesters they will face the nation's \"iron fist\" if political unrest continues. Scores of people are reported to have been arrested in recent days, including 200 in Tehran on Saturday night.\nThe Iranian authorities are blaming anti-revolutionaries and agents of foreign powers.\nMass demonstrations - referred to as the Green Movement - were held by millions of opposition supporters against the disputed election victory of incumbent president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\nAt least 30 people were killed and thousands arrested in the wave of protests, which drew the largest crowds in Iran since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.

      "text": "Germany is set to start enforcing a law that demands social media sites move quickly to remove hate speech, fake news and illegal material.\nSites that do not remove \"obviously illegal\" posts could face fines of up to 50m euro (\u00a344.3m).\nThe law gives the networks 24 hours to act after they have been told about law-breaking material.\nSocial networks and media sites with more than two million members will fall under the law's provisions.\nFacebook, Twitter and YouTube will be the law's main focus but it is also likely to be applied to Reddit, Tumblr and Russian social network VK. Other sites such as Vimeo and Flickr could also be caught up in its provisions.  \nThe Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz (NetzDG) law was passed at the end of June 2017 and came into force in early October. \nThe social networks were given until the end of 2017 to prepare themselves for the arrival of NetzDG.\nThe call to police social media sites more effectively arose after several high-profile cases in which fake news and racist material was being spread via the German arms of prominent social media firms. \nGermany's justice ministry said it would make forms available on its site, which concerned citizens could use to report content that violates NetzDG or has not been taken down in time.\nAs well as forcing social media firms to act quickly, NetzDG requires them to put in place a comprehensive complaints structure so that posts can quickly be reported to staff.\nMost material will have to be removed within 24 hours but networks will have a week to act on \"complex cases\". \nFacebook has reportedly recruited several hundred staff in Germany to deal with reports about content that breaks the NetzDG and to do a better job of monitoring what people post. \nThe law has been controversial in Germany with some saying it could lead to inadvertent censorship or curtail free speech. \nThe German law is the most extreme example of efforts by governments and regulators to rein in social media firms. Many of them have come under much greater scrutiny this year as information about how they are used to spread propaganda and other sensitive material has come to light. \nIn the UK, politicians have been sharply critical of social sites, calling them a \"disgrace\" and saying they were \"shamefully far\" from doing a good job of policing hate speech and other offensive content.\nThe European Commission also published guidelines calling on social media sites to act faster to spot and remove hateful content.

It is a major ivory trading hub, with most customers believed to be mainland Chinese. \nThe territory is in the process of bringing in its own total ban.\nChina had already banned sales of ivory acquired after 1975, under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). \nBut critics have long said allowing other ivory products to be sold openly drives up demand for the status symbol and allows illegal trade to flourish.\nThe international trade in ivory was banned in 1990.

It said there were \"more effective ways\" to invest UK aid.\nBy Emma Vardy, BBC political correspondent\nFor years there have been calls from some MPs for Britain's foreign aid budget to be cut, and the subject provides a steady stream of headlines in the right-leaning press.\nPriti Patel said too much of Britain's aid money was wasted, or spent poorly, when she was international development minister.\nThe government recently suspended a \u00a312m aid programme to Syria after a BBC investigation revealed the cash was at risk of going to jihadist groups.\nAnd before the 2017 General Election there were suggestions that Theresa May was planning to revise the 0.7% spending target, but eventually it remained unchanged. \nMrs May says she is \"proud\" of the UK's record on foreign aid while Labour, the Lib Dems and SNP are also committed to keeping the 0.7% target.\nMr Johnson's promise to spend foreign aid more wisely may improve confidence, but for the harshest critics it will not go anywhere near far enough.\nMany will continue to argue that in a time of economic difficulties for the UK, money spent abroad could be used to help tackle health and social care funding problems at home.\nMr Johnson said the UK would gain more control of its aid spending after Brexit.\nAbout \u00a31bn of the money the UK pays to the EU budget counts as part of the foreign aid budget.\nThe EU spends that money on humanitarian aid and on emergency responses to world crises, as well as on projects in countries close to the EU and those hoping to join in the future.\nMs Mordaunt said that the extra \u00a321m for the United Nations' Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) was needed because 2018 could be \"even bleaker\" than this year, with its \"harrowing\" humanitarian crises.\nThe money will hep to provide millions of people with food, clean water, sanitation and vital health services.\nAs of April 2017:"

      "text": "South Korean authorities have seized a second ship suspected of supplying oil to North Korea in violation of international sanctions, officials say.\nThe Panama-flagged tanker, which is named Koti, is being held at a port near the western city of Pyeongtaek.\nSouth Korea has already impounded a Hong Kong-registered ship it suspects of secretly transferring 600 tonnes of refined oil to a North Korean vessel.\nThe UN imposed sanctions on the North in response to its weapons programme. \nThe latest vessel seized, which has a mostly Chinese and Burmese crew, is a 5,100-tonne oil carrier, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported.\nSouth Korea revealed on Friday that it was holding the Hong Kong-registered Lighthouse Winmore.\nThat ship entered Yeosu port in South Korea on 11 October to load up with refined oil and left for Taiwan four days later.\nBut instead of going to Taiwan it transferred the oil to a North Korean ship and three other vessels in international waters on 19 October, South Korean officials were quoted as saying.\nThe Lighthouse Winmore was seized when it returned to Yeosu in November and remains in South Korea.\nLast week, US President Donald Trump blamed China for allowing illegal oil shipments to reach North Korea.\nIn a tweet, Mr Trump said that China had been \"caught red-handed\".\nHe said there could never be \"a friendly solution\" to the North Korea crisis if oil was allowed to be exported to Pyongyang.\nBeijing, which earlier this month supported the US-drafted UN resolution that includes measures to slash the North's petrol imports by up to 90%, denies the allegation.\nThe resolution bans ship-to-ship transfers of any goods destined for Pyongyang.\nThe tough new sanctions were a fresh attempt to curb North Korea's controversial nuclear and ballistic missile tests."

      "text": "The US says \"the world is watching\" how Iranian authorities respond to anti-government protests that have broken out in several cities.\nThousands of people have joined the protests, with scores arrested.\nA White House statement said Iranians were fed up with \"the regime's corruption and its squandering of the nation's wealth to fund terrorism\". \nMeanwhile, authorities urged supporters to turn out for nationwide demonstrations on Saturday.\nThe rallies are commemorating the 2009 demonstrations held in support of the then conservative government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\nThose demonstrations were in response to protests by reformists over a disputed election which returned him to power.\nThe BBC's Persian Service says thousands of people were likely to have been bussed into a rally in the capital Tehran.\n\"The Iranian government should respect their people's rights, including their right to express themselves. The world is watching,\" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Twitter. \nThe tweet later appeared on President Donald Trump's Twitter account.\nThe US State Department urged all nations \"to publicly support the Iranian people and their demands for basic rights and an end to corruption\".\nFirst Vice-President Eshaq Jahangiri has suggested that government opponents are behind the protests, according to comments reported by state broadcaster IRIB.\nHe said: \"Some incidents in the country these days are on the pretext of economic problems, but it seems there is something else behind them. They think by doing this they harm the government, but it will be others who ride the wave.\"\nEarlier, Fars news agency reported that protesters in Kermanshah had destroyed some public property and were dispersed.\nThe governor-general of Tehran said that any such gatherings would be firmly dealt with by the police, who are out in force on the main roads.\nOfficials in Mashhad said the protest was organised by \"counter-revolutionary elements\", and video online showed police using water cannon.\nThe protests started in the north-eastern city of Mashhad - the country's second most-populous - on Thursday.\nPeople there took to the streets to express anger at the government over high prices, and vented their fury against President Hassan Rouhani. Fifty-two people were arrested for chanting \"harsh slogans\".\nThe protests spread to other cities on Friday, with thousands turning out in Kermanshah, Rasht, Isfahan and Qom. In Tehran, social media footage showed a heavy police presence.\nSome developed into broader demonstrations against the authorities, calling for the release of political prisoners and an end to police beatings.\nIt was the biggest display of public dissent since huge pro-reform rallies in 2009.\nThe protests were initially against economic conditions and corruption but appear to have turned political.\nSlogans have been chanted against not just Mr Rouhani but Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and clerical rule in general.\nDemonstrators were reportedly heard yelling slogans like \"The people are begging, the clerics act like God\". Protests have even been held in Qom, a holy city home to powerful clerics.\nThere is also anger at Iran's interventions abroad. In Mashhad, some chanted \"not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran\", a reference to what protesters say is the administration's focus on foreign rather than domestic issues.\nOther demonstrators chanted \"leave Syria, think about us\" in videos posted online. Iran is a key provider of military support to the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria.\nIt is also accused of providing arms to Houthi rebels fighting a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, which it denies, and is an ally of Lebanon's powerful Shia movement Hezbollah.\nThere have been calls on social media for protests up and down the country, despite warnings from the government against illegal gatherings.\nDemonstrations of varying sizes are reported to have occurred in at least seven cities. \nOverall, the numbers said to be taking part range from a less than 100 in some places to thousands in others - but demonstrations do not appear to be taking place on a massive scale."
