      "text": "Scientists have identified a new contender for \"patient zero\" in the plague that caused the Black Death.\nA man who died more than 5,000 years ago in Latvia was infected with the earliest-known strain of the disease, according to new evidence.\nThe plague swept through Europe in the 1300s, wiping out as much as half of the population.\nLater waves continued to strike regularly over several centuries, causing millions of deaths.\n\"Up to now this is the oldest-identified plague victim we have,\" Dr Ben Krause-Kyora of the University of Kiel in Germany said of the 5,300-year-old remains. \nThe man was buried with three others at a Neolithic burial site in Latvia by the side of the River Salac, which flows into the Baltic Sea.\nThe researchers sequenced DNA from the bones and teeth of all four individuals, and tested them for bacteria and viruses.\nThey were surprised to find one hunter-gatherer - a man in his twenties - was infected with an ancient strain of plague, caused by the bacterium, Yersinia pestis.\n\"He most likely was bitten by a rodent, got the primary infection of Yersinia pestis and died a couple of days [later] - maybe a week later - from the septic shock,\" said Dr Krause-Kyora.\nThe researchers suggest the ancient strain emerged about 7,000 years ago, when agriculture was starting to appear in central Europe.\nThey think the bacterium may have leaped sporadically from animals to humans without causing large outbreaks.\nOver time, it became adapted to infecting humans, eventually evolving into the form known as bubonic plague, that is spread by fleas and raged through medieval Europe, causing millions of deaths.\nThe idea that early strains of plague were slow to spread challenges many theories about the development of human civilisation in Europe and Asia. \nAnd it casts doubt on the hypothesis that the disease caused large population declines in Western Europe at the end of the Neolithic Age.\nOther researchers have welcomed the study, but say it does not rule out the possibility that plague was spreading widely in Europe at this time.\nHumans usually get plague after being bitten by a rodent flea that is carrying the plague bacterium or by handling an animal infected with plague.\nThe disease is still around today, but is treatable with antibiotics if caught early.\nThe research is published in the journal Cell Reports.\nFollow Helen on Twitter."

Mr Berardo has not commented. \nHe is expected in court in the next two days.\nThe tycoon founded the Museu Cole\u00e7\u00e3o Berardo, showcasing major works by Mir\u00f3 and Mondrian, in 2006.\nAuthorities began a criminal investigation two years ago after three Portuguese banks filed a lawsuit against him aimed at recovering nearly \u20ac1bn (\u00a3860m; $1,2bn) in debt.\nMr Berardo had told a parliamentary committee in May 2019 that he had no debts in his name and that the loans he had requested were for companies he was linked to.\nThe museum's art collections were subsequently seized as collateral.\nOn Tuesday, police conducted more than 50 searches for evidence at private homes and banks across the country.\nIn a statement, prosecutors said the business group under investigation had been lent more than \u20ac439m from state bank Caixa Geral de Depositos (CGD) but allegedly breached contracts with it. Two other banks lost similar amounts. \nThe statement also criticised CGD, saying its procedures for granting the loan and the subsequent recovery process did not meet \"good practices and may constitute the practice of crime\".\nCGD has not commented on the prosecutors' statement either.

      "text": "UK house prices rose 13.4% in the year to June, the fastest pace since November 2004, the Nationwide has said.\nThe building society said the average house price increased to \u00a3245,432 from \u00a3216,403 in June 2020.\nNationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said prices were \"close to a record high\" in relation to average incomes, which he added \"makes it even harder\" for first-time buyers.\nHe told the BBC the pandemic had \"stimulated\" the housing market.\nMr Gardner said lots of people had \"reassessed what they want from home\" in terms of space and where they live as a result of the coronavirus lockdowns.\n\"The pandemic is an unusual kind of shock - it has stimulated housing market activity rather than the shock holding back the market which is normally what happens,\" he added.\nThe Nationwide bases the findings on its own mortgage data. It said while the rapid annual growth was partly due to prices being \"unusually weak\" during the first lockdown last year, the market continued to \"show significant momentum\".\nAll parts of the UK saw a rise in house prices in the second quarter of 2021, with Northern Ireland and Wales experiencing the largest year-on-year increases of 14% and 13.1% respectively.\nThe slowest rate of price growth was seen in Scotland, where property values increased by 7.1%, while London was England's weakest performing region, with prices rising 7.3%\nMr Gardner said despite the increase in house prices to \"new all-time highs\", the typical mortgage payment was \"not high by historic standards compared to take home pay, largely because mortgage rates remain close to all-time lows\".\nHouse prices are rising fast; prompted by stamp duty holidays, sustained by estate agent marketing, and - significantly - inspired by a Covid-related change of priorities among buyers.\nOf course, this is a general picture. The UK housing market is a series of mini-markets. Just ask someone trying to sell a flat at the moment and they may feel they are in a parallel universe. \nWhat really is in doubt is whether this boom will be followed by a bust.\nIf the economy fails to recover and jobs are lost, some people may be forced to sell and fewer will want to buy. If that is sustained and prices fall, negative equity looms for new buyers who are borrowing heavily now to buy somewhere bigger in which to live and work.\nThe market in recent months has continued to be stimulated by stamp duty holidays in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nFrom Thursday, those tax breaks start to be withdrawn, and will return completely to the pre-pandemic levels by October.\nNicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agents Fine and Country, said: \"Annual house price growth of this magnitude is something no one thought they'd see, particularly with the stamp duty holiday now tapering out.\n\"The final closure of the stamp duty scheme at the end of September may have no impact at all because other factors are so much more important, namely the race for space, low supply, accidental savings and low interest rates.\"\nHowever, some analysts point to the link between housing demand and jobs as key to the future of property prices.\nDanni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said unemployment would be closely watched. \n\"How many people will still be in a job once the furlough scheme ends? How many mortgage holidays will result in quick sales? There is no getting away from the fact that the next few months will be difficult for many people once support is withdrawn,\" she said."

      "tags": "Telford,Birmingham,West Mercia Police",
      "text": "A police officer who unlawfully killed Dalian Atkinson by tasering him to the ground and kicking him in the head has been jailed for eight years.\nPC Benjamin Monk, 43, discharged his Taser three times and kicked him twice in the head, leaving bootlace prints on his forehead, his trial heard.\nThe former Aston Villa striker died after the 2016 stand-off outside his father's home in Telford, Shropshire.\nJurors cleared Monk of an alternative charge of murder on 23 June.\nHe will serve two-thirds of his sentence before being entitled to release on licence.\nSpeaking after the conviction, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it was the first time in over 30 years that a British police officer had been convicted of manslaughter in the course of their duties. \nAlthough there have been 10 murder or manslaughter charges brought against police officers since 1990, those accused have all either been acquitted or the case has collapsed.\nMonk is also believed to be the first officer to face a murder charge after a person had been tasered by police.\nPassing sentence, Judge Melbourne Inman QC told Monk it \"should have been obvious to you\" the force used was excessive.\nHe said kicking and tasering Mr Atkinson while he lay on the street was \"beyond reasonable\" and told him: \"You have let yourself and the force down\".\n\"Although they were difficult, you failed to act appropriately in the circumstances as they developed,\" Judge Inman said. \n\"The obvious aggravating factor is that you committed this offence while on duty as a police officer.\"\nMr Atkinson's family reacted to the sentence by saying Monk had abused his position of trust in the \"callous attack\".\nIn the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, they called for change in the way Black people, particularly men, are treated by police and the criminal justice system.\n\"As his fellow footballers take the knee, we hope that they will honour the memory of Dalian,\" they said.\nIOPC regional director Derrick Campbell said the police would need to \"work hard to restore and maintain\" the confidence of Black communities following the sentence.\nDuring the six-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court, jurors heard Monk and his co-accused colleague, PC Mary-Ellen Bettley-Smith had been called to Meadow Close at about 01:30 BST on 15 August.\nMr Atkinson was in the midst of a mental breakdown and had been shouting outside his father's house claiming to be the Messiah.\nJudge Inman said he had \"suddenly lost touch with reality\" and was \"unrecognisable to those who knew him at the scene\".\nWhen the officers, who were in a relationship at the time, arrived, they claimed to be \"terrified\" of the 48-year-old sportsman, who had smashed a pane of glass in his father's door.\nMonk deployed his Taser three times. Twice he was unsuccessful but on the third occasion, jurors found he acted unlawfully, using excessive force by overriding the trigger to Taser Mr Atkinson for 33 seconds.\nWhile Mr Atkinson lay on the ground, the officer kicked him twice to the head with enough force to leave imprints of his bootlaces, while PC Bettley-Smith struck him with her baton.\nMr Atkinson, who had a number of underlying health conditions including renal failure, died in hospital just over an hour after the confrontation.\nIn interviews, Monk would downplay the force he used while exaggerating the risk posed by the footballer, who had also played for Ipswich Town and Sheffield Wednesday. \nHowever, \"the jury rejected any claim that Mr Atkinson's death resulted from reasonable self-defence in the line of duty,\" the head of the Crown Prosecution Service's special crime division, Rosemary Ainslie, said.\n\"Policing is a difficult job and officers deserve our respect, but they are not exempt from the laws they uphold.\"\nThe West Mercia officer was also found to have a history of dishonesty. In court on Monday it was revealed he had been found guilty of gross misconduct in a police hearing in 2011 for failing to disclose two prior cautions for theft and drunkenness when he applied to join the force.\nThe force said another misconduct process would be fast-tracked for Monk, who has been suspended since he was charged in November 2019.\nAssistant Chief Constable, Rachel Jones, said she \"does not underestimate the significant damage this case has done to our relationships with communities\" and is committed to \"repairing trust\".\nHowever Deborah Coles, from charity Inquest, which supports bereaved families after state-related deaths, said structural change was needed.\n\"Dalian's death is not an isolated case, nor is this officer a 'bad apple',\" she said.\n\"True justice requires structural change across our society to address racism and state violence, and better respond to mental ill health.\" \nThe jury was unable to reach a verdict about 31-year-old PC Bettley-Smith, who was charged with assaulting Mr Atkinson with a baton while he lay incapacitated.\nProsecutors are yet to announce whether they will seek a retrial.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "Parents prevented from seeing their dying son in his final weeks have said they were treated \"like criminals\".\nOllie Bibby, 27, from South Benfleet, Essex, died of leukaemia in hospital on 5 May, a day before Matt Hancock was filmed kissing a colleague, prompting his resignation as health secretary.\nPenny Bibby said she was \"livid\" Mr Hancock broke social distancing rules.\nUniversity College London Hospital (UCLH) said it would \"learn from her family's experience\".\nMr Bibby, who lived at home with his mother Penny and father Simon, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia, a cancer of the white blood cells, in 2016.\nAfter four years in remission, he relapsed and needed a bone marrow transplant last summer.\nIn March he was admitted to UCLH, where he stayed for seven weeks until he died.\nHe felt like he was \"in prison\" and \"begged\" to see his family, but they were \"barely allowed in\" due to Covid restrictions, his mother said.\nMr Hancock resigned on Saturday after CCTV footage emerged of him kissing and embracing aide Gina Coladangelo, in breach of social distancing rules.\n\"I'm disgusted - for that man to be carrying on like that, and us following the rules,\" said Simon Bibby.\n\"We feel cheated out of the last six weeks of his life.\"\nMrs Bibby said: \"I'm livid. We did everything we were told to do and the man that made the rules didn't. How can that be right?\"\nDescribing her son's time in hospital, she said: \"Ollie was in a room on his own and it was horrific for him. He suffered from anxiety and depression and he would just spend all this time on his own, worrying about his future.\n\"It was clear that the hospital did not want us there. We felt like we were criminals. The security staff would be better off at a nightclub, they were so aggressive.\n\"We just wanted to comfort our son. He felt like he was being punished for being ill. He was not even allowed to see a counsellor. The way he was treated was barbaric and inhumane.\"\nNo visitors were allowed at all when Mr Bibby was first admitted, but the rules later changed to allow one visit a week from one nominated person, she said. \nThe family spoke to their MP, Conservative Rebecca Harris, who persuaded hospital bosses to increase this to two visits a week for one person.\n\"I understand hospitals need to keep people safe from coronavirus, but we were shielding and taking lateral flow tests and doing everything possible to protect Ollie,\" Mrs Bibby said.\nThey drove an hour and a half from their home to the hospital after he phoned crying, saying he was bleeding and pressing his buzzer but was being ignored.\n\"This was the start of his internal bleeding; he was petrified. My husband was thrown out by a bouncer-type security guard. We were told they could only bend the rules in exceptional circumstances, but we couldn't work out how more exceptional it could be,\" she said.\nAs his health deteriorated, Mr Bibby refused to go to intensive care unless he could see his parents.\n\"They couldn't control him, he was in such a state that they eventually agreed, and that was the only reason we were able to be there when he died,\" said Mrs Bibby.\n\"Nurses were constantly asking us why we were in there and if we were allowed. It made a horrendous situation 50 times worse.\"\nShe said her other three sons were \"really suffering\" after being denied the chance to say a \"proper goodbye\".\n\"Ollie was really close to his three brothers but they were only allowed to see him once in seven weeks, for just 10 minutes, the day before he was put on a ventilator, when he was semi-conscious.\" \nThe family would be making a formal complaint to the hospital, Mrs Bibby added, in the hope that some rules could be changed for future patients.\n\"We do not blame the staff, they were just following the rules, but people higher up need to understand how traumatic this has been and work out a plan for each individual patient,\" she said.\n\"We were lucky that we were with Ollie when he died, but so many families haven't been able to say goodbye to their loved ones. How many more patients need to die alone, for them to listen?\"\nA spokesperson for UCLH said it would like to offer the family \"our sincere condolences\".\n\"We are confident that Ollie received appropriate care and treatment and that regular visits were allowed in line with hospital guidance,\" they said.\n\"We understand that having limits on visitors can be difficult, but these are necessary to protect patients from Covid-19, particularly the most vulnerable. We are in touch with Penny so we can learn from her family's experience.\"\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

There's no catch-up without children in class,\" said Sir Iain.\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"Where students have to self-isolate, schools are continuing to provide high-quality remote education, and through our ambitious and long-term education recovery plan, we have committed over \u00a33bn to date to help children and young people make up for lost education during the pandemic.\""

      "title": "Covid: Weekly deaths drop to two in Wales",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There were two deaths involving Covid-19 in the latest week in Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics. \nThat is one fewer than last week and the lowest total we have seen since early September. \nThese deaths accounted for 0.4% of the total in the week ending 4 June. \nThe deaths occurred in hospitals involving patients from Powys and Wrexham.  \nThe trend has been for a steady decline and the weekly total is 89% fewer Covid deaths than registered two months ago. \nSo-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, have been below average for 13 of the past 14 weeks and the number was 82 deaths below the five-year average in the latest week.\nLooking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in a typical year is seen as a reliable measure of the pandemic. \nThe number of deaths from all causes in Wales fell to 464 in the week ending 4 June. \nScotland and Northern Ireland both had an above average number of deaths, but all English regions saw below average deaths for the week.\nWhen looking across the course of the pandemic, there have been 46,505 deaths from all causes in Wales - 4,895 above the five-year average - with 7,893 (17%) mentioning Covid-19 on the death certificate. \nWhen deaths occurring up to 4 June, but later registrations are included, the total number of deaths involving Covid rises to 7,894.\nThere were no care home deaths in Wales where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate for a third week in succession in the latest ONS total and there has been one in the past month.\nThe ONS figures are seen as a more reliable measure than the \"snapshot\" daily numbers reported by Public Health Wales.\nThey include all deaths registered - including in hospices and people's own homes - and when Covid is suspected and not just confirmed by a doctor as being a factor in a person's death.\nAcross England and Wales, Covid was the underlying cause of death in 58.2% of cases when it was mentioned on the death certificate, so the actual number of deaths due to Covid fell.\nDeaths involving Covid fell in four English regions but rose in five others, including 14 more deaths in north-west England."

      "title": "UK needs millions more charging points, says car industry",
      "tags": "Companies,Batteries,Nissan,Electric cars,Car industry",
      "text": "The UK needs to set a binding target for building battery factories and install millions more charging points for electric cars, the industry says.\nThe Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) says ambitious policies over the next decade could create up to 40,000 high-skilled jobs.\nBut it warns failure to take action could be disastrous for the car sector.\nSMMT fears the potential loss of around 90,000 posts and worsening regional inequalities across the country.\nThe SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes, said that without the right backing, UK businesses would become \"consumers not producers, spectators not innovators\u2026 lead and we succeed, follow and we fail\".\n\"If ambitious words were currency, the UK would indeed be rich,\" he said. \"Give us the tools, and we will finish the job.\"\nLater this week, Japanese manufacturer Nissan is expected to announce plans for a new so-called Gigafactory to build batteries at its manufacturing base in Sunderland.\nMr Hawes said that under current plans the UK will have 12 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery production by 2025, whereas Germany will have 164GWh.\nThe expected announcement from Nissan, he said, would be \"a real vote of confidence\u2026 but we need a lot more than that\".\nA spokeswoman for the government said: \"We are committed to ensuring the UK continues to be one of the best locations in the world for automotive manufacturing and are dedicated to securing gigafactories to support the auto sector's transition to electric vehicles. \n\"We continue to work closely with investors and vehicle manufacturers to progress plans to mass produce batteries in the UK.\"\nShe added that the UK already has more than 23,800 public charging points including 4,450 rapid devices - one of the largest networks of rapids in Europe. \n\"We are working closely with local authorities to rollout the electric vehicle revolution, with \u00a31.3bn investment for electric vehicle infrastructure which will support drivers across the country,\" she said. \nA report, written for the SMMT by consultants Public First, sets out a range of proposals that it claims would secure the future competitiveness of the automotive industry - a sector which it claims contributes \u00a315bn to the UK economy, and employs around 180,000 people.\nThe shift to electrified vehicles, it says, is the biggest challenge facing the sector. The sale of new cars powered only by petrol and diesel is due to be outlawed by 2030 in the UK, while hybrids will be banned five years later. Other European governments have also set targets for phasing out conventional vehicles.\nTo meet demand for new electric cars, the report says, the government should commit to creating so-called gigafactories - giant battery-building plants - with a capacity of 60GWh by 2030. \nAt the moment, the only British factory making the kind of batteries needed for electric cars on a large scale is Envision AESC's plant in Sunderland. It has an output of around 2GWh, and is used to provide power packs for the Nissan Leaf, which is also produced in the region. \nThe Japanese carmaker is widely expected to announce later this week that it will expand this partnership, and invest heavily in a new gigafactory, which will initially have a capacity of at least 6.5GWh. \nStellantis, the global car company which owns Vauxhall, is expected to announce within the next few weeks whether its plant at Ellesmere Port will have a long term future. It has been considering whether to build electric cars at the factory in Cheshire.\nAlison Jones, the UK managing director of Stellantis suggested a decision by the company about where it will build a new gigafactory in Europe was central to its discussions with the government about the plant's future, which she said were \"ongoing\".\n\"That's why it's so important for the government to make their statements and their actual investments in UK manufacturing manufacturing\", she said.\nThe influential green group Transport and Environment recently warned that even this would amount to \"a tiny fraction of the 474GWh of production at 17 sites across Europe, for which funding has already been secured\". \nThe group suggested that the UK risked being left behind as other countries invested more rapidly in electric car production. It also expressed doubts that a number of other projects, including start-up Britishvolt's ambitious plan for a 35GWh factory in Northumberland, would happen without more pressure from the industry itself.\nThe SMMT's report, meanwhile, makes a number of other recommendations. It says there is a need for at least 2.3 million new charging points to be set up around the country by 2030. \nThis would, it suggests \"ensure that all drivers - especially those without driveways - have the confidence to invest in the latest low emission technologies, investment that will not just support a healthy domestic market, but which will underpin mass market automotive manufacturing in the UK\". \nIt also calls for the introduction of a \"build back better fund\" from the government to support manufacturing jobs and reduce costs, a commitment to developing and deploying connected and automated vehicle technology and a review of taxes affecting the sector. \nThe stakes, the SMMT says, are high. The correct strategy, it claims would see the sector transitioning to a zero emissions future, with ambitious global trading terms. \nThis, it suggests, could create 40,000 well paid and highly skilled jobs by 2030 - and would have a significant impact in the car industry's traditional heartlands, such as the West Midlands and the North East.\nBut without such a framework, it claims, the UK's automotive industry risks falling into a decline, resulting in the loss of some 90,000 jobs. \nThe majority of them would be lost outside London and the South East, thereby increasing regional inequality.

      "text": "Young carer services need \"sustainable funding\" and prioritisation for the safe re-opening of face-to-face support, according to a charity.\nCarers Trust Wales said it needs to be able to plan what support it could offer after lockdown, to help deal with the \"increasing isolation\".\nFor young carers such as nine-year-old Kieran, those services have helped build confidence and make friends.\nThe Welsh Government said more funding has gone towards supporting carers.\nIt added: \"We encourage young carers to contact their local authority to get the help and support they are entitled to.\"\nWales Live asked all local councils in Wales what they were doing to support young carers during the pandemic.\nOf the 17 that responded, 14 said they were now offering support services either online or over the phone, with four saying the need for additional support had increased over the past months. \nThere were 7,544 young carers under the age of 16 in Wales, according to the last census in 2011, although Carers Trust Wales said this figure is now likely to be far higher following the start of the pandemic. \nThe charity said resuming face-to-face support must be prioritised because the wellbeing and mental health of young carers have deteriorated, with the respite of schools now taken away.\nIt said: \"We really need to find ways of creating the space for them to get a break, to get the time that they need to be themselves and to actually be children at this really difficult time and to think about how those services are planned.\"\nChloe, 13, is one of those children balancing home-schooling with being a young carer, even helping with daily dialysis sessions for her mother Becky, who has kidney failure as well as other health conditions.\nChloe asked to be trained to help use the dialysis machine so she can support her mother during the four-hour-long sessions, although admits it's sometimes a rush between schoolwork and helping out at home.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has been even more 'tiring' because of the extra worry of her mother becoming unwell with the virus.\nChloe and her family have been shielding since March last year.  \n\"At first it was quite scary because, as the lockdown was easing a bit, you could see friends going out and hanging out with each other, but that wasn't an option for me,\" said Chloe.\n\"And in this lockdown it's the same. It's a bit sad because I wanted to be one of them people that hangs out with their friends.\" \nWhile enjoying extra time with her parents, Chloe misses the young carers groups she attended each week before the pandemic. Now all her interaction with other young carers happens entirely online. \n\"It was hanging out with people who know what you're going through,\" she said.\n\"So you have a place where you can relax and not have to worry about people asking a bunch of questions. It was where you could just be normal and not have to worry.\"\nAlso relying on online support is nine-year-old Kieran, who is a young carer for his 11-year-old sister Tegan. \nTegan has Joubert's syndrome, a rare condition which means she can struggle with communication and mobility. \nWhile she is becoming more independent as she gets older, Kieran is sometimes more of an older brother than a younger brother and helps with things like getting dressed and ready for the day. \nHe said the past 10 months have made him feel lonely. \n\"I am missing going to school because I stress a lot at home and I miss seeing my friends.\" \nAs well as going to school, Kieran said meeting other young carers through organised trips and activities helped him build his confidence and make new friends. That was until lockdown.\nSimon Hatch, director of Carers Trust Wales said lockdown and extra responsibilities were \"adding real pressure\" to young carers.\n\"They are giving us information about feeling frustrated, more isolated and lonely, particularly [at] not being able to engage with the services,\" he said.\n\"For many young carers, schools and being able to be at school with their friends is one of the only forms of respite they get, so you can imagine how much more difficult things are now.\"\nThe Welsh Government thanked young carers for the \"remarkable support\" they are providing during the pandemic.\n\"We are working with Carers Trust Wales to understand further the pressures young carers are facing and ensure they get support they need,\" added a spokesperson.\n\"We have also provided additional funding for mental health services and to support carers during this incredibly difficult time.\"\nYou can see more on this story on Wales Live on BBC One Wales on Tuesday 19 January at 22:35."

      "tags": "Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The quality of face masks healthcare workers wear makes a huge difference to their risk of coronavirus infection, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust research has found.\nWearing a high grade mask known as an FFP3 can provide up to 100% protection. \nBy contrast, there is a far greater chance of staff wearing standard issue surgical masks catching the virus. \nProfessional bodies have long campaigned for staff to be given better personal protective equipment.\nThe data was gathered during a programme of regular testing for Covid at the trust. \nThe results are published in a pre-print paper that has not been peer-reviewed. \nFor most of last year, the hospital followed national guidance which specifies that healthcare workers should wear surgical masks, except in a few limited situations.\nThough fluid resistant, these masks are relatively flimsy and loose-fitting and are not meant to screen out infectious aerosols - tiny virus particles that can linger in the air and are now widely accepted as a source of coronavirus infection. \nThe study found that staff caring for Covid patients on \"red\" wards faced a risk that was up to 47 times higher than those on \"green\" or non-Covid wards. \nLead researcher Dr Mark Ferris, a specialist in occupational health at the hospital, said staff were getting Covid despite doing everything they were asked to in terms of infection control.\nSo as the second wave of the pandemic started to hit last December, managers in Cambridge made a local decision to upgrade the protection on red wards. \n\"The only thing left to try that could make a difference was FFP3 respirators, and they did,\" Dr Ferris said. \nFFP3 masks have a close fit and are specifically designed to filter out aerosols.\nIn the weeks following this move, the rate of infections among healthcare workers on red wards dropped spectacularly, quickly falling to the level experienced by staff on green wards where there were no Covid patients.\nThe study concludes that \"cases attributed to ward-based exposure fell significantly, with FFP3 respirators providing 31-100% protection (and most likely 100%) against infection from patients with Covid-19\".\nAny remaining cases were likely to be caused by spread in the community, rather than in the hospital. \nThe paper says fluid-resistant surgical masks were \"insufficient\" to protect healthcare workers. \nDr Mike Weekes, of Cambridge University NHS Hospitals Foundation Trust, who also worked on the study, said the work gives \"some real world evidence that FFP3 masks are actually effective and more effective than the surgical masks\". \nHe added: \"Clearly, it's a relatively small study in one trust and so we need to see these findings replicated elsewhere. \n\"But given the difference in the results that we've seen, as a sort of precautionary principle effect, what we should be thinking about is changing to use FFP3 masks for anyone caring for a patient with coronavirus.\"\nThe Cambridge trust is among 17 across the UK known to have decided to upgrade PPE regardless of national policy.\nThe call for FFP3 masks to be issued more widely is in line with a long-standing demand by the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and many other professional bodies. \nThey have repeatedly appealed for higher standards of protection to face the threat of airborne spread of the disease, most recently in a high-level meeting with health officials earlier this month.\nIn an open letter to the new Health Secretary Sajid Javid, the Fresh Air NHS group of consultants and doctors says the new study provides yet more evidence of why the policy needs to change.\n\"This has important implications for healthcare worker protection as the UK copes with what is hopefully an 'exit wave', as well as trying to reduce the massive backlog of other work whilst coping with inevitable staff sickness and isolation,\" the group wrote.\nIt says supply chains have now been largely restored after the shortages of the early days of the pandemic, and that although FFP3 masks are less comfortable than surgical ones, surveys show staff generally prefer a higher level of protection.\nRose Gallagher, the RCN's lead for infection prevention and control, also welcomed the research, telling the BBC: \"This important study adds even further weight to the RCN's continuing call for nursing staff to be better protected from Covid-19 and given routine access to the highest levels of respiratory protective equipment whenever they need it.\n\"We are still seeing cases of Covid-19, even from some who have been vaccinated, and it is vital staff are fully protected and there are no attempts to restrict or ease off on measures to further reduce the risk of infection.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said guidance on PPE standards was regularly updated to reflect the latest science.\n\"The safety of the NHS and social care staff has always been our top priority and we continue to work round the clock to deliver PPE to protect those on the frontline.\n\"Emerging evidence and data are continually monitored and reviewed and guidance will be amended accordingly if appropriate.\""

      "text": "Rescue workers are pinning their hopes on finding a \"miracle\" survivor in voids underneath the rubble of a Florida apartment building which collapsed five days ago.\nMiami-Dade Fire Rescue Chief Andy Alvarez said a \"frantic effort\" was underway to reach any air pockets where people could have survived.\nNo one has been pulled alive from the site since Thursday, when the building in Surfside, north of Miami, collapsed.\nAt least 11 people have died.\nMore than 150 people are still missing, and officials say they are refusing to give up hope.\n\"We're going to continue and work ceaselessly to exhaust every possible option in our search,\" Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told media. \"The search-and-rescue operation continues.\"\nRescuers are searching through the rubble in sweltering heat and high humidity. Initial efforts were slowed by several fires in the debris. \nUS emergency crews have now been joined by teams from Israel and Mexico to help in the painstaking, round-the-clock operation. Machinery has moved large slabs, and a trench measuring 125ft (38m) long and 40ft deep has been built to help them reveal any potential air pockets in the wreckage of the 12-storey building. \nSurfside Mayor Charles Burkett previously described how the building had \"pancaked\", with spaces that were 10ft or more reduced to \"just feet\".\nMr Alvarez told ABC News that a number of voids had already been found. He said the huge cranes which had been brought to the site were now helping them \"to laminate this building, almost like an onion, so that we can get inside and, again, find those voids that we know might possibly be there and rescue those people\". \nSniffer dogs and listening devices are also being used to search for signs of life. But as yet, they have not revealed any survivors.\n\"We hear falling debris, twisting metal,\" Maggie Castro, a paramedic with the Miami-Dade county fire department, told AFP news agency. \"We have not heard human sounds.\"\nEight of the 11 victims have been named by officials so far: Gladys Lozano, 79, and her husband Antonio, 83; Stacie Fang, 54; Manuel LaFont, also 54; Leon Oliwkowicz, 80;  Christina Beatriz Elvira, 74; Luis Andres Bermudez, 26, and his mother Anna Ortiz, 46.\nMs Fang's son, 15, was pulled alive from the rubble.\nMiami Dade Police director Alfredo Ramirez III said on Monday that investigators would use rapid DNA tests when possible to identify deceased victims found amid the ruins. \nThe Champlain Towers South building contained 136 apartments and 55 of them collapsed early on Thursday, leaving piles of debris.\nResident Barry Cohen, who was in bed in a section of the building that survived when the collapse happened, said it sounded \"like thunder\".\n\"When we opened the door, there was no building there, it was just a pile of rubble,\" he said.\nFederal investigators are already on site and working to find the cause of the collapse and ensure evidence is preserved.\nAt a press conference on Monday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the investigation, conducted by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), would be thorough and \"will not happen in a day or two\". \n\"This will take a long time. That is the time horizon they work on,\" he said. \nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that there are dozens of federal officials at the scene - including building science experts, structural engineers, geotechnical experts, the FBI and Army Corp of Engineers.\nShe added that President Joe Biden \"does believe that there should be an investigation\", but did not specify which agency should lead a federal probe.\nUnder Florida law, buildings must be inspected every 40 years, and as the Champlain Towers complex has stood since 1980, inspectors were about to start its recertification process.\nBut a number of reports on the building had been done ahead of this inspection.\nAn engineer's report from 2018, which was made public on Saturday, highlighted \"a major error\" in the original design of the 12-storey seafront building. It said the fault prevented water draining away from the base of the building.\nThe report flagged \"major structural damage\" to the concrete platform beneath the swimming pool deck. It also referred to \"abundant cracking\u2026 of columns, beams and walls\" in the garage.\nThe report did not suggest the 40-year-old building was at any imminent risk of collapse but its author, engineer Frank Morabito, urged that the concrete repairs be carried out in \"a timely fashion\".\nMeanwhile, a study published last year by researchers at Florida International University found that the building had been sinking at a rate of two millimetres per year in the 1990s, which may have affected it structurally.\nThe author of the study, Prof Shimon Wdowinski, told the Miami Herald newspaper: \"We've seen much higher than that, but it stood out because most of the area was stable and showed no subsidence.\"\nProf Wdowinski reiterated the research was not meant to suggest certainty about the latest incident."

      "text": "Police are investigating video footage which appears to show England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, being accosted by two men in a park. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"shocked at seeing the despicable harassment\" of Prof Whitty.\nThe video shows two men laughing and jeering as they grab hold of Prof Whitty, who struggles to free himself.\nThe Met Police said it happened in St James's Park in London on Sunday and all those involved had been spoken to.\nThe force said when officers spoke to Prof Whitty, he had not suffered any injuries and told them at the time that he did not wish to make any allegations. \nIt added that the incident has been recorded as a common assault and continues to be investigated.\nThe PM tweeted: \"I condemn the behaviour of these thugs. Our hard-working public servants should not have to face this kind of intimidation on our streets and we will not tolerate it.\"\nOther MPs to criticise the incident included new Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who said it was \"appalling and totally unacceptable\".\nHe added: \"The CMO (chief medical officer) works tirelessly on behalf of the country... the men behaving in this disgraceful way should be ashamed.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer described it as \"disgusting behaviour\", adding that the police were right to investigate \"this harassment\".\nJess Phillips, a Labour MP, tweeted: \"Even if you perceive it as non-violent, it is clear that he felt awful and uncomfortable and resisted.\n\"Public figures are not dolls, they are human beings, it is stunning how easily this is forgotten.\"\nIt is not the first time Prof Whitty has been filmed being confronted by a member of the public.\nEarlier this month, a man in Oxford accused him of lying to the public about coronavirus, while in February a man accosted the chief medical officer outside Westminster.\nAnd a group of people gathered outside what was apparently Prof Whitty's London flat on Saturday, chanting and shouting.\nIs the answer to Prof Whitty's ordeal police protection? \nCertainly, if a senior cabinet minister was walking through St James's Park, they would have security watching their back. \nThe word \"harassment\" doesn't convey how shocking the confrontation looks and how vulnerable Prof Whitty must have felt. \nNor is it the first time he has been confronted by phone-wielding blokes. \nHis colleague, deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, was also accosted by an anti-vaccine activist in Whitehall last week.\nThey are not politicians - they are officials leading efforts to fight a pandemic who have become public figures. \nSo yes, perhaps protection is part of the answer. Westminster is sprinkled with police officers and they guard the gates of Parliament and No 10, but it rarely feels heavily policed unless there is a demonstration under way. \nAsked whether Prof Whitty and his colleagues would be offered police protection, the prime minister's official spokesman said: \"We keep security under constant review but I'm not going to be commenting on specific arrangements for individuals.\" \nIn its latest statement on Tuesday evening, the Met said: \"We are aware of a video being shared online showing an incident that took place in St James's Park at around 19:20 on the evening of Sunday, 27 June.\n\"Officers were in the vicinity policing a nearby demonstration and intervened when they saw what was happening.\n\"They spoke to the victim and checked his welfare. He had not suffered any injuries and informed officers that at that time he did not wish to make any allegations. He then went on his way.\n\"Officers continued to speak to the two men and recorded their details. They were robustly warned about their behaviour and ordered to leave the area.\"\nSince the start of the coronavirus crisis, he has been front and centre of the UK's decision-making and communication of messages to the public.\nHe took on the chief medical officer role in October 2019, and until the coronavirus threat emerged, had never done broadcast interviews or held press briefings or conferences.\nOne of the country's foremost experts in infectious diseases, he has worked as a doctor in Africa and Asia, as well as the UK.\nHe continues to practise medicine at University College London Hospitals, where he was spotted doing a shift over Christmas.\nHis father was a diplomat, who was murdered by terrorists in Greece after they flagged him down in his car in 1984."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "A mix-and-match approach to Covid vaccines - using different brands for first and second doses - appears to give good protection against the pandemic virus, a UK study has found.\nThe Com-Cov trial looked at the efficacy of either two doses of Pfizer, two of AstraZeneca, or one of them followed by the other. \nAll combinations worked well, priming the immune system.\nThis knowledge could offer flexibility for vaccine rollout, say experts. \nThe trial results also hint that people who have already received two doses of AstraZeneca vaccine could have a stronger immune response if they were given a different jab as a booster if recommended in the autumn. \nThe UK's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said there was no reason to change the current successful same dose vaccine schedules in the UK, however, given vaccines were in good supply and saving lives.\nBut he says it might be something to look at in the future: \"Mixing doses could provide us with even greater flexibility for a booster programme, while also supporting countries who have further to go with their vaccine rollouts, and who may be experiencing supply difficulties.\"\nSome countries are already using mixed doses. Spain and Germany are offering the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines as a second dose to younger people who have already received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following concerns about rare but serious blood clots, rather than about efficacy.\nTwo doses are important to give the fullest protection and teach the body to make antibodies and T cells to block and kill Covid. \nThe Com-Cov study, which looked at giving the doses four weeks apart in 850 volunteers aged 50 and above, found:\nLead investigator Prof Matthew Snape, from the University of Oxford, said the findings did not undermine the UK policy of giving people the same jab twice: \"We already know that both standard schedules are very effective against severe disease and hospitalisations, including against the Delta variant when given at eight to 12 weeks apart.\"\nHe said the new results showed mixed dose schedules were also effective, even though the interval of four weeks studied was shorter than the eight to 12-week schedule most commonly used in the UK.\n\"This longer interval is known to result in a better immune response,\" he added. \nMixed dose trial results for a 12-week jab interval will be available next month.\nMeanwhile, another pre-print study, which also came out on Monday, suggests a third dose of AZ vaccine, given more than six months after the second, boosts the immune system.\nBut experts say it is too early to know if people will need a booster dose this year ahead of winter. It is unclear yet how much immunity might wane over time. \nProf Paul Hunter from the University of East Anglia said: \"The big question at present is whether or not we will be being offered booster vaccines in the autumn. With the evidence available from this and other sources, I suspect that will be likely for those most at risk from the virus, either due to age or being clinically vulnerable.\"\nHe suggested people who have had a first course of AstraZeneca might be offered the Pfizer vaccine in as a booster rather than a repeat AstraZeneca, while people who had a Pfizer first course may not need an autumn booster, based on the evidence from the Com-Cov trial. \nThe initial results of this mix and match vaccine trial are highly encouraging and throw up some interesting options for booster doses.   \nMixing first and second doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines yielded strong immune responses.  Indeed, every combination of dosing - Pfizer/Pfizer, AZ/Pfizer or Pfizer/AZ produced higher antibody and cellular responses than AZ/AZ.  \nDoes this mean that two doses of AstraZeneca is somehow inferior? Not necessarily.  \nIt is worth remembering that two doses of AZ are already proven to reduce the chances of being hospitalised with Covid by more than 90%.  \nSo we know from real world evidence that the AZ vaccine is highly effective. The AZ vaccine is a 'slow burner', and immunity levels build over time, especially when the dosing period is stretched.  Currently the gap between first and second doses is between eight and 12 weeks which should give a better immune response.  \nWhat this trial suggests is that for the third, booster doses, it may be preferable to give a different brand of vaccine than the one used for the first two shots.  \nBut it's also worth noting that mixing vaccines does produce more short-term side effects such as chills, headaches and muscle pain.

      "text": "Dozens of people have died in Canada amid an unprecedented heatwave that has smashed temperature records.\nPolice in the Vancouver area have responded to more than 130 sudden deaths since Friday. Most were elderly or had underlying health conditions, with heat often a contributing factor.\nCanada broke its temperature record for a third straight day on Tuesday - 49.6C (121.3F) in Lytton, British Columbia. \nThe US north-west has also seen record highs - and a number of fatalities.\nExperts say climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves. However, linking any single event to global warming is complicated.\nUS President Joe Biden said the heatwave was tied to climate change in a speech on Tuesday as he pitched a plan to update the country's infrastructure network.\nOn Wednesday he is meeting with governors of western US states and fire officials, as the annual North American wildfire season begins.\nThe heat over western parts of Canada and the US has been caused by a dome of static high-pressure hot air stretching from California to the Arctic territories. Temperatures have been easing in coastal areas but there is not much respite for inland regions.\nBefore Sunday, temperatures in Canada had never passed 45C.\nBritish Columbia Premier John Horgan said the hottest week the province had ever experienced had led to \"disastrous consequences for families and for communities\".\nThe number of heat-related fatalities is likely to rise as some areas say they have responded to sudden death incidents but have yet to collate the numbers.\nIn Vancouver alone, heat is believed to have been a contributing factor in the unexpected deaths of 65 people since Friday. \n\"I've been a police officer for 15 years and I've never experienced the volume of sudden deaths that have come in in such a short period of time,\" police sergeant Steve Addison said. Three or four a day is the normal number.\nHe said people were arriving at relatives' homes and \"finding them deceased\".\nDozens of officers have been redeployed in the city, while the increased volume of emergency calls has created a backlog and depleted police resources.\nBritish Columbia Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe said 100 more deaths than normal had been reported in the period from Friday to Monday.\nThe tiny village of Lytton, about 155 miles (250 km) east of Vancouver - and not much further south than London - has recorded all of Canada's recent record highs.\nResident Meghan Fandrich said it had been \"almost impossible\" to go outside.\n\"It's been intolerable,\" she told the Globe & Mail newspaper. \"We're trying to stay indoors as much as possible. We're used to the heat, and it's a dry heat, but 30 [degrees] is a lot different from 47.\"\nMany homes in British Columbia do not have air conditioning as temperatures are usually far milder during the summer months.\nOne Vancouver resident told AFP news agency that hotels seemed to be sold out, as people flocked there for air-conditioning, adding: \"I've never seen anything like this. I hope it never becomes like this ever again.\"\nThe country's weather service, Environment Canada, has issued heat warnings for the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, along with areas of Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories and Manitoba.\nJodi Hughes, weather anchor at Global News Calgary, told the BBC that firefighters were extremely concerned at the possibility of wild fires, possibly sparked by thunderstorms that could occur as the weather pattern changes.\nIn the US Pacific Northwest on Monday, temperatures hit 46.1C in Portland, Oregon, and 42.2C in Seattle, Washington, the highest levels since record-keeping began in the 1940s, the National Weather Service said.\nAt least a dozen deaths in Washington and Oregon are believed to be linked to the heatwave.\nA doctor in a Seattle hospital told the Seattle Times the number of patients streaming in with heat stroke was comparable to the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nDr Jeremy Hess said some had kidney or heart problems, and one man had third-degree burns from walking on asphalt.\nSeattle resident Mark Aldham set up a cooling system in his front yard with free snacks and drinks. \"It is super hot here. So my partner and I, we set up some shade that we have from [Nevada festival] Burning Man to help cool off our neighbourhood and keep everyone safe,\" he told Reuters.\nThe heat has been intense enough to melt cables, shutting down the Portland Streetcar Service on Sunday.\nAn electrical utility in Spokane, Washington, has also introduced rolling blackouts to cope with huge power demand as residents run air conditioners.\nAgricultural workers are often now being given the option to start at dawn and finish at noon. But labour contractors say that some stay on to work regardless of the heat.\nOne worker was found dead in a field at the end of his shift at a farm in Oregon.\nOne Seattle resident told AFP that the city felt like a desert: \"Normally... 60, 70 degrees [Farenheit] is a great day - everybody is outside in shorts and T-shirts - but this is... ridiculous.\"\nAmazon allowed members of the public into areas of its Seattle headquarters as a cooling-off location on Monday, while people in Portland also flocked to cooling centres.\nHave you been affected by the high temperatures?

      "tags": "Britney Spears,Music",
      "text": "Britney Spears' sister has spoken publicly for the first time about the star's controversial conservatorship.\nBritney told a court last week that the legal arrangement, which controls many aspects of her life, was \"abusive\" and she was \"traumatised\".\n\"I'm so proud of her for using her voice,\" Jamie Lynn Spears said in an Instagram story on Monday. \n\"If ending the conservatorship... or whatever the hell else she wants to do to be happy - I support that.\"\nShe added: \"I am so proud of her for requesting new counsel like I told her to do many years ago.\n\"I'm not my family, I'm my own person. I'm speaking for myself.\"\nThe actress, who stars in Netflix drama Sweet Magnolias, appeared to address criticism from Britney fans in her post.\nSome who have backed the #FreeBritney campaign had questioned why Jamie Lynn had not been publicly supportive of her sister until now.\n\"The only reason I haven't [spoken out] before is because I felt like until my sister could speak for herself and say what she felt she needed to say publicly, it wasn't my place, and it wasn't the right thing to do,\" she explained.\n\"But now that she's very clearly spoken... I feel like I can follow her lead and say what I feel I need to say.\n\"I've made a very conscious choice in my life to only participate in her life as her sister,\" she added. \n\"Maybe I didn't support her the way the public would like me to, with a hashtag on a public platform. But I can assure you I have supported my sister long before there was a hashtag. And, I'll support her long after.\"\nThe term #FreeBritney dates back to 2009, according to a New York Times report, from a fan site that disagreed with the conservatorship agreement.\nJamie Lynn said that she had always been there for her older sister. \"Since the day I was born, I've only loved, adored, and supported my sister,\" she continued.\n\"I don't care if she wants to run away to the rainforest and have a zillion babies in the middle of nowhere or if she wants to come back and dominate the world the way she has so many times before. I have nothing to gain or lose either way. \n\"I am only her sister who is only concerned about her happiness.\"\nIn a 23-minute court appearance via phone, Britney told a court: \"I just want my life back.\" \nShe told the judge she had been drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from having more children.\nIt was the first time the star had spoken publicly about the conservatorship, which began in 2008, when concerns over her mental health prompted her father Jamie to petition the court for legal authority over his daughter's life.\nMr Spears currently oversees the star's fortune, alongside a professional wealth management firm. A licensed professional conservator temporarily took over Britney's personal care in 2019. She has since opposed her father's return to the role.\nAfter hearing her remarks in court, Mr Spears' lawyer issued a statement, saying: \"He is sorry to see his daughter suffering and in so much pain. Mr Spears loves his daughter, and he misses her very much.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "tags": "Alcohol,Pubs",
      "text": "Long-awaited plans to extend opening times for pubs and nightclubs in Northern Ireland have passed their final hurdle at Stormont.\nThe changes will allow pubs and clubs to serve alcohol for an extra hour, until 02:00, almost every weekend.\nEaster drinking restrictions have also been removed, with the changes backed by assembly members (MLAs) after a debate in the assembly.\nMost of the changes will take effect from 1 October 2021.\nThe 1 October date will allow the hospitality industry to avail of extended opening times ahead of the Christmas period.\nOther measures will come into force from 6 April 2022 in time for next Easter. \nIt marks a significant liberalisation of Northern Ireland's laws on alcohol that has been in the making for nine years.\nA previous bill to change Northern Ireland's licensing laws began its legislative passage in 2016, but the assembly collapsed in January 2017 amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in, who share power together at Stormont.\nMeanwhile, a full statutory review of licensing laws in Northern Ireland will also be held following an amendment to the licensing bill secured by SDLP assembly member (MLA) Matthew O'Toole on Tuesday afternoon.\nThe amendment means the Department for Communities must begin an independent review within the next year, including an investigation of how the so-called \"surrender principle\" affects the industry. \nThe principle means no new licence can be granted unless another one is surrendered.\nLicences for selling alcohol on and off premises are also convertible in court, which means that every supermarket or convenience store seeking to add an off sales needs to acquire a licence from somewhere else.\nMr O'Toole said the review would be a \"first step toward reforming the system here so that it works for everyone\".\nCommunities Minister Deirdre Hargey said she believed it was a \"a balanced piece of legislation\".\nShe told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme there was a need \"to modernise in 2021\".\n\"I want to make sure we do this in a balanced way, lifting some of the current restrictions, which are archaic, but also be mindful in terms of the health and safety impacts,\" she said.\nCinemas will also be permitted for the first time in Northern Ireland to apply for a licence to sell alcohol to customers. \nIt will bring the rules in Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland.\nMichael McAdam of the cinema chain Movie House said it was a positive step.\n\"I think it will add to people's overall experience,\" he said.\n\"I don't envisage massive sales but it's about giving people choice and that's the good thing about this legislation.\"\nOther changes in the bill include the extension in \"drinking-up time\" from half an hour to an hour, meaning venues can operate until 03:00 at weekends.\nThe law will also be tightened in some areas - supermarkets will face restrictions on where they can place in-store advertising for alcohol.\nThe current voluntary code of practice for drinks promotions will be replaced with legal requirements.\nThe changes will also enable local drinks producers to sell their products directly to the public in limited circumstances, make changes to the law affecting registered private clubs and allow changes to permitted hours at major events.

      "tags": "UK devolution",
      "text": "Two of the UK's parliaments - Holyrood in Scotland and the Senedd in Wales - will be holding elections on Thursday 6 May.\nBut what powers do national parliaments have, and how do different parts of the UK work?\nFor many years England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were run by the UK government, based in Westminster in London. \nBut in a process called devolution, some powers were passed from Westminster to elected bodies in Cardiff, Belfast and Edinburgh.\nPublic votes about devolution were held in 1997 in Scotland and Wales, and in both parts of Ireland in 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement. \nThis led to the creation of new elected institutions: the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales (now called the Senedd) and the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nThe UK government in Westminster remains responsible for policy for England, and overall policy in a number of areas.\nThese include defence and national security, foreign policy, immigration, citizenship and tax - though Scotland has its own powers to raise and lower income tax.\nThe Scottish Parliament sits at Holyrood in Edinburgh. There are 129 elected Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs).\nScotland already had its own legal and education system. After devolution, it has become responsible for many areas, including:\nIts powers were extended in 2012, and again after the 2014 referendum on whether Scotland should become independent. \nThe Scottish National Party (SNP), which has formed the Scottish government at Holyrood since 2007, continues to argue for full independence. \nThe SNP has also called for more devolved power following the UK's departure from the EU.\nSince May 2020, the National Assembly of Wales has been known as the Senedd Cymru (Welsh Parliament). It meets in Cardiff Bay, and is made up of 60 elected Members of the Senedd (MS).\nThe Senedd's responsibilities include:\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly sits at Stormont in Belfast. There are 90 elected Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs).\nDevolution in Northern Ireland is different to Scotland and Wales, with government powers divided into three categories:\nThe main powers of Stormont include:\nIn addition, the power-sharing agreement between the nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland is vital.\nThe First Minister and Deputy First Minister jointly lead the government - one representing each of the two largest parties in power, in a mandatory coalition. Despite different job titles, they have the same powers.\nNorthern Ireland's government was dissolved for three years after relations broke down between the governing parties - the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn F\u00e9in - in January 2017. \nBut in January 2020, the two parties re-entered the devolved government after agreeing to work together again, alongside three smaller parties - the Ulster Unionists, SDLP and Alliance. \nOver the past 20 years, more powers have been given to local and regional mayors in areas like transport and housing.\nThe first was the mayor of London. The position was created, alongside the London Assembly, after a referendum in 1998. \nThe London mayor decides how much money to spend and sets priorities in some key areas. \nFor example, the mayor can set bus and Tube fares, and decide targets for the number of affordable homes. \nMayors in other parts of the country were added following referendums held in 2002 and 2012. They have different powers depending on the areas they represent.  \nIn Greater Manchester, for example, the mayor's powers extend to social care, children's services and housing."

      "text": "Under-18s travelling to mainland Portugal with a fully vaccinated parent or guardian will not have to quarantine, authorities have confirmed.\nThe statement follows two days of confusion over whether Portugal's new rules applied to minors.\nUnder the rules, adults must quarantine for 14 days unless they can prove they received their second vaccine dose a fortnight before arrival.\nBut children aged 12 and over do have to show a negative Covid-19 test. \nThis must either be an RT-PCR test taken 72 hours before their departure, or a lateral flow test taken 48 hours before their departure.\nThese rules are specific to mainland Portugal, which is currently on the amber list, meaning those travelling back to the UK from there must quarantine for 10 days at home. \nDifferent rules apply for travellers to Madeira, which will be added to the UK's green watch list from Wednesday. \nThe new rules have already had an impact. \n\"It was carnage and chaos for every business in the Algarve,\" says Joe Mountain who runs Sandy Blue Villas, renting accommodation in the Algarve.\n\"Yesterday we were contacted by 50% of UK guests with forward bookings for this summer. \n\"People were in meltdown and just not understanding the rules. It's impossible to find answers. \n\"For us, it has been continued uncertainty for the last two months, with a real lack of ability to plan. We rely on that and it is critical that we get UK guests this summer.\"\nIn another development, Malta's health ministry has said travellers arriving there from the UK from Wednesday will need an official NHS letter to prove their vaccination status.\n\"Only the paper version of the NHS Covid letter will be accepted, which can be requested online or by calling 119,\" the health ministry said.\n\"The vaccination certificate will be not accepted in digital or downloaded PDF form. It must be the printed version issued directly from the NHS.\"  \nMalta has said only \"fully vaccinated travellers\" will be allowed to enter the country from the UK - and this includes children aged 12-plus. Children under 12 will be permitted if they are accompanied by parents or guardians who have had both doses. \nThe Maltese government has said those aged between five and 11 must also show evidence of a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours before arrival.\nThe measures have been introduced for UK travellers, in particular for those not fully vaccinated, amid fears they could spread the Delta variant of coronavirus, which was first identified in India."

      "text": "UK house prices rose 13.4% in the year to June, the fastest pace since November 2004, the Nationwide has said.\nThe building society said the average house price increased to \u00a3245,432 from \u00a3216,403 in June 2020.\nNationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said prices were \"close to a record high\" in relation to average incomes, which he added \"makes it even harder\" for first-time buyers.\nHe told the BBC the pandemic had \"stimulated\" the housing market.\nMr Gardner said lots of people had \"reassessed what they want from home\" in terms of space and where they live as a result of the coronavirus lockdowns.\n\"The pandemic is an unusual kind of shock - it has stimulated housing market activity rather than the shock holding back the market which is normally what happens,\" he added.\nThe Nationwide bases the findings on its own mortgage data. It said while the rapid annual growth was partly due to prices being \"unusually weak\" during the first lockdown last year, the market continued to \"show significant momentum\".\nAll parts of the UK saw a rise in house prices in the second quarter of 2021, with Northern Ireland and Wales experiencing the largest year-on-year increases of 14% and 13.1% respectively.\nThe slowest rate of price growth was seen in Scotland, where property values increased by 7.1%, while London was England's weakest performing region, with prices rising 7.3%\nMr Gardner said despite the increase in house prices to \"new all-time highs\", the typical mortgage payment was \"not high by historic standards compared to take home pay, largely because mortgage rates remain close to all-time lows\".\nHouse prices are rising fast; prompted by stamp duty holidays, sustained by estate agent marketing, and - significantly - inspired by a Covid-related change of priorities among buyers.\nOf course, this is a general picture. The UK housing market is a series of mini-markets. Just ask someone trying to sell a flat at the moment and they may feel they are in a parallel universe. \nWhat really is in doubt is whether this boom will be followed by a bust.\nIf the economy fails to recover and jobs are lost, some people may be forced to sell and fewer will want to buy. If that is sustained and prices fall, negative equity looms for new buyers who are borrowing heavily now to buy somewhere bigger in which to live and work.\nThe market in recent months has continued to be stimulated by stamp duty holidays in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nFrom Thursday, those tax breaks start to be withdrawn, and will return completely to the pre-pandemic levels by October.\nNicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agents Fine and Country, said: \"Annual house price growth of this magnitude is something no one thought they'd see, particularly with the stamp duty holiday now tapering out.\n\"The final closure of the stamp duty scheme at the end of September may have no impact at all because other factors are so much more important, namely the race for space, low supply, accidental savings and low interest rates.\"\nHowever, some analysts point to the link between housing demand and jobs as key to the future of property prices.\nDanni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said unemployment would be closely watched. \n\"How many people will still be in a job once the furlough scheme ends? How many mortgage holidays will result in quick sales? There is no getting away from the fact that the next few months will be difficult for many people once support is withdrawn,\" she said."

The rules came into effect at midnight.\nThe new quarantine measures apply only to those travelling to mainland Portugal, not Madeira.\nThere were 19 flights listed as departing on Monday from UK airports to Portugal's mainland airports - Lisbon, Faro and Porto.\nBrazil, South Africa, India and Nepal were already on Portugal's quarantine list, but the exception for people who are vaccinated against Covid-19 to avoid isolating applies just to the UK.\nFrustrated would-be holidaymaker Sarah Cluskey is one of many people who have been caught out by the ever-changing travel rules.\n\"Portugal is one of our favourite holiday destinations and when it went on the green list, we decided to book,\" she told the BBC.\nSarah's husband runs a construction company and has had to work in very difficult circumstances throughout the year, she says. \nHe has been travelling into London the whole time, apart from the first three weeks of lockdown.\nAfter a stressful year, she, her husband and their two teenage daughters had been looking forward to a break in the sun.\n\"Myself and my husband have been double vaccinated, so we can still go. However, we have an 18-year-old daughter who has just received her first vaccination and a 13-year-old daughter who hasn't been vaccinated. \n\"This leaves us in a position where we can go away, but not as a family, and there will be many other people in the same situation, which is very unfair to families. \n\"This means that we have no choice now but to cancel our holiday.\"\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Monday the measures in Spain for UK travellers would come into effect in 72 hours and included the Balearic Islands as well.\nPortugal and mainland Spain are currently on the UK's amber list, meaning those arriving back in the UK must take two tests and quarantine for 10 days.\nThe Balearic Islands are on the UK's green list, so holidaymakers do not have to quarantine on their return.\nMalta has said only \"fully-vaccinated travellers\" will be allowed to enter the country from the UK, but children under 12 will be permitted if they are accompanied by parents or guardians who have had both doses.\nThe Maltese government has said those aged between five and 11 must also show evidence of a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours before arrival.\nThe UK government says travellers can use an NHS Covid Pass to prove their vaccination status.\nThe pass is available in digital or paper format and people can access their own pass two weeks after having a second dose of the vaccine.\nYou are eligible to get a pass if: \nThe tougher restrictions across Europe come after Germany urged the EU to restrict UK travellers.\nThe Times reported German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to designate the UK as a \"country of concern\" because the Delta variant of the coronavirus is so widespread.\nThe plans will be discussed by senior European and national officials on the EU's integrated political crisis response committee.\nThe destinations added to the green list from 04:00 BST on 30 June are:\nSix destinations will also be added to the government's red list on 30 June - the Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Haiti, Mongolia, Tunisia and Uganda.\nMrs Merkel previously told Germany's parliament: \"In our country, if you come from Great Britain, you have to go into quarantine - and that's not the case in every European country, and that's what I would like to see.\"\nShe is set to meet Prime Minister Boris Johnson at Chequers on Friday.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has also talked about his concern at the spread of the variant.\nCurrently, fully vaccinated UK visitors to France can enter without quarantining.\nTravelling abroad isn't just about what is on the UK's green list: other countries also have to let UK travellers in. \nIn the last few days, more countries have tightened up their restrictions on arrivals from the UK, but each has decided its own approach on a sliding scale of severity. \nSome, like Spain, have added the need for a Covid test, while others like Malta require 12-year-olds and over to quarantine if not fully vaccinated. Each country is likely to continue deciding its own individual travel policy, but if many follow Malta's example, this could majorly disrupt family holidays. \nMany countries that rely on UK tourists will be loath to increase restrictions that will stop them from travelling and policies could change during the summer as countries vaccinate more of their citizens. \nBut these changes do show that international travel is still on shaky ground. \nWith Covid still widespread in many countries, tourists will have to think carefully about their spending on holidays.\nThere is always a risk that a green-list country may move to the amber or red list. If this happens, you will need to quarantine after your holiday - something that could be difficult for many people.\nOperators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate on your return.\nIf the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised, then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there.\nIn this case, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash.\nRead more about your refund rights on holidays\nAre you planning a holiday this summer?

      "text": "The EU's chief Brexit negotiator says he is \"confident\" a solution can be found in the next 48 hours over a possible ban on chilled meat products from GB being sold in NI.\nEuropean Commission Vice President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d  has appeared before a Stormont committee.\nProducts such as chilled sausages were due to be prohibited from Thursday as a result of the NI Protocol.\nThe protocol is part of the Brexit deal that creates a border in the Irish Sea.\nIt keeps NI in the European Union single market for goods.\nThe EU does not generally permit the import of chilled meat products like mince and sausages from non-member states.\nBut the UK has asked the EU to delay the ban through extending a so-called grace period.\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said he had been in \"intensive contact\" with the European Parliament and EU member states in recent days about the UK's request.\n\"While I cannot today announce the EU's formal agreement to the request, but after all the internal contacts I have had, I remain confident we can find a solution in the next 48 hours that will address both sides' needs and concerns,\" he said.\n\"I hope to be bringing such optimism to Northern Ireland more in the future.\"\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d also told MLAs that the EU was \"prepared to take bold steps\" on flexibilities, if the UK is committed to implementing protocol in full, including changing EU laws if necessary.\nHe repeated the EU's preference for a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement as a solution for Northern Ireland, where the UK continues to follow all EU agri-food rules. \nThe UK has previously rejected this proposal, with its negotiator Lord Frost saying it would be \"an abrogation of sovereignty\" if it involved the rules being enforced through the EU institutions.\nSpeaking later in the Northern Ireland Assembly, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she welcomed the \"indication\" from Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d that the extension would be granted.\n\"We should bank that but what we need here are longer-term solutions and I hope we can find those in the period ahead,\" she added.\n\"I do think the appearance of Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d really was a positive development, I think it is really important that he does hear first-hand that the DUP doesn't speak for the north on Brexit or the Protocol.\"\nAnalysis\nThere are clearly some within the EU who think that the UK government is not serious about maintaining the protocol.\nSo Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d was saying 'yes we want to be flexible, but we also need to see the goodwill and the implementation from your side'.\nI think the two sides are still quite far apart on what sort of flexibilities are required or are necessary to make the protocol work.\nI think it's inevitable that we will see another big row blowing up at least by the autumn.\nEconomy Minister Paul Frew described the protocol as \"damaging and brutal\".\nHe told the assembly it was being used as \"punishment and leverage\" by the EU for future negotiations with the UK.\n\"There are some people here [in the assembly] who are complicit in that and that has really frustrated businesses I've spoken to over the last couple of weeks,\" he added.\nBefore the Executive Office committee meeting, the SDLP's Colin McGrath, speaking as chairman, said the committee would make sure Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d was \"fully appraised\" of what Stormont's backbench members think about the protocol.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which keeps NI in the European Union single market for goods.\nThe EU does not generally permit the import of chilled meat products like mince and sausages from non-member states.\nSince January, producers in Great Britain have not been able to sell these products in the EU.\nHowever, in December 2020, the EU agreed to a six-month grace period to allow supermarkets in Northern Ireland to re-orientate supply chains away from Great Britain.\nThe UK has asked the EU to extend a grace period for chilled meats to the end of September.\nMeanwhile judgement is expected this week in a judicial review which challenged the lawfulness of the protocol.\nThe challenge was brought by a group of unionist politicians and was heard in the High Court in Belfast last month.\nOne of the applicants, Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister, tweeted that judgement is expected on Wednesday morning."

      "tags": "Republic of Ireland,Coronavirus vaccines,Hospitality industry,Restaurants",
      "text": "The Irish government is delaying the return of some indoor activities, including hospitality, over increasing cases of the Delta Covid-19 variant.\nIndoor hospitality was due to reopen on 5 July.\nWhen it reopens, it will be limited to those who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19, Taoiseach (Irish PM) Miche\u00e1l Martin has said.\nThe recommendation was made by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).\nThe Irish cabinet met on Tuesday morning to consider the plans.\nMr Martin said while there would be an increase in the number of people who could attend outdoor events and the number who can attend weddings would be increased to 50 as planned, \"the return to other indoor activities including hospitality will be delayed\".\n\"NPHET's clear advice based on the modelling it has done is that given the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant, the safest way to now proceed with the return of indoor hospitality is to limit access to those who have been fully vaccinated or who have recovered from Covid infection,\" he said.\n\"Over the course of the coming weeks, the government will work urgently with the relevant sectors to agree a practical and workable approach.\n\"The simple truth is that we are in a race between the variants and the vaccines and we want to do everything we can to ensure that the vaccine wins.\"\nMr Martin said he knew his announcement of the delay would be greeted with dismay and frustration.\nHe said the tourism and hospitality sectors had borne a disproportionate burden throughout the pandemic and in recognition of this additional supports would be provided in the coming weeks.\nThe taoiseach gave no date for when indoor dining and drinking in pubs and restaurants would resume.\nRestaurateurs and publicans expressed their anger and frustration at Mr Martin's comments.\nCathal Doherty, who owns the Ballyliffin Townhouse Boutique Hotel in County Donegal, said many in the hospitality sector would view Tuesday's announcement as unworkable. \n\"We obviously have to wait for the full published guidance, but it will be interesting to see how they [the government] can even begin to possibly explain this,\" Mr Doherty said.  \n\"It's beyond confusing, we just seem to be going backwards.\"\nMr Doherty believes for many small businesses across Ireland the delay for reopening will be seen as the \"final nail in the coffin\".\n\"If we [the hospitality sector] don't start getting a decent trade in summer then many small businesses are simply not going to make it until winter,\" he said.  \n\"That is the hard truth, this has caused more challenges than solutions,\" he added.\nMartina Barrett, who owns The Tavern in Portnoo, County Donegal, labelled the proposed rules as \"absolutely ridiculous\". \nMs Barnett explained that many of her staff, who are in their early 20s, have not even received their first Covid-19 jab and questioned how her pub could operate.\n\"It's just impossible to police, and once again this decision has left us unclear as to what to do next,\" she explained. \nLabour leader Alan Kelly said the plan was \"bananas and discriminatory\".\nHe said what the government is proposing was not enforceable and people under 30 were shocked that they had been \"jettisoned\".\nSocial Democrats co-leader R\u00f3is\u00edn Shortall also said the plans were unworkable and unenforceable.\nIndependent TD Mattie McGrath called on the government to dispense with the services of NPHET.\nMinister for Health Stephen Donnelly said it was intended to agree a plan by 19 July in consultation with the hospitality industry to allow those who are vaccinated or recovered from Covid-19 to use indoor hospitality.\nThe Cabinet Covid Committee had a meeting which lasted until 01:00 local time on Tuesday.\nDuring the meeting, the NPHET gave some warnings to the Irish government on Monday, including a \"most pessimistic\" scenario of hundreds of thousands of cases between July and September and more than 2,000 deaths with Covid-19.\nMeanwhile, T\u00e1naiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson vaccines would now be offered to all age groups after being previously limited to over-50s.\nThe plans have been criticised by the Restaurants Association of Ireland, which said it was \"astounded\" that indoor hospitality would face a further delay. \nIn a statement, the group said it believed the policy was discriminatory and unworkable.  \n\"Restaurant, pub and caf\u00e9 owners will now be placed in the unenviable, complex and difficult position of allowing vaccinated customers enter indoors and restricting non-vaccinated customers to outdoor dining,\" its chief executive Adrian Cummins said. \n\"Such a practice of refusing access to goods and services in currently illegal under equality acts.\"\nHe added that many people working in the hospitality sector were in the unvaccinated age groups, and could potentially be asked to refuse service to their peers. \nOutdoor hospitality in the Republic has been reopen since 7 June, with social distancing and restrictions on the number of people who can meet in place. \nIn Northern Ireland, indoor hospitality reopened on 24 May, with restrictions in place on the number of people and households able to meet. \nNon-essential international travel is expected to resume on 19 July and the cabinet is also expected to give the green light to increasing the number of wedding guests to 50 next month."

      "tags": "Republic of Ireland,LGBT,Chile,Canada",
      "text": "Catholic nun, gay and militant. Bridget Coll, Irish born but a proud Canadian, was a trailblazer. \nShe and her partner, Chris Morrissey, made history when they challenged Canadian immigration law which had only recognised heterosexual married partners.\nAs nuns in the 1980s, they stood with the oppressed in Chile against dictator Augusto Pinochet's regime.\nHers is an inspirational journey. She travelled thousands of miles in just one lifetime.\nNow, her story features in a new exhibition in Dublin telling the stories of Ireland's LGBTQ+ diaspora.\nBridget died in 2016. Her life partner, activist and former nun, Chris, survives her.\nHistorian Dr Maurice Casey, who curated the exhibition, came upon their story by chance. He had set out to celebrate an LGBTQ+ history of the Irish emigration story.\nHe was researching the Canadian LGBTQ+ community and was inspired by a series of tapes held by Simon Fraser University recorded in 2009, through which the women tell their story.\nThere is wit and wisdom, a generosity and a humility about Bridget Coll that shines through on the tape recordings from 12 years ago.\nShe talks about how she was born in Donegal in 1934, one of 12 children from a Catholic family who grew up near Fanad lighthouse. She never questioned her sexuality.\n\"I didn't even know that queer existed,\" she said.\nAt 14, she wanted to be a nun and at 16, joined an order in England.\nFrom there, she went to America to work for the Franciscan Missionaries of St Joseph.\nThat was where the first seeds of dissent were sown.\n\"There was an encyclical on birth control from the Pope. The priest gave a whole sermon from the pulpit about how it was a real bad thing to do,\" she said in the recording. \n\"I had a lot of contact with mothers of kids that I taught. They would come and tell me their stories about birth control. I listened to the women's stories and their hardships.\n\"For the first time in my life, I began to doubt the teachings of the Church.\"\nShe was drawn to read more about social justice and liberation theology - a radical movement that grew up in South America as a response to the poverty and ill-treatment of ordinary people. \nThe Liberationists said the Church should act to bring about social change and should ally itself with the working class. \nIt was at that time that Bridget became close to Chris, a Canadian nun in the same order.\nWhen Bridget's parents died within weeks of each other in 1977, Chris was the one person who truly helped. \n\"She said she was a lesbian and asked: 'Do you know what that is?' I said: 'No'. \n\"She said: 'I think you're a lesbian'. I didn't know the word - that was the first time I knew.\n\"It was 1977, I was 43, that's the first time I ever heard it and the first time I fell in love with a woman.\"\nBridget knew she wanted to work in Chile and asked her superior to go there.\n\"Remember you're going to preach the gospel, not to meddle in politics,\" she was told.\nChris went with her to Chile in 1981. They lived in a shack in a shanty town joining whatever struggles people were experiencing. \nThey encouraged women to stand up for themselves in a strongly patriarchal society, and got the name of \"home wreckers\" for it, Bridget joked.\nThey joined an anti-torture movement. They never knew the second names of the other members - if they were tortured then they could not reveal names.\nOne day, a letter came from their religious superior. The order was celebrating an anniversary with a garden party.\nHow would they celebrate in Chile? There was a big protest against Pinochet that day; Bridget and Chris joined it. \n\"I realised how distant I was from them [the Order],\" she said. \nAfter much soul searching, the women left their congregation in 1989 and headed for Vancouver to live openly as a couple.\nBut Chris could not sponsor Bridget as a Canadian immigrant because they were lesbians. In 1992, she initiated a constitutional challenge, and won.\n\"It was on the local news at six o'clock, then it was on the national news that evening... it was something about Gorbachev first and then these two lesbians in Vancouver,\" said Bridget.\nThe women campaigned for LGBTQ+ rights.\nChris Morrissey has loving memories of her partner, and says she must listen again to those tape recordings Bridget made in 2009.\nShe remembers their first protest in Chile. They had to be fast. It was dangerous.\nSpeaking to BBC News NI from her home in Vancouver, Chris recalls Bridget urging them to get there quickly.\n\"The protest lasted only three minutes. She was always in the front row. I was the one holding back. She was out in front dragging me along.\"\nThe decision to leave their order was huge, says Chris. \n\"Our whole understanding of faith and spirituality had changed after the years in Chile. There was no way we could go back and listen to a priest preaching,\" she says. \n\"I have no regrets\u2026 I still value our history and how we learned to be in the world.\"\nThe women went on to work for the oppressed and marginalised in Canada.\nThen Bridget got dementia.\n\"Even when she was not quite sure who I was, I could tell by the way she looked at me that she loved me,\" says Chris.\n\"She had always loved and stood by me, no matter what. She pushed me from behind and pulled me along.\n\"At the end of her life, she was content. She died as she lived, simply and courageously.\"\nMaurice Casey says the couple belong to that \"first generation to grow old and out\".\n\"Bridget Coll's story shows that there is an LGBTQ+ story in almost every strand of Irish emigrant history,\" he says.\nThe couple showed enormous foresight, bravery, courage, principle and humility, Mr Casey adds. \n\"They phrase it as though they put one foot in front of the other. But it required an enormous capability.\"\nCanada claims Bridget Coll and Chris Morrissey as part of their country's history, he says, now Ireland should claim them too."

      "tags": "Schools,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children",
      "text": "There has been a sharp rise in pupils sent home from school in England because of Covid, according to the latest official figures.\nThey showed that more than 375,000 pupils - about one in 20 - were out of school for Covid-related reasons, up by more than 130,000 in a week.\nAbsences have quadrupled during June.\nThe government has signalled a shift to more Covid testing for schools in September - rather than having to send home whole \"bubbles\" of pupils.\nThe Department for Education figures show the highest number of Covid-related absences since the return to school in March, with 5.1% of children out of school, up from 3.3% the previous week.\n\"The government simply does not appear to have a grip on this situation,\" said Paul Whiteman of the National Association of Head Teachers - with attendance figures down to levels seen last autumn.\nAbsences were higher in secondary than primary school in the latest figures, with 6.2% out of secondary school, up from 1.4% earlier this month.\nBut out of all those young people having to stay at home - only 4% are confirmed Covid cases.\n\"It is clear that a different approach is needed in the autumn term,\" said Geoff Barton of the ASCL head teachers' union. But he complained that so far the government's proposals are only \"vague aspirations\".\nMore pupils seem to be returning to learning online - with the Oak National Academy, set up during the first lockdown, reporting a big increase in the use of its online lessons, particularly in the north west of England.\nCandice Yates, a parent and physical health co-ordinator at Ellesmere Park High School in Eccles, Greater Manchester, says the increase in self-isolation has been very disruptive for children, families and schools.\n\"I think psychologically it's awful having to think that you're going to get that call, that your child's going to have to isolate again or they're going to be off again. \n\"And you just feel like, at the moment, there isn't an end to it all; it's just constantly like losing bits and pieces and chunks of their education. \n\"Then they're back in, then they're online, then they're back in, then they're off again and it's just hard to watch the kids go through that as well - as a parent and as staff to watch them go through all these different emotions, of one minute being at home, one minute being here. \n\"Their friendship groups are being affected, not just their education and socially things are being affected for them as well. So it's been tough on them, really tough.\"\nMs Yates says the situation is also difficult for parents. \"I think for families in general it's been quite difficult obviously.\"\n\"More than anything, watching other staff members go through it with younger kids (mine are older), but with the staff having to be off if they had a child in nursery, a child in primary and a child in secondary - they were being torn left, right and centre.\n\"It's been a case of juggling the guilt all the time - if you have to go home to be with your kids, because you've got no other childcare, then you feel guilty for not being in work, if your children are sent home and you're trying to find alternative childcare you feel like you're not there for them because you're at work.\"\nThe current approach of whole bubbles of pupils having to self-isolate where there are cases is under scrutiny - and the rules could change in the autumn, in a bid to limit the disruption.\nIt has been suggested more testing could be used in response to Covid cases - and a pilot scheme in some secondary schools has used daily Covid tests, rather than requiring pupils to self-isolate.\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said he was \"working with the health secretary, alongside scientists and public health experts, to relax Covid measures in schools\".\n\"I'll be looking closely at the issues around the need for ongoing isolation of bubbles and the outcomes of the daily contact testing trial, as we consider a new model for keeping children in education,\" he said.\nLabour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said \"parents and schools are crying out for help\" and called on the government to act before the summer holidays.\n\"When you've got the majority of the class out and trying to teach them difficult concepts, it's a bit of a nightmare really,\" says Danielle Stephenson, a science teacher at Ellesmere Park High School in Eccles, Greater Manchester.\nIn her Year 10 class, Ms Stephenson has 10 out of 14 children currently at home because of Covid cases.\n\"You're juggling it, trying to anticipate. What things will they need to know when they come back? What am I going to do to catch them up when they get back in? How am I going to make sure I don't make the other kids bored because they've already learnt it?\n\"So you're trying to catch everyone up to the same speed - it's just really really difficult.\"\nMs Stephenson says teachers are now always thinking about how they can adapt for children out of school.\nBut she says there is no substitute for face-to-face learning and has noticed that pupils are much more enthusiastic about being in school now.\n\"The kids are a lot more happy to see you and I think I actually appreciate them more when I see them face-to-face. So I think the appreciation is on both sides, from the children and the staff.\"\nThe government's former catch-up tsar, Sir Kevan Collins, said the \"key thing\" was to follow the evidence and take advice from experts and scientists on how testing could be used to reduce self-isolation for pupils.\n\"Ideally, of course, what we all want to do is get every child back in school every day, because that's the very best way we'll recover from the pandemic,\" Sir Kevan said.\nThe former education recovery commissioner, who appeared before the Commons Education Select Committee on Tuesday, warned that education inequality could be the \"legacy of Covid\" and said longer school days could be one way of tackling this.\n\"I'm personally very, very clear that the biggest impact of Covid will definitely be on our most disadvantaged children.\" \nHe confirmed to MPs that he quit his role earlier this month because a \u00a31.4bn catch-up fund, \"just wasn't enough to deliver the kind of recovery we need\".\n\"Our country has responded in a way which compared to some others is frankly a bit feeble. This scale of shock requires a massive national effort to recover.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Facebook,Competition law,United States",
      "text": "The stock market value of Facebook has topped $1 trillion for the first time after the tech giant won a court victory against US regulators. \nA federal court dismissed two lawsuits, from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and a coalition of states, sending Facebook shares up 4.2%.\nIt took the value of Facebook above $1tn, making it the last of the \"big five\" tech firms to hit the milestone.\nThe legal actions had accused Facebook of stifling competition.\nBut Judge James Boasberg ruled that the FTC's anti-trust complaint against the social networking giant was too vague.\nAnother separate anti-competition lawsuit filed by a group of 46 states was thrown out because the alleged violations occurred too long ago.\nIn the US District Court for the District of Columbia ruling, Judge Boasberg wrote that the FTC's complaint was \"legally insufficient\" and had to be dismissed, because the FTC had \"failed to plead enough facts\" to back up its claim that Facebook was stifling competition. \nThe FTC's lawsuit had requested that the technology giant, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, be broken up.\n\"The FTC's complaint says almost nothing concrete on the key question of how much power Facebook actually had, and still has, in a properly defined anti-trust product market,\" wrote Judge Boasberg.\n\"It is almost as if the agency expects the court to simply nod to the conventional wisdom that Facebook is a monopolist.\"\nWhile this is a setback for the FTC that some analysts say could have repercussions for the future of anti-competition law in the US, the watchdog can re-file the charges and has until 28 July to do so. \nHowever, investors saw it as an important victory for Facebook, sending the share price higher. The values of the other tech giants - Apple, Google-owner Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon - have already topped $1tn.\nSeparately, Judge Boasberg also dismissed an anti-competition lawsuit brought by a coalition of 45 US states together with the FTC.\nThis lawsuit had also sought to force Facebook to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. It related to Facebook's acquisition of the two apps in 2012 and 2014.\nIn March, Facebook petitioned the federal court in the US to dismiss them, describing the FTC complaint as \"nonsensical\".\nThe firm said the FTC's case \"ignores the reality of the dynamic, intensely competitive high-tech industry in which Facebook operates\".\nIn his ruling on this case, Judge Boasberg said that the states did not provide \"a reasonable justification\" for why they had waited between six to eight years to decide to sue Facebook - an argument the social networking giant previously made.\nHe added that the states had failed to provide \"a factual dispute\" and only gave a \"half-hearted contention that Facebook was not prejudiced but rather 'benefitted from the states not filing sooner', since it has been and remains a very profitable company\".\n\"Ultimately, this anti-trust action is premised on public, high-profile conduct, nearly all of which occurred over six years ago - before the launch of the Apple Watch or Alexa or Periscope, when Kevin Durant still played for the Oklahoma City Thunder and when Ebola was the virus dominating headlines,\" wrote Judge Boasberg.\nHe added that the states' allegations made it clear that the lawsuit could easily have been filed between 2012 and 2014: \"The system of anti-trust enforcement that Congress has established does not exempt plaintiffs here from 'the consequences of [their] choice' to do nothing over the last half decade. \""

      "text": "The Scottish government is to lift its ban on non-essential travel between Scotland and parts of north-west England, including Manchester.  \nThe restriction sparked a row between First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham.\nMr Burnham accused Ms Sturgeon of \"hypocrisy\" for imposing the ban without any consultation with him.\nHe also pointed out that parts of Scotland had higher Covid rates than Manchester. \nThe ban on travel between Scotland - which currently has the highest Covid rate of any UK nation - and Manchester came into force on 21 June.\nHowever, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said the measure - and a similar ban on travel to and from Bolton that was announced in May - is to be lifted from midnight on Tuesday after a \"careful review of the data\".\nA ban on non-essential travel to the Blackburn with Darwen local authority area will remain in place for at least another week.\nMr Burnham had accused Ms Sturgeon of \"hypocrisy\" over the \"completely disproportionate\" ban, saying she had failed to engage with concerns about it.\nHe also threatened legal action on behalf of individuals and businesses who were affected.\nMs Sturgeon said she was \"a bit confused\" over the mayor's stance, and suggested his statements were \"part of some position in a Labour leadership contest of the future\".\nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average: \nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nCovid infection numbers have hit a series of new record highs in Scotland over the past week, with more than 3,200 cases being reported on Monday - the highest since the pandemic began.\nScottish government scientists say infections could hit 100,000 per week by mid-July in a worst-case scenario.\nBut Mr Yousaf said there were no plans for additional restrictions to be imposed, with the vaccine programme weakening the link between cases and serious illness.\nHe also insisted the government would \"never allow\" the number of weekly cases to hit 100,000.\nAnnouncing the lifting of the travel restrictions, the health secretary said nobody wanted them to be in place any longer than \"absolutely necessary\".\nHe said: \"Placing restrictions on travel between Scotland and parts of north west England was only taken after extremely careful consideration and analysis of data to help prevent the spread of variants of concern.\n\"Following a careful review of the data we have decided to ease travel arrangements between Scotland and Manchester, Salford and Bolton.\n\"However, the situation regarding Blackburn and Darwen will need to be closely monitored and will be reviewed again in a week's time.\"\nMr Burnham said he had serious concerns about the ban being imposed - but was \"grateful to the first minister and to the Scottish government for listening, and for the decision they have announced today\".\nMs Sturgeon later told a Scottish government Covid briefing that there were two factors in particular which could be behind Scotland's high case rate, beyond temporary causes such as fans travelling to London to watch the Scotland football team earlier this month.\nShe said: \"The Delta variant in England seeded into Bolton first of all. In an English context size-wise Bolton is relatively small.\n\"In Scotland the delta variant first seeded in Glasgow, which is our biggest city, so accounts for a much bigger part of our population - so therefore the Delta variant was possibly able to spread more quickly and more extensively than in England in that early phase.\"\n\"We have, by around 8 to 10 percent, lower population immunity in Scotland than in England and Wales, which may be reflective of the fact fewer of us had the virus in earlier stages.\n\"What that means, while vaccination will be evening this out on a day by day basis, is that right now we have a slightly bigger susceptible population\"."

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nWith frustration building over the number of children being required to isolate at home, having been in contact with confirmed coronavirus cases at school, Health Secretary Sajid Javid says he will address the issue. Last week's figures showed more than 250,000 children in the UK were absent - the vast majority close contacts of positive cases. The Scottish government is also reviewing its approach while, in Wales, the education minister says he's looking at ways to ensure the numbers isolating are not disproportionate.\nResearch suggests close-fit FFP3 masks - designed to filter out airborne virus particles - could offer health workers up to 100% protection from coronavirus. After finding staff on Covid wards faced a risk 47 times higher than colleagues on wards kept free from infection, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust issued FFP3 masks during December's second coronavirus wave. The rate of infections dropped to the level on non-Covid wards, says the research, which is yet to be peer reviewed.\nHong Kong is banning all flights from the UK from Thursday, to curb the spread of the Delta variant of Covid. The UK is to be classified as an \"extremely high-risk\" country, the highest rating Hong Kong has for pandemic travel, meaning anyone who has recently spent more than two hours in Britain will be barred from flying to Hong Kong from any airport.\nFor many, the pain of losing loved ones has been magnified by restrictions on visits imposed in the face of the pandemic. The parents of Ollie Bibby, 27, say they were treated \"like criminals\" as they were prevented from seeing their son during his final weeks in hospital with leukaemia. Here's their story.\nRelaxed restrictions mean 40,000 fans will be at Wembley for England's Euro 2020 last-16 tie with Germany this evening. The vast majority will be willing the home side to avenge a series of defeats in tournament football. England manager Gareth Southgate, who missed a crucial penalty in his side's Euro 96 defeat to their rivals, says his players have a chance to create happier memories.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nHere's what's happening with plans to end restrictions.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "title": "Rare black hole and neutron star collisions sighted twice in 10 days",
      "tags": "Black holes,Astronomy,Astrophysics,Gravitational waves",
      "text": "Scientists have detected two collisions between a neutron star and a black hole in the space of 10 days. \nResearchers predicted that such collisions would occur, but did not know how often.\nThe observations could mean that some ideas of how stars and galaxies form may need to be revised.\nProf Vivien Raymond, from Cardiff University, told BBC News that the surprising results were ''fantastic''.\n\"We have to go back to the drawing board and rewrite our theories,\" he said effusively.\n\"We have learned a bit of a lesson again. When we assume something we tend to be proved wrong after a while. So we have to keep our minds open and see what the Universe is telling us.\"\nBlack holes are astronomical objects that have such strong gravity, not even light can escape. Neutron stars are dead stars that are incredibly dense. A teaspoonful of material from a neutron star is estimated to weigh around four billion tonnes. \nBoth objects are cosmological monsters, but black holes are considerably more massive than neutron stars. \nIn the first collision, which was detected on 5 January 2020, a black hole six-and-a-half times the mass of our Sun crashed into a neutron star that was 1.5 times more massive than our parent star. In the second collision, picked up just 10 days later, a black hole of 10 solar masses merged with a neutron star of two solar masses. \nWhen objects as massive as these collide they create ripples in the fabric of space called gravitational waves. And it is these ripples that the researchers have detected.\nThe researchers looked back at earlier observations with fresh eyes and many of them are likely to to have been similar mismatched collisions.\nResearchers have detected two black holes colliding, as well as two neutron stars but this is the first time they have detected a neutron star crashing into a black hole. \nSo apart from completing the set, why does this latest collision matter?\nIt is because, according to current theories and past observations, neutron stars tend to be found with - and collide into - other neutron stars. And the same should be true of black holes.\nIn fact, there are factors which reduce the chances of the two distinct objects being found together.\nBut the two neutron star-black hole collisions, published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, may challenge that received wisdom. \nInstead, it may lean towards another suite of theories, which assume that black holes and neutron stars are indeed found alongside each other. These alternative theories imply that stars and galaxies formed in different ways to the picture painted by standard views of how the cosmos formed.\nFor example, over billions of years, stars have produced many of the building blocks from which larger cosmic structures - such as planets and galaxies - are formed. The production within stars of so-called heavy elements - such as iron, carbon and oxygen - is related to the proportion of black holes and neutron star pairs in the Universe. \nThe force with which stars push out the material inside them when they explode is also related to this proportion of black hole and neutron star pairs. In conclusion, the new finding suggests that stars produce fewer heavy elements and push them out with less force than previously thought, which, in turn, has implications for real-world observations of the Universe.\nNo existing theory can perfectly explain what astronomers see in the night sky. But, according to Dr Raymond, many of the ideas can be ''tweaked'' to better fit what we now  know.\nProf Sheila Rowan, of Glasgow University, told BBC News that observations of the type and frequency of collisions of black holes and neutron stars over the past six years is creating an ever more detailed picture of the dynamics inside galaxies.\n\"All this is giving us a rich picture of stellar evolution. This latest observation is another first for us in our understanding of what is out there in the Universe and how it came to be the way it is,\" she said.\nThe collisions were detected by measuring waves caused by the sudden changes in gravitational forces that occur when two massive celestial bodies collide. These are ripples in the fabric of space itself, just like a stone thrown into a still pond. \nThese so-called gravitational waves travel hundreds of millions of light years across space and were picked up by detectors in Washington State and Louisiana in the US and the Virgo detector in central Italy. Together, they form the Advanced Light Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (ALIGO) collaboration. \nBy the time they reach us, the ripples are tiny - less than the width of an atom. The detectors themselves are among the most sensitive instruments ever constructed. \nIn future, the team hopes to detect neutron star-black hole collisions which are also observed by telescopes - both in space and on the ground. This will enable scientists to find out more about the super-heavy materials neutron stars are made of.\nThe ALIGO collaboration comprises over 1,300 scientists from 18 countries, and includes researchers from 11 UK universities.\nFollow Pallab on Twitter."

      "text": "What is best for Wales should be the focus of recovering from the pandemic, not political differences, a business group has said.\nIan Price, director of employers group CBI Wales, said the Welsh and UK governments needed to \"pull together\".\nHe said the pandemic showed how quickly Wales could react and wanted fast action in future to seize opportunities for jobs and living standards.\nThe UK government said Wales had been given relevant funding.\nOfficials in Cardiff Bay said the UK government needed to respect devolution.\n\"The priority should be what's best for Wales at the end of the day and politics shouldn't be a part of this,\" Mr Price said.\nCardiff Bay and Westminster have previously clashed over collapsed plans for a tidal lagoon, rail electrification to Swansea and the proposed \u00a31.6bn M4 relief road around Newport. \nIn Pembroke Dock, oil company Total is backing a project to develop Wales' first floating offshore wind farm.\nThe joint venture would involve 870ft (265m) tall turbines, assembled and serviced in Wales and the first pilot project is promising 600 direct jobs and 500 indirect. \nThe next stage is planned to generate a gigawatt of power and 3,000 jobs.\nDavid Jones, stakeholder manager at Blue Gem Wind, said: \"I think it's an opportunity for both governments, whether it's devolved or not, it's such a big opportunity and it's such a challenge that I think there's real room for governments to work together on this.\"\nThe proposals have already been in the bidding process for five years.\nThe stumbling block is that Welsh ports need upgrading - with help from the Welsh or UK government - by 2026 at the latest or Mr Jones said there was \"a real danger that we'll have to go elsewhere\".\nA stone's throw away, Ledwood Mechanical Engineering employs 300 people and had been dependent on the declining oil and gas industries.\nManaging director Nick Revell sees renewable energy as the future for Wales but feels governments at both ends of the M4 are not working together.\nHe said: \"I think they can work far better together. There's a lot of politics to play for here and it would be a good opportunity to park some of those politics together get on the same agenda, make things happen that really make a difference for jobs for people living in Wales, living in Pembrokeshire.\"\nPatch, a hardship charity based in Milford Haven, knows from the people it helps how an economy based on low wages affects families.\nManager Tracy Olin said simple changes, such as more frequent buses to help people get work and improve their incomes, would make a real difference and wants the two governments to work together to make that happen.  \n\"I've always hated politicians that just fight all the time, they are there to represent people, and they need to represent people and find out what people really need,\" she said. \n\"If they put the energy of their hatred of the other party to positive then, I think that, oh it would just be wondrous if they could work together and support each other.\"\nMr Price said the speed of decision-making shown by both governments during the pandemic was needed now if new, skilled jobs were to be created in Wales.    \n\"We need to continue that, the danger is that we may revert after all this is over and go back to how we used to do things and wrap things in process and get bogged down in the detail of things.\"\nCBI Wales also wants skills to be linked to what businesses need - such as helping firms adapt from being in the oil sector to hydrogen or developing new opportunities.\nIt also wants more emphasis on the importance of well-being in the workplace.  \nThe UK government said: \"People and businesses across Wales want to see politicians working together. That is why we have provided the Welsh government with an additional \u00a38.6bn since the start of the pandemic to help them respond to the challenges they have faced.\"\nThe Welsh government said: \"We work closely with the UK government on a range of issues of importance to Wales. However, the UK government needs to respect devolution and the Welsh government's role in making decisions for Wales.\""

      "text": "People in England are no longer legally required to wear face masks in almost all public spaces, although they are still recommended in some settings. \nThe change is part of the government's decision to lift Plan B coronavirus measures in England.\nMasks are still required in many situations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nFrom Thursday 27 January:\nWhat are the latest changes to the UK's Covid rules?\nFace mask changes: 'We hope customers aren't discouraged'\nIn Scotland, masks must be worn in most indoor public spaces including public transport, shops and gyms (although they can be temporarily removed when exercising).\nThey must be worn in pubs and restaurants when not seated or dancing, and in the workplace in communal areas and canteens. \nThey are compulsory for all school staff as well as secondary school pupils and are required in indoor public spaces in universities.\nLike England, under-12s are exempt.\nFrom Friday 28 January, adults running organised sessions with under-5s will no longer need to wear face coverings. \nIn Northern Ireland, post-primary pupils must wear face coverings inside school buildings, as must staff if they can't socially distance.\nMasks must also be worn on public transport, in shops and hospitality venues unless you're sitting down to eat or drink.\nMasks aren't required in gyms or other exercise venues.\nHowever, people no longer have to show proof of exemption if they're not wearing a mask.\nUnder-13s don't have to wear masks in public indoor places, and primary school pupils are exempt from the rules on public transport.\nPeople no longer have to wear face masks by law in cafes, pubs, restaurants and nightclubs, but face coverings are required on public transport and  most public spaces, including shops.\nSecondary school pupils are being asked to wear masks in class until the end of half term. \nThe guidance in Wales applies to everyone aged 11 or over.\nIn England, Transport for London (TfL) officers and police can currently fine people \u00a3200 for their first offence. This drops to \u00a3100 if paid within 14 days. \nThe penalty doubles for each subsequent offence, with no discount for quick payment. So, a second penalty would be \u00a3400, a third \u00a3800, up to a maximum of \u00a36,400. \nIn Wales, the penalty for a first offence is \u00a360, with the fine doubling for each subsequent offence - up to a maximum of \u00a31,920. Repeat offenders can also be prosecuted in court where fines are unlimited.\nIn Scotland, the police can issue a penalty notice of up to \u00a360 for breaking the law on mask-wearing.\nEvidence suggests transmission mainly happens indoors where people are close together.\nCovering the nose and mouth reduces the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and while speaking.\nThe main purpose is to protect others although there is some evidence they offer protection to wearers.\nIt should:\nStandard surgical masks are acceptable. It is also possible to buy FFP2 and FFP3 masks used by healthcare workers which can offer higher protection. However, these must be fitted correctly to work."

      "tags": "Ballymena,NI Health,Antrim",
      "text": "A review into the work of a radiologist is a matter of \"the gravest concern\" and will happen as quickly as possible, the health minister has said.\nMore than 9,000 Northern Trust patients have been contacted in a review of the locum consultant's work. \nThe consultant was \"engaged\" between July 2019 and February 2020 and reported on 13,030 images in that time. \nWhen concerns were raised by the General Medical Council (GMC), 30 CT scans were reviewed. \nFollowing that, a full lookback review of all radiology reports issued by the locum has begun. \nHealth Minister Robin Swann told the Northern Ireland Assembly that the review would be \"comprehensive\".\n\"I want to assure members of the public that correct and appropriate steps are being taken by the trust to quickly and thoroughly identify any potential for harm to these patients and to take any follow-up action as may be necessary,\" he said.\nSome patients may have to be recalled for clinical assessment and two serious adverse incidents reviews - the highest level hospital investigation - have been launched.\nA radiologist analyses images such as x-rays, ultrasounds, CT scans and MRIs.   \nThe trust is aiming to complete the review by October.\nIt says breast services are not affected and are not part of the review.\nA GMC spokesperson said it was investigating the \"serious concerns\" and would be working closely with the Northern Trust throughout the process. \n\"As with all concerns raised with us, we can and do take action where we find evidence of an immediate or ongoing risk to patient safety,\" the spokesperson added.\nThe Northern Trust's medical director, Dr Seamus O'Reilly, said: \"First and foremost, I'd like to apologise to all 9,091 of those patients who have received a letter today or may receive a letter over the next few days, for any anxiety or concern that it may create for them. \n\"We feel that there are very small numbers of patients who would be directly impacted as a result of this and that [for] the vast majority of those patients reporting will be of a satisfactory standard.\"\nDr O'Reilly said the trust had written to 9,091 patients or their parents/guardians, where appropriate, to make them aware of the review.\nHe said: \"Those letters were all posted first class and should start arriving today and over the next few days. If people do not receive a letter, it means that their images are not included in the review.\"\nEarlier he said the idea was \"to try to prioritise what we consider to be the high-risk images\".\nDr O'Reilly said the locum was understood to still be working \"within the UK\".\nThe images were all taken at Antrim Area Hospital, Causeway Hospital, Whiteabbey Hospital, Mid Ulster Hospital or the Ballymena Health and Care Centre.  \nThe trust said no other hospitals or healthcare facilities were involved.  \nThe images being examined include 1,100 CT scans, 300 MRI reports, more than 11,000 x-rays and 330 ultrasound reports, taken for a variety of reasons.\n\"We appreciate that this will be a worrying and anxious time for those who do receive a letter,\" said Dr O'Reilly. \n\"I would stress that all of the images relating to the 9,091 patients will be reviewed, but based on our initial audit, we estimate that less than 7% may have experienced a delay in diagnosis as a result of unsatisfactory image reporting.\n\"That does not mean that they will all have come to harm as a result but we will be making a further clinical assessment in each of those cases.\"\nThis is the latest in a series of reviews being carried out across the health service in Northern Ireland. \nA statutory public inquiry has been ordered into the work of consultant urologist Aidan O'Brien, who retired from the Southern Trust in June 2020. \nMore than 1,000 patients' records were recalled.  \nAnd a consultant neurologist at the Belfast Trust is at the centre of the largest ever recall of patients in Northern Ireland. \nApproximately 3,000 patients were linked to the work of Dr Michael Watt at the Royal Victoria Hospital. \nThe Independent Neurological Inquiry, established in May 2018, was converted to a public inquiry last year. \nBelfast Trust has said he is no longer an employee. \nMeanwhile, Sinn F\u00e9in North Antrim MLA Philip McGuigan said he had been contacted by a number of very concerned constituents who described it as a \"massive shock\" to receive letters informing them of the review.\nHe said he spoke to one woman who felt the wording of her letter was very vague and had been shocked by the news.\n\"This isn't the first review - the DoH have seen quite a number of recalls in the last few years,\" he said.\n\"What lessons will the DoH learn from this in terms of how it communicates with patients and how it supports patients in this?\"\nMr Swann confirmed that the locum is no longer working in Northern Ireland. \nThe trust said it intends to contact all patients with information as their images are reviewed, and where necessary, further imaging or follow-up appointments will be arranged \"very quickly\". \nSupport is being provided for any patient with concerns.  \nA helpline is available for any patients with concerns - freephone 0800 023 4377 - and a dedicated e-mail address - radiologyreview@northerntrust.hscni.net - has been set up."

      "text": "A painting by Pablo Picasso that was stolen nine years ago during a heist at a Greek gallery has been recovered.\nPolice say a 49-year-old builder has been arrested for the theft of Picasso's Head of a Woman and a second work by Dutch artist Piet Mondrian.\nInitially, the raid on the Athens National Gallery in 2012 was blamed on two thieves.\nThe artworks were stripped from their frames in the early morning heist which took only seven minutes to carry out.\nA third work in pen and ink by Italian artist Guglielmo Caccia, from the 16th Century, was also seized but police said the suspect told them it had been damaged and he had flushed it down the toilet. \nPolice first revealed that the Picasso painting and Mondrian's 1905 work Stammer Mill with Summer House were recovered late on Monday, and gave further details to reporters the following morning. \nA few months ago it had emerged that they still believed the Picasso had not left Greece. \nCulture Minister Lina Mendoni told reporters the artwork would have been \"impossible to sell or go on display\" because it had a personal inscription from the Spanish painter on the back that read, in French, \"For the Greek people, a tribute by Picasso.\"\nHe had given it to the National Gallery in Athens in honour of Greek resistance to Nazi Germany during World War Two. The Cubist work, painted in 1939, is one of a number of portraits of Picasso's partner Dora Maar.\nDuring the Tuesday press conference, police alleged that the 49-year-old suspect had confessed to the theft and explained how he planned the raid for six months in advance. \nAlmost every day he would monitor the movements of security guards and other staff, they said, noting the times the guards took cigarette breaks. On 9 January 2012, the suspect set off a false alarm in another part of the building and broke into the ground floor of the museum, police explained. \nAt the time the police minister condemned security measures as \"non-existent\", with faulty alarms and some areas of the building not covered by security cameras.\nWithin minutes, four works had been seized, although a second Mondrian painting was apparently dropped during the escape.\nPolice said the builder, described as a decorator, had hidden the paintings at his home for years and had no intention of selling them. Recently, however, he had moved them, wrapped in plastic sheets, to a dried up riverbed in Keratea, outside Athens, where they were eventually found in good condition.\nThe museum's security system has since been upgraded and the Greek government hailed the paintings' recovery as \"a major success\". \nThe culture minister said the National Gallery's \"greatest wound has been healed\" while its director, Marina Lambraki-Plaka, told Greek media that it was like a resurrection."

      "tags": "Yair Lapid,Israel,United Arab Emirates",
      "text": "The arrival of Israel's Foreign Minister, Yair Lapid, in the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday is a landmark moment for his country and the Arab world.\nMr Lapid is the first Israeli minister to pay an official visit to the Gulf state since Israel, the UAE and Bahrain signed a historic deal to normalise ties nine months ago.\nDuring the two-day trip, Mr Lapid will meet his Emirati counterpart, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and inaugurate the Israeli embassy and consulate office in Abu Dhabi and Dubai respectively.\nThe visit is important not only for its symbolic significance but also because it will be the first official engagement between the two sides since the Israel-Gaza conflict in May. At least 256 people were killed in Gaza, according to the UN, and 13 people were killed in Israel during the hostilities.\nThe 11-day conflict was the first test for the newly forged relationship - especially given that the UAE leadership had billed the normalisation deal as an opportunity to halt Israel's plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, which were vehemently opposed by the Palestinians.\nIn the lead-up to the fighting the UAE had condemned the potential eviction by Israel of Palestinians from homes contested by Jewish settlers in East Jerusalem - a focal point for rising Israel-Palestinian tensions - and had urged Israel to defuse the situation.\nDuring the hostilities, however, the UAE could do little to deploy diplomatic leverage to pressure the Jewish state to limit the scale of its attacks on Gaza, from where militants fired thousands of rockets.\nIt is difficult to gauge public mood on contentious political issues in the UAE, an autocratic state, but anger was palpable on social media with citizens condemning Israeli action and showing support for Palestinians. \nDespite this, Abdulkhaleq Abdullah, a Dubai-based political scientist, believes that Mr Lapid's historic visit shows that both countries have weathered the storm well. \n\"The bilateral relationship has passed its first test, and it shows its irreversible,\" he says.\n\"The UAE is adopting two tracks: first is the normalisation path, and the second that it still supports the Palestinian right to have their own state.\"\nIsrael and the UAE had different objectives when they decided to normalise ties last year. From Abu Dhabi's perspective, security was at the heart of its decision, while for Israel, economic co-operation with the UAE - and acceptance by an Arab state - were the main drivers. \nShortly after the agreement, known as the Abraham Accords, was reached, then-US President Donald Trump's administration authorised the sale of 50 advanced F-35 fighter jets to the UAE. This was a huge shot in the arm for UAE, as the acquisition will not only beef up its military capabilities but also give it a strategic edge in the region.\nAccording to Bader Al-Saif, a Kuwait-based fellow with the Carnegie Middle East Center, the agreement with Israel reflects the UAE's long-term ambition of being an important geopolitical player on the global stage. \n\"Through this deal, the UAE is betting on elevating its security stature in the region,\" he says.\n\"They have established themselves as an important economic hub but now they want to be one of main leaders in the Middle East.\"\nThe economic partnership has flourished since the accords were reached, with a flurry of business deals signed across multiple sectors, including healthcare, artificial intelligence, defence and travel. \nIn April, Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investment, signed a memorandum of understanding to buy a stake in an Israeli natural gas field for as much as $1.1bn (\u00a3790m; \u20ac922m). If the deal goes through it will be the biggest between the two countries yet. \nData suggests that when it comes to trade ties, Israel has been the early winner. \nAccording to Karen Young, director of the Economics and Energy Program at the Middle East Institute, the total value of investments from the UAE to Israel touched $80m between September 2020 and March 2021. During the same period, the capital inflow from Israel to the UAE amounted to less than $25m.\nEmirati investments into Israel have been led by state entities. Ms Young expects that trend to continue, especially after the recent Israel-Palestinian violence.\n\"What happened in May turned off a lot of private businesses in the UAE that may have been willing to go into Israel as investors,\" she says.\nBut even as private investments from the UAE are expected to remain subdued, Ms Young thinks that investments by state entities - specifically in technology, defence, water and food - will continue as these sectors are a priority for the UAE government.  \n\"There were going to be obvious difficulties in pursuing this relationship, including opening up investment ties, but they will hold firm because the UAE government is strongly committed to seeing this through,\" she says.\nYou might also be interested in:"

Smoking in public and in front of children is banned. \nThe ruling does not mention the commercialisation of cannabis.\nThe decision came after a legalisation bill stalled in Congress.\n\"Today is a historic day for liberties,\" Supreme Court president Arturo Zald\u00edvar said.\nBut some groups said the ruling was unlikely to result in major immediate changes.\nMexico United Against Crime, a non-governmental organisation, said the decision \"does not decriminalise the activities necessary to carry out consumption\" such as possession and transportation.\nMexico's lower house approved a bill legalising the recreational use of cannabis in March, but it still needs final approval by the Senate.\nThe legislation would let users with a permit carry up to 28g and grow as many as eight plants at home for personal use. At present, it is illegal to carry more than five grams.\nSupporters of legalisation hope it could reduce some of the violence related to illegal drugs trade, which claims the lives of thousands of people in the country every year."

      "text": "The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September.\nThe government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of \u00a32,500.\nAt first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%.\nThe most recent figures show 1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July - the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier.\nNearly one million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation.\nThe numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough.\nSome employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends.\nInternational travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs.\nMany forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. \nIf you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. \nThe selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay.\nIf you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: \nYou might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. \nThe amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. \nYou may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs. \nThere is lots of free benefits guidance and advice available, including: \nThe government says 11.6 million jobs have been supported by the scheme.\nFrom March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about \u00a366bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. \nThat's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid.\nHowever, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs. \nAt the start of the pandemic it was feared that more than one in 10 workers would become unemployed.\nInstead the unemployment rate is currently less than one in 20.

      "tags": "Alcohol,Pubs",
      "text": "Long-awaited plans to extend opening times for pubs and nightclubs in Northern Ireland have passed their final hurdle at Stormont.\nThe changes will allow pubs and clubs to serve alcohol for an extra hour, until 02:00, almost every weekend.\nEaster drinking restrictions have also been removed, with the changes backed by assembly members (MLAs) after a debate in the assembly.\nMost of the changes will take effect from 1 October 2021.\nThe 1 October date will allow the hospitality industry to avail of extended opening times ahead of the Christmas period.\nOther measures will come into force from 6 April 2022 in time for next Easter. \nIt marks a significant liberalisation of Northern Ireland's laws on alcohol that has been in the making for nine years.\nA previous bill to change Northern Ireland's licensing laws began its legislative passage in 2016, but the assembly collapsed in January 2017 amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in, who share power together at Stormont.\nMeanwhile, a full statutory review of licensing laws in Northern Ireland will also be held following an amendment to the licensing bill secured by SDLP assembly member (MLA) Matthew O'Toole on Tuesday afternoon.\nThe amendment means the Department for Communities must begin an independent review within the next year, including an investigation of how the so-called \"surrender principle\" affects the industry. \nThe principle means no new licence can be granted unless another one is surrendered.\nLicences for selling alcohol on and off premises are also convertible in court, which means that every supermarket or convenience store seeking to add an off sales needs to acquire a licence from somewhere else.\nMr O'Toole said the review would be a \"first step toward reforming the system here so that it works for everyone\".\nCommunities Minister Deirdre Hargey said she believed it was a \"a balanced piece of legislation\".\nShe told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme there was a need \"to modernise in 2021\".\n\"I want to make sure we do this in a balanced way, lifting some of the current restrictions, which are archaic, but also be mindful in terms of the health and safety impacts,\" she said.\nCinemas will also be permitted for the first time in Northern Ireland to apply for a licence to sell alcohol to customers. \nIt will bring the rules in Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland.\nMichael McAdam of the cinema chain Movie House said it was a positive step.\n\"I think it will add to people's overall experience,\" he said.\n\"I don't envisage massive sales but it's about giving people choice and that's the good thing about this legislation.\"\nOther changes in the bill include the extension in \"drinking-up time\" from half an hour to an hour, meaning venues can operate until 03:00 at weekends.\nThe law will also be tightened in some areas - supermarkets will face restrictions on where they can place in-store advertising for alcohol.\nThe current voluntary code of practice for drinks promotions will be replaced with legal requirements.\nThe changes will also enable local drinks producers to sell their products directly to the public in limited circumstances, make changes to the law affecting registered private clubs and allow changes to permitted hours at major events.

      "title": "Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us?",
      "tags": "Merthyr Tydfil,Cardiff,Newport,NHS Wales,Mountain Ash,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "What can different statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales?\nHere we update some of the key areas of data for measuring the pandemic and we also try to explain some of the different measures being used. \nThe emergence of the Omicron variant in December 2021 led to record case numbers and fears that a surge in cases could put pressure on hospitals already struggling - as a result, tighter rules were imposed on 26 December.\nBy the second week of January, case numbers began to fall quickly. One week later, the Welsh government was confident the peak had passed and Wales moved to the lowest level of restrictions - alert level zero - on Friday. \nWe saw record numbers of Covid cases in the community in the days after Christmas but this did not translate into a significant rise in hospital cases, with the number of Covid patients now falling for more than a week.\nThere was a rolling average of 560 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on 27 January, a 22% drop on a week ago, although the daily figure has now risen for two successive days to 566.\nThere were two and a half times as many people in hospital with confirmed Covid at the same point in 2021. \nWhen we include patients with suspected Covid and recovering from Covid, there are an average of 1,028 patients. They make up 12% of all hospital patients.  \nThere are now 470 patients who are recovering, so they no longer test positive for Covid but are either still rehabilitating or waiting for a discharge or care support or place to become available. This is the highest number of these patients since last March.\nThe number of Covid patients on invasive ventilation or in critical care beds stood at 20 on 27 January. This is a figure we last saw in early August.\nThe average daily number has fallen from 28 to 21 in a week.\nAbout 90% of these patients are primarily being treated for Covid.\nThere are seven times the number of non-Covid patients in critical care. \nAt the same point in 2021, there were 134 critically ill Covid patients.\nThe mortality rate of a critical care Covid patient, in the most recent study of 623 Welsh patients since May 2021, is about 35%, including those who died later in a general ward.\nAbout half had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived are spending less time in critical care than earlier in the pandemic.\nThe average age is 55, nearly two-thirds are men and they are more likely to be overweight. Nearly half are from more deprived parts of Wales. Just under a third are aged under 50.\nThe study, at a UK level, showed 61% of those Covid patients in critical care were unvaccinated in December.\nCovid admissions are at an average of 25 a day - lower than the average of 40 last week - and make up 2.3% of all hospital admissions.\nWe can also see how they are running lower than modelled scenarios, based on various estimates based on vaccine effectiveness.\nWe can see from a comparison with December-January 2020-21, that despite much higher numbers of cases in the community, the hospital admissions rate is much lower.\nAccounting for a 10-day lag between cases being confirmed and hospital admissions, on 24 January, Covid hospital admissions were just less than 1% of positive Covid tests, compared to 9.4% at the same point in 2021.\nAdmissions have been considerably lower compared to the second wave.\nNearly six in 10 cases of patients in hospital with confirmed Covid in the last week were patients being treated for other conditions.\nOnly 41.5% of patients in acute hospital beds with Covid were being primarily or \"actively\" treated for the virus.\nBut that proportion rises to 90% of those in critical are.\nThe figures on these \"incidental\" Covid cases are only just being published and reflect the fact there has been a lot of people being infected out in the community, while in the latest week there were 220 patients who caught Covid \"probably\" or \"definitely\" while in hospital for other reasons.\nNearly 10,000 patients have hospital-acquired Covid since the start of the pandemic.\nIt doesn't mean that these patients can't have complications because of having Covid and it can still present challenges for patient management.\nSeparate analysis of Covid admissions to Welsh hospitals between the start of the pandemic and August 2021 in Wales estimated that 71.2% were directly due to Covid.\nIn cases where Covid wasn't the primary cause, trauma injuries made up nearly one in five cases, with Welsh Government scientists saying acute illnesses were known to increase the propensity to fall, which on top of reduced physical activity and consequent muscle loss due to shielding and self-isolation issues, \"would increase the likelihood of hip fractures\".\nOne indication of pressure on the NHS is overall bed occupancy in acute hospitals, which has been 90.7% on average for the week, at its highest level over the last two weeks.\nThe other measure is NHS staff absence.\nLatest figures show NHS staff sickness related to Covid-19 in Wales has improved slightly over the last two weeks after being at its highest level since the start of the first wave.  \nOverall staff absence was slightly higher last winter.\nA total of 1.5% of staff were absent due to Covid-related sickness in the week to 24 January. Another 1% of staff were having to self-isolate, according to the weekly Welsh government figures. This does not include NHS Wales staff absent for other reasons. \nThe total absence proportion has dropped to 7.1%.\nAbout 84% of those eligible for a booster in Wales have now received one.\nThere have been an average of 3,494 boosters given out a day in the past week, which has seen a drop off, as the programme works through people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. Before Christmas, the daily average was 42,500.\nAt the peak of the vaccine programme in March, between 38,000 and 40,000 daily vaccines were given out. \nAbout 61% of all vaccines being given out are boosters, with nearly two thirds of 12 to 15-year-olds now having a second dose.\nThe chart above shows the number of people admitted to hospital who have had two doses of vaccine, and those who have had none, for every 100,000 people.\nIt shows the rate of admissions for over-60s who have not had a jab is nearly triple that of those who have been double jabbed and is also far higher for the 18-59 age group.\nThe latest infection survey by the Office for National Statistics suggests - based on swab samples of 9,430 people - that one in 30 people in Wales had Covid in the week ending 22 January.\nThat is 99,500 people, or 3.27% of the population.\nThat's estimated to be highest in youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nThis shows another decrease, compared to the estimate of 112,100 the previous week.\nWhen it comes to age groups, the highest proportion of people infected are youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nCase rates are becoming more problematic to interpret, because three-quarters of people who test positive for lateral flow tests are no longer asked to take follow-up PCR tests.\nThe infection survey is a useful indicator, as it picks up asymptomatic people.\nONS says it shows Covid infections fell in Wales, as in England and Scotland, with an uncertain trend in Northern Ireland. Similar surveys showed infections were one in 30 in Scotland too and one in 20 in England and Northern Ireland. \nIt's now more than two weeks since results from the new testing criteria started coming in, which meant most asymptomatic people no longer needed to take follow-up PCR tests if they tested positive with a lateral flow device. \nAround 80% of those testing positive for lateral flows did not take a follow-up test in the latest week.\nWe know that there were 17,000 people with positive LFTs in the week to 22 January, who did not have follow-up PCR tests and so were not included in the case rate figures - set against 16,000 positive PCR results in the same period. LFT results are published weekly and so we have to be careful with comparisons and interpretation.\nBut if we look at the trend from those figures taken roughly together, in the latest week they would have pushed up the case rate more noticeably than it has risen in recent days. But this is still well down on the numbers we saw in early January.\nThe positivity rate has levelled out - at 34.4% - roughly the same as the week before.\nThe nature of this wave so far has been defined by the age profile.\nThis can also be seen in the big change in January 2022, compared to the week in 2021.\nAround 10% of Covid cases in Wales were in the over-60s, compared to 22% in the very early days of the vaccine roll out in January 2021. \nThere has been a big rise in the proportion of cases in the under 19 age group, now making up a third of all cases.\nThis is back to a share not seen since September and early October and can probably be linked to schools going back.\nAbsence for Covid-related reasons in primary schools has been an average of 4.7% and 2.7% in secondary schools in the last week.\nMost age groups are showing a decline, although there has been a recent rise in the under 16 age group.\nThis week, the proportion of cases among the under 19 age group reached 37% of all positive tests for the first time since September.\nThe 30 to 39 age group remained the largest group. \nCouncil areas in Cardiff and Vale and the Aneurin Bevan health board area all showed rises, as 13 of Wales' 22 local authority areas showed falls in under 25s in the week ending 20 January.\nNewport (1122.9 cases per 100,000) had the highest rate in the under 25s, as it did for case rates as a whole, showing how younger people have generally driven rises in case rates.\nNewport also had above average case numbers in the over 60s.\nMeanwhile, the R-number - reproduction number - for Wales has been estimated at the slightly lower range, between 1.1 and 1.5, up to 13 January. This is a calculation which looks at various factors to work out a transmission rate for Covid. It suggests that for every 10 people with Covid, another 11 to 13 people would be infected.\nRecent modelling, published on 7 January, indicated a rise over the following two weeks, with the situation unlikely to ease. \nBut a fall in cases led First Minister Mark Drakeford, a week later, to say there were \"positive signs that the peak may have passed\" although he added caution over a \"fast-moving and volatile variant\".\nBy 21 January, after a sharp drop, he could say \"confidently\" that Wales had passed the peak of the Omicron wave and the \"incredibly high levels of infections we have seen across Wales\".\nThe latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics suggests that 97.4% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection.\nAlthough slightly less than the other UK nations, it is an increasing proportion and the highest yet recorded, since estimates began more than a year ago.\nThe estimate is 97.2% of 16 to 24-year-olds would have tested positive for antibodies, although it falls to 96.4% for those aged over 80. It is as high as 98.2% for people in their 70s. \nONS also estimates that 88% of 12 to 15-year-olds in Wales have antibodies.\nIn the most recent week, up to 14 January, 69 people in Wales had a death which involved Covid-19 - and saw it included as a contributory factor on a death certificate.\nThis compared to 61 deaths registered in the previous week, according to the ONS.\nIn 77.4% of cases (across England and Wales) in the latest week, Covid was the underlying cause of death - so deaths were due to Covid. This is a lower proportion than seen in earlier months, when it averaged 87%.\nThere were no deaths from Covid in only three counties in the latest week: Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil and Powys.\nThe Betsi Cadwaladr health board area had 18 deaths.\nDuring 2021, there were 4,007 deaths involving Covid, of those registered up to now.\nThat includes 204 deaths in December. Back in December 2020, there were 1,333 deaths involving Covid.\nThe second wave in the winter brought 83 deaths alone on 11 January 2021 - the worst single day during the pandemic in Wales.\nA total of 9,384 deaths involving Covid have occurred during the pandemic in Wales - with 65 actually occurring, rather than just being registered, over the most recent week.\nThe ONS measure includes deaths in people's homes, hospices and other settings, as well as hospitals and care homes.\nBecause Public Health Wales' \"snapshot\" measure only includes deaths within 28 days and after a positive Covid lab test, mostly in hospitals, it excludes deaths involving Covid elsewhere, including many deaths in the first wave of the pandemic, hundreds of deaths in people's own homes and where doctors suspect Covid has been a contributory factor.\nONS also records so-called \"excess deaths\". This has been seen as a useful measure of the pandemic's impact because it looks at deaths from all causes overall, compared to the five-year, non-pandemic average.\nSo since March 2020, there have been 6,520 more deaths than we might expect to see on average.\nDeaths ran above average for the last half of 2021 and in the latest week were the same as the five-year norm. \nNearly a fifth of all Covid deaths (19%) registered have occurred in care homes.\nThere were 10 deaths involving a care home resident in the latest week.\nCare Inspectorate Wales reports that deaths peaked in May 2020 and said it has been notified of 2,019 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid- 16.1% of all reported deaths.\nDeaths in people's own homes have also been running at more than a third higher than average.\nWe can also see how deaths in the third wave have been at much lower levels than in the second wave.\nCovid-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in Wales in December. \nMortality analysis by the ONS showed it accounted for 5.4% of all registered deaths. This compares with 5.2% of all deaths in England.\nCovid was the third leading cause of death in the previous three months and had been ranked as the leading cause of death in six months since the pandemic began.\nDementia, heart disease and chronic lower respiratory diseases were the three leading causes of death in Wales in December. Flu and pneumonia ranked seventh, with the mortality rate significantly lower than normal levels.\nCovid was the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease throughout 2021.\nThe ONS, which takes into account population and age structure, found the mortality rate for deaths due to Covid in Wales in December was 59.3 deaths per 100,000 - significantly lower than the previous month. This was lower than five of the nine English regions: the north west, north east, east and west Midlands and the highest in London (70 deaths per 100,000).\nFour health board areas in Wales had mortality rates in December higher than the Welsh average - the highest was 107 deaths per 100,000 in Cardiff and Vale due to Covid.\nAcross the course of the pandemic, the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is the same in Wales and England - 147.4 deaths per 100,000, with Scotland (126.9) and Northern Ireland (132.5) both lower in the 22 months to the end of December.\nThe age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England, than in Wales.\nWhen a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales again.\nONS also looks at how deaths are registered on certificates and found since the pandemic began, Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 79.6% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales. \nThis is a fall from 83.9% in November. It has been as high as 94% and on average since the start of the pandemic it has been 87%.\nIn around 3% of these deaths, the doctor had written that Covid was \"suspected\".\nA doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution. \nRhondda Cynon Taf has the highest mortality rate over the course of the pandemic in Wales.\nBy the second week of January, RCT and Cardiff each had a total 1,024 deaths.\nRCT also has the seventh highest mortality rate of all local authorities across England and Wales.\nSix of its communities were also in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates are broken down further.\nThe area with the highest number of deaths in the first two waves of the pandemic was Tonyrefail, with a total of 57 deaths due to Covid, followed by Sandfields in Port Talbot (52) and Porth East in Rhondda Cynon Taf (48 deaths), by the end of April 2021.\nWhen translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Llanelli Bigyn is the highest, followed by Port Talbot East.\nAnd there is one community remaining which has had no Covid deaths at all through the pandemic - Llandudno Junction South & Llansanffraid Glan Conwy.\nIn the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales.\nThe ONS and public health bodies are measuring things in a different way - and information is available at different times so do not expect to see the same thing:\nPublic Health Wales' daily updates on its online dashboard show numbers of deaths and positive tests for coronavirus:\nThe graphic above shows how it looks when you compare figures from the different data sources - and how there is a difference between ONS and PHW. There is also a similar count used by the UK government, which takes the PHW statistics and involves people who died within 28 days of a first positive test for Covid.\nThere is a difference of about 2,620 deaths.\nAccording to the PHW measure, on 28 January, there had been a total of 6,804 deaths with Covid, with the daily average running at four a day in the last week.\nMore than eight million Covid-19 tests have been carried out during the pandemic so far.\nNHS Wales labs have capacity to handle 15,000 a day but private labs process most of the test results.\nAlthough PHW figures show more than 765,000 positive tests, this is not the total number of people who have had Covid as mass testing was not available until the tail end of the first wave of the pandemic.\nSince the summer of 2021, and with the easing of restrictions, more lateral flow tests (LFTs) of asymptomatic people have been undertaken, which saw more positive tests eventually feeding into the system - adding about 10% to numbers.\nThe most recent week has seen more than 383,000 LFTs, with a record 21,127 positive. This positive proportion of 11% in the week ending 23 January, was another record. \nThe highest incidence is still among the under 20s - 8,873 positive tests, an 87% rise - and the positivity rate of 24.9% is also the highest  -which is likely to be associated with schools going back.\nIt is the only age group showing a rise, although figures will not show up in overall case numbers.\nFrom 6 January 2022, most people who take LFTs are not being asked to take a follow-up PCR test if positive. This will affect the number of cases which appear - only counting those who come forward with symptoms. This will have to be taken into account when interpreting case data.\nAbout 19,000 tests are routinely taken in hospitals each week and 25,000 in care homes. \nThe number of tests processed in the last two weeks have showed a big drop - half what they were a fortnight ago.\nAbout 96% of tests requiring a rapid turnaround were completed within one calendar day.\nThere have been 1,068 positive tests in care homes among residents and staff in the latest week, following routine testing. This is down on two weeks before, which set a record high since the programme returned in October 2020.\nCare Inspectorate Wales figures also show 235 (22.3%) care homes in Wales have notified one or more confirmed cases of Covid in the last week.\nThis is also fall on the previous week.\nIn the last two weeks, there have also been 39 reported deaths of residents with confirmed or suspected Covid.\nThe dominant variant in Wales is now Omicron, with more than 12,344 new cases sequenced.\nNumbers are now only being reported weekly, as the variant has taken hold.\nPHW increased lab capacity in readiness for sequencing more cases. About 20-30% of positive cases in Wales, which are flagged as being more likely to be variants, have swabs sent for sequencing, with results coming back a few days after people get their normal test results.\nWe can also see more people reporting symptoms of \"long Covid\" - 58,000 estimated in Wales to be experiencing the long-term effect of having the virus. \nThis includes 21,000 people estimated to still be reporting symptoms a year or more after their infection."

      "tags": "Olivia Rodrigo,Music",
      "text": "Elvis Costello has defended pop star Olivia Rodrigo after she was accused of lifting one of his guitar riffs.\nBrutal, a track on Rodrigo's number one album, is based around a punky chord sequence that also featured in Costello's 1978 hit Pump It Up.\nBut when a Twitter user said Rodrigo's song was \"pretty much a direct lift\", Costello replied: \"This is fine by me.\n\"It's how rock & roll works,\" he wrote. \"You take the broken pieces of another thrill and make a brand new toy.\" \nHe added: \"That's what I did.\"\nThe veteran singer-songwriter also included hashtags referencing Bob Dylan's 1965 classic Subterranean Homesick Blues, which inspired Pump It Up; and Chuck Berry's 1956 single Too Much Monkey Business, which influenced the Dylan song.\nYou can compare the Costello and Rodrigo tracks below. The guitar riff first appears 14 seconds into Brutal, and at 15 seconds in Pump It Up:\nCostello's relaxed reaction comes despite a surge in music copyright cases in recent years.\nPerhaps the most infamous case was over the hit song Blurred Lines - in which the family of Marvin Gaye accused Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams of plagiarising Gaye's song Got to Give It Up.\nThe jury's controversial verdict found that Thicke and Williams had copied the \"vibe\" of Gaye's 1977 hit - rather than lifting a melody or chord sequence, which is usual bar for plagiarism.\nSince then, stars like Ed Sheeran, Katy Perry and Childish Gambino have all been sued for millions over similarities between their songs and earlier hits.\nOthers have taken the precaution of crediting writers who might have a claim, even a tangential one, to protect themselves against legal action.\nNotably, Taylor Swift gave Right Said Fred a share of her song Look What You Made Me Do because her chorus melody followed a similar rhythmic pattern to their 1990s novelty hit I'm Too Sexy.\nRodrigo and her co-writer Daniel Nigro have not done the same for Brutal - but it seems Costello is honoured, rather than annoyed, by the hat-tip.\nCostello previously gave permission for Pump It Up's riff to be sampled in Rogue Trader's 2005 dance hit Voodoo Child.\nMeanwhile, Rodrigo has faced separate accusations of plagiarism from Courtney Love.\nLove highlighted similarities between the artwork for her band Hole's 1994 album Live Through This and the images used to promote Rodrigo's Sour Prom, a livestream concert taking place on Tuesday.\nBoth images show a prom queen holding flowers while mascara streams down their faces.\n\"My [album] cover was my original idea,\" Love wrote on Facebook. \"A thing you maybe have to actually live life to acquire?\n\"I've informed her I await her flowers [and] note.\"\nLove also shared the Sour Prom photo on Instagram with the caption: \"Spot the difference,\" eliciting a reply from Rodrigo.\n\"Love u and live through this sooooo much,\" the 18-year-old commented, to which Love replied: \"Olivia - you're welcome.

      "text": "The BBC will end its licence fee grace period for over-75s on 31 July, with 260,000 pensioners still yet to pay.\nThe right to a free TV licence for that age group ended last August for all except those in receipt of the pension credit benefit.\nBut in February, the BBC announced a transition period due to the pandemic.\nThe BBC said that, of the 3.9 million people over 75 who needed to make new TV licence arrangements, 3.6 million had now done so.\nThe corporation said the proportion of over-75s who have now made arrangements for a TV licence was in line with the broader UK population.\nThe BBC said it would write to the remaining 260,000 people with information about the next steps and where they can get advice and support.\nThe corporation said it would also offer \"customer care visits for those who require further assistance\" after the July deadline.\nSilver Voices, which has campaigned against the end of free TV licences, said \"a significant hard core remains of over-75s who are refusing or unable to pay\".\nThe organisation's director Dennis Reed said: \"Is the BBC going to fine and potentially take to court hundreds of thousands of senior citizens who are standing out against the scrapping of this welfare benefit?\n\"We have massive political and media support for a rethink on this issue and the government now needs to intervene urgently to force a solution.\"\nFormer cricketer Lord Botham, who has been among the loudest voices against the change, said many people had paid \"extremely reluctantly\" and would \"sit on their chequebooks\" in the future.\n\"The BBC is now threatening to send round the boys for what it calls 'customer care visits',\" he said. \"The public can see through this Orwellian language and will never stomach the BBC intimidating the elderly.\"\nResponsibility for TV licences for the over-75s was passed from the government to the BBC as part of the broadcaster's last royal charter.\nThe BBC said continuing to fund free licences for all older viewers would have forced it into \"unprecedented closures\" of services. But in 2019, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the BBC should \"cough up\" and cover the cost.\nIn January, the government decided not to move ahead with plans to decriminalise non-payment of the TV licence fee but said it would \"remain under active consideration\".\nThe following month, the BBC said no enforcement action had been taken against anyone who previously held a free over-75s TV licence.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "title": "Mixing Covid jabs has good immune response, study finds",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "A mix-and-match approach to Covid vaccines - using different brands for first and second doses - appears to give good protection against the pandemic virus, a UK study has found.\nThe Com-Cov trial looked at the efficacy of either two doses of Pfizer, two of AstraZeneca, or one of them followed by the other. \nAll combinations worked well, priming the immune system.\nThis knowledge could offer flexibility for vaccine rollout, say experts. \nThe trial results also hint that people who have already received two doses of AstraZeneca vaccine could have a stronger immune response if they were given a different jab as a booster if recommended in the autumn. \nThe UK's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said there was no reason to change the current successful same dose vaccine schedules in the UK, however, given vaccines were in good supply and saving lives.\nBut he says it might be something to look at in the future: \"Mixing doses could provide us with even greater flexibility for a booster programme, while also supporting countries who have further to go with their vaccine rollouts, and who may be experiencing supply difficulties.\"\nSome countries are already using mixed doses. Spain and Germany are offering the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines as a second dose to younger people who have already received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following concerns about rare but serious blood clots, rather than about efficacy.\nTwo doses are important to give the fullest protection and teach the body to make antibodies and T cells to block and kill Covid. \nThe Com-Cov study, which looked at giving the doses four weeks apart in 850 volunteers aged 50 and above, found:\nLead investigator Prof Matthew Snape, from the University of Oxford, said the findings did not undermine the UK policy of giving people the same jab twice: \"We already know that both standard schedules are very effective against severe disease and hospitalisations, including against the Delta variant when given at eight to 12 weeks apart.\"\nHe said the new results showed mixed dose schedules were also effective, even though the interval of four weeks studied was shorter than the eight to 12-week schedule most commonly used in the UK.\n\"This longer interval is known to result in a better immune response,\" he added. \nMixed dose trial results for a 12-week jab interval will be available next month.\nMeanwhile, another pre-print study, which also came out on Monday, suggests a third dose of AZ vaccine, given more than six months after the second, boosts the immune system.\nBut experts say it is too early to know if people will need a booster dose this year ahead of winter. It is unclear yet how much immunity might wane over time. \nProf Paul Hunter from the University of East Anglia said: \"The big question at present is whether or not we will be being offered booster vaccines in the autumn. With the evidence available from this and other sources, I suspect that will be likely for those most at risk from the virus, either due to age or being clinically vulnerable.\"\nHe suggested people who have had a first course of AstraZeneca might be offered the Pfizer vaccine in as a booster rather than a repeat AstraZeneca, while people who had a Pfizer first course may not need an autumn booster, based on the evidence from the Com-Cov trial. \nThe initial results of this mix and match vaccine trial are highly encouraging and throw up some interesting options for booster doses.   \nMixing first and second doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines yielded strong immune responses.  Indeed, every combination of dosing - Pfizer/Pfizer, AZ/Pfizer or Pfizer/AZ produced higher antibody and cellular responses than AZ/AZ.  \nDoes this mean that two doses of AstraZeneca is somehow inferior? Not necessarily.  \nIt is worth remembering that two doses of AZ are already proven to reduce the chances of being hospitalised with Covid by more than 90%.  \nSo we know from real world evidence that the AZ vaccine is highly effective. The AZ vaccine is a 'slow burner', and immunity levels build over time, especially when the dosing period is stretched.  Currently the gap between first and second doses is between eight and 12 weeks which should give a better immune response.  \nWhat this trial suggests is that for the third, booster doses, it may be preferable to give a different brand of vaccine than the one used for the first two shots.  \nBut it's also worth noting that mixing vaccines does produce more short-term side effects such as chills, headaches and muscle pain.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Vaccinating children is routine and widely accepted - measles, mumps, polio, diphtheria, rotavirus, multiple strains of meningitis, whooping cough\u2026 the list goes on. All this starts from just a few weeks old. \nSo, what about Covid-19?\nSome countries are cracking on. The US is immunising children between 12 and 15. It expects to have enough safety data to go even younger next year. \nBut in the UK - the BBC has been told - a decision to vaccinate all 12 to 17-year-olds is unlikely to be recommended by UK experts any time soon.\nThere is a scientific question - will vaccinating children save lives? - which is complex as the answer may vary from country to country. \nThere is also a moral and ethical dimension if doses destined for children would save more lives if they were given to health workers and vulnerable adults in other countries. \nOne argument for not vaccinating children against Covid is they get relatively little benefit from it. \n\"Fortunately one of the few good things about this pandemic is children are very rarely seriously affected by this infection,\" said Prof Adam Finn, who sits on the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nInfections in children are nearly always mild or asymptomatic, which is in sharp contrast to older age groups who have been prioritised by vaccination campaigns. \nA study across seven countries, published in the Lancet, estimated that fewer than two out of every million children died with Covid during the pandemic. \nEven children with medical conditions that would raise the dangers of a Covid infection in adults are not being vaccinated in the UK at the moment. Only those at \"very high risk of exposure and serious outcomes\" - which could include older children with severe disabilities in residential care - are recommended to be vaccinated. \nThe vaccines are incredibly safe, but the risk and the benefit still have to be carefully weighed. \nThere is another potential benefit to vaccinating children - it could save other people's lives. \nThis is an approach that is already used for flu. British children aged from two to around 12 are given the nasal spray, largely to protect their grandparents, each year. \nOne argument is doing the same with Covid vaccines could help contribute to herd immunity - the point at which the virus struggles to spread because so many people are protected. \nThe Covid vaccines look very good at disrupting the spread of the virus. Just one dose appears to cut the chance of catching the virus by at least half and even those that do still get it are half as likely to pass it on. \nChildren do not appear to be major spreaders of coronavirus, but older teenagers may still play a role.\n\"There's certainly evidence of potential for transmission in secondary school ages, so vaccinating could have an impact on overall transmission,\" said Dr Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nBut there is not a universal answer on whether it is worthwhile. \nThe UK's vaccination programme is hurtling ahead and there have been large outbreaks that have left a legacy of immunity which could also play a role.\nAbout a third of 16 and 17-year-olds in England have coronavirus antibodies in their blood despite barely any of them being vaccinated.\nSo the UK and similar countries could find they have enough immunity to stop the virus spreading without vaccinating children.\n\"It's a very different situation to countries without many outbreaks and who don't get as high coverage in adults, then it's very difficult without vaccinating young groups as well,\" said Dr Kucharski.\nAustralia is one country struggling with vaccine hesitancy and, alongside places like New Zealand and Taiwan, contained the virus so well there is barely any immunity from infection. \nOne thing to bear in mind is who doesn't get a vaccine if a child is given one instead.\nThe World Health Organization says wealthy countries should postpone their plans to immunise children and donate them to the rest of the world. Prof Andrew Pollard, who ran clinical trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, said it was \"morally wrong\" to prioritise children.\nProf Eleanor Riley, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh, said: \"There is a case for it and if there was unlimited supply of vaccine we could keep going with the over-12s, but there isn't.\n\"Eventually it's a political decision whether to prioritise our kids over adults dying in their droves elsewhere in the world.\" \nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Jeremy Miles,Welsh government,Wales education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Wales' education minister says he wants to minimise the number of children having to self-isolate from schools.\nJeremy Miles told a press conference he wanted to make sure a \"disproportionate\" number of pupils were not having to self-isolate.\nCouncils in north-east Wales have told BBC Wales thousands of children are staying away from classes.\nBut a head teachers' union said it was \"utterly confused\" by Mr Miles' comments.\nMr Miles also said it would be up to individual schools, colleges and universities to decide their own Covid-safety rules in future - such as on social distancing, face masks and testing.\nIt does not mean the safety measures - which are currently subject to national guidance - will be totally scrapped.\nBut the minister said he wanted them to \"gradually ease\", with schools running as normal as possible in the autumn.\nThe latest three-day rolling number of cases across schools in north Wales is at an average of 26 new cases a day - higher than at the peak of the second Covid wave in December.\nIt compares with just eight cases a day in the Swansea Bay health board area, and less than one case a day on average across Powys. \nGroups of children, called bubbles, have been told to isolate when cases have been identified in their schools. That can involve entire year groups having to stay home.\nMr Miles said the Welsh government would be looking at \"best practice across Wales to ensure that there we do not have a disproportionate number of learners self-isolating\".\n\"While class or year bubbles have played an important role over the last year, we need to ensure that settings distinguish between bubbles on the one hand, and personal contact with cases on the other,\" he said.\nMr Miles said he wanted to make sure schools were not treating the individual contacts of a positive Covid-19 case and entire school bubbles the same way, \"because they are importantly very separate\".\nHe said schools would be helped to minimise the numbers having to self-isolate, using contact tracing.\nMr Miles acknowledged that in parts of north Wales cases were \"increasing\" - but he said it was not \"inevitable\" that more coronavirus cases would have an impact on schools there in the final three weeks of term. \n\"While we will not simply be back to normal by September, we will look to gradually ease the extraordinary measures we've had to put in place,\" Mr Miles told the press conference.\n\"Our guiding principle has to be a move towards education being enabled to operate as normally as possible in the autumn.\n\"Currently, all education settings follow national guidance. However, as we move through the pandemic there will be a need to move to a more localised approach, rather than a blanket approach,\" he added.\nEithne Hughes, director of Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, said: \"It appears from the education minister's statement that he suspects some schools in Wales are guilty of sending home large numbers of young people to self-isolate unnecessarily.\n\"The very last thing any school leader wants to do is to now have learners lose any more time in the classroom following the significant disruption to education they have experienced over the course of the last 16 months.\"\nLaura Doel of the National Association of Head Teachers Cymru Laura Doel said: \"Whilst we all went to see an end to restrictions on social distancing in schools as soon as possible, the plan to do away with 'class bubbles' but retain a requirement for schools to identify close contacts of pupils is impractical,\" she said. \nShe added: \"The proposals, with all the unintended consequences, have the potential to be hugely disruptive. \n\"We are utterly confused by the minister's statement, which we think could actually increase the number of close contacts rather than reduce them.\"\nWelsh Conservative education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones said: \"We can't afford for whole communities to be left behind thanks to a postcode lottery in education provision, and Labour ministers need to show leadership on this issue, and not pass the buck and responsibility for decision-making on to staff and schools that are already under enormous pressure.\"\nPlaid Cymru's Sian Gwenllian it was \"crucial that the government is absolutely transparent with the public and provides a full picture on how quickly the virus is spreading in our classrooms and what measures they are putting in place - such as increased ventilation and vaccinations for young people - to curb the spread.\"\nKeith Maher, head teacher of Pen y Dre High School, Merthyr Tydfil, said while he was looking forward to seeing an easing of restrictions he did not want to do anything that would \"take us back a step\".\nSpeaking before Mr Miles' press conference, he said schools had adapted well to the \"unique experience\" and he was \"quietly satisfied\" with the way it had gone.\nLooking towards the autumn term, he said he wanted to see \"opening up slowly, surely, gradually in a measured way to make sure our children don't miss out on the fun of being young\".\n\"What we are looking for is clarity of information, a shared understanding of what the new term will look like but hopefully moving towards further easing back on risk assessments.\"\nSam, 15, is in Year 10 at Pen y Dre High School and said he did not mind Covid measures if it meant in-person teaching could take place.\n\"We are grateful because online learning wasn't quite one-to-one, but now teachers are making it better to get back to normality so any measure we need to take is fine with me.\"\nHe thought being able to go to school without face masks next term could boost morale but was happy for other measures to stay in place.\nGracie, 12, went up to Year 7 while restrictions were in place which were not required in primary schools.\nShe said she had got used to it - but some measures had made it harder to make friends and children missed out on more practical lessons such as drama.\n\"I really enjoy school at the moment but if it went down to 1m instead of 2m distance I could make more friends and be more comfortable,\" she said."

      "text": "The Scottish government is to lift its ban on non-essential travel between Scotland and parts of north-west England, including Manchester.  \nThe restriction sparked a row between First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham.\nMr Burnham accused Ms Sturgeon of \"hypocrisy\" for imposing the ban without any consultation with him.\nHe also pointed out that parts of Scotland had higher Covid rates than Manchester. \nThe ban on travel between Scotland - which currently has the highest Covid rate of any UK nation - and Manchester came into force on 21 June.\nHowever, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said the measure - and a similar ban on travel to and from Bolton that was announced in May - is to be lifted from midnight on Tuesday after a \"careful review of the data\".\nA ban on non-essential travel to the Blackburn with Darwen local authority area will remain in place for at least another week.\nMr Burnham had accused Ms Sturgeon of \"hypocrisy\" over the \"completely disproportionate\" ban, saying she had failed to engage with concerns about it.\nHe also threatened legal action on behalf of individuals and businesses who were affected.\nMs Sturgeon said she was \"a bit confused\" over the mayor's stance, and suggested his statements were \"part of some position in a Labour leadership contest of the future\".\nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average: \nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nCovid infection numbers have hit a series of new record highs in Scotland over the past week, with more than 3,200 cases being reported on Monday - the highest since the pandemic began.\nScottish government scientists say infections could hit 100,000 per week by mid-July in a worst-case scenario.\nBut Mr Yousaf said there were no plans for additional restrictions to be imposed, with the vaccine programme weakening the link between cases and serious illness.\nHe also insisted the government would \"never allow\" the number of weekly cases to hit 100,000.\nAnnouncing the lifting of the travel restrictions, the health secretary said nobody wanted them to be in place any longer than \"absolutely necessary\".\nHe said: \"Placing restrictions on travel between Scotland and parts of north west England was only taken after extremely careful consideration and analysis of data to help prevent the spread of variants of concern.\n\"Following a careful review of the data we have decided to ease travel arrangements between Scotland and Manchester, Salford and Bolton.\n\"However, the situation regarding Blackburn and Darwen will need to be closely monitored and will be reviewed again in a week's time.\"\nMr Burnham said he had serious concerns about the ban being imposed - but was \"grateful to the first minister and to the Scottish government for listening, and for the decision they have announced today\".\nMs Sturgeon later told a Scottish government Covid briefing that there were two factors in particular which could be behind Scotland's high case rate, beyond temporary causes such as fans travelling to London to watch the Scotland football team earlier this month.\nShe said: \"The Delta variant in England seeded into Bolton first of all. In an English context size-wise Bolton is relatively small.\n\"In Scotland the delta variant first seeded in Glasgow, which is our biggest city, so accounts for a much bigger part of our population - so therefore the Delta variant was possibly able to spread more quickly and more extensively than in England in that early phase.\"\n\"We have, by around 8 to 10 percent, lower population immunity in Scotland than in England and Wales, which may be reflective of the fact fewer of us had the virus in earlier stages.\n\"What that means, while vaccination will be evening this out on a day by day basis, is that right now we have a slightly bigger susceptible population\"."

The last registered Covid death occurred on 5 June.\nIt comes as the number of weekly deaths involving Covid-19 in England increased to 102.\nSo-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, saw 15 deaths below the five-year average for the latest week.\nComparing deaths from all causes with normal years has been regarded as one of the key measures during the pandemic.\nDuring the peak of the pandemic in January, there were 83 deaths involving Covid on a single day. \nIt was 28 March before there was a day without a Covid death occurring in Wales - towards the end of the second wave. There has now been one death occurring over the last 16 days.\nThe total number of deaths involving Covid now stands at 7,899 in Wales. \nThe ONS measure of deaths, which includes deaths in all settings, including people's homes and in hospices, is seen as giving the fullest picture. It includes cases when doctors suspect Covid is a contributory factor as well as those when Covid is the confirmed underlying cause of death. \nWe know already that deaths due to Covid have dropped significantly, with ONS analysis for May showing it had become the 31st leading cause of death in Wales.\nMinisters expect Covid case numbers in Wales to peak in July in the third Covid wave, as health officials watch closely for any rise in hospital numbers.\nBut the latest figures have brought good news.\nThere was only one Covid hospital admission in Wales on Monday, for the first time during the pandemic.\nDaily admissions with confirmed and suspected Covid have been running in mostly single figures since the start of June but this is the lowest point yet, according to figures from Digital Health and Care Wales.\nThe one Covid admission was in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area. Covid admissions across Wales are running at a daily seven-day average of five, also a record low.\nCovid admissions now make up 0.4% of all hospital admissions.\nMeanwhile, looking at hospitalisations, for confirmed, suspected and recovering Covid patients, these too have hit a record low.\nOn Monday, there were 102 Covid patients in hospital beds, while the daily average was 112 - also record lows.\nNumbers in critical care or on ventilation with Covid also remain low - three patients overall, in Cardiff and north Wales.\nTwo-thirds of positive Covid tests involve the under 30s - the target for this latest phase of the vaccination programme.\nSome deaths are still occurring, but far fewer in number, with six occurring in the last month.\nPublic Health Wales, which gives a daily snapshot, involving lab-confirmed cases of Covid, has reported three deaths over the last 14 days - up until Monday.\nAs deaths can take a few weeks to register, these will show up in later ONS figures."

      "text": "The European Union (EU) has agreed to a three-month delay to a ban on some meat products from Great Britain being sold in Northern Ireland.\nThe proposed ban on items like fresh sausages was a consequence of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a Brexit deal between the UK and EU in 2019.\nThe EU and UK agreed to extend a so-called grace period - the time before the ban comes into effect.\nThe new arrangement means the meat ban will be postponed until 30 September. \nThe EU's chief Brexit negotiator, European Commission Vice-President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the EU was \"accommodating\" the UK's request to extend the grace period but was \"not issuing a blank cheque\".\n\"This solution is of a temporary nature, in which strong conditions are attached,\" he added.\n\"This extension will allow stakeholders, and especially supermarkets in Northern Ireland, to continue to adapt their supply chains to the post-Brexit situation - something yet to be completed. \n\"What is equally important, we hope that during these three months, the UK will engage constructively on the broader agreement in the areas of public, animal, and plant health based on alignment with EU rules.\"\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d  added that the EU Commission had put forward \"solutions in a number of other areas\" including the continued supply of medicines and for guide dogs, as well as a decision waiving the need for Northern Ireland motorists to show an insurance green card when driving in EU countries.\nHe said: \"These solutions help to ensure that the application of the protocol impacts as little as possible on the everyday life of communities in Northern Ireland. \n\"They highlight the EU's commitment to - and ability to deliver - solutions that work.\"\nThe EU said it had \"identified a solution to facilitate the movements of guide dogs\" accompanying those travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but details had to be worked out.\nCurrent rules mean assistance dogs are not exempt from paperwork and vaccines needed to bring pets from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\nThe broad agreement was welcomed by the UK's Brexit Minister, Lord Frost, who described it as a \"sensible extension\".\n\"This is a positive first step but we still need to agree a permanent solution - Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom and its consumers should be able to enjoy products they have bought from Great Britain for years,\" he said. \nThe deal was announced on the same day that a High Court judge in Belfast ruled that the Northern Ireland Protocol was lawful.\nThe protocol is the part of the Brexit deal that creates a trade border in the Irish Sea in order to prevent a hardening of the Irish land border.\nIt keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are enforced at its ports.\nIt was agreed by the UK and EU in October 2019 and was subject to further negotiation and agreement in 2020.\nLord Frost helped to negotiate the NI Protocol on behalf of the UK government but previously said it was not being implemented as he intended.\nIn a statement after Wednesday's deal, he said: \"This is a very clear sign that the protocol has to be operated in a pragmatic and proportionate way. \n\"The chilled meats issue is only one of a very large number of problems with the way the protocol is currently operating, and solutions need to be found with the EU to ensure it delivers on its original aims: to protect the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, safeguard Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom, and protect the EU's single market for goods.\"\nThe Labour Party's shadow minister for task force Europe, Baroness Chapman, welcomed the decision but urged Boris Johnson \"not to waste\" the extension.\nIrish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said the extension showed that the EU was delivering solutions to a range of issues raised by the protocol.\n\"I welcome that the EU has responded positively to the UK's request for an extension to the grace period on chilled meats,\" he said. \n\"This co-operative approach recognises that the protocol is jointly owned and must be jointly implemented. The only sustainable solutions are those agreed together. \n\"Today's announcement also ensures continued access to vital medicines in Northern Ireland as well as addressing issues relating to motor insurance green cards, guide dogs and the movement of certain animals.\"\nEarlier, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin said that EU-UK work on resolving differences over the Northern Ireland Protocol was of a \"stop-start nature\".\nSpeaking in the D\u00e1il (Irish Parliament) he said there was goodwill on the issue on the part of EU leaders but that the UK needed to engage.\nThe EU does not generally permit the import of chilled meat products like mince and sausages from non-member states.\nSince January, producers in Great Britain have not been able to sell these products in the EU single market.\nHowever, in December 2020, the EU agreed to a six-month grace period to allow supermarkets in Northern Ireland to re-orientate supply chains away from Great Britain.\nIt is this grace period relating to chilled meats which has now been extended.\nMeanwhile new poll from Queen's University Belfast suggests people in Northern Ireland are evenly split on the protocol.\nAlmost 70% of respondents agreed that Northern Ireland needs 'particular arrangements' for managing the impact of Brexit but they are divided on the protocol itself. \nWhen asked whether the protocol is appropriate for Northern Ireland, 47% agree that it is but 47% disagree. \nSimilarly, 43% think that the protocol is, on balance, good for Northern Ireland, whereas 48% think that it isn't. \nNevertheless, 56% agree that the protocol provides Northern Ireland with a unique set of post-Brexit economic opportunities.\nProfessor Katy Hayward, from Queen's University Belfast and a senior fellow of the UK in a Changing Europe, said: \"People in NI are highly exercised by the Protocol, both for and against - and in equal proportions. \n'The political tensions are compounded by the low levels of trust in the political parties when it comes to the protocol, and by the fact that the Protocol is likely to feature heavily in the next assembly election.\"\nThe online polling was carried out by LucidTalk, surveying a weighted sample of 1,500 adults. It has a margin of error of up to 3%."

      "text": "The government has said it is carrying out a thorough investigation into how classified defence documents were found at a bus stop in Kent.\nDefence minister Jeremy Quin told MPs he was \"very sorry\" it had happened.\nHe said it appeared to be a mistake made by a senior official, and the person's access to sensitive material has been temporarily suspended.\nThe documents - which were handed to the BBC - contained details of HMS Defender and the military.\nThey were found in a soggy heap behind a bus stop in Kent early on Tuesday morning.\nIn a statement to the Commons on Monday, Mr Quin said the documents included a paper that was marked \"secret UK eyes only\".\nHe said the senior government official had contacted his department to report they were missing on Tuesday. \n\"This is a mistake, it appears,\" Mr Quin later added. \"I don't want to prejudge the investigation but it appears it was a mistake made by an individual.\"\n\"I'm very sorry this incident has happened and the investigation will be thorough.\"\nHe added: \"While the investigation is being conducted the individual's access to sensitive material has been suspended.\"\nThe papers have now been given back to the government and are being assessed to check that none are missing, said Mr Quin.\nHe said the investigation will look at the actions of the people involved - including the printing of the papers, how the incident was managed once reported and the underlying processes for printing and carrying papers.\nThe defence minister said he expected the investigation to be completed \"shortly\" - but that he hoped it could be as little as a week.\nAnd asked whether the UK has told its allies, Mr Quin said: \"We have certainly informed the United States.\"\nMr Quin was also asked whether the investigation will consider whether any official secrets laws were broken by the BBC in reporting on the documents.\n\"In an ideal and proper world these documents should not have been available where they were so that's where the original fault clearly lies,\" he replied.\nHe said he would encourage members of the public to hand in such documents to the police.\n\"Although I would have preferred naturally the BBC to have handed them over immediately and not made reference to them, they have a job to do. And I recognise that they have behaved responsibly and they have handed the documents back into the department.\"\nOne MP, Conservative Bob Stewart, had said he was saddened that the BBC published its report rather than pass the documents straight to the police.\nBy Paul Adams, BBC diplomatic correspondent\nMPs are understandably concerned, and in some cases angry, about the loss of such sensitive documents. One even suggested that the senior MoD official responsible for losing them should be made to \"walk the plank\" for putting the country's military personnel at risk.\nIt's clear that the breach was significant. Some of the papers were marked \"secret\" and many were printed on pink paper, indicating the sort of material that should not be removed from the Ministry of Defence except under exceptional circumstances and according to strict procedures. \nThe investigation, led by the Permanent Secretary at the MoD and involving MoD police, will want to establish whether those procedures were followed and, perhaps, whether they need to be changed. \nA former senior government security official told the BBC that taking pink documents out of the MoD was the most \"egregious\" aspect of this whole affair, but also said that with senior officials working under enormous pressure, provision for them to work securely from home ought to be made possible. \nLabour shadow defence secretary, John Healey, asked if there was any danger that espionage may have played a role in the loss of the documents. The minister for defence procurement Jeremy Quin replied that the official had \"self-reported\" as soon as he realise the documents were missing.\nThrough our own reporting, the BBC can say with a high degree of confidence that this is not a story of espionage. \nBut it's still highly concerning. The documents relating to the UK's presence in Afghanistan in the coming months, and how UK forces might work alongside the Americans, are particularly sensitive. The BBC understands the loss has been the subject of frequent conversations with officials in Washington. \nLabour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said the incident of the missing documents was embarrassing for the government and also \"deeply worrying\".\n\"Ministers need to do more to reassure the public and our forces personnel that they have a grip of their department,\" he said.\nMr Healey said this was not the first time sensitive documents had gone missing, citing two other examples this year. The minister replied that earlier breaches had not involved such highly classified material.\nOne set of documents discusses the likely Russian reaction to the passage of British ship HMS Defender through Ukrainian waters off the Crimea coast.\nOn 23 June more than 20 Russian aircraft and two coastguard ships shadowed the warship as it sailed about 12 miles (19km) off Crimea.\nThe documents discovered in Kent confirm that passage through a short stretch of water close to the south-west tip of Crimea was a calculated decision by the British government to make a show of support for Ukraine, despite the possible risks involved. \nAnother of the documents details plans for a possible UK military presence in Afghanistan after the US-led Nato operation there ends."

      "tags": "Mental health,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The coronavirus pandemic has led to concerns about a worsening of mental health across the UK but what's the scale of the problem?\nMental health problems have worsened across all age-groups in the past year.\nIn adults, the proportion of individuals showing symptoms of depression has almost doubled since the start of the pandemic, according to the Office for National Statistics. \nIn the run-up to the first lockdown, roughly 10% of people showed moderate to severe symptoms, compared with 19% in June 2020. \nIn children, 16% of 5-16 year olds have \"probable\" mental health disorders compared with 10.9% in 2017, according to NHS England. \nBoth of these studies are based on surveys which ask individuals questions related to mental health or depressive symptoms. \nDue to the nature of mental health problems recording is difficult, but this form of survey provides the best estimates and allows for consistent comparison over time. \nCoronavirus has fuelled feelings of loneliness, anxiety and fears for the future for many people. \nAccording to the ONS, people with depressive symptoms were more likely to feel that their finances were being impacted, as well as access to care and essential goods. \nThey also were more likely to feel like their personal relationships were being impacted by the virus. \nChildren with mental health problems were more than twice as likely to live in a household that had fallen behind with payments, according to NHS England.\nThey were also more likely to feel as if their lives had been made worse by lockdown. \nCoronavirus has had an impact on the amount of people using publicly funded mental health service. \nThis is part of a broader trend across the whole of the NHS. \nOn an average month, the NHS talking therapies service can expect to receive about 150,000 referrals for treatment of common mental health problems such as depression or anxiety. \nHowever, this dropped as low as 60,000 in April 2020. \nThis slowly returned back to normal over the summer, but it is unclear how the second and third lockdowns may have impacted it. \nAccess to children's and teenage mental health services also saw a dip in referrals and access to treatment over the first lockdown, according to analysis by the Children's Commissioner. \nThere has been a sharp increase in referrals since then, but the increases have not been matched with similar increases in children actually accessing the services.\nPart of these declines could be down to a big decrease in GP appointments or children not being at schools, which are often the referral point for new patients.\nThe NHS has managed to ensure that those people who have been referred for talking therapies have been able to receive the treatment within target. \nThis means 95% of people are receiving treatment within 18 weeks. \nMany mental health services already had the option to do therapy remotely meaning they could adapt quickly and get new patients started. \nIn the most recent two lockdowns, group therapy has also been considered a \"reasonable excuse\" to leave the home.\nThere isn't enough data available to check if targets for access to children's mental health are being met. \nIt's too early to say. \nThis is because the process for registering these kinds of deaths takes substantially more time than deaths from natural causes. \nEarly research from the University of Manchester doesn't show any major increases. \nHowever, they say that the longer-term impacts of a future economic downturn could have an impact and that some areas could end up seeing higher figures.

      "text": "As Covid-19 restrictions are set to ease again in Wales, what steps have led us to this point?\nOutdoor concerts, festivals and sporting events can resume from Monday, the first minister has confirmed.\nIt comes as the Welsh Government pushes for more people to get vaccinated.\nPolicy-makers and health officials have been looking at key measures in making decisions. Here is some of the data that have taken us to this point in the road out of lockdown.\nIf you go back to the days before Wales went into lockdown last December, Covid cases were peaking at 2,864 positive tests a day.\nThe average is now 36 positive tests a day.\nAll council areas have been below the key 50 cases per 100,000 threshold for two months.\nThousands of people are still being tested every week - including routinely in care homes and hospitals - but the proportion of tests coming back positive has been 1% or less for a month.\nThe key indicator is this positivity rate to be below 5%.\nYou can see in the video above how clusters and local spikes can still happen, even with cases low, but compared with the winter, the impact of the vaccination programme is clear.\nA quiet word of caution could be heard on Friday though. There are \"early signs\" of an increase in Covid infections in Wales, according to the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) weekly swab survey.\nIt estimates that 2,900 people in Wales had Covid in the week ending 29 May.\nThat's still only around one in 1,050 people or 0.10% of the population.\nLast week, the estimate was 800 or one in 3,850 people - 0.03% - the lowest figure yet. \nThe ONS has been taking swab tests from thousands of people in Wales every week since the summer, to estimate the level of infections. It catches people who may have Covid-19 but do not realise it.\nWell over three quarters of people in Wales are now estimated to have antibodies against Covid-19.\nThe level of protection, from people who have either had the virus or a vaccination against it, has been the main weapon in the fight against Covid.\nImportantly, 90% in those more vulnerable age groups - as the second doses of vaccines kick in - have antibodies, according to the most recent survey by the ONS.\nThe Welsh government has said it is ahead in its commitment to offer every adult a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine by the end of July and it remains a priority, \nThe challenge now for Wales - leading the world on first doses of the population - is to continue its push on second doses.\nTwo thirds of those aged in their early 60s have had two doses and the programme is now working through those in their 50s.\nThe UK nations have roughly converged on the proportions of people fully vaccinated, with Wales just behind Scotland and England.\nWales, as well as leading global figures for the proportion of first doses, is also still in the current \"top 10\" in the world for second doses of vaccinations too.\nMark Drakeford has said health boards have the ability to \"speed up\" second doses if needed to combat local clusters, especially given the presence of the Delta/India variant. \nAnd with the majority of the 54 cases found in current Conwy cluster among people not vaccinated, there will a concern to continue getting the message across to those who have not taken it up.\nThere has been a close eye on numbers of Covid cases in hospital.\nAdmissions to hospitals of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases have hit a record low point - a daily average of eight across the last seven days.\nThere were only two confirmed and suspected Covid patients admitted on Thursday - in Cardiff and Vale and Betsi Cadwaladr - another record low during the pandemic. \nCwm Taf on Monday had its first Covid admission in a month but none since.\nThere will be an even closer watch on the progress of the Delta variant and if this starts to translate into patients through hospital doors in the days to come, with the body representing Welsh health boards reminding people of the \"importance of sticking to the rules\".\nThe number of confirmed cases was 16 across all Welsh hospitals on Thursday, which is up on last week's record low, but still 99% fewer patients than we saw during the peak in early January.\nCovid-19 patients - including those suspected and recovering - made up 1.5% of all patients in hospital on 3 June. The proportion reached 36% before Christmas.\nThere were also only two Covid patients in critical care, according to the Digital Health and Care Wales figures.\nThe toll on families from the many deaths in the pandemic cannot be forgotten.\nThe second wave in particular brought more than 4,800 Covid deaths in Wales, over the winter.\nBut the fall since has been pronounced, as the vaccination programme kicked in.\nIn the most recent week, there were no Covid deaths in 15 out of Wales' local authority areas and only seven altogether, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nDeaths from all causes have also been below average for 11 out of the last 12 weeks.\nFigures have plummeted in care homes, with no deaths recorded in the latest week and vaccinations having a real impact on cases too - with positive results coming back at nearly one in 1,000 in the routine testing programme.\nThe snapshot daily figures from Public Health Wales have also not reported a Covid death for nine days in a row, which we've not seen before.\nAnother positive after a long period of so many grim statistics."

It was terrifying. It's just horrific. \n\"There are huge gouges out of the road. We rang 999 but the emergency services couldn't get to us.\n\"We just didn't expect this to happen. I bought a house on a hill not to get flooded but there was raging river water.\"\nShe added: \"We have no road so we can't get in or out. There is tarmac and rubble piled up in mangled messes that I can't believe. \n\"The furniture is wet and we've taken the carpets and rugs out. It's devastation.\n\"The floors are all up, there's soggy carpet, but we're safe.\"  \nIsobel Loader, from Forton, said she had not realised how much the water had risen and was alerted by a neighbour.\n\"We were quietly watching television and suddenly the neighbours came in and said 'do you realise what's going on' and there was water right up to our steps at the back and all in the garage in the front,\" she said.\nA flood warning remains in place on the River Isle from Chard Reservoir to Hambridge and drivers should be cautious as some local roads remain impassable, Somerset County Council said.  \nMayor of Chard Jason Baker described the flooding as \"quite phenomenal\".\nHe added: \"It wasn't what we were expecting, it was far far worse. I haven't known it like this for 15-odd years.\"\nStuart Mackie, 35, who lives near Axminster, said initially he thought a tap had been left on after hearing a dripping sound.\n\"We then looked out of the window and all we could see was this huge torrent of water coming down the hill,\" he said.\n\"We rushed and saw the water pouring into the house and rescued what we could off of the floor.\n\"It was a flash flood that came from nowhere really. It was surprising because we hardly had any rain all day, it was relatively dry.\nThe bottom floor of his home has been flooded as the water was knee deep, he added.\n\"We were out with brooms to get the water out last night so we've got the worst of it out and we've left it now for insurers to take a look.\"\nThe water has since receded to about ankle deep in his cottage, he said.\nThe council said its teams worked overnight to deal with the damage.\nJim Everard, the chairman of Winsham Parish Council, said he had been part of a team that tried to prevent flooding in his area.\n\"There was a team of about 20 or 30 villagers for two or three hours, sandbagging, putting up scaffold boards, using brooms, doing anything we could do to stop the water getting in,\" he said.\nJohn Woodman, Somerset County Council's cabinet member for highways and transport, said: \"Teams from the emergency services, Somerset County Council and South Somerset District Council - not to mention volunteers and the community - did an incredible job and we will now assess the damage and make any repairs as quickly as we can.\" \nThe council said all main routes are now clear of flooding.\nA help and information centre has been set up for anyone affected at Chard's Guildhall.

      "tags": "Schools,Children,Department for Education,Primary education,Secondary education,Leeds,Young people,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Covid control system in England's schools, where groups of pupils have to self-isolate if one tests positive, could be scrapped in the autumn. \nMinisters are looking at asking secondary schools to introduce daily testing instead. \nThe latest figures show that in England, 279,000 children were self-isolating having potentially been in contact with a positive case in school. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid has pledged to address the issue.\nFrustration among parents and teachers is building over the disruption because a rising number of children and their households currently have to quarantine.\nThe Department for Education said that in order to keep as many children in face-to-face classes as possible, it has written to secondary schools asking them provisionally to prepare for a change after the summer break.\nEngland's Children's Commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza said there was an urgent need for children to get back to normal as lockdown restrictions had been a \"real trauma\" for many young people.\nGrouping pupils into bubbles - often made up of their year group or form which has to quarantine when one child tests positive for Covid - should end as soon as possible, she told the Daily Telegraph.\nAsked about the self-isolation policy in the Commons on Monday, Mr Javid said it was \"having a huge knock-on impact\" on children's education.\nSteve Chalke, founder of the academies group Oasis Schools, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that 10% of his pupils - about 3,000 children - were currently off due to Covid, adding it was a \"pretty alarming situation and we would say that something needs to be done about this now\".\nSchools minister Nick Gibb told the BBC the government had brought in \"important measures to help us deal with this pandemic\".\nBut he said ministers would be looking at the data from an on-site testing pilot taking place at some secondary schools and colleges before making a decision on whether there is an \"effective alternative to self-isolation\". \nHe said the trials involved \"daily contact testing, where somebody who has come into contact with somebody with Covid, instead of self-isolating, takes a test every day, and if they are negative they can go into school\".\nThe testing pilot will end on Wednesday. \nOfficial figures for 24 June show that more than 375,000 primary and secondary pupils in England were out of school for Covid-related reasons - an increase of more than 100,000 in a week. \nThere were also absences because of suspected contacts in the wider community and 24,000 possible infections among students themselves.\nMinisters are not expected to make a final decision on self isolation until the results have been examined. But there is a recognition that any change must be announced before the end of term, so it can be implemented after the summer break.\nIt is unclear whether any future testing would involve primary-age pupils, who to date have not been participating in the government's Covid testing programmes at schools.\nLike almost all responses to Covid, automatic self-isolation for pupils who come into close contact with an infected case has both costs and benefits.\nWhen it was established in September it was considered vital to control cases and save lives.\nBut now vaccines offer the most vulnerable very good protection the benefits of the policy have been reduced.\nMeanwhile, the costs have increased because greater numbers are being asked to self-isolate because we are more comfortable about letting Covid spread.\nThat's why many, from child health experts to teaching unions, are beginning to question the approach. The costs seem disproportionate to the benefits.\nBut the problem is that it's not clear what it can be replaced with. Rapid testing is being trialled in some secondary schools as an alternative to self-isolation, but we already know these tests have their limitations in terms of being able to spot infection.\nVaccinating children remains an option, but one that government advisers have yet to give the green light to. It is said to be a finely-balanced decision.\nIt is about finding the least worst option - and that is a very difficult task.\nThe policy, which sees children sent home for 10 days if they are classed as a close contact of a confirmed case, was established last September - well before the vaccines were rolled out.\nCurrently, for every one confirmed case there are about 20 pupils isolating at home as a precaution.\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it was vital the disruption of the past year was brought to an end \"as a matter of urgency\".\nKevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said any changes needed \"consideration of the logistical challenge facing schools and colleges\".\nHe added: \"We should hope for the best - that vaccination of adults solves the problem - but plan for the worst, considering the options around mass testing, vaccination of secondary students, and improvements in ventilation for example.\" \nChris Dyson, head teacher at Parklands Primary school in Leeds, agreed, saying it was having a damaging effect on the children at his school.\nHe has recently had to shut one Year 5 class bubble of nine to 10-year-olds because of a positive case.\nThe children, who will miss extra summer activities like swimming and archery, are \"devastated to be at home\", he said.\nThe Scottish government is reviewing its approach to self-isolation for school children, who return to lessons in August. \nIn Wales, the education minister has said he is looking at best practice to ensure the number of pupils isolating is not disproportionate.\nReporting by Philippa Roxby, Nick Triggle and Alex Kleiderman"

      "text": "Residents of a Florida apartment building that collapsed last week received a letter in April warning of worsening structural damage.\nThe letter, obtained and reported by US media, was sent by the president of the apartment block's building association.\nIt said damage that was first reported in 2018 had \"gotten significantly worse\" and would soon \"begin to multiply\" without immediate repairs.\nAt least 12 people were killed and 149 more are still missing in the collapse.\nThe letter is the latest in a string of documents that have emerged providing evidence that the Champlain Towers South building in Surfside, north of Miami, had known structural issues.\nLawsuits are already being filed over the deadly disaster, with the latest accusing the building association of \"reckless and negligent conduct\".\nThe April letter, sent by the president of the Champlain Towers South Condominium Association, said that \"observable damage\" had gotten \"significantly worse\" and warned that \"concrete deterioration is accelerating\". \nThe letter also warned about roof damage, and estimated that fixing the building's problems would cost about $15m (\u00a310.8m)\nIt follows reports about findings from a 2018 inspection that urged timely repairs after \"major structural damage\" was found, including  \"abundant cracking\" in an underground parking garage. \nQuestions over the collapse are mounting at the same time as a desperate search operation continues.\nDozens remain missing in the rubble of the 12-floor apartment building, which partially collapsed in the early hours of Thursday as scores of residents slept. \nOfficials insisted on Tuesday that the operation remains a search and rescue one. \"Nobody is giving up hope here. Nobody is stopping. The work goes on. Full force,\" Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said.\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis said: \"When somebody's missing in action in the military, you're missing until you're found and we don't stop the search, so I think that's what's happening.\"\nHundreds of emergency responders, including experts from as far away as Mexico and Israel, are assisting with the operation. \nOfficials say rescuers are removing debris \"piece by piece\" and using scanners, cranes and dogs to try and find anyone that may still be alive. \nMiami-Dade Fire Chief Alan Cominsky said some 3,000,000lb (1,360,000kg) of concrete had already been removed.\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to visit the building collapse later this week along with First Lady Jill Biden.\nThe president will thank emergency services and meet with families impacted by the \"terrible tragedy\", the White House said."

      "title": "Covid-19 in the UK: How many coronavirus cases are there in my area?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "tags": "Deafness and hearing-impairment,Depression,Disability,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Thousands of deaf and disabled people across the UK have told the BBC of the devastating impact the pandemic has had on their lives.\nMost said their disability had worsened and more than 2,400 said routine, often vital, medical appointments had been cancelled.\nMore than 3,300 people took part in the research carried out by the BBC.\nDisability charity Scope said the findings confirmed that disabled people's needs \"had been forgotten\".\nThe findings paint, for the first time, a comprehensive picture of a hidden fallout of Covid-19.\nNearly 100 more disabled people also contacted the BBC wanting to share their stories. Many of them had experienced huge physical and mental decline since March 2020. \nThere were young people with autism who had attempted suicide because they could no longer cope with drastic changes, others were isolated and alone, their support networks gone or hours of care cut.\nAccess to healthcare was a huge issue - one woman was told not to go to hospital if she contracted Covid as this might put her more at risk.\nA family told how care had been almost stopped for their disabled daughter, while her father, who had had Covid, was offered a range of treatments.\nFourteen-year-old Josselin has a rare genetic condition, which means she has hearing loss, a vision impairment, can't walk or talk and is fed through a tube.\nHer family, who live in Wiltshire, have a vital network of services they rely on to keep her well - physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, respite care. All of that stopped in March 2020.\n\"Josselin really struggled. She just shutdown,\" says her mother Karen Tilley. \"I never thought [she] would suffer from depression like that.\n\"After about a month she started pulling her hair out and picking at her skin, she had cuts all over her arms.\"\nJosselin was prescribed anti-depressants and anti-psychotic medication. She was also given prescription drugs like diazepam to cope with the pain she was having in her hips and her spine because of a lack of physiotherapy.\n \"Suddenly she was put on all these new medications. There was just no support for us at all - it was horrendous.\"\nAt the beginning of this year, Josselin's dad Lee, 43, caught Covid-19. He spent five weeks on a ventilator in intensive care.\nLee is back home making small and slow steps to, the family hope, a full recovery. But the difference between the support he is offered and the treatment his daughter receives is stark.\nHis calendar is full of medical appointments. He has an occupational therapist, a physiotherapist, and he has been sent equipment to help him regain his mobility.\nBut for Josselin, her cochlear implant, which needs retuning every few months, has not been checked for nearly two years. Her last eye test was over the phone, she's not had any face-to-face physiotherapy since March 2020, and her walking frame no longer fits.\n\"It feels like it's because she's disabled so it's not worth bothering with,\" says Karen. \"She's not ever going to walk and talk so they just don't bother with her.\"\nAll the people we have spent time with over the past few months have shared their own, heart-breaking stories. Considering everything they have had thrown at them this past year, they have managed to get through it the best they can, almost entirely on their own. \nBut what really hit me is that none of them kept a \"who had it worse during Covid\" scorecard. \nYes, they all pretty much described themselves in one way or another as \"the forgotten ones\", but they were all incredibly measured and understanding of the fact that the pandemic has touched us all in very different ways, disabled or not. \nFreelance journalist Raya Al Jadir, 43, uses a ventilator. She was told by her specialist doctors that if she caught Covid-19, she should not go to hospital because the level of care she would need could not be guaranteed.\nShe was also warned that it was unlikely that she would be considered for life support.\n\"It made me feel alone and isolated. If I did end up in hospital and I was really sick - who was going to fight for me?\"\nRaya was one of the hundreds of disabled people who told the BBC that they would avoid going to hospital during the pandemic.\nFrom March 2020 to May 2021, Raya did not leave her house for fear of catching Covid. \nShielding may have officially ended but there are still many disabled people living an isolated existence. Nearly 2,000 told the BBC that they had left their house on only a few occasions since the start of the pandemic, with almost 250 saying they had not ventured outside since March 2020.\nAt the end of May, Raya finally left her London flat.\n\"Breathing the air, seeing the clouds made me feel part of the world again.\n\"As a disabled person, I feel like the weakest link in society. And now, because of Covid-19, no-one knows what to do with the weakest link.\n\"I don't think my life will ever return to what it was before March 2020.\"\nOne of the biggest disability charities in the UK, Scope, has said the BBC's findings \"confirm the government's failure to provide support for disabled people throughout the pandemic.\"\n\"Millions spent months shielding, having to battle for basic support like healthcare, supermarket deliveries, financial support and social care,\" said James Taylor, executive director at disability equality charity Scope. \"Horrifying reports of DNRs [do-not-resuscitate orders] being placed on people without their consent left many fearing they'd not get treatment if they caught the virus. \nThe government \"must take bold action now to put disabled people at the heart of the recovery, and end the growing inequality\".\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said it recognised the pandemic has been \"incredibly difficult\" for disabled people.\n\"Among other support, we have invested \u00a32.4m to help charities offer vital projects to improve disabled people's physical and mental wellbeing.\n\"The government has provided a range of help for disabled people throughout this period and through our forthcoming National Disability Strategy we are going to go even further in addressing issues that disabled people say affect them the most.\"\nInformation and support: If you or someone you know needs support for issues about emotional distress, these organisations may be able to help."

      "tags": "Greater Manchester Police,Manchester",
      "text": "\"I wouldn't feel confident reporting a crime to my own police force.\"\nThese are the words of a serving Greater Manchester Police (GMP) officer who has chosen to speak to BBC Newsnight to allege serious failings within England's second largest force.\nA number of officers, past and present, have also come forward to voice similar concerns. \nIn December, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) found GMP failed to record about 80,000 crimes in a 12-month period and closed cases without proper investigation.\nFormer chief constable Ian Hopkins resigned after the force was placed in special measures, and successor Stephen Watson told a recent press conference vital improvements would be made rapidly. \n\"That is not to say GMP is a failing force,\" he said. \"It is a force comprised of many thousands [of] genuinely hard-working, committed, brave, talented, professional people.\"\nFormer GMP officer Scott Winters said he could not wait to leave the force in 2017 after 28 years of service. \nIn 2015, he took the force to an employment tribunal, later reaching an out-of-court settlement. \nHe claimed the force he loved working for had become one that put its reputation ahead of tackling problems. \nMr Winters described the police watchdog's findings as \"dire\", \"unforgivable\" and \"abysmal\".\nAnd it is the public who suffer as a result, he said, with victims being let down.\n\"They are a victim of crime and they've not either had the crime recorded [or] a chance of the perpetrators being brought to justice and punished,\" Mr Winters said. \nSome serving police officers say the situation within GMP has not improved, either.\nOne, who asked to remain anonymous, told Newsnight that criminals \"are luckier now\" as they are \"literally walking the streets [and] not being arrested\".\nAlmost two years ago, Patricia (not her real name) walked into Rochdale police station with her daughter who had finally found the courage to report allegations that a man had groomed and raped her.\nHer daughter had been so desperate that she had twice tried to take her own life.\n\"We went in and the detective we spoke to already had a pile of papers on his desk and a photograph,\" said Patricia.\n\"He asked us 'is this the man in question?' and we said 'yes' and he said 'yeah, we know a lot of stuff about this man'. \n\"So I just thought: 'Brilliant, they already know who he is so it will be dealt with really, really well'.\n\"My daughter gave a really lucid account, and at one point I had to leave the room because I couldn't hear what had happened, what he had done. I just couldn't bear it.\"\nBut her daughter would then have to go on to retell the distressing account again. Since making the report, four different officers have been in charge of the case.\nThe phone her daughter handed in as evidence also temporarily went missing. \n\"To me they are absolutely incompetent, there's no other word to sum them up,\" Patricia said.\n\"What this man did has ruined probably the best years of her life,\" said Patricia. \n\"It's given her such bad anxiety that she's on antidepressants. Maximum dose. She can't sleep. She's just not the girl she used to be. \n\"He's caused all that and he's still out there. He's not even been arrested.\"\nThe family are being supported by the Maggie Oliver Foundation for victims of sexual violence after not receiving the response they expected from the police. \nMany have pointed to GMP's new computer system, which went live two years ago, as the catalyst of some of the failings. \nCalled the Integrated Operational Policing System (iOPS), it has been dubbed iFLOPS by many insiders.\nUntil last year, Paul Bailey was a GMP detective working on major incidents. He remembers the frustrations of using iOPS.\n\"It felt like it had been designed by someone who had never been a police officer and never worked on the streets,\" he said. \n\"A simple example is if there was intelligence regarding firearms at an address or premises and officers were sent to that address and didn't know that, then maybe the outcome could be a poor one for everyone involved.\"\nThe radio panic buttons linked to the system have also been a cause for concern, as Mr Bailey discovered when a colleague pressed it by accident during a shift.\nThe system should have located their car but it failed, he said.\n\"We could have been dying in a ditch and no-one would have known about it,\" he said.\nWith mounting concerns about public protection, the HMICFRS reviewed iOPS and published its findings in March 2020. \nA catalogue of serious issues was identified.\nBut, 15 months on, some serving police officers say the system is still not fit for purpose.\n\"You could be dealing with gangster number one in Salford - major organised crime gang players - and there's a black hole where the recent intelligence should be,\" one told the BBC.\nGail Hadfield Grainger, whose partner Anthony Grainger was killed in a botched GMP firearms operation, said \"it just seems like one failure after another\".\nMr Grainger, from Bolton, was shot through the windscreen of a stolen Audi in a car park in Warrington in 2012. He was unarmed at the time. \nA public inquiry found a \"catastrophic series of failings and errors\" including inaccurate information given to firearms officers. \n\"Anthony lost his life. The intelligence system was flawed [and] GMP were ordered by the judge to ensure that this doesn't happen again,\" Ms Hadfield Grainger said.\n\"I think these are serious, systemic changes that need to be changed from the root of the problem. I don't think this is a quick fix.\"\nIn a statement, Chief Constable Watson acknowledged that part of the iOPS system had \"presented significant challenges\" to GMP but it was under review and upgrades and improvements had been made. \nHe said the force \"remains absolutely committed to protecting children, young people and all vulnerable people in our community. \n\"Some of the historic investigations, by their very nature are distressing, time-consuming and present multiple and complex difficulties for all involved and affected by the case.  \n\"We are nonetheless determined to conclude our investigations thoroughly and to the evidential standards required to bring offenders to justice,\" he said. \nYou can hear more on Gail Hadfield Grainger's story in the documentary One Night in March on BBC Sounds and watch the Newsnight episode on iPlayer.

      "tags": "Mobile phones",
      "text": "Olivia Colman, John Nettles and Joanne Harris are among dozens of high-profile artists calling for a portion of gadget sales revenue in the UK to go into a fund for performers and creators.\nIn a letter in Tuesday's Times newspaper, they claim a centralised \"Smart Fund\" could generate up to \u00a3300m per year for the UK's creative sector.\nThe levy would be between 1% and 3% of the overall price of a device.\nHowever, critics say it would amount to \"a new tax\" on consumers.\nIt would apply to everything that can \"store and download creative content\".\nThis includes laptops, PCs and smartphones, said a group of artist industry organisations behind the idea.\nThere are no official proposals for such a scheme, but the artist Yinka Shonibare described it as \"a no-brainer\".\n\"Currently there isn't any effective way for creators to be recompensed when their work is downloaded and stored by audiences,\" he said.\nHowever, Tech UK, a network for the country's tech sector, said it sounded like a \"new tax\" on consumers. \n\"It is an arbitrary tax on consumers that is hugely bureaucratic to manage, and with no transparency on how funds are disbursed and spent,\" said a spokeswoman.\n\"Shoppers buying a new phone or laptop might have a lot of questions about why they should have to pay such additional charges, when they already pay a significant amount of VAT.\" \nThose of us who were around in the 1980s will remember the slogan \"Home Taping Is Killing Music\", used by the British record industry in a long-running campaign against what it regarded as piracy, and in favour of a levy on cassette tapes. \nThis latest campaign for a Smart Fund is more subtle, making no mention of piracy, and suggesting that artists, tech companies and government can unite around the idea of a simple one-off levy on gadgets to support the creative industries. \n\"We're just about the only country in the world that doesn't have some kind of private copying remuneration scheme,\" said one proponent of the idea.\nWith the tech companies not exactly popular and the government keen to find some easy way of helping the arts, the idea may find more political weight behind it this time. \nBut the tech industry will lobby hard to convince ministers that this is just the kind of bureaucratic European scheme that the UK is now free to ignore."

      "text": "More than a quarter of a million children are absent from school in the UK because of coronavirus, prompting calls for a different approach to testing and quarantining of pupils that puts children's needs first.\nWith children at extremely low risk from the virus and more than three out of every five UK adults now fully vaccinated, is it time for a change in policy?\nOver the past week, in England alone, absences due to Covid have nearly trebled - with more than 170,000 pupils self-isolating as close contacts, most in secondary schools.\nAccording to Dr Michael Absoud, from King's College London, missing school will have a detrimental effect on children's mental and physical development, particularly those with learning disabilities or from poorer families.\nThe most vulnerable have missed out on much-needed support and socialising, as well as their education, which has \"set them back hugely\", he says.\n\"We are at a different stage in the epidemic now - there needs to be an alternative to isolating contacts of positive cases,\" Dr Absoud adds.\nChildren's mental-health experts have long campaigned for the harmful knock-on effects of the pandemic to be recognised. \nThis is even more critical now, they stress, when the most vulnerable have been vaccinated and lives are returning to normal.\nParents are also expressing their anger and frustration on social media, saying families' plans are being disrupted and children are missing out on sports days, exams, end-of-term events and trips.\n\"Children must be the most isolated and tested group,\" secondary-school parent Liz Cole, co-founder of campaign group UsForThem, says.\n\"Where is the roadmap for children's lives?\" \nAs the Delta variant, first identified in India, pushes up the case numbers, young adults and school-age children are seeing the sharpest increases - because they are, broadly, the least vaccinated groups.\nRegular rapid testing of schoolchildren means asymptomatic cases, more likely in children, can be detected early to reduce spread. \nBut this often results in whole classes or year groups having to self-isolate too, particularly in areas with high case rates.\nMany scientists say there is no easy way to resolve this issue when cases of the virus are rising and more than one out of every three adults has yet to have two doses of the vaccine.\n\"You can't ignore Covid completely and we don't know yet whether frequent daily testing is as effective as isolating whole classes,\" Dr Damian Roland, paediatrician and honorary associate professor at the University of Leicester, says. \n\"So we are stuck trying to keep children at school but also avoiding unnecessary spread.\" \nThe latest official figures, for 17 June, show, in England alone, 2.7% of primary and 4.2% of secondary schoolchildren are absent because of Covid. \nThat includes;\nIn Scotland, 20,700 pupils are not in school for Covid-related reasons, with 17,800 of those self-isolating. Two primary schools are closed and several others at risk of closure.\nAnd if a pupil has symptoms, tests positive or is a close contact of someone who does, they must stay at home for 10 days. \nA government-led trial is under way to work out whether the daily testing of pupils who are close contacts is a better option than self-isolation - but that will come too late for this school year.\nIn the meantime, schools with positive cases report them to the Department for Education and contact their local authority's public health team for advice.\nMany say the current approach is the right one because it cuts the risks of airborne transmission in schools, which tend to be poorly ventilated and where masks are no longer mandatory.\n\"Children can get infected and shed virus at even higher viral loads for even longer than adults,\" consultant virologist Dr Julian Tang says.\nAnd asymptomatic cases can cause more infections because they often remain undetected.\nBut health officials say spread of the virus in schools has always been low and there is no evidence schools are causing outbreaks. Instead, they appear to be reflecting levels of the virus in their local communities.\nData from the government-led trial, in 200 schools and colleges, should answer the question of how many close contacts of infected children actually become infected themselves - and give ministers some idea of how rules could change in the future. \nThe ultimate goal is to keep schools and colleges open and prevent children's education from being disrupted, while also reducing the risk of community spread."

      "text": "Almost a year ago, shop owner Amit Puntambekar, 28, found himself stuck between two customers, trying to stop one from hitting the other.\nThe row had started outside his village store but carried on inside, ending in the older, taller, customer punching the teenage target of his anger.\nMr Puntambekar managed to evict the aggressor and help the younger man, promising to report it to the police.\nHe did so - but nearly 12 months later, nothing has happened.  \nMr Puntambekar is one of thousands of shop owners and workers who feel they are being let down by the police, according to a new report on violence against retailers by the Home Affairs Committee.\nThe report has found that violence against retail employees has escalated over the past five years, increasing further through the pandemic. \nOnly essential retailers have been allowed to stay open during periods of lockdown, but both small and larger firms gave evidence to the committee, detailing extensive verbal and physical abuse.\nSupermarkets Morrisons and Sainsbury's told MPs their staff had been threatened with knives, firearms and even syringes.\nThe Home Affairs Committee is now asking the government to consult on a standalone law that would make it a criminal offence to assault retail workers in England and Wales.\nIt said that the problem is \"becoming endemic in British society and the policing response is failing to match the scale of the problem\".\nIt cites a survey of shop workers conducted by the Association of Convenience Stores, which found that only one in five who reported incidents \"were satisfied with the response from the police\".\n\"When the police fail to attend or follow-up serious incidents, it undermines trust and confidence in them, discourages reporting, and weakens the deterrent for repeat offenders,\" the report said.\nAssistant commissioner Alistair Sutherland, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for business crime, said: \"Individual forces will have different tactics available to them and will use crime prevention initiatives most suited to the issues they are facing. \n\"We take reports of all types of retail crime very seriously, particularly those involving violence, and will seek to prosecute anyone who breaks the law in this regard.\"\nHe added: \"We recognise however, that there is more that we must do to encourage reporting and provide a better service and assurance to victims.\"\nCrime and policing minister Kit Malthouse, said the government is putting 20,000 extra police officers into communities to cut crime, \"including retail crime\". \nHe added: \"The Sentencing Council has set out guidelines that mean courts should be increasing sentences for assaults committed against those providing a service to the public, including shop workers.\"\nIt is an issue that Mr Puntambekar is all too aware of: \"We phoned the police. We had all the incident, we had the customer's licence plate. I spent hours with the police tracking what direction he was coming from.\"\n\"I sent them all the video evidence and nothing has ever happened.\"\nUnfortunately, the parents of the young man who was assaulted now blame Mr Puntambekar.\nHe said: \"I thought everything had proceeded fine [but] the parents no longer shop with us because they blame me for the incident and blame me for not following it up.\"\nIt has been compounded by the fact that Mr Puntambekar is not allowed to show the parents the CCTV video of what happened to their son, because of General Data Protection Regulation rules.\n\"So the parents, to this day, do not know what has happened to this poor lad because I can't legally show them the footage,\" he said.\nThe pandemic has exacerbated the problems that retailers are facing - industry group the British Retail Consortium says the number of violent incidents or abuse against shop workers between 2019 to 2020 rose by 7% to 455 attacks a day, compared to 424 a day during 2018 to 2019.\nAt one point in the winter, Mr Puntambekar said his shop was losing between \u00a3300 to \u00a3400 a week due to theft. \n\"The police view it as a 'soft crime' because when a theft happens there is no penalty to the state or the government,\" he said. \"We will end up paying the liability for it.\"\nAs a shopkeeper, he says \"you accept there is always going to be a level of shrinkage of theft\", adding that \"there's not many other businesses where you think \"we going to lose \u00a35,000 or \u00a310,000 a year\".\nThe National Federation of Retail Newsagents told the inquiry that they thought a \"strong police response\" to simple shop theft \"might serve to stop future, more serious incidents, but it is here that the police response is weakest\". \nMarks and Spencer added that local police have \"struggled to respond to reports of assaults\" in their shops. \nThe company told the committee that as a result \"colleagues have become less inclined to report assaults to the police, as they believe that there is 'no point' when it is likely no action will follow\".  \nThe report also suggests it is \"surprising that there is no mandatory process for recording crimes against retail workers as a specific group\" within police force crime statistics and that there is a \"much needed\" drive for data on incidents. \nThe Home Affairs Committee is seeking a new standalone criminal offence that protects retail workers from violence and abuse in England and Wales - similar to that already passed by the Scottish government.\n\"A standalone offence for assault on emergency workers has produced promising early results in increasing prosecutions,\" said Home Affairs Committee chair Yvette Cooper.\n\"Violence and abuse towards shop workers must be treated with the same seriousness and those workers must be afforded similar protection in law.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Greater Manchester's Covid death rate has been 25% higher than the rest of England during the pandemic, new research has found.\nThe study into the impact of the virus in the region also said life expectancy in north-west England declined more during 2020 than in England overall.\nThe report says health inequalities in Greater Manchester have been exposed and amplified by the pandemic.\nIt calls for more resources directed at education, employment and housing.\nThe report was originally commissioned in 2019 by the Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership - the devolved health body responsible for health across the city region. \nIt asked one of the world's leading experts on health inequalities, Prof Sir Michael Marmot, to look at how it could improve the health of Manchester's population.\nBut the pandemic led to a change in emphasis, meaning today's report looks at the toll the virus has taken across the area. \nIt found the city had a 25% higher Covid-19 death rate than England as a whole in the 13 months to March 2021. \nGreater Manchester had the third highest Covid death rate of the areas studied in the report, behind the West Midlands and Greater London. \nThat high death rate contributed to a decline in life expectancy in the wider North West that was larger than the average in England, it said.\nLife expectancy in the North West fell in 2020 by 1.6 years for men and 1.2 years for women compared with an average in England of 1.3 years and 0.9 years respectively. \nIn the garden of their family home in Oldham, Gary Gilmartin's sisters Jayne Risby and Debbie Phillips are still coming to terms with the death of their brother.\n\"He was just really special, a really special person. I'd say out of all the family he was the real character,\" says Jayne of her brother.\nGary fell ill after a family holiday to Spain in March of 2020, just as the pandemic was taking off.\nThree weeks after dancing and singing karaoke with his sisters in Benidorm, Gary was dead.\nA dedicated Manchester City fan, Jayne says her brother was hugely popular. \n\"He was just a massive Mancunian, a lot of people in Manchester just absolutely loved him.\" \nAnd Jayne says the whole family - Gary was one of five siblings - is struggling with grief.\n\"The loss of him affects us now for the rest of our lives, we'll never have Gary around for a party, we'll never have him round for dinner. \n\"I just feel like he's been stolen away from us and it's left a massive void.\"\nBoth sisters know that Gary is one name among hundreds of thousands - each one a painful story of loss.\n\"There's millions aren't there, all worldwide. Really, we're all suffering.\"\nIn the report, Sir Michael says the pandemic exposed and amplified existing issues in the city. \n\"Greater Manchester has high levels of avoidable health inequalities as a result of longstanding economic and social inequities, and as across the country, ethnic disadvantage,\" he said.\n\"The city region has also experienced high rates of mortality from Covid-19 and particularly damaging long-term economic and social effects during the pandemic as a result of prolonged lockdowns.  \n\"The kind of recommendations that I make are not just about health care or not just about public health. \n\"They're about housing and transport and community development and jobs and schools.  It cuts across the board. And we need to spend to improve the health and wellbeing for future generations as well as for now.\"\nThe proposals also include a call for extra resources for early years care, better mental health services for young people, and measures relating to the environment and workplaces.\nMayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham has welcomed the report's findings.\n\"The pandemic has brutally exposed just how unequal England actually is,\" he said. \"People have lived parallel lives over the last 18 months. \n\"People in low-paid, insecure work have often had little choice in their level of exposure to Covid - and the risk of getting it and bringing it back home to those they live with.\n\"Levelling up needs to start in the communities that have been hit hardest by the pandemic. \n\"To improve the nation's physical and mental health, we need to start by giving all fellow citizens a good job and good home.\""

      "text": "It is \"impractical and unfair\" to expect teachers in Wales to take responsibility for their Covid safety measures, a head teachers' union says.\nEducation Minister Jeremy Miles said on Monday rules would be \"localised\" within a national framework.\nLaura Doel, director of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) Cymru, said teachers needed to be left to focus on pupils' education.\nMr Miles said conversations with partners were continuing.\nIn a press conference on Monday, he said that in order to make sure a \"disproportionate\" number of pupils were not having to self-isolate, it would be up to individual schools, colleges and universities to decide their own Covid safety rules in future.\nThis would include social distancing, face masks and testing.\nMs Doel told BBC Radio Wales it was \"completely unfair that schools have been put in this situation\".\nShe said more consultations were needed to make sure case numbers did not rise as a result.\n\"That's something that we've told the minister and we hope through further discussions this week that he will listen to our concerns and we can work together to come up with a plan that is workable in schools because unfortunately this plan is not.\n\"School leaders, teachers, teaching assistants are experts in education. They need to be left to concentrate on teaching and learning, and decisions on safety - medical based decisions should be made by those experts,\" she said.\nShe said they needed a plan \"by the latest at the end of the week\" and not by September as the education minister had said.\nMr Miles said the rules would introduce flexibility to schools with lower case rates and reduce the impact on children's education.\n\"The decisions which a school will take will be absolutely based on intelligence from Public Health Wales, their local incidents teams, and nationwide advice - it's about having a framework which adapts to local circumstances and is underpinned by professional advice.\n\"We've agreed to give schools a notice period of any significant changes which we absolutely will be doing but at the end of the day this gives schools more control over options available.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Wales, Ian Loynd, headteacher of St Teilo's Church in Wales High School in Cardiff, said he agreed it was important \"to do everything we can\" to avoid large numbers of children having to self-isolate.\nBut he cautioned against giving schools power over public health decisions.\n\"I'm a teacher and I make educational decisions and I think public health decisions should be made by clinicians - I absolutely feel uncomfortable and I think it will lead to division and consternation within and between schools.\"\nLiz Burden from Newport has two children in Years 7 and 12 and said she trusted her children's school to make the right choices.\nShe said her priority was keeping her children in school.\n\"I think it is a good thing as they know their individual schools and what is going to work for them.\n\"I've noticed a marked difference in my children returning to school as they were not good with home-schooling,\" she said.\nPlaid Cymru said the rules were \"totally unfair\".\nEducation spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said they created an \"opportunity for huge inconsistencies between different schools\".\n\"Measures intended to keep pupils, staff and the wider community safe need to be driven by data and need to be made by experts,\" she said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nThere has been a sharp rise in the number of pupils sent home from school in England because of Covid. According to the latest official figures, more than 375,000 pupils are out of school for Covid-related reasons - an increase of more than 130,000 in a week. Absences have quadrupled this month. The government has signalled a shift to more testing in September - rather than schools sending home whole \"bubbles\" of pupils in response to Covid cases. You can read more on that here.\nForeign business leaders will no longer need to quarantine when arriving in England if their trip is likely to have a significant economic benefit to the UK. The exemption will be for arrivals from amber-list countries, and only given in exceptional circumstances, the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy said. The exemption is for executives wishing to travel to England to make a \"financial investment in a UK-based business\" or for \"establishing a new business within the UK\". You can read more about the UK's current foreign travel rules here.\nPolice are investigating video footage that appears to show England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, being accosted by two men in a park. Boris Johnson said he was \"shocked at seeing the despicable harassment\" of Prof Whitty, who has become a household name during the pandemic, frequently appearing alongside the PM at major press conferences. The video shows two men laughing and jeering as they grab hold of Prof Whitty, who struggles to free himself. The Met Police said it happened in St James's Park in London on Sunday. You can read more about Prof Whitty, and his career before Covid, here.\nThe ban on Scots travelling to Manchester and some other parts of England is to be lifted. The restriction on non-essential journeys sparked a row between First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham. Mr Burnham accused Ms Sturgeon of \"hypocrisy\" for imposing the ban without any consultation with him. He also pointed out that parts of Scotland had higher Covid rates than Manchester. You can read more about the spread of cases in Scotland here.\nA Covid-19 vaccine refuser has told how he \"stared death in the eyes\" as he lay gasping for breath in hospital after catching the virus. Abderrahmane Fadil, 60, was taken to Bradford Royal Infirmary earlier this month struggling to breathe. The father of two said declining his vaccination invite in February was \"the biggest mistake\" of his life. He has thanked NHS staff for saving his life and urged others to get vaccinated.

      "title": "UK needs millions more charging points, says car industry",
      "tags": "Companies,Batteries,Nissan,Electric cars,Car industry",
      "text": "The UK needs to set a binding target for building battery factories and install millions more charging points for electric cars, the industry says.\nThe Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) says ambitious policies over the next decade could create up to 40,000 high-skilled jobs.\nBut it warns failure to take action could be disastrous for the car sector.\nSMMT fears the potential loss of around 90,000 posts and worsening regional inequalities across the country.\nThe SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes, said that without the right backing, UK businesses would become \"consumers not producers, spectators not innovators\u2026 lead and we succeed, follow and we fail\".\n\"If ambitious words were currency, the UK would indeed be rich,\" he said. \"Give us the tools, and we will finish the job.\"\nLater this week, Japanese manufacturer Nissan is expected to announce plans for a new so-called Gigafactory to build batteries at its manufacturing base in Sunderland.\nMr Hawes said that under current plans the UK will have 12 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery production by 2025, whereas Germany will have 164GWh.\nThe expected announcement from Nissan, he said, would be \"a real vote of confidence\u2026 but we need a lot more than that\".\nA spokeswoman for the government said: \"We are committed to ensuring the UK continues to be one of the best locations in the world for automotive manufacturing and are dedicated to securing gigafactories to support the auto sector's transition to electric vehicles. \n\"We continue to work closely with investors and vehicle manufacturers to progress plans to mass produce batteries in the UK.\"\nShe added that the UK already has more than 23,800 public charging points including 4,450 rapid devices - one of the largest networks of rapids in Europe. \n\"We are working closely with local authorities to rollout the electric vehicle revolution, with \u00a31.3bn investment for electric vehicle infrastructure which will support drivers across the country,\" she said. \nA report, written for the SMMT by consultants Public First, sets out a range of proposals that it claims would secure the future competitiveness of the automotive industry - a sector which it claims contributes \u00a315bn to the UK economy, and employs around 180,000 people.\nThe shift to electrified vehicles, it says, is the biggest challenge facing the sector. The sale of new cars powered only by petrol and diesel is due to be outlawed by 2030 in the UK, while hybrids will be banned five years later. Other European governments have also set targets for phasing out conventional vehicles.\nTo meet demand for new electric cars, the report says, the government should commit to creating so-called gigafactories - giant battery-building plants - with a capacity of 60GWh by 2030. \nAt the moment, the only British factory making the kind of batteries needed for electric cars on a large scale is Envision AESC's plant in Sunderland. It has an output of around 2GWh, and is used to provide power packs for the Nissan Leaf, which is also produced in the region. \nThe Japanese carmaker is widely expected to announce later this week that it will expand this partnership, and invest heavily in a new gigafactory, which will initially have a capacity of at least 6.5GWh. \nStellantis, the global car company which owns Vauxhall, is expected to announce within the next few weeks whether its plant at Ellesmere Port will have a long term future. It has been considering whether to build electric cars at the factory in Cheshire.\nAlison Jones, the UK managing director of Stellantis suggested a decision by the company about where it will build a new gigafactory in Europe was central to its discussions with the government about the plant's future, which she said were \"ongoing\".\n\"That's why it's so important for the government to make their statements and their actual investments in UK manufacturing manufacturing\", she said.\nThe influential green group Transport and Environment recently warned that even this would amount to \"a tiny fraction of the 474GWh of production at 17 sites across Europe, for which funding has already been secured\". \nThe group suggested that the UK risked being left behind as other countries invested more rapidly in electric car production. It also expressed doubts that a number of other projects, including start-up Britishvolt's ambitious plan for a 35GWh factory in Northumberland, would happen without more pressure from the industry itself.\nThe SMMT's report, meanwhile, makes a number of other recommendations. It says there is a need for at least 2.3 million new charging points to be set up around the country by 2030. \nThis would, it suggests \"ensure that all drivers - especially those without driveways - have the confidence to invest in the latest low emission technologies, investment that will not just support a healthy domestic market, but which will underpin mass market automotive manufacturing in the UK\". \nIt also calls for the introduction of a \"build back better fund\" from the government to support manufacturing jobs and reduce costs, a commitment to developing and deploying connected and automated vehicle technology and a review of taxes affecting the sector. \nThe stakes, the SMMT says, are high. The correct strategy, it claims would see the sector transitioning to a zero emissions future, with ambitious global trading terms. \nThis, it suggests, could create 40,000 well paid and highly skilled jobs by 2030 - and would have a significant impact in the car industry's traditional heartlands, such as the West Midlands and the North East.\nBut without such a framework, it claims, the UK's automotive industry risks falling into a decline, resulting in the loss of some 90,000 jobs. \nThe majority of them would be lost outside London and the South East, thereby increasing regional inequality.

      "text": "Rebel forces in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region have retaken its capital, Mekelle, sparking street celebrations and forcing officials to flee.\nResidents reported scenes of joy, with fireworks and thousands waving flags.\nThe government, which took Mekelle in November after Tigrayan rebels rejected political reforms and captured army bases, has now called a \"humanitarian ceasefire\" in the region.\nThe fighting has left thousands dead and has pushed 350,000 towards famine.\nMore than two million people have been displaced.\nThere had a recent upsurge in fighting between the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and government forces outside Mekelle.\nA rapid offensive led to the unexpected recapture of the city by the rebels on Monday.\nA statement released by what was termed the Government of the National State of Tigray praised a \"stunning victory\", saying Mekelle was \"now under the complete control of the Tigray Defence Forces\".\nIt calls on rebel forces \"to stay vigilant, relentless and on constant alert until Tigray is fully free of all invading forces\".\nRebel spokesman Getachew Reda told Reuters news agency that Tigrayan fighters would \"destroy the enemy\" by entering the neighbouring Amhara region as well as Eritrea - whose troops have been supporting the Ethiopian army.\n\"We have to ensure that the enemy, whether from the Eritrean side or Amhara side or Addis Ababa, doesn't have the capability to threaten the security of our people anymore,\" he said.\nVivienne Nunis, BBC News, Nairobi\nWith TPLF rebels seizing back control of Mekelle, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed appears to have had few options left when he unilaterally declared a ceasefire. \u00a0\nBut by framing the decision as a \"humanitarian\" one, the government in Addis Ababa is attempting to save face.\u00a0\nSo what now? The TPLF has so far ignored the ceasefire saying it's intent on driving out all so-called \"invading enemies\". \u00a0\nThat means not just the Ethiopian troops, but the Amhara militia and Eritrean forces who have been fighting alongside the Ethiopian army. \u00a0\nThe international community will be watching to see whether the ceasefire is a turning point, and in particular, whether humanitarian groups can now travel freely in the region to deliver supplies to the millions of people in desperate need of food. \nA federal official told AFP news agency that the interim administration in Mekelle had decided to leave on Monday after rebels closed in \"on every side\".\nLocals are celebrating. One eyewitness quoted by AFP said: \"Everybody is out of their house. Everybody is excited and they have music on the streets.\"\nEthiopia's government said it was calling a military ceasefire for humanitarian reasons. It pointed to the need for aid workers to gain access, for farmers to get help during the planting season and for the return of internally displaced people. \nThe UK, the US and Ireland have called for an emergency UN Security Council meeting.\nAll sides in the conflict have been accused of carrying out mass killings and human rights violations.\nThe status of Eritrean troops remains unclear, although one resident of the town of Shire told Reuters the Eritreans appeared to be moving north, towards the border.\nEarlier this month, the UN described a situation of famine in northern Ethiopia. The UN's World Food Programme (WFP), Food and Agriculture Organization and Unicef have all called for urgent action.\nHowever Ethiopia's government has denied that there is a famine in the country.\nEthiopia is still awaiting the results of its 21 June parliamentary elections. Boycotted by some opposition groups and not held in some regions, including Tigray, they are expected to favour Mr Abiy."

      "text": "Adopted children and young people in Wales are facing a \"mental health emergency,\" a charity has warned.\nAdoption UK said two-thirds of adoptive families surveyed in Wales \"face a continual struggle for support\".\nMimi Woods, 20, from Carmarthenshire, tried to take her own life as a teenager after being adopted aged three. She is calling for more support for people who have been adopted.\nThe Welsh government acknowledged \"there is more to do\".\nAdoption UK surveyed adoptive families across the UK, including 335 from Wales, representing 351 children.\nIn a new report, the charity said the \"mental health emergency\" among adopted children and young people had been caused by \"failings in a system that is not set up to meet their needs\".\nThe report found most adopted young people suffered abuse, neglect or violence in their early years which had lasting impacts on their relationships, learning and health.\nIt said adoptive families were left to \"pick up the pieces\" when professional support was not provided.\nAs a teenager, Mimi Woods could not understand why she struggled with her mental health.\nShe was thriving in school and had a loving family. But at just 15 years old, she tried to take her own life.\nReflecting now, Mimi realised a lot of the problems stemmed from being adopted and the trauma she would have suffered as a baby taken into care.\nBorn in Bangkok, Mimi lived in foster care and a children's home in Thailand before she was adopted as and moved to Ammanford in Carmarthenshire.\n\"It comes from a feeling of not being wanted and not having a place or an emotional connection to anyone,\" she said.\nShe does not remember living in Thailand but said that being adopted had emotional consequences for her as a teenager, including \"feeling lost within myself\".\n\"I had no motivation and it felt as though there was no light at the end of the tunnel. \n\"When I was in secondary school, I felt like I didn't know who I was. I've been trying to find myself but I'm still looking now, aged 20.\n\"Identity is a big issue for me. I was adopted from Thailand, so everyone could tell I was adopted as my adoptive parents are white.\n\"My parents are lovely people and I had a really happy childhood and had no other issues in my life, so I couldn't put my finger on the reason for feeling the way I did.\n\"I've since learned that past trauma can affect you years later.\"\nMimi is involved in a group for young people who have been adopted and suffered with depression, trauma and suicidal thoughts.\nShe said speaking to other adopted people had really helped.\n\"My mental health is now better than what it was last year but I do still get those days where I cry a lot, overthink things and have no motivation.\"\nAnn Bell, director of Adoption UK in Wales, said: \"For the third year running, two-thirds of respondents from Wales said they face a continual struggle for support.\n\"All too often, these families are being failed by a system which invests heavily in the placement of children for adoption, then fades into the background, often with terrible consequences for the mental health of the children and their adoptive families.\"\nShe said the survey highlights the consequences of the failure to provide early and consistent support for adopted young people.\nThe report found almost a quarter of adopted 16 to 25-year-olds in Wales were not in education, employment or training at the end of 2020 - more than twice as likely as UK averages.\nIt also said that involvement in high risk and criminal activity had also steadily increased since its first Adoption Barometer report in 2019.\nProblems were often compounded by children falling through the cracks between child and adult services, and almost three-quarters of parents who responded said their child's support reduced or stopped as the became too old to use adolescent services.\nAnother concern was the impact that contacting birth families can have when it was done outside any formal agreement.\nThe charity said it could have \"devastating effects\" on family stability and mental health.\nAs of 31 March 2020, there were 7,170 children in care in Wales - an increase of 5% compared with the previous year. \nOf those, 245 (3%) were placed for adoption and 295 were adopted from care.\nWhen families did get support, the report found there was a noticeable improvement despite the pandemic.\nMs Bell said investment from the Welsh Government had improved some aspects of adoption services, but that more needed to be done.\nA Welsh Government spokesperson said it \"welcomed\" the report's findings because \"the voices of children, young people and adoptive families are key to ensuring the right support is provided\".  \nThe spokesperson said it had \"invested substantially\" in the Welsh adoption service, but conceded \"there is more to do and we will continue working with the sector to ensure we target those areas\".\nThe government is also \"committed to improving mental health services\" and will continue to \"develop our services so adopted young people making the transition to adulthood\", the spokesperson added.\nSuzanne Griffiths, director of the National Adoption Service for Wales, said it was important to \"recognise and celebrate the improvement that has already taken place\", but added the service was \"not complacent about the need for continued improvement\". \nIf you or someone you know has been affected by the issues raised in this story, information on available support can be accessed on the BBC Action Line website."

      "text": "Mark Drakeford has accused Boris Johnson's government of \"aggressively\" ignoring Wales' government and parliament. \nThe first minister has published a report on reforming the \"fragile\" union between the four UK nations.\nIt calls for a partnership between governments, but says relations have recently deteriorated.\nUK ministers said focusing on constitutional issues was an \"irresponsible\" distraction from Covid.\nMr Drakeford said there was an urgent need for change because \"the union has never been this fragile\". \nThe report came as Welsh ministers were granted permission to appeal after their legal challenge to a post-Brexit UK trade law was blocked.\n\"If matters continue in their current vein the case for the break-up of the UK will only increase,\" the first minister said.\n\"Too often we see the UK government act in an aggressively unilateral way, claiming to act on behalf of the whole UK, but without regard for the status of the nations and the democratic mandates of their governments.\" \nThe Labour first minister, an opponent of independence, wants more powers for the Welsh Parliament, including over the justice system.\nHis report says Westminster should allow Wales and Scotland to hold referendums on independence if their devolved parliaments want to, but adds \"it would be unreasonable for such referendums to be held too frequently\".\nWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland should continue to be represented in the House of Commons, the report says, but the membership of the House of Lords should also reflect the make-up of the UK.\nFunding for the devolved nations should be based on their needs, it says, and the UK government should get consent from Cardiff if it wants to pay for certain things in Wales.\nIt follows a row over replacing EU funding to Wales, with UK government ministers acquiring new powers to fund things that are normally controlled by the Welsh government.\nIn a statement, the UK government said people wanted both administrations to work together \"and our full focus must remain on recovering from the challenges the pandemic has created\".\n\"Choosing to prioritise constitutional issues in the middle of a pandemic is an irresponsible and unwanted distraction,\" it said.\nResponding to accusations that UK-wide schemes such as the levelling-up fund undermined devolution, Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said: \"What we're trying to do with more visibility and vigour - I'm very proud of the fact - is we are trying to get more money into Wales, more investment into Wales, more jobs into Wales.\"\nOn the subject of the union, Mr Hart added: \"For most people it's the comforting knowledge that we are part of a big, historic combination of strengths, and that on balance that it's a force for good,\" pointing to the Covid vaccination programme as an example.  \nPlaid Cymru deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said the UK was \"failing utterly to deliver economic and social justice for the people of Wales\".\n\"The only way of achieving this is by putting Wales's future in Wales's hands, free from Westminster's chaos and incompetence. It's why support for independence is at an all-time high, and growing,\" he said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic,Humza Yousaf",
      "text": "Health Secretary Humza Yousaf has said no further restrictions are planned for Scotland despite an ongoing surge in Covid cases.\nMr Yousaf told the BBC he did not believe cases would reach 100,000 per week - a prediction modelled by scientists in a worst case scenario.\nA further 3,285 people tested positive on Monday, a new record high.\nWhile there was a \"weakening\" link between cases and serious illness, Mr Yousaf said numbers could keep rising.\nScottish government scientists believe the 100,000 cases per week figure could be reached by mid-July.\nThey modelled the future impact of the pandemic based on positive test data reported up to 24 June.\nThe report said: \"There is uncertainty as to whether infections will continue to rise or will reduce in coming weeks. This will drive whether hospital beds and intensive care beds also continue to rise.\"\nIt added that the increase in cases in the last few days was \"likely\" to lead to an increase in hospitalisations and intensive care use, with \"considerable uncertainty\" in future weeks.\nHowever Mr Yousaf told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the Scottish government \"wouldn't allow\" those numbers to arise and would \"never allow\" hospitals to come under that level of strain.\nHe stressed that the vaccination programme was the \"route out\" of the pandemic, rather than imposing a further lockdown.\nMr Yousaf said: \"We might continue to see rise in cases, but thankfully because of the vaccine that link between rising cases and severe illness and hospitalisation - and thankfully even commensurate numbers of deaths - has weakened. \n\"That means we wouldn't want to go back to being in a position where we're re-imposing restrictions. Let's not forget lockdown in its severest form also had health impacts, economic impacts and so on.\" \nPrior to the publication of Covid statistics on Monday, the previous highest number of cases was 2,999 reported last Thursday.\nOn the cause of the recent surge, Mr Yousaf said cases were \"very clearly skewed\" towards young males under 40 - adding that some experts associated the disparity with people gathering indoors to watch Euro 2020 matches.\nThose travelling to London in coaches to watch the Scotland squad was \"high risk\" and involved \"little social distancing\", Mr Yousaf said.\nBut the health secretary argued that deploying travel restrictions would only have garnered further criticism and penalised people travelling to London to visit family.\n\"People should understand the virus hasn't gone away,\" said Mr Yousaf. \"We need people to use their judgement.\"\nThe government aims to move the whole of Scotland to the lowest level of the five-tier system of restrictions on 19 July, before lifting most measures entirely in August.\nHowever, the announcement of these plans has coincided with a sharp rise in new cases of the virus, with infections surpassing the highest levels of the \"second wave\" in January.\nMeanwhile Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said people in England are \"very likely\" to be able to return to \"pretty much life before Covid\" on 19 July.\nCabinet Office minister Michael Gove told Good Morning Scotland that the rollout of vaccinations meant the UK was in a position to open up even as case numbers \"remain higher than we'd ideally want\".\nHe said: \"On the basis of everything we can see at the moment we recognise that lockdown has had an effect on people's mental health, it's had an effect on the economy. \n\"But we've put public health overall first. We're going to have to live with Covid in the way we live with flu as a disease that's there, that needs to be managed and vaccination and effective public health measures are the way to go.\"\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon is due to host a briefing on Tuesday with Dr Gregor Smith, the chief medical officer, to discuss the rising Covid case numbers.\nShe is likely to repeat her warnings to the public to take care with three weeks to go until a further easing of restrictions."

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The final easing of lockdown measures in England is still set for 19 July, the new health secretary has said.\nSajid Javid told MPs that ministers \"see no reason to go beyond\" that \"target date\".\nHe said that while cases were rising, the number of deaths \"remains mercifully low\".\nIn a statement, he said no date for lifting restrictions would come with \"zero risk\" and that \"we have to learn to live with\" Covid-19.\n\"We also know that people and businesses need certainty, so we want every step to be irreversible,\" he said.\n\"The restrictions on our freedoms, they must come to an end.\"\nAddressing the House of Commons for the first time as health secretary, Mr Javid added that the government was aiming for \"around two thirds of all adults in this country\" to have had two doses of a coronavirus vaccine by 19 July.\nThe vaccine is now estimated to have prevented 7.2 million infections and 27,000 deaths in England, according to new analysis from Public Health England and Cambridge University.\nThe end of England's lockdown was originally scheduled for 21 June, but was pushed back by four weeks with the promise of a review after two. Mr Javid's update marks the end of that review.\nThe number of new cases across the UK has continued to rise quickly since the delay was announced.\nA further 116,287 cases have been recorded in the past seven days - a 70% increase on the previous week's total. \nBut the latest estimates show fewer than one in 1,000 infections is leading to a death. At the peak of the winter wave it was one in 60.\nThe talk of encouraging data is understandable. You only need to look at what was happening in the autumn when the second wave was starting. \nAs is the case now, infection rates were climbing rapidly from a low base.\nBack then, that saw hospital admissions top 1,000 a day little over a month later. Thanks to the vaccines, hospitalisations are nowhere near that level now.\nIt means that what can be considered a proportionate response to the virus is now very different.\nBut admissions are still rising. So that is why government scientists are hoping to see some signs of a flattening in infection levels before a decision is made about 19 July.\nThe new health secretary is clearly confident that all remaining restrictions can be lifted then. The next two weeks will prove whether that faith is misplaced or not.\nMr Javid was asked whether it was the government's plan to remove all restrictions on 19 July.\nHe replied that it was certainly the government's intention to \"remove restrictions\" - but whether that would be all or just some, he added: \"As we follow the data in the coming days, we will set out more in due course.\"\nHe was also asked what he would do to help parents who were having to stay home repeatedly because their children were being told to isolate.\nMr Javid said a pilot was under way to ascertain whether \"tests can be used in lieu of isolation\". \nLabour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, suggested the government should not be so confident about the date, warning that cases were on the up. \n\"We've seen around 84,000 cases in the last week, an increase of around 61%. Today we've seen the highest case rate since January,\" he said. \n\"So what is he going to do to push infections down? Vaccinations will do it eventually but not in the next four weeks.\"\nThe tone from the new health secretary sounded less cautious than his predecessor, but in substance not much has changed.\nSajid Javid did exactly what Matt Hancock would have done had his political career survived - he dashed any hope that sceptical Conservative backbenchers might have had that restrictions in England could end next week.\nBut he did try to reassure them that the economic pain would not be prolonged for much longer.\nWith infections rising, though, Labour is warning that the anti-restriction rhetoric could prove premature.\nAnd while legal restrictions might end and closed businesses might re-open on 19 July, Mr Javid was less forthcoming on exactly when the paraphernalia of the pandemic - the masks, the apps, the contact tracing - will finally be consigned to the past.\nEarlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people in England were \"very likely\" to be able to return to \"pretty much life before Covid\" on 19 July.\nHe said it was \"sensible to stick to our plan\" of having a \"cautious but irreversible approach\" to lifting the remaining restrictions.\nA total of 22,868 cases were reported on Monday, up from 14,876 on Sunday. However, the government said Sunday's figure was lower than expected because of a delay to processing data, and that Monday's total would include outstanding cases.\nA further three deaths within 28 days of a positive test have been reported in the UK. There tend to be fewer deaths reported on Mondays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend.\nThe latest figures show that 84.4% of adults in the UK have had their first jab and 61.9% have had their second.\nUntil lockdown is further eased in England, limits will remain on gatherings. \nCurrently, groups of no more than 30 are allowed to meet outdoors, while up to six people or two households are allowed indoors. Capacity limits will continue at venues and nightclubs will stay closed.\nHowever, some coronavirus pilot events are continuing as planned, including some upcoming Euro 2020 games, Wimbledon, and arts and music performances. Attendees have to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative test.\nIt is not yet known whether social distancing and face masks will continue to be advised after 19 July. Reviews are under way into social distancing as well as into masks and other measures, and these are due to be completed before the lifting of rules on 19 July.\nOn its website under the section about step four of lockdown easing (the next step), the government says: \"We are going to have to keep living our lives differently to keep ourselves and others safe. We must carry on with 'hands, face, space'. Comply with the Covid-secure measures that remain in place.\"\nFormer Health Secretary Matt Hancock also previously suggested there could be a new approach to self-isolation, for example taking daily tests while continuing on with daily life.\nIn Wales, meanwhile, the lifting of Covid restrictions has been paused and will be reviewed again on 15 July. \nIn Scotland, it is hoped that the remaining rules will be lifted on 9 August, while some rules in Northern Ireland will be reviewed on 1 July."

      "text": "South Africa's former President Jacob Zuma has been sentenced to 15 months in jail by the country's highest court.\nHe has been given five days to hand himself in to police. Failing that, the police minister must order his arrest.\nThe sentence comes after the Constitutional Court found him guilty of contempt for defying its order to appear at an inquiry into corruption while he was president.\nMr Zuma's time in power, which ended in 2018, was dogged by graft allegations.\nBusinessmen were accused of conspiring with politicians to influence the decision-making process.\nThe former president testified only once at the inquiry into what has become known as \"state capture\" but then refused to appear subsequently.\nThe inquiry - headed by Justice Raymond Zondo - asked the Constitutional Court to intervene.\nActing Chief Justice Sisi Khampepe was damning in her ruling. Mr Zuma refused to come to the court to explain his actions, she said, and he \"elected instead to make provocative, unmeritorious and vituperative statements that constituted a calculated effort to impugn the integrity of the judiciary.\n\"I am left with no option but to commit Mr Zuma to imprisonment, with the hope that doing so sends an unequivocal message... the rule of law and the administration of justice prevails.\"\nThe former president was not in court to hear the majority ruling and has repeatedly declared that he was the victim of a giant political conspiracy.\nIn a separate legal matter, Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty last month in his corruption trial involving a $5bn (\u00a33bn) arms deal from the 1990s.\nThis was a scathing, and hugely significant judgement against Jacob Zuma. \nThe Constitutional Court did not simply find him in contempt, but spelled out the many ways in which the former president had lied, sought to mislead the public, and ultimately tried to \"destroy the rule of law\". \nThe judges were clearly seeking to pre-empt the inevitable push back from Mr  Zuma's supporters.\nThey say that he is the victim of a vast political conspiracy, and wonder why a former anti-apartheid hero who spent a decade on Robben Island should be imprisoned, while key figures from South Africa's old racist white minority government remain free.\nBut while there may be some protests against the court's majority decision, many more South Africans are likely to welcome the judiciary's firm stance after years in which it seemed the rule of law was being eroded by a culture of high-level impunity.\nThe ruling will also have an impact within the governing ANC, and will strengthen the hand of President Cyril Ramaphosa while weakening those - often linked to Mr Zuma - who have also been implicated in the vast \"state capture\" corruption that Mr Ramaphosa has repeatedly vowed to expose and confront."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,NHS Scotland,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Vaccination is offering Scotland the \"route out\" of the pandemic, according to Nicola Sturgeon. The first minister told MSPs this week that the link between new cases and the serious health harms caused by the virus hasn't gone away - but it is weakening significantly.\nScotland recorded 2999 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday - a record high. What do recent figures show us about this link? And does this mean we no longer have to worry about case numbers?\nCases are rising fast - and there are no signs yet that the rate of new infections is slowing.\nScotland had been enjoying a sustained decline in the number of new Covid-19 cases, but that all changed on 5 May.\nSince then, the number of new Covid cases per day has mainly been rising, and at an increasing pace in recent days.\nOn 5 May, the number of cases detected over the previous seven days was 1,046. By 23 June, this figure had gone up to 11,067 - a 10-fold increase.\nScotland also has the highest case rate among all of the UK nations, reaching almost 203 cases per 100,000 people on Wednesday.\nThe sharp rise is being driven by the more infectious Delta variant, first identified in India, which accounts for more than 90% of new cases in the UK, according to the UK government.\nHowever, the Scottish government says fewer people are being treated in hospital for Covid illness now and fewer people are dying, despite this increase.\nIn short, yes.\nBut according to the government's analysis, only about 5% of people who are infected end up in hospital, rather than the 10% we were seeing before vaccination started to offer us protection.\nPeople are also staying hospital for shorter periods after being admitted.\nThe easiest way to see this is in a graph which shows the link between new cases and the number of people in hospital being treated for Covid.\nDuring the outbreaks in the autumn and over the winter, the daily figure on hospital occupancy has closely tracked the daily cases figure, but it's different this time.\nThe number of people in hospital is trending upwards, but the gap between the two lines is obvious.\nTo draw a comparison with the end of 2020, when the average number of new cases being recorded a day was similar to now, there were 1,174 Covid patients in hospital. On 23 June, there were 170.\nPublic Health Scotland publishes data on daily hospital admissions of people with a positive test for Covid, and again there appears to be a different pattern this time.\nOn 28 August, as the second wave took hold in Scotland, an average of seven people were being admitted a day. It was a similar figure on 5 May 2021, as the Delta variant began to drive a new wave of cases.\nThis next chart compares hospital admissions from those dates.\nFor the first three weeks there is not much difference at all between the two lines, but then the rate of new admissions in the autumn begins to rise at a much faster rate.\nThere is generally a lag of several weeks between new cases and Covid-related deaths, which means it is harder to draw firm conclusions on whether the link between the two figures is weakening.\nCertainly, the number of new death certificates mentioning Covid-19 in Scotland has been reasonably stable over the last few weeks.\nHowever, the rate of new deaths in the autumn did not begin to rise fast until the latter half of October - six to eight weeks after case numbers began going up.\nIn the seven days up to 6 September just two death certificates mentioned Covid-19, the lowest figure in any week since the pandemic began in Scotland.\nAfter that, weekly deaths began to rise, with 76 recorded in the seven days up to 18 October.\nLast week, there were 13 death certificates mentioning Covid-19, according to the National Records of Scotland - three weeks after this spring's low of four deaths in the middle of May.\nWhat happens to this rate in the next few weeks will give a clearer indication on how much the link with deaths has weakened.\nLinda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland she was expecting the number of deaths to go up.\n\"We will see more deaths if cases continue to increase and we're going to see those deaths in two groups - the unprotected by full vaccination and, in a small number of cases, people who have had both doses, because the vaccines are not 100% protective,\" she said. \n\"So I think it will go up, but I'm hoping that it won't go anywhere near where we were before.\"\nIn the first minister's statement to Holyrood on Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon announced a \"revised strategic framework\" for tackling Covid, which took into account the protection being offered by vaccination against Covid sickness.\nShe said that previously the Scottish government was intent on suppressing the virus to the \"lowest possible level\", but this has been replaced with an aim of suppressing the virus \"to a level consistent with alleviating its harms\".\nThis essentially means that higher numbers of cases will be tolerated than in past waves of the pandemic.\nThe Scottish government's new strategy reflects the latest guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) on public health and social measures to tackle Covid.\nIn this document, the WHO says the focus can shift from case numbers to hospital admissions and intensive care rates in countries where the most vulnerable are fully vaccinated - a position Scotland will be in by next week, according to the first minister.\nBut there is a balance to be struck here.\nIf case rates are allowed to get completely out of control, then pressure will inevitably increase on the NHS and more will die, Prof Bauld said.\n\"If we really see these numbers continue to increase, it's still going to translate into some hospital admissions and people becoming very unwell.\n\"So we've just got to hold the course for a few more weeks and try and send the behavioural message that this is not a free-for-all - we all need to do our bit.\"\nA high case rate also increases the risk of new variants of concern emerging - ones that are more infectious, more deadly or which are resistant to current vaccines.\nThe WHO's document says that some form of Covid restrictions - for example isolating after a positive test - will need to be used \"for the foreseeable future\".\n\"Things are improving but it's not going away,\" Prof Bauld said.\n\"Into the winter months we're still going to have to have some mitigations... there may be [restrictions] that are put in place again, rather than everything just continuing open indefinitely.\"\nAnd Prof Bauld also cautioned against governments coming up with an acceptable death rate for Covid-19.\n\"I think there's pressure on politicians to come up with a number of tolerable deaths from this disease in the future and quite rightly they're resisting that,\" she said.\n\"There are also these constant comparisons with flu which is unfortunate, because its much more deadly than influenza - and more transmissible.\"\nThe vaccination programme has been operating for more than six months and has been made possible thanks to the hundreds of people who give the jabs. If you are one of those vaccinators, we'd like to hear from you.

      "tags": "Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The quality of face masks healthcare workers wear makes a huge difference to their risk of coronavirus infection, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust research has found.\nWearing a high grade mask known as an FFP3 can provide up to 100% protection. \nBy contrast, there is a far greater chance of staff wearing standard issue surgical masks catching the virus. \nProfessional bodies have long campaigned for staff to be given better personal protective equipment.\nThe data was gathered during a programme of regular testing for Covid at the trust. \nThe results are published in a pre-print paper that has not been peer-reviewed. \nFor most of last year, the hospital followed national guidance which specifies that healthcare workers should wear surgical masks, except in a few limited situations.\nThough fluid resistant, these masks are relatively flimsy and loose-fitting and are not meant to screen out infectious aerosols - tiny virus particles that can linger in the air and are now widely accepted as a source of coronavirus infection. \nThe study found that staff caring for Covid patients on \"red\" wards faced a risk that was up to 47 times higher than those on \"green\" or non-Covid wards. \nLead researcher Dr Mark Ferris, a specialist in occupational health at the hospital, said staff were getting Covid despite doing everything they were asked to in terms of infection control.\nSo as the second wave of the pandemic started to hit last December, managers in Cambridge made a local decision to upgrade the protection on red wards. \n\"The only thing left to try that could make a difference was FFP3 respirators, and they did,\" Dr Ferris said. \nFFP3 masks have a close fit and are specifically designed to filter out aerosols.\nIn the weeks following this move, the rate of infections among healthcare workers on red wards dropped spectacularly, quickly falling to the level experienced by staff on green wards where there were no Covid patients.\nThe study concludes that \"cases attributed to ward-based exposure fell significantly, with FFP3 respirators providing 31-100% protection (and most likely 100%) against infection from patients with Covid-19\".\nAny remaining cases were likely to be caused by spread in the community, rather than in the hospital. \nThe paper says fluid-resistant surgical masks were \"insufficient\" to protect healthcare workers. \nDr Mike Weekes, of Cambridge University NHS Hospitals Foundation Trust, who also worked on the study, said the work gives \"some real world evidence that FFP3 masks are actually effective and more effective than the surgical masks\". \nHe added: \"Clearly, it's a relatively small study in one trust and so we need to see these findings replicated elsewhere. \n\"But given the difference in the results that we've seen, as a sort of precautionary principle effect, what we should be thinking about is changing to use FFP3 masks for anyone caring for a patient with coronavirus.\"\nThe Cambridge trust is among 17 across the UK known to have decided to upgrade PPE regardless of national policy.\nThe call for FFP3 masks to be issued more widely is in line with a long-standing demand by the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and many other professional bodies. \nThey have repeatedly appealed for higher standards of protection to face the threat of airborne spread of the disease, most recently in a high-level meeting with health officials earlier this month.\nIn an open letter to the new Health Secretary Sajid Javid, the Fresh Air NHS group of consultants and doctors says the new study provides yet more evidence of why the policy needs to change.\n\"This has important implications for healthcare worker protection as the UK copes with what is hopefully an 'exit wave', as well as trying to reduce the massive backlog of other work whilst coping with inevitable staff sickness and isolation,\" the group wrote.\nIt says supply chains have now been largely restored after the shortages of the early days of the pandemic, and that although FFP3 masks are less comfortable than surgical ones, surveys show staff generally prefer a higher level of protection.\nRose Gallagher, the RCN's lead for infection prevention and control, also welcomed the research, telling the BBC: \"This important study adds even further weight to the RCN's continuing call for nursing staff to be better protected from Covid-19 and given routine access to the highest levels of respiratory protective equipment whenever they need it.\n\"We are still seeing cases of Covid-19, even from some who have been vaccinated, and it is vital staff are fully protected and there are no attempts to restrict or ease off on measures to further reduce the risk of infection.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said guidance on PPE standards was regularly updated to reflect the latest science.\n\"The safety of the NHS and social care staff has always been our top priority and we continue to work round the clock to deliver PPE to protect those on the frontline.\n\"Emerging evidence and data are continually monitored and reviewed and guidance will be amended accordingly if appropriate.\""

      "tags": "Travel,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Foreign business leaders will no longer need to quarantine when arriving in England if their trip is likely to have a significant economic benefit to the UK, the government has announced.\nThe exemption will be for arrivals from amber-list countries, and only given in exceptional circumstances, the Department for Business (BEIS) said.\nSome business groups and MPs expressed anger as it excludes smaller companies.\nBut BEIS said it would balance economic interests with public safety.\nSome critics said it should include all business travel and key workers. Labour's Angela Rayner and Manchester's Labour Mayor, Andy Burnham, said it smacked of one rule for the rich and one for the rest.\nCraig Beaumont, for the Federation of Small Business, said: \"Small business owners and the self-employed often travel for their business, and it is wrong to declare this activity as of no significant economic benefit - and so outside of the government's plans. \n\"There should not be a fast lane of easements for big business while small firms are left behind.\"\nTej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: \"Medium-sized enterprises will be the powerhouses of our economic recovery, so initiatives that effectively lower quarantine requirements for executives in large businesses seem arbitrary.\"\nMr Parikh stressed that it was \"vital that the government does not overlook the crucial importance of helping SME business leaders getting back up and running by focusing purely on multinationals\".\nUKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls agreed, telling the BBC this exemption needed to be \"expanded for broader business travel, including hospitality workers abroad who are currently unable to return to the UK due to the cost and hassle of current quarantine requirements\".\nThe plans follow disquiet at perceived double standards for influential guests and dignitaries after sponsors and officials from Uefa and Fifa were allowed into the UK for Euro 2020 without having to quarantine. \nThe exemption is for executives wishing to travel to England to make a \"financial investment in a UK-based business\" or for \"establishing a new business within the UK\".\nBEIS said: \"This exemption is designed to enable activity that creates and preserves UK jobs and investment, while taking steps to ensure public health risks are minimised.\"\nThe prime minister's official spokesman added: \"Protecting public health is our number one priority and that's why those exemptions will only apply in truly exceptional circumstances.\"\nBusiness leaders will not qualify for an exemption if the activities can be carried out remotely via telephone or email, or by another person. \"Routine meetings\" and \"speculative sales pitches\" will not qualify.\n\"Significant economic benefit\" is considered to be having a greater than 50% chance of creating or preserving at least 500 UK-based jobs, or creating a new UK business within two years, BEIS said.\nMs Rayner said: \"It is the lowest-paid working people who have got our country through this crisis, risking their lives on the front line.\n\"Yet again it is one rule for those at the top and another for everyone else.\"\nGreater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said it was the \"wrong move at the wrong time\".\n\"It can't be one rule for the rich and another for the rest,\" he added.\nBusiness leaders visiting England will need to take a Covid-19 test, take further tests on arrival and tell the government they intend to use the exemption, before getting a letter of confirmation.\nBosses hoping to use the loophole to attend a routine board meeting will be disappointed, although a meeting to make a decision on whether to invest in a new UK division could be accepted.\nAs with the quarantine exemption for seasonal workers, the business leaders will need to self-isolate whenever they are not conducting the exempt business activity. \nTravellers from red list countries are not exempt.\nBusiness leaders have been primarily carrying out activities remotely during much of the pandemic.\nBut airlines have been pushing hard for restrictions to ease, because sales of business-class and first-class seats - which generate the biggest profits - have plunged as companies adopt remote working. \nA spokesperson from ABTA, the travel association, told the BBC that while this was a \"step forward\", the roles and activities involved were \"limited, and this will not be not be sufficient to bring about a meaningful recovery in business travel\".\nMatthew Fell, UK policy director for the CBI business lobby group, told the BBC the measure was a \"welcome step towards taking the pragmatic and truly risk-based approach needed for business travellers in the coming months\".

      "text": "The EU's chief Brexit negotiator says he is \"confident\" a solution can be found in the next 48 hours over a possible ban on chilled meat products from GB being sold in NI.\nEuropean Commission Vice President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d  has appeared before a Stormont committee.\nProducts such as chilled sausages were due to be prohibited from Thursday as a result of the NI Protocol.\nThe protocol is part of the Brexit deal that creates a border in the Irish Sea.\nIt keeps NI in the European Union single market for goods.\nThe EU does not generally permit the import of chilled meat products like mince and sausages from non-member states.\nBut the UK has asked the EU to delay the ban through extending a so-called grace period.\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said he had been in \"intensive contact\" with the European Parliament and EU member states in recent days about the UK's request.\n\"While I cannot today announce the EU's formal agreement to the request, but after all the internal contacts I have had, I remain confident we can find a solution in the next 48 hours that will address both sides' needs and concerns,\" he said.\n\"I hope to be bringing such optimism to Northern Ireland more in the future.\"\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d also told MLAs that the EU was \"prepared to take bold steps\" on flexibilities, if the UK is committed to implementing protocol in full, including changing EU laws if necessary.\nHe repeated the EU's preference for a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement as a solution for Northern Ireland, where the UK continues to follow all EU agri-food rules. \nThe UK has previously rejected this proposal, with its negotiator Lord Frost saying it would be \"an abrogation of sovereignty\" if it involved the rules being enforced through the EU institutions.\nSpeaking later in the Northern Ireland Assembly, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she welcomed the \"indication\" from Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d that the extension would be granted.\n\"We should bank that but what we need here are longer-term solutions and I hope we can find those in the period ahead,\" she added.\n\"I do think the appearance of Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d really was a positive development, I think it is really important that he does hear first-hand that the DUP doesn't speak for the north on Brexit or the Protocol.\"\nAnalysis\nThere are clearly some within the EU who think that the UK government is not serious about maintaining the protocol.\nSo Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d was saying 'yes we want to be flexible, but we also need to see the goodwill and the implementation from your side'.\nI think the two sides are still quite far apart on what sort of flexibilities are required or are necessary to make the protocol work.\nI think it's inevitable that we will see another big row blowing up at least by the autumn.\nEconomy Minister Paul Frew described the protocol as \"damaging and brutal\".\nHe told the assembly it was being used as \"punishment and leverage\" by the EU for future negotiations with the UK.\n\"There are some people here [in the assembly] who are complicit in that and that has really frustrated businesses I've spoken to over the last couple of weeks,\" he added.\nBefore the Executive Office committee meeting, the SDLP's Colin McGrath, speaking as chairman, said the committee would make sure Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d was \"fully appraised\" of what Stormont's backbench members think about the protocol.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which keeps NI in the European Union single market for goods.\nThe EU does not generally permit the import of chilled meat products like mince and sausages from non-member states.\nSince January, producers in Great Britain have not been able to sell these products in the EU.\nHowever, in December 2020, the EU agreed to a six-month grace period to allow supermarkets in Northern Ireland to re-orientate supply chains away from Great Britain.\nThe UK has asked the EU to extend a grace period for chilled meats to the end of September.\nMeanwhile judgement is expected this week in a judicial review which challenged the lawfulness of the protocol.\nThe challenge was brought by a group of unionist politicians and was heard in the High Court in Belfast last month.\nOne of the applicants, Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister, tweeted that judgement is expected on Wednesday morning."

      "text": "A winner of one of Brewdog's \"solid gold\" beer cans has asked the advertising watchdog to investigate its claim the prize is worth \u00a315,000.\nThe Scottish firm offered 10 people the chance to find a gold can hidden in a case of its beer.\nSome winners questioned the worth after discovering the cans are gold plated, and one has asked the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to probe whether any rules were broken. \nBrewdog stands by the valuation.\nA company spokesperson said the use of the term \"solid gold\" was a mistake, but it stood by its \u00a315,000 claim, saying the estimate was made up of more than just the metal used.\nThe ASA confirmed it was looking into the matter after it was contacted by sales manager Adam Dean, from Shrewsbury, Shropshire.\nMr Dean told the BBC: \"I realised I had won after I treated myself to a can after having mowed the lawn and spotted something glistening away in the case.\n\"It said on the can 'you've won a \u00a315k 24 carat gold Hazy Jane can'. Once I'd got over the shock I wanted to cover it on my house insurance. I got in touch with the can's makers, Thomas Lyte, who told me it was actually brass with a 24 carat gold plating.\n\"I had it valued by a jewellery expert. He told me it was only worth \u00a3500. I'm just totally disappointed and I want it resolved. I legally entered a competition to win a solid gold can but I've not got that. I asked for shares to make it up to \u00a315,000 and Brewdog basically said no, so I called the ASA.\"\nHe said the ASA had asked for all the emails he's received from the company and told him it will  \"assess my concerns\". \nAnother winner, Mark Craig, from Lisburn, Northern Ireland, asked for a valuation after he won his gold can and discovered it was actually made of gold-plated brass. \nHe told the BBC: \"If you're told something is worth \u00a315,000, that's what you would hope you had sitting on your mantelpiece. I bought two cases online in my attempt to win.\n\"The past 18 months have been tough for everyone. I myself was made redundant and had plenty of need of extra cash. I wanted to sell the can and contacted Brewdog for any certification they had.\n\"The certificate they sent said it was gold-plated but they promoted it as solid gold. When I contacted them they told me the 'solid gold' claim was an error.\n\"It's not just me that's been let down. Lots of people have lost out on this. Buying extra beer - and buying it online from them directly handing them a higher share of the profits.\"\nBrewdog said in a statement: \"We have reached out to Mark privately to apologise for the erroneous use of the phrasing 'solid gold' in some of the communications around the competition. Once the error was flagged by our internal teams, we immediately removed or changed all such mentions. \n\"This error may have informed his complaint regarding the value of the can. Importantly, the phrasing in question was never included in the detailed terms and conditions of the competition, nor in the wording informing the lucky winners of their prize.\"\nThe company said the \u00a315,000 value was \"reasonable based on multiple factors\", including the manufacturing price, metal, and quality of the product. Brewdog added that the cans were collectible items, with the value \"somewhat detached from the cost of materials\".\nThe ASA said in a statement: \"A complainant has challenged whether the claim that the prize was solid gold is misleading as they believe it's not made from solid gold and rather brass and gold plating. \n\"They have also challenged whether another ad is misleading as they understand the can is not worth \u00a315 000.\"\nIt said it was assessing the complaint to establish whether or not it needed to take action. \nBrewdog was founded in 2007 by boss James Watt and Martin Dickie.\nIt has been attracting negative scrutiny in recent weeks after a letter from ex-workers was posted on Twitter which said a \"significant number\" of former staff had \"suffered mental illness as a result of working at Brewdog\".\nIt made a number of allegations, including that Brewdog fostered a culture where staff were afraid to speak out about concerns.\nThe company has promised an independent review of the beer firm and has apologised to staff for the \"lot of pain\" they have been caused.\nThe fast-growing Scottish brewer and pub chain has enjoyed rapid success and employs 2,000 staff. But it has also courted controversy with its marketing and commercial decisions."

      "text": "The government is being urged to give GCSE and A-level students more information about this year's exams as soon as possible. \nHead teachers say it would help pupils deal with the disruption caused by the recent Omicron surge.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh governments have confirmed that face coverings will remain compulsory in high schools. \nAll UK schools must offer face-to-face teaching to every age group, and provide effective online learning for pupils who are absent or isolating.\nThe specific Covid measures in place vary across the nations. \nAll school staff and secondary school pupils are asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week (three in Wales).\nIn England, secondary school pupils no longer need to wear masks in the classroom, and won't be required to wear them in communal areas from 27 January.\nA teachers union has urged the government to give GCSE and A-level students information about this year's exams ahead of the planned update on 7 February. Pupils will be offered a choice of topics in some subjects, but don't yet have the final details. \nIn Wales, some schools have reintroduced year-group bubbles, and have staggered start and finish times. Face coverings will remain compulsory in classrooms and communal areas until the end of the February half term, when schools will be expected to revert to their normal timetable. Rules will be reviewed on 10 February. \nIn Northern Ireland, schools reopened with the same measures as last term. New guidance says all primary and post-primary pupils in a class where there are multiple Covid cases should take an LFT. The overall guidance to schools will be reviewed in mid-February.\nIn Scotland, social distancing remains in place, pupils are separated into groups where possible. Pupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the 1m (3ft) social distancing rule still applies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the guidance for schools was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nThe latest data for England shows that 415,000 pupils (5.1%) were absent for Covid-related reasons on 20 Jan, up from 3.9% on 6 January.\nOver the same period, 4.5% of teachers and leaders were off because of Covid, although a quarter of schools had absence rates above 15%.\nIn addition, 4.7% of teaching assistants and other staff were off for Covid-related reasons. \nThe latest data in Northern Ireland shows that on 24 January, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covid - the highest rates since the new term began.\nIn Scotland on 21 January, 30,238 students (4.4%) were missing from school due to Covid-related reasons. \nMany schools have told the BBC they can't find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. A number of supply teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.\nEngland's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says the government is considering options to deal with staff shortages. \nHe previously urged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response.\nMr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes in the event of teacher shortages. \nBut teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children.\nYes - as long as they don't have any of the main Covid symptoms, under-18s don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. \nSimilarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. \nHowever, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advised to take LFTs for at least seven days. \nAll primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland should take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. \nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the second jab typically given 12 weeks after the first.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has also recommended that booster doses should be offered to children aged:\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has also been approved for five to 11-year-olds who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from Covid. \nThe JCVI also recommends that primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, but it's not yet clear when they might get the doses.\nChildren who aren't considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after testing positive for Covid before being vaccinated.\nVentilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid. \nIn England, the government is making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. \nLabour says this isn't enough, but the Department for Education says the units are only required in areas where doors and windows cannot be opened effectively.\nSome 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors had already been promised for England's schools to help identify areas with poor ventilation, but teaching unions complained this won't solve the problem. \nThe Scottish government gave \u00a3100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.\nThe Welsh government has a \u00a36m programme to increase air circulation and purity which will provide 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines."
