      "text": "Thousands of young people are forgoing school on day six of the UN climate summit to show world leaders they expect action on the crisis.\nActivist Greta Thunberg  has headlined a youth march organised by the school strike movement Fridays for Future.\nYoung people from across the globe joined her on the procession from Kelvingrove Park to the city centre. \nSome of them told us why.\nGraham Paisley and his daughter Amy were among those gathering in Kelvingrove Park, in Glasgow's west end, ahead of the march. \nMr Paisley, 49, said: \"I am here for Amy. I think it is really important for her to have a view of what is happening in the world. \n\"Climate change is going to have a big impact on our lives and things will definitely get worse if we don't do anything about it.\"\nThe businessman only found out about the demonstration when S4 pupil Amy, 14, mentioned it on Monday. \nThey travelled from Darnley, Glasgow, to take part in what will be their first protest. \nAmy said: \"If someone is going to get something done about it then it is going to be young people as we are going to have to live with it. \n\"I hope today will make governments realise that it is something people care about. \n\"They need to do something about it.\"\nApril travelled to George Square from Paisley, Renfrewshire, for the rally with her 11-month-old daughter Juneau.\nThe teacher said: \"It is too important not to be here as there hasn't been anything like this in the city before. \n\"I worry about what the world will be like when my daughter is older. What animals will be extinct?\n\"Will she see the beauty of Scotland as I saw it growing up?\"\nMs Hamilton, 33, hopes the outcome of COP26 will be more than just words. \nShe is looking forward to seeing climate activist Greta Thunberg, whom she said is an incredible role model for her daughter. \nMs Hamilton added: \"I think it is amazing that one person can have such an impact. She hasn't changed her tune and she hasn't let fame get to her head. \n\"She is just one girl who cares about the world.\"\nPatrick Klein is on the march with wife Julia and son Philip. \nThe software engineer is originally from Luxembourg but has lived in Glasgow for 20 years. \nMr Klein, 50, said: \"I think it is important to make the case for climate change and to send a message to politicians that they need to take action.\" \nHe said he had been disappointed with what had been announced at COP26 so far as he believed it did not go far enough. \nAmong the measures Mr Klein would like to see are coal consigned to history and an end to combustion engines in cars before 2030. \nPhilip, 10, said: \"I came here today because I want my future to to be good and I want everyone else's future to be good.\"\nGlasgow University biology Professor Kathryn Elmer is attending the march with her son Keifer. \nShe said: \"There has been many, many years of scepticism and talk but now is the time to make some aggressive choices. \n\"We can't just sit here and watch the planet burn.\" \nProf Elmer, who is originally from Canada, wants the UK to stand up and be a global leader on climate change. \nSon Keifer, 10, said: \"Not a lot of adults are listening to young people, like Greta Thunberg.\n\"I think it is time for for all ages to take action.\"\nEvelyn Acham, a Ugandan activist with the Rise Up movement in Africa, said some young people had become \"full-time activists\" against climate change, giving up education and work due to the urgency of the crisis.\nMs Acham told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme the situation was so urgent that they had abandoned other parts of their lives to push for action.\nShe said: \"The young people going out there to march gives us hope. \n\"The future belongs to those young people, because they still have a lot of time, they haven't achieved a lot, but the older generation have already achieved so much and (climate change) probably won't be so much their problem.\n\"But young people still have work to do, they still have school to do, they have a future to build, so this is our concern.\"\nShe added: \"Many young people have given up school to become full-time activists, some have given up work, some have given up going for a masters degree, just because they're seeing the urgency of this.\"\nShe said young people continued to take to the streets across the world because \"we do not have a choice\".\nRuth Ewan is in George Square for the rally with her daughter Peggy - who made a special sign for their pet lurcher, Dora.\nThe artist said: \"I want my daughter to think about what is happening to the world and to engage with the struggle for climate justice.\"\nMs Ewan, 40, is also concerned about rising inequality and hopes the UN climate conference will have a positive impact across the globe. \nShe added: \"I want to see more action and less blah blah blah. \n\"I am excited that my daughter will get to see Greta today as she is an amazing young female role model.\"\nRuby has been allowed to miss school to attend her first ever march - on her birthday.\nShe said: \"I wanted to come here on my birthday to help everyone's voices get heard on climate change. \n\"I'm worried if I have any children they might not know what a polar bear is.\""

      "tags": "Georgia,US race relations,United States",
      "text": "Georgia prosecutors have shown the full footage of the fatal shooting of a black jogger at the trial of three white men accused of his murder.\nThe prosecutors argued 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery was attacked by men who pursued him because of racial bias.\nOn the opening day of arguments, the court was also shown video from the first police officer on the scene. \nDefendants Gregory and Travis McMichael and William Bryan deny all charges and have said they acted in self-defence.\nMr Arbery was shot and killed during the confrontation with the McMichaels on 23 February 2020. The case erupted into public view after footage of Mr Arbery's final moments surfaced online months later.\u00a0\nMr McMichael, 65, his son Travis, 35, and neighbour Mr Bryan, 52, who filmed the incident, say they pursued Mr Arbery in order to make a citizen's arrest - allowed at the time under Georgia law. They say they suspected he had stolen from a nearby construction site. \nThe McMichaels have also said they acted in self defence, accusing Mr Arbery of attacking Travis when they tried to stop him.\nIn her opening statement, lead prosecutor Linda Dunikoski told the jury: \"All three of these defendants did everything they did based on assumptions - not on facts, not on evidence.\"\nMs Dunikoski showed an extended version of the mobile phone footage taken by Mr Bryan.\n\"Mr Arbery was under attack by strangers with the intent to kill him,\" she said. \"The only thing Mr Arbery did was run away.\"\n\"They didn't simply follow Mr Arbery. All three 'trapped him like a rat' with their two pickup trucks,\" said Ms Dunikoski, using the elder Mr McMichael's own words.\nShe added that Mr Bryan tried to hit the jogger four times with his car, getting so close that Mr Arbery's palm prints and T-shirt fibres were later visible on the vehicle.\n\"No-one said 'I'm making a citizen's arrest today',\" she told the jury. \nThe first witness called by prosecutors to testify was Glynn County police officer William Duggan, who described the bloody scene before his bodycam footage was shown to jurors. \n\"I could see he was covered in blood,\" Mr Duggan said of Travis McMichael. \"There was blood all over, and I remember at some point asking if he was OK.\" \nHe said that the defendant responded: \"'No I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody.'\" \n\"This case is about duty and responsibility,\" began Bob Rubin, a lawyer for Travis McMichael. \"It's about Travis McMichael's duty and responsibility to himself, his family and his neighbourhood.\"\nHe added that the younger McMichael had received training from the US Coast Guard that prepared him for the encounter with Mr Arbery and that he feared for the safety of his five-year-old son when he left the house to pursue him. \nMr Rubin argued that other neighbourhood residents had also previously offered to make a \"citizens arrest\" of Mr Arbery, who he claimed was seen repeatedly \"plundering around\" properties. \nAt the time of Mr Arbery's death, Travis McMichael - Mr Rubin said - was \"hoping to raise the weapon to de-escalate the situation,\" thinking it would act as a deterrent. But instead Mr Arbery charged towards him, it was alleged.\n\"Travis has no choice but to fire his weapon in self defence,\" the lawyer continued, adding that his client \"reasonably believed\" that Mr Arbery would beat him up and use this own shotgun against him. \nEarlier, in twin blows to the defence, the judge ruled that evidence of recent cannabis use by Mr Arbery was not relevant to the case, but that the McMichaels' Confederate flag licence plate was admissible as evidence.\nAleem Maqbool, BBC News, Georgia\nWhile the mobile phone video of Ahmaud Arbery's death went viral, and ultimately led to the arrest of the men now on trial for murdering him, Ahmaud's mother had told me she had studiously avoided watching it over the past 18 months.   \nIn the courtroom today on the first day of the trial, the anguished cry of Wanda Cooper Jones, as she saw that footage of her son's final moments for the first time, brought her devastating loss into stark focus. \nThat the three white men on trial thought it was a good idea to put that video online (which one of them had filmed) thinking it would somehow show them in a good light, gives us a sense of the attitudes that persist in this part of Georgia. \nSupporters of Ahmaud's family argue that those attitudes undoubtedly contributed not only to the killing but also to the response of the police in the aftermath.\nRelatives of Mr Arbery have said they were concerned that the case would have been covered up without the emergence of the video.\nThe racial composition of the jury - one black juror and 11 white - has led to new concerns from Mr Arbery's family about the possible outcome of the trial.\nThe case is currently on its fourth prosecutor. Two district attorneys earlier recused themselves due to ties to Greg McMichael, a former police officer. \nThe first prosecutor to handle the case is facing charges of obstruction for allegedly blocking the arrest of the McMichaels. The second district attorney to take the case declined to arrest the men after determining that they were using citizen's arrest rights in confronting the jogger.  "

      "title": "Where are we at with Covid?",
      "tags": "James Gallagher,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There is a never-ending stream of data about Covid and at times it can seem completely contradictory. So where do we stand at the moment?\nThe number of people testing positive is continuing to fall, but are we wrong to constantly tout this number around? It is looking certain that the epidemic in schoolchildren is in decline, but why, and will it last? And do we need to pay more attention to infections in older age groups? After all, they are the people at highest risk.\nThe main ways of tracking Covid are:\nEach has its own quirks that makes them flawed and yet revealing in different ways. It's only when you bring them all together that you get closer to the reality. \nNearly every source of data agrees that there is a lot of coronavirus around, but that has started to fall. \nThe latest number of cases (ie people who take a test and it's positive) is 34,029 on Friday, down from 43,467 on the same day last week.\nThe issue with that figure is that it is heavily influenced by the number of people choosing to get tested and some don't, especially if their wages depend on being free of Covid. \nThe React study at Imperial and the ONS both test people at random, whether they're sick or not, to see if they're harbouring the virus. \nThat makes them less biased, but people test positive for some time after catching the virus, so the picture they paint is always a bit out of date. \nReact recorded the highest levels of coronavirus since it started after the first wave, but says it may have started to fall in recent days. The ONS estimates one in 55 people in the UK has Covid - that's about 1.27 million of us. However, their data goes up only to 30 October, so is doubly out of date.\nThe R number for the UK, that's the average number of people each infected person passes the virus on to, is between 0.9 and 1.1. That suggests the level of infections is roughly stable, but the way it is calculated means it again reflects what was happening weeks ago.\nThe Zoe Covid study app, which works in real time by getting people to log their symptoms, has recorded a 5% fall in Covid in the past week. \n\"Hopefully we're over the last great peak of Covid in 2021,\" said Prof Tim Spector, who analyses the data at King's College London.\nBut there is a danger in just looking at the headline number of cases - even though it is the mainstay of Covid coverage.\nProf Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh, told me: \"We're tempted to be very concerned when cases rise sharply, and there seems to be a mood that we can relax when it starts to decline.\n\"I don't think it's helping anyone right now.\"\nProf Mike Tildesley, from the University of Warwick, agreed: \"Putting those figures in the public's eye every day does distract from what we should be looking at.\"\nWithin the data, there are two epidemics currently worth considering.\nThe big one in school pupils who are still mostly unvaccinated, but at relatively low risk from Covid. And an emerging one in at-risk groups, who are now being offered their booster doses.\nThe number of cases in school-age pupils surged through September and October, but is now in decline. That has become apparent, even in the laggy ONS data. \n\"For the first time in several weeks, we are seeing a decrease in infections among secondary school-aged children in England, although rates do remain high,\" said the ONS's Sarah Crofts. \nThe fall is likely to be a mix of a rampant outbreak in schools building up natural immunity, pupils who have been vaccinated, and the half-term effect when kids are no longer mixing in the classroom. The React scientists say they witnessed a similar effect 12 months ago, and cases rose once the school gates reopened. \nThe precise balance of those effects on Covid in children remains uncertain - is it a school break or herd immunity?\n\"That's the real question, I'm cautiously optimistic that it's that latter and it's a very significant moment if it is,\" said Prof John Edmunds, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nThe sheer scale of the rise and then fall in infections in young people means the overall picture is dominated by people who are generally at low risk of needing hospital treatment for Covid. \nProf Woolhouse said: \"Over-interpreting those large fluctuations in low-risk groups is misleading and I'm quite worried about those at high risk.\n\"Underlying those waves, there's been a rather steady increase in older age groups and I'm concerned about that.\"\nIt is worth stressing infections in older age groups are at low levels, and it is not yet clear how much the rise will matter.\nThe number of people being admitted to hospital looks to have plateaued at just over 1,000 a day in the UK.\n\"We haven't seen the massive increase in hospital admissions that some were concerned about, but we're not out of the woods yet,\" Prof Tildesley told BBC News. \nProf Spector, whose Zoe app data also showed continuing increases in infections in older age, said the pattern was \"worrying\" but that hopefully the booster campaign would prevent it becoming a major problem.\nProf Edmunds said: \"There's an enormous epidemic in children, it filters through to their parents and from them to others even more vulnerable, vaccines are stopping this being a disaster.\"\nBut he says if cases in children do turn a corner, then that should reduce the risk for everyone. \nIt is abundantly clear we are in an infinitely better position than last year which culminated in lockdowns. \nHowever, there is no certainty about how winter will go. \nWill cases in children continue to fall? If they do, will that lead to falls in other age groups? How will the booster campaign go? What will the weather be like (and will we all meet indoors as the temperature drops)? What will other diseases do and how will they pressure the NHS?\nChanges in behaviour could still change the course of the epidemic. While children's lives look much closer to pre-pandemic norms, that is not the same in adults. There is also the potential of new variants, such as the offshoot of delta - AY.4.2 to cause problems. \n\"It's an extremely complex picture and very hard to predict what is going to happen,\" said Prof Woolhouse.  \nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Music festivals,Texas,United States,Houston",
      "text": "Police in Houston, Texas, have opened a criminal investigation into the deaths of revellers at the Astroworld festival on Friday. \nAt least eight people died and hundreds more were hurt after a crowd surge on the opening night of the music event. \nThe victims were aged between 14 and 27. Some of their identities have started to be publicly released.\nPolice are also investigating reports that somebody in the audience was injecting people with drugs.\nThe incident began around 21:15 on Friday (02:15 GMT Saturday) when panic broke out as the crowd began to press towards the front of the stage during the rapper Travis Scott's headline set.\nAs people started getting hurt, panic grew and the casualties quickly overwhelmed the on-site first aiders, officials said. Some 300 people were treated for injuries such as cuts and bruises. \nThe police investigation into the tragedy will involve the homicide and narcotics divisions, and will review video from the scene to determine what caused the surge and why people could not escape. \nSeveral concert goers had to be revived with anti-drug overdose medicine, including a security officer who police said appeared to have an injection mark on his neck.\n\"We do have a report of a security officer... that he was reaching over to restrain or grab a citizen and he felt a prick in his neck,\" Houston Police Chief Troy Finner said. \n\"When he was examined he went unconscious,\" he added. \"He was revived and the medical staff did notice a prick that was similar to a prick that you would get if somebody is trying to inject.\"\nMeanwhile, the names of some of the victims are starting to emerge. \nBrianna Rodriguez, 16, was a junior at Heights High School in Houston. \"Dancing was her passion and now she's dancing her way to heaven's pearly gates\", her family wrote on Facebook. \nDanish Baig was 27. His brother posted on Facebook that he had been killed while trying to save another relative in the crush. \nRudy Pe\u00f1a, from Laredo, Texas, also died in the tragedy. His age has not yet been confirmed. \nFranco Patino, 21, was an engineering student at the University of Dayton. His university confirmed his death to local TV station WHIO. \nIn his first statement since the event on Twitter, Travis Scott thanked the police and emergency services and said he was \"committed to working together with the Houston community to heal and support the families in need\".\nLater he posted a video message on Instagram, in which he encouraged anyone with information about the incident to contact the authorities.\nScott, whose real name is Jacques Webster, made his big breakthrough in 2013 and has since had eight nominations for Grammy Awards. He has a child - and another one on the way - with socialite Kylie Jenner, who was among the 50,000 people at the festival. \nShe posted on Instagram that they were \"broken and devastated.\"\n\"I want to make it clear we weren't aware of any fatalities until the news came out after the show and in no world would have continued filming or performing\", she wrote. \nIn 2018, Travis Scott pleaded guilty to a public disorder charge after he was accused of encouraging people to rush the stage at a concert in the US state of Arkansas. \nAccording to a local newspaper, he also paid nearly $7,000 (\u00a35,186) to two people who said they were injured at the 2018 event.\nAngelica Casas, BBC News, Houston\nThe night wasn't supposed to end like it did. Today, the streets surrounding the Astroworld festival grounds are still mostly closed off, and the venue is almost empty except for staff and a heavy police presence.\nEdward, a 25-year-old Houston native and a long-time Travis Scott fan, attended Friday's performances, and both previous Astroworld festivals.\nHe was right in the middle of the crowd when, he says, things began to get ugly. As the surge grew worse in a matter of minutes, desperate concert-goers tried to escape, pushing and pulling.\n\"I personally had a girl grab and hold on to me for dear life,\" he said. \"I had to calm her down because she literally thought she was about to die.\"\nEdward says he made a protective circle with his arms around her so she could catch her breath. He was able to pull her out of the crowd and help her to safety. As he walked out, he saw unconscious people around him, some already receiving CPR.\nAnother attendee, Andy Pacheco, filmed the moment concert-goer Seanna Faith, in a desperate plea for help, climbed on to a platform where a cameraman was stationed to ask him to do something about the crowd surge. She wanted the cameraman to call police or medics. But her plea for help was in vain.\nMs Faith later wrote online that she had just escaped a \"sinkhole\" of people as the crowding had become more intense. \nShe managed to pull herself and a friend out and was trying to get help for the others. \nPeople come to these festivals to escape reality and feel like they belong in a music community. On Friday night, that sense of belonging turned deadly. \nDid you witness the incident?

      "text": "The US Virgin Islands has served Barclays in the UK with a court order to provide any documents linked to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\nThe US territory is seeking information on transactions, correspondence and investments linked to the financier.\nThe bank was subpoenaed in New York on the matter in February this year.\nA Barclays spokesperson said: \"Barclays has already provided its response to this subpoena and complied with its obligations. \n\"The US Virgin Islands is now in the process of serving a similar subpoena on Barclays in the UK and Barclays will respond to that subpoena once it is served.\"\nThe BBC understands there is no link between the subpoena and Jes Staley's recent shock resignation as Barclays chief executive, or the FCA probe into his links to Mr Epstein.\nFollowing the conclusion of the investigation, Mr Staley left his job suddenly this week after more than six years at Barclays.\nIt had focussed on Mr Staley's links with the dead financier and whether they were closer than first thought.\nBarclays said on Monday it had been made aware of the conclusions of the probe and \"Mr Staley's intention to contest them\".\nThe subpoena served on Barclays in the US asked for a wide range of documents including any communications between Mr Staley and Epstein, details of the bank's investigation into Epstein and Staley, and Barclays' decision to hire Mr Staley.\nThe US Virgin Islands attempted to serve the second subpoena on Barclays at its London offices in September, but this needs High Court approval, which lawyers for the US territory are understood to be seeking.\nMr Staley left his job as Barclays boss after a shock resignation this week, apparently over a perceived inconsistency between his account to his own board of his relationship with Epstein and evidence seen by regulators.\nMr Staley insists that while Epstein was an important client of JP Morgan, where Mr Staley worked for a number of years and as such they were in contact regularly, their dealings were well within the grounds that could be described as professional.\nThe BBC understands the regulator took the view that the volume and tone of the emails between the two suggested a closer relationship than the purely professional. But Barclays has stated that the report makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Epstein's crimes."

      "title": "Owen Paterson row: How did PM score spectacular own goal?",
      "tags": "Conservative Party,Boris Johnson,Owen Paterson,Parliamentary Standards Commissioner ",
      "text": "Boris Johnson's U-turn over MPs' standards - and the suspension of Owen Paterson - has had Westminster in a spin. \nSo how did it happen? And how angry were the Tory MPs caught in the middle of it?\nUnlike Margaret Thatcher, who famously declared her refusal to change direction when the going got tough, it turns out that this Conservative prime minister is very much for turning.\nWhether it's free school meals in the holidays, or letting a health secretary go despite initially defending him, Boris Johnson has had few qualms about changing his mind in the face of public pressure.\nSometimes U-turns are politically astute - neutralising potentially toxic issues swiftly.\nThe U-turn over Owen Paterson, though, feels different.\nThe obvious difference is that Mr Johnson's own MPs were marched to the top of the hill, came under a barrage of hostile fire, and were then required - with reputations wounded - to march back down again.\nAnd, privately, they are prepared to say what they think, with one usually loyal MP telling me: \"It was moronically stupid.\"\nThere is something approaching a consensus on the Conservative benches that the whole affair has been more damaging to the prime minster, the government's reputation and to Owen Paterson himself than had the Standards Committee's recommended 30-day suspension been agreed. \nAs one very senior figure put it: \"This has now become a question of the government's judgment.\"\nAnd there is feeling that the handling of the issue by Downing Street is what gave it such prominence.\nA long-serving MP said the incident had \"further exposed Boris's lack of judgment\", adding: \"In fact, it has been one misjudgement after the other.\"\nThere was a lot of talk of the government moving the goalposts to help Owen Paterson on Wednesday. But by the end of the week, the football analogy has shifted.\nThe question now is how did the prime minister score such a spectacular own goal?\nAfter the damning standards report was released last week - with the verdict that Owen Paterson had breached lobbying rules on multiple occasions - his allies rallied round.\nA campaign was born.\nMembers of his family and former ministers took to the pages of newspapers to argue that he hadn't had a fair hearing from the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, Kathryn Stone.\nVia WhatsApp and emails, fellow Conservative MPs were given the same message.\nHis allies worked on what would be the best approach to shield him from a 30-day suspension that could have triggered a by-election (though there were some doubts that enough constituents - 10% of voters in North Shropshire - would call for this, as there was widespread sympathy for him because of the loss of his wife).\nOne option was to amend the motion to suspend him - reducing the penalty from 30 days to nine - just beneath the threshold for triggering a by-election.\nBut one of those involved in the pro-Paterson campaign explained to me earlier this week why this was not pursued.\nApart from an unwillingness by Mr Paterson to accept any penalty at all, he said there was a danger that reducing the length of any suspension would look like politicians letting their mates off lightly and it would not play well with the public.\nLittle did he know, of course, the extent of the negative reaction to the other method under discussion and which was adopted.\nMy contact believed that if the case was made that MPs should be treated in the same way as other professionals - whose disciplinary bodies allow for a right of appeal - then this would seem like a sensible reform.\nIt was also thought likely that it would maximise the chance of cross-party support, as there was a feeling that the Standards Committee were taking too long to come up with their own proposals for change.\nAnd as Mr Paterson had consistently complained about the process under which he had been investigated, then a new system would, in effect, mean a new hearing.\nOnce the broad thrust of the amendment had been agreed on Monday, the question for the MP's allies was whether this would be likely to pass.\nAt this stage the looming political disaster could have been averted.\nWhat was happening behind the black door in Downing Street was crucial. \nSome weeks ago, before the publication of the standards report, allies of Mr Paterson spoke to the prime minister, but I'm told he showed little interest at that stage.\nNow, though, the former cabinet minster's allies said they had received nothing but encouragement from No 10.\nOne of them told me: \"If Boris didn't want to do it, he shouldn't have done it. He should have told us that.\"\nAnd, he added, had the PM vetoed the whole idea at the beginning of the week, it would not have gone ahead.\nBut Downing Street was nowhere near as united as Mr Paterson's allies might have imagined.\nSevere scepticism about the plan was expressed by some officials, particularly over how it would play in the press. But they were overruled.\nCommons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg is reported to have been influential in backroom discussions, and he publicly argued the case on Tuesday that the Standards Committee's recommendations could be amended.\nBut given the eventual outcome - an embarrassing climb-down - opinion on the Conservative benches is divided over who to blame.\nSome MPs have told me it was primarily the fault of chief whip Mark Spencer - that he should have, but failed to, stand up to Downing Street.\nOthers say they have huge sympathy with \"the chief\" - he was simply doing the PM's bidding.\nOne MP said Mr Johnson was under pressure from many of Mr Paterson's allies and he just wanted the problem to go away - so he tasked the chief whip with finding a solution.\nWith the final wording of the amendment drafted on Tuesday - after checks made informally with Commons officials to make sure it would not be ruled out of order - the whipping operation began.\nSome reports suggest No 10's position was not finalised until after the prime minster enjoyed dinner with prominent Telegraph journalists on Tuesday night.\nBut, in truth, the decision to at least test the water had been taken before that.\nAbout 17:30 on Tuesday, Conservative MPs were approached - some face-to-face, some by text - by their whips.\nThey were given a summary of the yet unpublished amendment in very approving terms and asked whether they would be willing to add their names to it.\nFrom my conversations, however, there seemed to have been quite a bit of pushback.\nSome said it looked like a wrecking amendment, while others expressed more general concerns about what was being proposed, even if they had some sympathy with changing the standards system.\nConflating those changes with the Paterson case was seen as unwise by some MPs. There were predictions this could end in tears.\nBut despite those concerns - and to the surprise, even shock of some - at 11:30 on Wednesday, the day of the vote, MPs were told there would be a three line whip (although one MP acerbically observed he had learned about it from the Daily Telegraph first).\nThis was seen by some as a sign of Downing Street weakness, not strength, as there was speculation that without the imposition of a formal whip, enough Conservative MPs may have abstained in the vote to kill the plan.\nWhatever the case, it was clear that it was not a happy Parliamentary Conservative Party that trooped through the Commons voting lobbies on Wednesday.\nSome said the whipping operation had been quite \"light\" but others reported that they had felt under pressure to toe the line.\nOne MP - who said he had two sleepless nights as he considered how to cast his vote - said he had never seen so many gloomy-looking colleagues.\nA number of MPs witnessed the government's law officers having what appeared to be an animated discussion with a government whip.\nAbstentions, rebellions and no-shows eventually reduced a Conservative working majority of 81 to just 18.\nSome Conservatives felt that Mr Paterson and his allies were partly responsible for the narrowness of the victory.\nSome of the 2019 intake of Conservative MPs said that Mr Paterson had not personally canvassed their support, that the \"old guard\" were taking them for granted and that the campaign to shield him was \"arrogant\".\nThat unease grew when they saw his television interviews following the vote.\nOne of them summed up the mood thus: \"He showed no contrition.\"\nAnother of the 2019 intake told the BBC: \"It's frustrating to have my reputation potentially damaged by a man who doesn't even know my name.\"\nA long-serving colleague added: \"Perhaps the party's elder statesmen should learn from the street judgment of the new intake, who come from a wider range of backgrounds.\"\nThere had been no organised rebellion - indeed one rebel was surprised to see some colleagues vote against the government rather than just abstain.\nAnd some abstainers have told me the Standards Committee chairman, Labour's Chris Bryant, had swayed them sit on their hands as he set out the case against the former cabinet minister.\nOne MP, who in the end did follow the three-line whip, said that Mr Paterson's breach of the lobbying rules wasn't just \"egregious\", it was \"rampant\".\nThe following morning's newspapers - some of them usually sympathetic towards the government - were brutal.\nThere was little advance notice of the government U-turn that would see Mr Paterson face a vote on his future after all.\nOne of the MP's close friends spoke to him and they both agreed it would be better for him now to resign.\nThe pressure of the investigation, I am told, made it likely that he would stand down in any case, but he had wanted a new standards regime in place first, so he would have an opportunity to clear his name.\nWhen that wasn't forthcoming, he saw little point in staying on and he had indeed been urged by his family to stand down.\nThose who know him well are clear that he is still grief-stricken over his wife's death.\nBut his allies believe the government has done itself immeasurably more harm in U-turning than in just taking the political hit.\n\"They gave in to panic,\" one of them said.\nLabour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats would not co-operate with setting up a new system. \nBut a very senior MP maintains that a new committee would not have been necessary to give MPs a new right of appeal.\nThis could have been done by a change in standing orders, and could have been limited to those facing 10 days or more suspension - that is, those who would be at risk of fighting a by-election under the \"recall\" system.\nOne Paterson ally felt that the detail of the case would have had little cut through with the wider public - unlike U-turns on school meals or on Covid measures, which have a tangible effect on their lives.\nAs they often have a low opinion of MPs in any case, so the government, in his view, could have ridden out the row over the rule changes.\nBut it is the backtracking that gave the issue rocket boosters, they added.\n\"The public don't like incompetence.\"\nSo why did the PM take the political risk in the first place? There are almost as many theories are as there are MPs.\nSome say Mr Johnson had a \"human reaction\" and wanted to help Mr Paterson out.\nOthers say he wanted to get redoubtable campaigners, such as Iain Duncan Smith and David Davis, off his back.\nSome say he was distracted by the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, or misled by the chief whip over levels of support for Mr Paterson.\n\"I really would cut the PM some slack,\" said an opponent of the changes, pointing out that the prime minister had a lot on his mind.\nBut there are more Machiavellian theories too.\nHis former aide Dominic Cummings has suggested that the PM very much had a hound in this fight - that it would benefit him to knobble Standards Commissioner Kathryn Stone. \nThis is completely and forcefully denied by Downing Street. They say they have had no indication, for example, that Ms Stone wants to investigate the controversial and costly refurbishment of Downing Street - the subject of an active investigation by the Electoral Commission.\nBut a senior MP suggested that getting changes to the standards system was far more important to Mr Johnson than the fate of his Tory colleague. \nSo, to unlock cross party talks on this subject, \"he threw Owen under a bus\". \nAnother said: \"Owen was now expendable.\"\nWhat is true, though, is that some ministers certainly wanted to see the back of the Standards Commissioner and have said so privately.\nThey would certainly have seen this as a bonus. \nSome of them expected the Standards Committee and the Commissioner to resign in the wake of Wednesday's vote.\nIndeed, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng publicly stated: \"It is difficult to see what the future of the commissioner is.\"\nInstead, Ms Stone and the Standards Committee dug in.\nAnd now, rather than the behaviour of a former cabinet minister coming under scrutiny, it is the Downing Street operation  - and the prime minister's own judgment - that are in the spotlight."

      "text": "Protesters are marching in the capital as part of a global day of climate crisis action.\nCampaigners are protesting in Cardiff and other UK cities as leaders meet at the COP26 summit in Glasgow.\nWales' rugby team host South Africa at the Principality Stadium while Cardiff City host Huddersfield in the football, with 100,000 expected in the city.\nPeople have been advised to leave plenty of time and wear face masks in busy areas.\nClimate change activists are also marching in Swansea, Bangor, Llangollen and Holyhead while the Cardiff demonstration will finish in a rally outside the Senedd.\nThe 200 countries at the COP26 conference were asked cut emissions by 2030 and to keep global warming to 1.5C to avoid a climate catastrophe - before reaching net zero in 2050.\n\"More people than ever now realise behaviour change is only part of the solution as we can only ever make changes within the capitalist systems and infrastructure we are given,\" said Cardiff demonstration organiser Clare James.\n\"We know that COP26 is unlikely to deliver the solutions we need, so we're encouraging everyone to join us and demand a system change for future generations, because it's what we do together once COP26 is over that will be more important.\"\nThe demonstration in Cardiff started outside City Hall at noon before hearing speeches from campaigners outside the Welsh Parliament building in Cardiff Bay.\nWales' future generations commissioner Sophie Howe said while \"we have seen solid actions from governments, there's a lot more we need to do\".\n\"Please don't underestimate the power of your actions,\" she said in a message to activists.\n\"It is the power of citizens from across the world who are scrutinising their governments and holding them to account.\n\"Working together to make sure we're holding policy makers to account, I believe there is a real chance in Wales that we can and will say we're acting today for a better tomorrow.\"\nAt the march in Cardiff, which was attended by about 1,000 people, Meriel Harrison who works for the RSPB wildlife charity said: \"Nature and the climate emergency are so interlinked.\n\"We're not going to help one without solving the other. \n\"It's nature day at COP26 today in Glasgow so it's important we stand up for nature and make sure that nature's voice is heard in the climate negotiations.\"\nMariska from Cardiff, who attended the event with her two daughters Maia, five, and Vesper, three, said her eldest was \"very interested in climate change\".\n\"As a mother I think it's a good thing to take my kids to and educate them,\" she said.\nCardiff, Glasgow, London and 14 other UK cities are marching for \"just and fair solutions\" to the crisis as the United Nations climate talks continue in Scotland.\nAcross Wales, rallies are taking place in Bangor, with others expected in Llangollen, Newtown, Pontypridd, Swansea and Ruthin while there will be a tiny forest planting day in Caerphilly.\nThe march in Bangor started from the city's pier and included a range of speakers, including scientists and campaigners from Friends of the Earth Cymru and Bangor and Conwy Extinction Rebellion.\n\"The impacts of runaway climate change are almost too awful to contemplate, and the people who will be worst hit are typically those who have done the least to cause the problem,\" organisers said.\nThe protests and sports events could have an impact on local infrastructure - and, in Cardiff, some roads immediately around the Principality Stadium were shut at 07:00 ahead of the Wales rugby international. \nThere is a full Cardiff city centre road closure from 13:30 until 20:30 around the game which kicks off at 17:30.\nPublic transport operators have warned trains and buses are expected to be busier than normal and Transport for Wales has warned social distancing \"is not going to be possible on the majority of match-day\" trains.\nFace coverings are mandatory on public transport in Wales - unless you are exempt - to help prevent the spread of Covid while Welsh Rugby Union bosses have warned fans they must also wear masks inside the Principality Stadium.\nTfW has promised \"additional capacity\" on their busiest routes into Cardiff on Saturday with \"all available carriages in service\".\nIt added: \"We have measures in place to keep passengers safe including hand sanitiser at stations, enhanced cleaning regimes on trains and stations and queuing systems to control the flow of people into stations and on to trains.\n\"It is vital customers allow plenty of time to get into Cardiff prior to kick-off and familiarise themselves with the post-event queuing systems.\"\nAfter last Saturday's Wales rugby game in Cardiff, the health minister said she was concerned what \"Christmas will look like if we see the kind of scenes that we saw in Cardiff on the weekend everywhere in Wales\".\nEluned Morgan told the Senedd on Tuesday that if rates continue to go up then Covid passes will be required for pubs and restaurants.\nIt comes as First Minister Mark Drakeford warned scrapped Covid restrictions could be brought back in at the Welsh government's next review on 19 November so people could have a \"normal\" Christmas.\nAlthough infection rates are falling, Wales has the UK's highest Covid case rate, but coronavirus hospital admissions remain relatively low. \nHowever, there are 73 Covid patients in critical care beds and these are the highest levels since February."

      "tags": "Infrastructure,US Congress,Joe Biden",
      "text": "President Joe Biden has hailed the passage of his landmark $1tn (\u00a3741bn) infrastructure spending package as a \"monumental step forward\". \nNegotiations over the sweeping public works bill - which passed the House of Representatives with 228-206 vote - created a bitter split among Democrats.\n\"Finally, infrastructure week,\" Mr Biden told reporters. \"I'm so happy to say that: infrastructure week.\"\nA more ambitious social spending bill favoured by liberals was put on hold.\nThe infrastructure package now heads to Mr Biden's desk to be signed into law.\nBilled as a \"once-in-a-generation\" spending measure, the infrastructure legislation proposes $550bn in new federal expenditure, over the next eight years, to upgrade highways, roads and bridges, and to modernise city transit systems and passenger rail networks.\nThe agreement also sets aside funding for clean drinking water, high speed internet, and a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging points.\nIt is the largest federal investment in the country's infrastructure for decades and is seen as a major domestic win for the US president.\n\"We took a monumental step forward as a nation\", Mr Biden told reporters. \"We did something that's long overdue... a once-in-a-generation investment that's going to create millions of jobs modernising infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our broadband, all range of things\". \nIt will be financed in several ways, including unspent emergency relief funds from the Covid pandemic.\nIts passage marks a huge achievement for the Biden administration amid low approval ratings and a defeat for the Democrats in Virginia's gubernatorial election this week.\nThree months ago, 19 Republicans joined with Democrats to approve the legislation in the evenly split Senate, a rare bipartisan feat in an increasingly divided Congress.\nOn Friday the bill passed the House with support from 13 Republicans, too. But more liberal lawmakers balked at its final version, complaining that key liberal policies had been dropped in exchange for the bipartisan win. \nSix Democrats voted against it, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. The group of six - dubbed The Squad - are among the most left-wing and progressive members of the House.\nMembers of the Congressional Progressive Caucus pledged they would not support the infrastructure bill until they had voted on a separate social welfare bill that allocates $1.75tn for healthcare, education and climate change initiatives.\nIf passed, it would usher in the biggest expansion of the US safety net in more than 50 years.\nDemocrats control both chambers of Congress by very slim majorities, so near-universal support would be required for the bill's passage.\nCentrist Democrats continue to object to the size and scope of the sprawling bill. They are insisting on seeing full accounting of its economic impacts.\nOn Friday House leaders brokered a compromise, insisting on a vote on the infrastructure bill, accompanied by a procedural vote to start debate on the social spending bill. The chamber passed the procedural vote early on Saturday by 221 votes to 213.\nCompiling an independent assessment of the social spending bill's full cost is expected to take at least two weeks, although Democratic leaders have said they remain confident the bill will be passed before the Thanksgiving holiday at the end of November.\nAfter months of haggling, brinksmanship and trips back to square one, Joe Biden's bipartisan infrastructure bill is on the verge of becoming infrastructure law.\nFinal passage in Congress was secured by a deal forged between liberals and centrists in the Democratic Party to approve the infrastructure bill now and hold a vote in the House of Representatives on a larger social spending package by 15 November.\nThat represents a leap of faith - and a tactical retreat - by the liberals who had been insisting that the infrastructure and spending bills be approved simultaneously. It was a leap too far for the handful of liberals who still voted no. But with a few Republicans on board, and Joe Biden publicly pushing for a vote and promising progressives the spending bill would get its day soon, a path to passage emerged.\nOf course, promises can be broken - and there's still the possibility centrists could derail the spending package, either in the House or after it reaches the Senate. In the meantime, however, the infrastructure bill, with hundreds of billions of dollars for roads, bridges, pipes and green energy, has reached the finish line, giving Mr Biden a signature bipartisan legislative victory."

      "text": "Greta Thunberg has told a mass rally in Glasgow that the COP26 climate summit has been a \"failure\". \nThe Swedish activist had earlier joined thousands of young people - including striking school pupils - for a march through the city.\nShe addressed the crowd when it arrived in George Square, saying \"immediate and drastic\" cuts to emissions are needed. \nThe march was organised by Fridays for Future Scotland, a group founded by youngsters inspired by Ms Thunberg.\nIt was one of the largest of a series of demonstrations taking place throughout the summit, which is being held in the city.\nMs Thunberg said: \"It is not a secret that COP26 is a failure. It should be obvious that we cannot solve a crisis with the same methods that got us into it in the first place.\"\nShe said: \"We need immediate drastic annual emission cuts unlike anything the world has ever seen.\n\"The people in power can continue to live in their bubble filled with their fantasies, like eternal growth on a finite planet and technological solutions that will suddenly appear seemingly out of nowhere and will erase all of these crises just like that.\n\"All this while the world is literally burning, on fire, and while the people living on the front lines are still bearing the brunt of the climate crisis.\" \nShe described the UN climate change summit as a \"two-week long celebration of business as usual and blah, blah, blah\" to \"maintain business as usual\" and \"create loopholes to benefit themselves\".\nMs Thunberg added: \"We know that our emperors are naked.\"\nActivists from several other countries also gave speeches about how climate change is already affecting their homelands. \nThey included Vanessa Nakate from Uganda, who said: \"Historically, Africa is responsible for only 3% of global emissions and yet Africans are suffering some of the most brutal impacts fuelled by the climate crisis.\n\"But while the global south is on the frontlines of the climate crisis, they're not on the front pages of the world's newspapers.\"\nThe procession marched through the city's west end, past the COP26 site at the Scottish Events Campus, before heading towards the city centre.\nIt ended at George Square where a stage and speakers had been erected.\nCharlie O'Rourke, 14, from Glasgow, skipped school to attend the march with his mother Cairsty and his sister.\nHe said global leaders at COP26 must \"listen to the people\", adding: \"Don't just go for profit. Listen to what the planet needs.\"\nHis mother said she was there for her children and for \"the generations to come to just show that something has to happen and it has to happen very quickly\".\nFinlay Pringle, 14, from Ullapool in the Highlands, travelled by train to Glasgow with his father to take part in the march.\nHe said: \"If you really, truly love something and you want to protect it, no matter what it is, it doesn't have to be climate striking, but if there's something that you love and you want to protect it, then you should do that, don't think twice about it.\"\nThe wider Fridays for Future movement has seen young people around the world striking from school on a Friday to raise awareness of climate change.\nAnna Brown, an activist with Fridays for Future in Glasgow, said the event was aimed at demonstrating a need to move climate discussions away from \"enclosed\" spaces. \nShe told the BBC: \"The message is that the system of COPs - we've had 26 now -  isn't working. So we need to uproot that system. \n\"The message is you need to listen to the people in the streets, the young people, the workers.\"\nShe continued: \"We need to move it from being in an enclosed space where people can't get involved to the streets, where people can see what's happening and have a say.\n\"I think part of it is designed so people don't understand what it's about - if people don't understand what's being said in negotiations, they can't criticise what's happening and the decisions that are being made.\"\nAssistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie said it was \"hugely inspiring\" to see thousands young people take part in the \"spectacular event\" on the streets of Glasgow. \n\"This was a really important day in the COP26 schedule and we were pleased to be part of such a memorable event for these young participants and for Glasgow,\" he said. \n\"Our officers enjoyed engaging with young people, many have children of their own who were taking part in today's march.\"\nHe said there has been \"positive engagement\" between police and protestors during the summit and so far fewer than 20 arrests had been made - mostly for disorder type offences.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was committed to \"meaningful engagement\" between the Scottish government and young people and to involve them in decision-making.\nShe said: \"In Scotland, we are already acting to tackle the climate emergency, but, as we have heard from children and young people this week from Scotland and round the globe, is it not enough and we must do more.\"\nMeanwhile, the Prince of Wales expressed sympathy with the anger and frustration of the young activists in a speech addressing COP26 negotiators, telling delegates the \"weight of history\" was on their shoulders.\nHe said he had been invited to take part in the march, but would not be able to do so.\nIn London, Downing Street said young people missing school to attend the demonstration is \"extremely disruptive at a time when the pandemic has already had a huge impact on their learning\".\nHowever, Glasgow City Council and most neighbouring local authorities told the BBC that schoolchildren would not be punished for taking part in the climate strike.\nThey urged parents to let schools know if a pupil would be off for safety check purposes.\nOnly East Dunbartonshire told pupils they would be marked as having unauthorised absence if they did not attend school on the day of the march."

Our sincere condolences to his family.\"\nIn total, UB40 have recorded 39 UK top 40 singles and 28 top 40 albums, with Astro singing lead vocals on the hit Rat In Mi Kitchen which reached number 12 in 1987.\nThe group also enjoyed success around the world, including in the US, where Red Red Wine went to number one, as did another cover, Can't Help Falling in Love with You, which spent seven weeks at number one in 1993.\nThe original line-up played together for three decades before Ali Campbell left in 2008.\nIn an interview with the Guardian in May, Astro spoke about the band becoming the voice of working-class people's dissatisfaction with political and global issues after they formed in 1978.\nHe told the paper he experienced the \"same rigmarole as  most black people in the late 70s\", referring to a law which allowed people to be stopped and searched by police if they were deemed to be acting suspiciously - which Astro said was a \"weekly occurrence\". \n\"We found it harder to write love songs than militant lyrics, because it was a lot easier to write about stuff you had witnessed or read about. It seemed natural to us,\" he added.\nAfter the news of Astro's death broke, BBC Radio West Midlands played the UB40 track Sing Our Own Song as a tribute - with presenter Natalie Graham calling his death \"very, very sad\".\n\"Astro really was a wonderful and an incredible human being and obviously the legacy of the music that we still get to enjoy from the likes of UB40 is something very, very special,\" she said.\nHe acquired his nickname as a child because he wore a pair of Dr Martens boots with the model name \"Astronaut\", the musician explained in a 2016 interview with website UK Music Reviews.\n\"Fortunately, no one called me astronaut because it is rather a mouthful so they shortened it to Astro and it has stuck ever since,\" he added.\nAsked how he felt about touring and performing live, Astro said: \"There is no job on this planet that gives you the job satisfaction that I get. I live to be on stage.\"\nIn August, fellow UB40 founding member and saxophonist Brian Travers died of cancer aged 62.\nAdditional reporting by Adam Durbin."

As he was trying to get to Paul he saw a woman floating towards him.\n\"He gave the rope to a man and went in after the girl, he did CPR until the emergency services arrived.\"\nMs Williams said her son, who is a strong swimmer, was warned not to go in by people around him, but he said \"I'm going anyway\".\nMs Williams said after the five-minute rescue, he carried on his day - went back for his haircut and later went out for Halloween.\n\"We've always been proud of him,\" she added.\nFloral tributes have been left at the side of the river, where the incident happened. Paul O'Dwyer was described by family and friends as \"the life and soul of the party\" who devoted much of his time to charities.\nNeath Port Talbot councillor Matthew Crowley, who knew Mr O'Dwyer for most of his life, said: \"Paul immersed so much of his time and energy into charities. Whenever there was a charity event Paul would be the first one in fancy dress, he'd be the first one with a ra-ra skirt on.\n\"He loved all that... helping people and raising a few pound for good, worthwhile causes in the community.\"\nA 'paddle out' has been arranged on Aberavon beach Saturday 6 November by Aberavon Surf Club in Mr O'Dwyer's memory.\nMore than 20 police officers, as well as 30 firefighters from Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service, including specialist water rescue technicians, were involved in the rescue.\nTwo fire service boats helped with bank and river searches, which also involved coastguard teams and helicopters.\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service also sent several ambulances to the scene and took the injured woman to nearby Withybush Hospital.\nClare Rutter, paddle boarding instructor and member of South Wales Paddleboarders, said \"the main thing is always tell somebody your plans\" when going out on excursions. \nPutting phones in plastic waterproof cases for emergencies, wearing a buoyancy aid, dressing \"for the temperature of the water\", and training is also recommended she said.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford was one of many to pay his respects to those involved in the incident. \nHe tweeted to say he was \"deeply saddened\" and his thoughts were with those who had lost loved ones in this \"heart-breaking tragedy\"."

The group of six - dubbed The Squad - are among the most left-wing and progressive members of the House.\nMembers of the Congressional Progressive Caucus pledged they would not support the infrastructure bill until they had voted on a separate social welfare bill that allocates $1.75tn for healthcare, education and climate change initiatives.\nIf passed, it would usher in the biggest expansion of the US safety net in more than 50 years.\nDemocrats control both chambers of Congress by very slim majorities, so near-universal support would be required for the bill's passage.\nCentrist Democrats continue to object to the size and scope of the sprawling bill. They are insisting on seeing full accounting of its economic impacts.\nOn Friday House leaders brokered a compromise, insisting on a vote on the infrastructure bill, accompanied by a procedural vote to start debate on the social spending bill. The chamber passed the procedural vote early on Saturday by 221 votes to 213.\nCompiling an independent assessment of the social spending bill's full cost is expected to take at least two weeks, although Democratic leaders have said they remain confident the bill will be passed before the Thanksgiving holiday at the end of November.\nAfter months of haggling, brinksmanship and trips back to square one, Joe Biden's bipartisan infrastructure bill is on the verge of becoming infrastructure law.\nFinal passage in Congress was secured by a deal forged between liberals and centrists in the Democratic Party to approve the infrastructure bill now and hold a vote in the House of Representatives on a larger social spending package by 15 November.\nThat represents a leap of faith - and a tactical retreat - by the liberals who had been insisting that the infrastructure and spending bills be approved simultaneously. It was a leap too far for the handful of liberals who still voted no. But with a few Republicans on board, and Joe Biden publicly pushing for a vote and promising progressives the spending bill would get its day soon, a path to passage emerged.\nOf course, promises can be broken - and there's still the possibility centrists could derail the spending package, either in the House or after it reaches the Senate. In the meantime, however, the infrastructure bill, with hundreds of billions of dollars for roads, bridges, pipes and green energy, has reached the finish line, giving Mr Biden a signature bipartisan legislative victory."

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change,Glasgow",
      "text": "About 100,000 people marched in Glasgow to demand more action on the climate crisis, organisers have said.\nThe protest was the biggest so far during the COP26 summit and took place alongside hundreds of similar events around the world.\nGreta Thunberg joined the march but did not speak, leaving activists such as Vanessa Nakate to address a rally.\nPolice arrested 21 scientists who chained themselves together and blocked a road bridge over the River Clyde. \nOfficers also contained a group of socialist activists after pyrotechnics were set off during the march - one person was then arrested.\nHowever the force said the day passed \"largely without incident\". \nThe \"Global Day of Action for Climate Justice\" march started at Kelvingrove Park in the west of the city and Queen's Park in the south at about midday and made its way along a pre-agreed three-mile route to Glasgow Green.\nAbout 100 climate change demonstrations were held in other parts of the UK while events were also taking place in a further 100 countries including Kenya, Turkey, France, Brazil, Australia and Canada.\nIn London, protesters marched from the Bank of England to Trafalgar Square while another large demonstration happened in Cardiff. \nThe opening speeches at the protest rally at Glasgow Green came from representatives of indigenous people around the globe.\nUgandan activist Vanessa Nakate later told protesters: \"The climate and ecological crises are already here. But so are citizens from around the globe.\n\"Leaders rarely have the courage to lead. It takes citizens, people like you and me, to rise up and demand action. And when we do that in great enough numbers, our leaders will move.\"\nIt was understood that Greta Thunberg decided to give space to other speakers as she had already addressed youth activists in a march and rally on Friday.\nAway from the march, 21 protesters from Scientist Rebellion were arrested after chaining themselves together on the King George V Bridge in Glasgow city centre.\nCharlie Gardner, an associate senior lecturer at Durell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, said scientists could not \"rely on our leaders to save us anymore\" and had a \"moral duty to act\".  \nHe tweeted: \"Over 15,000 scientists declared that we're in a climate emergency, but most aren't acting as if it's an emergency.\n\"We're taking this action to encourage others, scientists and all people, to rise up in rebellion against the system that is killing everything.\"\nPolice Scotland closed the bridge to pedestrians and vehicles during the protest. \nA spokesperson said: \"We have facilitated a peaceful protest, but to balance right to protest with public safety and rights of the wider community, our protest removal team is safely removing protesters.\"\nAfter the event at Glasgow Green dispersed, Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie said the atmosphere had been \"generally good natured\", with people in \"high spirits\".\nHe confirmed one person had been arrested after a socialist group was contained and a further 21 were arrested following the King George V Bridge incident.\nHe said: \"Glasgow has today hosted a public protest the size and scale of which was beyond anything many of us - both within and outwith policing - can ever remember. I am pleased to say today has passed largely without incident. \n\"I want to thank the vast majority of those who attended both the Youth March and the Climate March for their positive attitudes and for following instructions from our officers.\"\nDespite the grim weather there was a carnival atmosphere at the start of the march in Kelvingrove Park, with one group playing steel drums to entertain the crowd. \nFlags and banners were blowing in the wind and most activists were sporting multiple layers in a bid to combat the cold and rain.\nOne enterprising local vendor who was selling whistles at the youth march on Friday was today offering ponchos for \u00a33.\nThere was a heavy police presence and officers paid particular attention to a group of socialist activists dressed in black and wearing red face masks. \nMembers of the group were still being closely monitored more than five hours later when they were among the last to arrive at Glasgow Green.\nA helicopter hovered overhead as the demonstration snaked through the west end and city centre.\nOne group set off a red flare in Finnieston but the march was good natured throughout and I saw no signs of any trouble.\nThe event was the largest protest in Glasgow since the Stop the Iraq War march in 2003 and groups representing a broad spectrum of causes, ranging from indigenous people to refugees, made for a colourful spectacle.\nThey were entertained along the way by acts including a bagpiper and a man singing karaoke dressed as Darth Vadar.\nOne of the highlights was a spontaneous outbreak of applause which greeted the marchers as they arrived in George Square.\nIt was summed by a banner which read: \"Glasgow Welcomes Climate Activists\".\nThe sun had come out by the time the mass protest arrived at Glasgow Green and some revellers even enjoyed a dance party outside the High Court in Glasgow.\nBut the huge crowd was later left disappointed when it emerged celebrated climate activist Greta Thunberg would not be addressing the rally.  \nWorld leaders and representatives who came to Glasgow for the climate change summit have so far made promises to curb deforestation, phase out coal, end funding for fossil fuels abroad and cut methane emissions.\nBut there is still a significant gap between the measures countries have committed to and what is needed to avoid more than 1.5C of warming, beyond which the worst floods, droughts, storms and rising seas of climate change will be felt.\nCountries are under pressure to agree on actions for the next decade, finance loans for developing countries to cope with the crisis and finalise the last parts of how the global Paris Agreement on climate change will work.\nAsad Rehman, a spokesperson for the COP Coalition, said: \"We are taking to the streets across the world this weekend to push governments from climate inaction to climate justice. \n\"This has been the least accessible climate summit ever - with so many people side-lined at the talks or not able to make it in the first place. Today those people are having their voices heard.\"\nRepresentatives of indigenous communities from North and South America joined the march in Glasgow. \nSome have no formal representation at COP26, despite living at the frontline of environmental destruction caused by mining or deforestation, because they are not recognised by their governments. \nMarchers came from across the UK to take part in the Glasgow march, including surfers from Cornwall.\nEdinburgh COP Coalition put on 13 coaches to travel to the event while a series of \"Pedal on COP26\" bike rides were organised from more than 20 areas of Scotland, the longest rides being from Inverness, Aberdeen and Dumfries setting off on Friday.\nThe cyclists brought up the rear of the march, which took near two hours to leave Kelvingrove Park, making the line of protesters almost two miles (3.2km) long.\nPolice said they blocked a section of the crowd between Holland Street and St Vincent Street because of \"congestion issues\". \n\"Following an escalation in their conduct a small number of people from the group who deliberately stopped on the parade route at the junction of Holland Street and St Vincent Street were contained by police on the grounds of public safety,\" a Police Scotland tweet said. \nBleak weather with heavy showers and gusts of wind greeted early arrivals to the march, but the weather improved over the afternoon. \nHigh winds, however, continued to cause a problem, hampering efforts to set up the main stage at Glasgow Green. and speakers instead used the stage company's lorry as a platform. \nSaturday's march came after many young activists - including striking school pupils - took part in a mass demonstration in the city on Friday.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

It could be worth \u00a3100,000 or more.\"\nThe Yorkshire Museum, in York, is assessing the item before a valuation is set.

      "tags": "British Transport Police",
      "text": "The British Transport Police (BTP) has apologised to the British African community for \"systemic racism\" and a corrupt officer in the 1970s.\nA number of young black people were jailed for crimes they did not commit.\nDerek Ridgewell gave false evidence at trials of groups of men including those who became known as the Waterloo Four, Oval Four and the Stockwell Six.\nCurrent BTP Chief Constable Lucy D'Orsi said: \"We cannot undo the past, but we can learn from it.\"\nIn the past two years, the wrongful convictions of the Oval Four and Stockwell Six were overturned at the Court of Appeal. In each case, a senior BTP officer offered an apology to the victims of the quashed case.\nHowever, Winston Trew, who was one of the Oval Four, suggested to BTWSC, an African history education group, that BTP apologise to the wider British African community.\nMr Trew, along with Sterling Christie, George Griffiths and Constantine \"Omar\" Boucher were accused of stealing handbags in 1972. They spent eight months in prison for assaulting a police officer and attempted theft.\nThe Chief Constable said: \"I am sincerely sorry for the trauma suffered by the British African community through the criminal actions of former police officer DS Derek Ridgewell who worked in BTP during the 1960s and 70s. \n\"In particular, it is of regret that we did not act sooner to end his criminalisation of British Africans, which led to the conviction of innocent people. This is simply inexcusable and is something that my colleagues and I are appalled by.\"\nA judge halted a trial of the 'Tottenham Court Road Two' in 1973 when Det Sgt Ridgewell's evidence against two devout Jesuits from Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), who were studying at Oxford University, became too outlandish.\nHe was transferred from the underground to work in a south London mail depot investigating mail theft.  \nHe died of a heart attack in prison in 1982, serving a seven-year jail term.\nChief Constable D'Orsi said: \"The actions of DS Ridgewell do not define the BTP of today which is enriched by highly professional, kind and committed officers and staff who are passionate about protecting the public. I have also met retired officers who are equally appalled by the criminal actions of DS Derek Ridgewell. I acknowledge that, during those times, systemic racism played a role in the culture of the force, as it did across many parts of society.\n\"Moving forwards, I would like to engage and work closer with the British African community. We cannot undo the past, but we can learn from it. This is an important and sombre point of reflection in our history. \n\"BTP is committed to combating racism, which includes Afriphobia, which led to these historic cases that targeted African youths and destroyed lives.\n\"Finally, I would like to reiterate my sincere apology for the trauma caused to the British African community by a corrupt BTP officer, whose misuse of his powers caused harm not only to the innocent young people criminalised, but also to their families and community.\""

      "tags": "Music festivals,Texas,United States,Houston",
      "text": "At least eight people have died and scores of people have been hurt after a crowd surge on the opening night of a music festival in Houston, Texas. \nPanic broke out after the crowd began to press towards the front of the stage at rapper Travis Scott's Astroworld Festival, emergency officials said. \nEleven people were taken to hospitals in cardiac arrest and eight died. Some casualties are aged as young as 10. \nSome 50,000 people attended the outdoor event, which has been cancelled.  \nLina Hidalgo, the county judge of Harris County, described what had happened as an \"extremely tragic night\".\n\"Our hearts are broken,\" she said. \"People go to these events looking for a good time, a chance to unwind, to make memories - it's not the kind of event you go to where you expect to find out about fatalities.\" \nAstroworld said in a statement that their hearts were with the \"festival family... especially those we lost and their loved ones\", and they thanked local emergency services for their response.  \nThe incident began around 21:15 on Friday (02:15 GMT Saturday), Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a said.\n\"The crowd began to compress toward the front of the stage, and people began to panic,\" he told reporters.\nAs the crush began causing injuries to people, the panic grew, the official added.\nAccording to the Houston Chronicle, Travis Scott, who founded the festival, stopped multiple times during his 75-minute performance when he spotted fans in distress near the front of the stage. \nThe rapper asked security to make sure they were okay and help them out of the crowd. Emergency vehicles, lights and alarms flashing, cut through the crowds several times, the paper says. \nAmateur video from the concert appears to show fans jumping on an emergency vehicle in the crowd as the performance continues on stage.\nOrganisers halted the event when it was apparent that many people had been hurt, but the sheer scale of the casualties quickly overwhelmed the existing medical facilities, the fire chief added. \nFans pressed up against each other near the front of the main stage, eyewitnesses told the Chronicle. In some places, people were so crammed together that they started hyperventilating or struggling to leave.\n\"We were hanging on to each other to avoid getting separated,\" said a male concert-goer. \"If you let go, you could easily drift apart.\"\nA female concert-goer told the paper she had never been to a \"music festival with so many angry people\".\nSome 300 people were treated for injuries such as cuts and bruises on Friday. Judge Hidalgo said \"many\" of those killed at the festival had been \"tragically young\".\nA reunification centre has been set up at the Wyndham Houston Hotel for families who have not heard from loved ones at the festival.\nEarlier on Friday, hundreds of people had rushed the event's perimeter, knocking down metal detectors and a security screening area to get into the concert, news outlet ABC13 reports.\nSaturday was to have been the second and final day of the festival.\n\"Nobody could dream of this,\" said Houston Police Department Chief Troy Finner. \"But we're here, and I think it's very important that none of us speculate. Nobody has all the answers tonight.\"\nBy Joey Guerra, music critic for the Houston Chronicle, spoke to BBC Radio 5 Live\nI had been there for most of the day and there had been minor incidents throughout most of the day. When the gates opened people stampeded through and jumped metal detectors, and a few people got injured that way. I saw a couple of times people being taken out on stretchers. I'm not sure what the reasons were.\nDuring Travis Scott's set there were multiple times when you could see emergency vehicles with their lights on going through the crowd, but they would cut through and the show would go on. Travis Scott himself did stop the show several times to point out people near the front who were in distress or needed help and he would get security to come and help them. I don't think he was aware of the extent of what was going on.   \nTravis Scott is a rapper from Houston so this was particularly special for our city.\nThis is the third year of the festival. It is kind of an homage to an amusement park called Astroworld that was very popular here in Houston and that is not around anymore. He has kind of re-imagined this whole concept. There are carnival rides, games, different things that people who knew Astroworld back then are going to recognise here, and it has gotten bigger every year.  \nLive Nation, the event organiser, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, Reuters news agency reports.\nAstroworld is an annual event held at NRG Park since 2018, though it was put on pause last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic.  \nTravis Scott, 29, made his big breakthrough in 2013 and has since had eight nominations for Grammy Awards. He has a child with celebrity socialite Kylie Jenner. \nOther acts scheduled at the festival over the weekend included rappers Chief Keef and 21 Savage, and Australian rock act Tame Impala.\nDid you witness the incident?

Eligible patients can also book an appointment at a pharmacy.\nHealth officials in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales plan to cover similar groups - with some variation.\nIn Scotland, teachers, nursery teachers and support staff in close contact with pupils are being offered the jab. \nIn Northern Ireland secondary school children in their first year can have the vaccine. Older children are eligible if they are at risk.\nPeople not included in these groups can pay for a flu vaccine at pharmacies or some supermarkets, at a cost of about \u00a315.\nHowever, officials say vaccine supplies will be prioritised for people most at risk.\nFor many people it will typically last about two weeks, and get better on its own.\nHowever, for some, flu can be very serious - particularly for older adults, very young children and people with underlying health conditions.\nThe added concern this year is that some of these people are also at greater risk of getting seriously ill from Covid.\nAnnual flu deaths vary each year, depending on the strain and other factors. Social distancing is likely to have helped to keep the number low last year. \nThere were more than 22,000 estimated deaths in the 2017-18 season, but just under 4,000 deaths in 2018-19.\nIt can be hard to tell if you have flu or coronavirus as they sometimes share similar symptoms, including:\nSome people may also experience muscle aches, a headache, sore throat and diarrhoea and vomiting with flu. \nBut these symptoms can be seen with other common winter viruses too. \nIf any doubt, it's best to get a test.\nFlu and coronavirus can also be spread before people have symptoms.\nYes, in which case you are more likely to be seriously ill.\nResearch shows those infected with both viruses are more than twice as likely to die as someone with Covid alone.\nAbout 30 million people in the UK are being offered a booster jab against Covid, including the over-50s and younger adults with health conditions. \nThey may be offered the flu and booster jab at the same time - but only if it's practical.\nDeputy chief medical officer for England Professor Jonathan Van-Tam has said that it's safe to have both jabs simultaneously, and doesn't affect how well they work. \nMost side-effects are mild and only last a day or two, including a slightly raised temperature, muscle-ache and a sore arm where the needle went in. \nAllergic reactions are rare but you should avoid the vaccine if you have previously had a serious allergic reaction to a flu vaccine. \nPeople who have allergies to eggs should consult their pharmacist or GP to get a low-egg or egg-free vaccine. \nIt is best to avoid the vaccine if you are ill with a high temperature. You should re-book for when you are fully recovered.\nThere are several types of flu vaccine. \nChildren will typically be offered the vaccine via a a nasal spray. Adults are offered injections. \nFor adults aged 65 and over the most common vaccine includes an extra ingredient that triggers a stronger response from the immune system.\nIf you are getting your vaccine on the NHS, experts say you will be offered the one that is most effective for you - depending partly on your age and taking into account vaccine stocks.

But I'm more interested in what the people of Maine are telling me about it.\" \nSenator Capito told Politico she had received the call while in the car. Seeing a blocked number, Ms Capito thought it was Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a fellow West Virginian. \n\"I'm in my car. I'm driving. It says caller ID blocked. Honestly... I thought it was Senator Manchin. His calls come in blocked. And she goes 'Senator Capito?' I said, 'Yes.' She said, 'This is Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex,\" Ms Capito recounted.\nMeghan was reportedly given the senators' phone numbers by a Democratic colleague: New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Ms Gillibrand has been a vocal supporter of adding paid family leave to a massive spending bill now up for debate in Congress. \nRepresentatives for Senator Gillibrand, Senator Capito and the duchess did not respond to an immediate request for comment from the BBC.\nDemocrats on Wednesday moved to add paid family leave back into the $1.75tn (\u00a31.1tn) social spending and climate policy bill, an addition that is surely to face intense opposition, especially from Republicans and some moderate Democrats. \nThe US is the only wealthy nation with no national paid parental leave programme. \nSome 21% of US workers have access to paid family leave through their employers.\nIt is a cause apparently close to the duchess' heart. Last month, the mother of two and posted a letter to Congress on the website PaidLeaveforAll.org pushing for paid family leave in the US.\n\"I'm writing to you at this deeply important time - as a mom - to advocate for paid leave,\" she said. \"The working mom or parent is facing the conflict of being present or being paid.

      "tags": "Republic of Ireland,UK government,European Commission,John Major,Brexit",
      "text": "Former Prime Minister Sir John Major has said that triggering Article 16 and suspending parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol would be \"colossally stupid\".\nHe added that to suspend parts of the protocol \"would be absurd\".\nThe protocol is the special Brexit deal agreed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\nIt keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU.\nBut it also creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  \nThe EU has proposed measures to ease the checks and controls for goods crossing the Irish Sea.\nBut the UK is demanding fundamental reform and there is growing speculation it will trigger Article 16 - which allows parts of the protocol to be unilaterally suspended if they are causing serious difficulties - in the coming weeks.\nSir John told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that if the government did this, \"it would be seen as very bad faith indeed, it would be seen as irresponsible\".\n\"It would add to destabilisation in Northern Ireland, it would seriously damage relationships across the whole of Ireland north and south and the UK, it would erode relationships between Europe and the UK, it would damage relationships between Washington and London,\" he said.\nHe said the UK was negotiating over the protocol \"with all the subtlety of a brick\".\nHe added that triggering Article 16 would be a \"difficult and dangerous road to go down\" and the government would \"come to regret it\".\n\"It is not just a question of trade difficulties, it could, we have seen what has happened in Northern Ireland before, it could become much worse, they should be very, very careful about this.\"\nIn a statement, the UK government said that it had been \"consistently clear\" that it would prefer to \"settle the issues arising from the operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol consensually and reach a positive outcome through negotiations\". \nHowever, it said it was its responsibility \"to safeguard peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland, and we will use Article 16 if necessary\".\n\"The fundamental aim of the Protocol is to support the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement,\" it added. \n\"The Article 16 safeguards within it are provided to deal with the situation if the protocol ceases to support the BGFA (Belfast/Good Friday Agreement).  The UK Government will always act with that in mind.\"\nSir John said he suspected Article 16 would be triggered after the United Nations Cop26 climate summit being hosted by the UK in Glasgow has concluded.\nHe said critics might brand him a \"bitter old Remoaner\", but although he was a Remainer, he was not bitter, but \"disappointed and angry at the way the government has behaved\".\nSeparately, Sir John criticised the government's handling of former Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson's case as shameful and wrong.\nHe said the actions of Boris Johnson's government had trashed Parliament's reputation at home and abroad, and were \"un-Conservative\".\nThis week, the government tried to block the suspension of Mr Paterson, who had broken lobbying rules - but then reversed its decision.\nThe government has apologised.\nMr Major's comments about the protocol follow a meeting on Friday between European Commission (EC) Vice-President Maros Sefcovic and UK Brexit minister Lord Frost in Brussels over the protocol dispute. \nMr Sefcovic has warned there will be \"serious consequences\" if the UK triggers Article 16.\nBefore the meeting, Lord Frost had warned time was running out on the talks.\nHe had said the UK was not going to trigger Article 16 on Friday, although this was \"very much on the table and has been since July\".\nLord Frost added that if the gap narrowed, the commission listened to what was said in the UK command paper and looked at the situation in Northern Ireland, that could help move things forward.\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he expected to see decisive action on the protocol before the end of November.\nSir Jeffrey, whose party opposes the protocol, has said he would meet Lord Frost next week to discuss the issue."

She was known as the country's \"Queen of Suffering\".\nLast year, as concerts were cancelled because of the pandemic, she performed in a series of online gigs. One of them set the record of the most-watched live stream in the world, with 3.3 million peak viewers on YouTube.\nIn 2020, she was the most listened to artist in Brazil on Spotify.\nMendon\u00e7a, who had a two-year-old son, was set to perform at a concert on Friday evening in the city of Caratinga, 12km (seven miles) from the crash site. Hours before the accident, she posted a video on social media in which she prepared to board the private aircraft.\nThe singer's staff had initially said she was alive and well after news of the accident emerged. Television images later showed the damaged aircraft near a waterfall in a mountainous area.\nAfter her death was confirmed, Brazilian footballer Neymar said on Twitter: \"I refuse to believe, I refuse\". Singer Anitta said: \"I can't believe it. I want to believe that there is still hope\"."

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Owen Paterson,Lobbying in the United Kingdom,Lobbying",
      "text": "Former minister Owen Paterson has resigned as an MP after a backlash at the government's decision to block his suspension from parliament.\nMr Paterson is the Conservative MP for North Shropshire. He served as Northern Ireland secretary and environment secretary under David Cameron.\nSince leaving government he has been a paid consultant for Randox Laboratories and Lynn's Country Foods. He is paid \u00a38,333 a month by Randox for 16 hours work and \u00a32,000 every other month from Lynn's Country Foods for four hours work.\nThis is not against the rules, and he declared his positions in the public register of interests.\nHe was investigated by the Commissioner for Parliamentary Standards after being accused of breaking lobbying rules for MPs.\nThe commissioner found that, on behalf of the companies, he approached and met officials at the Food Standards Agency and ministers at the Department for International Development a number of times.\nHe also used his parliamentary office and stationery for his consultancy work and failed to declare his interests in some meetings, the report said.\nThe commissioner decided that the contact with officials and ministers were \"serious breaches\" of the rules.  \nMPs are forbidden from taking money to raise issues in the House of Commons or with the government. \nThe code of conduct politicians have to follow says there must be not conflicts of interest between their personal interests and public interest.\nMPs who are found to have broken the rules may be asked to apologise to the House of Commons or be suspended as an MP.\nThe Standards Committee called Mr Paterson's actions \"an egregious case of paid advocacy\" and recommended at 30-day suspension.\nMr Paterson has criticised the decision and the way the investigation was carried out.\nHe said his approaches to officials and ministers amounted to whistle-blowing. For instance, Randox's contact with the FSA was to warn them of illegal antibiotics that had been found in milk that was available in supermarkets. \nThere is an exemption in lobbying rules for MPs who are alerting the government to \"a serious wrong or substantial injustice\", even if doing so would lead to \"incidental\" financial or material benefit for the MP.\nMr Paterson has said he \"would not hesitate to act in the same way again if confronted with new information about serious harms or wrongs requiring urgent remedy\".\nThe commissioner said only one of his approaches to officials qualified for the whistle-blowing exemption.\nHe has argued that the investigation constituted an \"absolute denial of justice\" for a number of reasons, including his claim that several witnesses who had come forward in support of his case had been ignored. \n Mr Paterson accepted that he had broken the rules regarding stationary and apologised.\nLobbying is when an individual or a group tries to persuade a public figure such as an MP, a minister or a government official to support a policy or campaign.\nIt's a normal part of the democratic process and anybody can do it by signing a petition or writing to their MP, for example.\nMPs are expected to lobby on behalf of their constituents - they might try to persuade the government to build a new hospital in their constituency, for example.\nBut because lobbying by MPs is likely to be more effective than lobbying by the general public there are rules to make sure they do not take advantage of their position for reasons other than the best interests of the people who elected them.\nThey must declare any jobs they have or that a member of their family has that could influence their opinions. \nAnd they are not allowed to take money for raising issues in the House of Commons or with ministers.  \nApart from Mr Paterson, more than 20 MPs get paid for consultancy work, including former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, who is paid \u00a3182,600 per year for 32.5 days work.\nSir Ed Davey works as a consultant alongside his job as leader of the Liberal Democrats. He provides political and policy expertise to Herbert Smith Freehills, for six hours a month at \u00a35,000.\nOther MPs have second jobs as doctors, nurses, barristers and even a football referee. \nOn Thursday afternoon Mr Paterson announced that he would be resigning as an MP, saying the last few days had been \"intolerable\".\nHe criticised the investigative process, which doesn't allow MPs to bring appeals against judgements. \nLeader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said there was a \"very strong feeling on both sides of the House that there is a need for an appeals process\" and that he would work with other parties to make \"improvements\" to the system.  \nThere will be a by-election in Mr Paterson's constituency of Shropshire North, which the Conservative Party has held since its creation."

Several hundred passengers were evacuated.\nOne woman told the German newspaper Bild she was standing in the aisle when she heard other passengers screaming: \"There's a knife! Everyone get to the rear!\"\nThe train was halted at the station of Seubersdorf, roughly 70km (43m) south of Nuremberg, where the man was arrested.\nAccording to German media reports, the arrested man had been granted refugee status after entering Germany in 2014 and was suffering from \"psychological problems\".\nThe attack comes months after a Somali immigrant fatally stabbed three women in the city of W\u00fcrzburg.\nSimilar attacks in the past few years have exacerbated divisions in Germany as some of the perpetrators had arrived during the 2015 migrant crisis when Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the country's doors to some 900,000 asylum-seekers."

      "text": "Five of the UK's biggest supermarkets have promised to halve the environmental impact of a weekly food shop by the end of the decade.\nTesco, Sainsbury's, Waitrose, Co-op and M&S said they would reduce carbon emissions, deforestation and the food waste and packaging they produce.\nTheir efforts will be monitored by the WWF conservation group.\n\"Food production is one of the biggest threats to our planet,\" said WWF chief executive Tanya Steele said.\nThe chief executives of the supermarkets, which together serve more than half of UK food shoppers, said in a joint statement: \"We recognise that a future without nature is a future without food. By 2030 we need to halt the loss of nature.\"\nBefore the end of next year, they also promised to set science-based targets for how they would help to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures.\nThis is a key target for world leaders at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, with scientists saying it must be met to avoid the worst effects of climate change.\nCurrently, the world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods and forest fires are already becoming more intense. Unless more is done, the planet is already on track to warm by more than 2C by the end of this century.\nThe food industry is responsible for more than a quarter of total greenhouse gas emissions and almost 60% of the global damage to biodiversity, so minimising its impact could make a significant contribution to reducing climate change.\nEach year, the industry emits 17.3bn tonnes of carbon dioxide - about 19 times more than commercial planes.\nAbout a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, forestry and other land use - and experts say the way food is grown and consumed needs reforming.\nMs Steele from the WWF said the world could only tackle the \"climate and nature emergency\" if food retailers played their part.\n\"The promises these CEOs have made are game-changing and we hope other food retailers will follow in their footsteps, so that every shopper can be confident that the products they buy aren't fuelling the climate crisis and pushing precious wildlife closer to the brink,\" she said.\nLater, as the COP26 summit continues, it is expected that 45 governments, including the UK, will pledge urgent action and investment to protect nature and shift to more sustainable ways of farming. \nAnd, in a separate development, another 20 countries joined a global forum aimed at reducing deforestation from the production of commodities such as palm oil, cocoa and soya - the Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade (FACT) dialogue forum.\nMatt Williams, an expert from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit think tank, said \"food and farming have largely been missing from this summit so far\" but this \"plants the seeds\" for it to make a serious contribution to reaching net-zero emissions.\nAnother 27 countries also signed up to a sustainable agriculture pledge to help them meet their climate goals, and will use funding earmarked for agriculture subsidies to reduce emissions.\nAnd the UK government has announced a \u00a3500m programme which it said would help to protect over five million hectares of rainforests from deforestation - an area almost 20% of the size of the UK itself.\nBut Anna Jones at Greenpeace UK said the attempts to address the supply chains of the food industry were \"little more than a talking shop\".\nShe said \"there's nothing on the need to reduce demand for products like meat and dairy that are driving deforestation\".\nLarge-scale demonstrations are taking place in Glasgow, where the summit is being held, as well as in London and other cities in the UK and around the world.\nThe marches come after thousands of young activists, including Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate marched through Glasgow on Friday protesting against investment in fossil fuels and the failure to tackle the climate crisis."

which allows parts of the protocol to be unilaterally suspended if they are causing serious difficulties - in the coming weeks.\nMr Sefcovic said triggering Article 16 would be serious for EU-UK relations \"as it would mean a rejection of EU efforts to find a consensual solution to the implementation of the protocol\".\nHe said that despite a \"big move\" by the EU on its proposals, \"until today we have seen no move at all from the UK side\".\nFollowing Friday's meeting, a UK spokesperson said Lord Frost had indicated \"the EU's proposals did not currently deal effectively with the fundamental difficulties in the way the protocol was operating\".\n\"He underlined that the UK's preference was still to find a consensual solution that protected the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and the everyday lives of people in Northern Ireland,\" the spokesperson added.\nBefore the meeting, Lord Frost had warned time was running out on the talks.\nHe had said the UK was not going to trigger Article 16 on Friday, although this was \"very much on the table and has been since July\".\nThere is growing speculation that the UK is planning to use Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol in the coming weeks.\nThe Irish government says such a move would be \"reckless and irresponsible\", and Maros Sefcovic has warned it could result in \"serious consequences\".\nUltimately, the EU could impose tariffs on UK goods - but that would only be possible after a lengthy arbitration process.\nThe arbitrators would first have to find that the UK is in breach of the protocol.\nThen the UK would have to refuse to remedy that breach, at which point the EU could retaliate under the terms of the wider Brexit deal, the TCA.\nIt could require another arbitration process to rule whether the use of tariffs is proportionate retaliation.\nThere is a potentially faster legal track - known as infringement proceedings - which could lead to the UK being fined.\nRead the full analysis here.\nLord Frost added that if the gap narrowed, the commission listened to what was said in the UK command paper and looked at the situation in Northern Ireland, that could help move things forward.\nHe would not give a timescale on how long negotiations could last but said they were trying to reach agreement and were going to \"carry on trying\".\nThe European Commission has also ruled out talk about deadlines but it is understood the EU could look to legally challenge any move by the UK to trigger Article 16.\nUltimately, the EU could impose tariffs on UK goods, but that would only be possible after a lengthy arbitration process. \nEC spokesman Daniel Ferrie told reporters in Brussels on Friday that the commission was \"fully concentrated on finding solutions\". \nHe said the EU's proposals were \"far-reaching and ambitious\".  \nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he expected to see decisive action on the protocol before the end of November.\nSir Jeffrey, whose party opposes the protocol, said he would meet Lord Frost next week to discuss the issue.\n\"The protocol is harming Northern Ireland, it is harming our economy, it is harming our political place in the union and that's why I want to see new arrangements put in place that respect Northern Ireland's place within the UK internal market,\" he said.\n\"I hope agreement can be reached but if it can't then within weeks I want to see the UK government taking decisive action.\"\nThe EU accepts the Northern Ireland Protocol is causing difficulties for many businesses but its proposed measures to ease checks and controls for goods crossing the Irish Sea have not been accepted by the UK government.\nIt is seeking more wide-ranging reform of the protocol. \nLast month, Lord Frost said the UK government would not trigger Article 16 \"gratuitously or with any particular pleasure\".\nArticle 16 can be triggered if the protocol is leading to serious \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\" that are liable to persist.\nIf the UK was to use Article 16 to suspend most controls on goods going from GB to NI, that could cause significant problems for Ireland.\nIt could reopen questions about goods being controlled as they cross the Irish border or as they leave Ireland for the rest of the EU.\nTaoiseach (Irish PM) Miche\u00e1l Martin has said it would be \"irresponsible and reckless\" for the UK to trigger Article 16.\nMeanwhile, a survey has indicated that the protocol is not a top priority for most people across Northern Ireland, including unionists. \nUnionist parties in Northern Ireland oppose the protocol, as they say it undermines their place in the UK. \nIt ranked fourth on the list of priorities behind health, Covid recovery and the economy.\nThe survey also shows the majority of the 1,000 people asked would support remaining in the UK if a border poll was held \"tomorrow\".\nReacting to the survey, Sir Jeffrey said he did not agree that people do not care about the protocol, saying it was a \"big issue for many people, particularly those businesses that are being harmed\". \n\"They do care about the protocol and they also care, as I do, about other issues like health, like Covid recovery, the economy.\n\"These things are important and they are all inextricably bound up in our membership of the union.\"\nCommissioned by the University of Liverpool, the survey questioned people across all of Northern Ireland's council areas last month.\nOf those who responded, 39% described themselves as unionist, 26% nationalist and 33% neither unionist or nationalist\nThe survey indicated that just over 9% said the protocol was their biggest concern.  \nWhen broken down, just 12% of unionists said the protocol was the important issue for them.\nMore than 60% also said they wanted the Stormont Executive to remain in place until the Assembly election in May.\nWhen asked how they would vote in a border poll \"tomorrow\", 58% of those surveyed supported remaining in the UK, with 29% voting for a united Ireland."

Some 300 people were treated for injuries such as cuts and bruises on Friday.\nIn his first statement since the tragedy, the rapper thanked the police and emergency services and said he was \"committed to working together with the Houston community to heal and support the families in need\".\nSome 50,000 people were attending the two-day outdoor event, which has now been cancelled. \nAccording to the Houston Chronicle, Scott stopped multiple times during his performance when he spotted fans in distress near the front of the stage. \nThe rapper asked security to help them out of the crowd. Emergency vehicles, lights and alarms flashing, cut through the crowds several times, the paper says. \nAmateur video from the concert appears to show fans jumping on an emergency vehicle in the crowd as the performance continues on stage.\nA reunification centre has been set up at the Wyndham Houston Hotel for families who have not heard from loved ones at the festival.\nAstroworld is an annual event held at NRG Park since 2018, though it was put on pause last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. \nTravis Scott, 29, made his big breakthrough in 2013 and has since had eight nominations for Grammy Awards. He has a child with celebrity socialite Kylie Jenner, who also attended the concert. \nOther acts scheduled at the festival over the weekend included rappers Chief Keef and 21 Savage, and Australian rock act Tame Impala.\nAngelica Casas, BBC News, Houston\nThe night wasn't supposed to end like it did. Today, the streets surrounding the Astroworld festival grounds are still mostly closed off, and the venue is almost empty except for staff and a heavy police presence.\nEdward, a 25-year-old Houston native and a long-time Travis Scott fan, attended Friday's performances, and both previous Astroworld festivals.\nHe was right in the middle of the crowd when, he says, things began to get ugly. As the surge grew worse in a matter of minutes, desperate concert-goers tried to escape, pushing and pulling.\n\"I personally had a girl grab and hold on to me for dear life,\" he said. \"I had to calm her down because she literally thought she was about to die.\"\nEdward says he made a protective circle with his arms around her so she could catch her breath. He was able to pull her out of the crowd and help her to safety. As he walked out, he saw unconscious people around him, some already receiving CPR.\nAnother attendee, Andy Pacheco, filmed the moment concert-goer Seanna Faith, in a desperate plea for help, climbed on to a platform where a cameraman was stationed to ask him to do something about the crowd surge. She wanted the cameraman to call police or medics. But her plea for help was in vain.\nMs Faith later wrote online that she had just escaped a \"sinkhole\" of people as the crowding had become more intense. \nShe managed to pull herself and a friend out and was trying to get help for the others. \nPeople come to these festivals to escape reality and feel like they belong in a music community. On Friday night, that sense of belonging turned deadly. \nDid you witness the incident?

And if I am concerned at how the government is behaving, I suspect lots of other people are as well.\n\"It seems to me, as a lifelong Conservative, that much of what they are doing is un-Conservative in its behaviour.\"\n\"This government has done a number of things that have concerned me deeply: they have broken the law, the prorogation of Parliament. They have broken treaties, I have in mind the Northern Ireland Protocol. They have broken their word on many occasions.\"\nLet's be clear: Sir John Major has been a critic of Boris Johnson for some time.\nDuring the EU referendum he reckoned the NHS would be as safe under Mr Johnson and Michael Gove as a pet hamster would be with a \"hungry python\". \nAnd he voted for Jeremy Hunt, not Boris Johnson, to be Conservative leader, because, as he said at the time: \"I cannot vote for someone who was part of the Brexit campaign that misled the country.\"\nSo we shouldn't be surprised that he is a critic.\nBut nonetheless it is still quite something when a former Conservative prime minister delivers such a detailed, lengthy and withering critique as Sir John just has of the current Tory prime minister.\nHe went on to describe the government as \"perhaps politically corrupt\" in its briefing of parts of the press well in advance of any public announcement or statement to Parliament.\nAsked about reports Owen Paterson could receive a peerage, Sir John said he thought it \"would be rather extraordinary if that happens\" - adding that he was unsure it would be approved.\nSir John's own Conservative government in the 1990s was brought down in part due to allegations of sleaze and the cash-for-questions scandal where MPs were offered money in exchange for asking parliamentary questions. \nThis was \"immensely damaging, it was embarrassing, it hurt Parliament\", Sir John said. \n\"When that happened I set up the Nolan Committee on Standards in Public Life to stop it, which has been a huge success.\n\"The striking difference is this: in the 1990s I set up a committee to tackle this sort of behaviour.\n\"Over the last few days we have seen today's government trying to defend this sort of behaviour.\"\nLiberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said Sir John's comments were \"astonishing\" and a damning indictment of the party under Mr Johnson. \nThe handling of Mr Paterson's case was just the latest in a long line of attempts to undermine \"democratic traditions\", she said.\nFormer Justice Secretary David Gauke, who had the Tory whip removed after he voted against Mr Johnson's Brexit deal and subsequently lost his seat in the 2019 general election, said the type of behaviour - undermining checks and balances, failing to abide by the highest standards of integrity - was not something the government should be willing to tolerate.\nA government spokesperson said: \"As the prime minister has said, paid lobbying and paid advocacy by ministers and MPs is absolutely wrong. \n\"All elected officials must abide by the rules of conduct, as the public have a right to expect.\"\nSir John also warned Boris Johnson that suspending parts of Northern Ireland's Brexit deal would be \"colossally stupid\" and dangerous.\nHe said doing so would further destabilise Northern Ireland, and damage relations with the rest of Europe and the US.\nCurrent negotiations, he said, were being conducted with \"all the subtlety of a brick\".\nThe government insisted it would prefer to settle its issues with the Northern Ireland protocol consensually - through negotiations - but said it would use Article 16 \"if necessary\", which would effectively suspend elements of the arrangement."

      "text": "People living in England will be able to book their coronavirus booster jabs a month in advance under government plans to speed up their rollout.\nCurrently, people cannot book their top-up vaccines until six months have elapsed since their second dose.\nBut from Monday, those aged 50 and over, plus those most at risk, will be able to book after five months.\nIt means they could receive their booster on the day they reach the six-month milestone.\nNHS England is introducing the change to accelerate the rate of take-up of booster jabs, to help prolong protection against the virus.\nExperts say while two vaccine doses give people high levels of protection, immunity reduces over time, particularly for at-risk groups. \nThe added concern is that even small dips in vulnerable people's immunity will affect the NHS's ability to cope this winter.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said vaccines were the best way to protect people ahead of a \"challenging winter\".\nHe said: \"This will accelerate the booster programme, ensure the NHS is able to vaccinate people as quickly as possible, and importantly, help more people maintain protection against Covid-19, as we know immunity will dip over time.\"\nThe government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) estimates the protection against needing hospital treatment for a Covid infection falls:\nPeople are eligible for a booster jab in the UK if:\nIt must also have been six months (182 days) since their second dose.\nRules about who is eligible for a booster are the same throughout the UK. \nIn Scotland, people will be able to book boosters online from later this month. In Wales and Northern Ireland people will be invited to book an appointment and for most people this will happen at least six months after their second jabs.  \nRead more here.\nThe UK got off to a fast start with its vaccine programme - jabbing the most vulnerable with first doses ahead of almost every other country in the world - but some have criticised the booster rollout for being too slow.\nSo far, some nine million people in the whole of the UK have been given a third top-up jab to prolong immunity.\nThe average number of boosters given daily was about 293,000 in the week leading up to Monday, according to the latest vaccine statistics. \nEarlier this week, the Labour Party called on the government to set a target of administering 500,000 Covid booster jabs a day. \nShadow health minister Rosena Allin-Khan told the House of Commons: \"On current trends we won't complete the booster programme until spring 2022. The government needs to get a grip and set a target of 500,000 boosters a day.\" \nBoosters are considered to be a key part of preventing the reintroduction of some restrictions as part of the government's Plan B for winter if the situation should worsen. \nOn Wednesday, England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam cautioned it could be a difficult winter ahead  and urged people to get their boosters.\nAnd last week the Welsh government warned of a possible return to a return of some Covid restrictions to allow a \"normal\" Christmas.\nLast month, the guidance was changed so that those at highest risk - including people in care homes - can already receive their boosters slightly earlier - five months after a second vaccine.\nIn England, people can also book jabs by calling 119 or by going to walk-in sites across the country, without an appointment, six months after their second dose."

      "text": "Environmental activist Greta Thunberg is in Glasgow, where the COP26 summit is taking place.\nThe 18-year-old is one of the world's best known climate campaigners.\nGreta Thunberg has called the climate summit a \"failure\" and a \"PR exercise\". \nShe told a youth protest in Glasgow that world leaders had had \"26 COPs, they have had decades of blah, blah, blah - and where has that got us?\".\nShe has also criticised goals for cutting emissions which cause global warming, saying: \"We don't just need goals for just 2030 or 2050. We, above all, need them for 2020 and every following month and year to come.\"\nHowever, Thunberg has avoided getting into the detail of what action should be taken, saying \"it is nothing to do with me\". \nThunberg became well-known after she protested outside the Swedish parliament in 2018, when she was 15.\nShe held a sign saying \"School Strike for Climate\", to pressure the government to meet carbon emissions targets.\nHer small campaign had a global effect, inspiring thousands of young people across the world to organise their own strikes. \nBy December 2018, more than 20,000 students - from the UK to Japan - had joined her by skipping school to protest.\nA year later, she received the first of three Nobel Peace Prize nominations for climate activism.\nIn 2019, Thunberg sailed across the Atlantic on a yacht to attend a UN climate conference in New York.\nDelivering what is probably her most famous speech, she angrily told world leaders they were not doing enough.\n\"You all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\" she said.\nThunberg was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year in December 2019.\nThunberg has received support from climate activists, scientists and public figures.\nBroadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough told her she has achieved things many others have failed to do, adding: \"You have aroused the world. I'm very grateful to you.\"\nPrince Harry praised Thunberg's campaigning, saying \"every country, every community, every school, every friendship group, every family needs their own Greta\".\nAlok Sharma, the president of the COP26 summit, has said that Thunberg's UN speech in 2019 had made him feel \"really uncomfortable\" because it held up a \"mirror\" to his generation.\nBut not all politicians have been as complimentary. \nDonald Trump tweeted that she should \"work on her anger management problem\" while Russian President Vladimir Putin described her as a \"kind but poorly informed teenager\".\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nThunberg has Asperger syndrome, a developmental disorder, and has described it as a gift. She said being different can be a \"superpower\".\nThunberg's mother, Malena Ernman, is an opera singer and former Eurovision Song Contest participant. \nHer father Svante Thunberg, is an actor and a descendant of the scientist who created a model of the greenhouse effect.\nWhat questions do you have about changes in our climate? \nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

Some went to prison. And all, even the innocent were tarred. \nI can recall one MP, blameless in his expenses claims, telling me how he decided to leave Parliament at the next election, because someone, recognising his partner in a constituency supermarket, spat at her. \nAnother who ran a marathon for charity, recalled a derisive shout from a spectator, \"I bet you're claiming expenses for this, aren't you.\"\nBeyond the details of the Owen Paterson case, the worry for all parliamentarians is that a feeding frenzy of investigations of other individuals will follow, tainting the innocent as well as the guilty. \nMaybe Sir Keir Starmer and Labour will hope history repeats itself, and they can run against a discredited government. \nThe stakes are high.

There are also requirements for military and federal contractors.\nBut opponents say it is not constitutional for a president to impose such a sweeping nationwide rule.\nRepublican Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who has opposed government mandates on vaccines and masks, applauded the court's decision.\n\"We will have our day in court to strike down Biden's unconstitutional abuse of authority,\" he said.\nBut Labor Department solicitor Seema Nanda said it was \"confident in its legal authority\" to issue the rule.\n\"We are fully prepared to defend this standard in court,\" she said."

      "text": "\"I was upset and really disappointed,\" says Tammy Banks, reflecting on the row in Parliament this week over the policing of MPs' conduct. \nIn her day-to-day life, she runs a training and development company specialising in team building, coaching and mentoring. \nBut she is also one of seven members of the public that sit on the Commons Committee on Standards - making rulings on whether MPs have broken their code of conduct. \n\"I have real faith in the current system,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Week in Westminster. \n\"I think people have a perception that it is lay members versus MPs on the committee because there are seven [members of the public] and seven MPs, but it isn't like that at all.\n\"Not only do we have the voting majority, but actually everybody acts as individuals, so the debates are really, really intense and everybody comes from different perspectives and brings that in, whether they're a lay member or an MP.\"\nBut that system came under fire this week as a result of the case of Conservative MP Owen Paterson.\nThe committee recommended Mr Paterson be suspended for 30 sitting days for an \"egregious\" case of breaking lobbying rules, which was a tough enough sanction to lead to a recall petition and a by-election in his seat. \nBut his Conservative allies believed he had been treated unfairly during the investigation into his conduct without a fair chance to appeal the committee's findings, and Mr Paterson himself continued to deny any wrongdoing.  \nWith the backing of the government, they went to the Commons to block the suspension and instigate a overhaul of the committee and the role of the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, Kathryn Stone. \nThey won their vote, but it led to a furious backlash from opposition MPs, as well as some on the government's own benches, and saw No 10 perform a screeching U-turn due to a lack of cross-party support.\nMr Paterson himself then resigned as an MP within hours, still protesting his innocence but wanting a life \"outside the cruel world of politics\".  \nEducation Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said backtracking on the \"mistake\" was the \"grown-up thing to do\".\nBut he said it was right for the government to continue with one part of its proposals - introducing a \"right of appeal\" for MPs under investigation - and it would be holding talks with MPs of all stripes.\n\"I've given four years of my life to this system because I really believe in it,\" said Ms Banks. \n\"I sit on the committee and I see the dedication, the passion and the commitment of everybody around that table.\"\nThe charity CEO was particularly distressed by the attacks she saw made on the standards' commissioner - with newspapers reporting a particular rift between No 10 and Ms Stone, ministers saying she should consider her position, and senior Tory MP David Davis calling her \"amateurish\". \n\"[I have seen] some of the slanderous comments about the commissioner... which I have just been appalled by,\" said Ms Banks. \n\"She works hard, she does her best and above everything else she is fair. Its been really hard to sit on the side-lines and see some of that happening.\"\nBut Ms Banks said she ended the week feeling more \"positive\" after support for the committee from all sides of the House. \n\"I think that within any system there is always room for improvement,\" she said.\n\"So I would welcome any type of review, and if reform is needed, then I think that is something that can be explored.\n\"But I can honestly say that if I was an MP, I would have real faith in the current system. It really is diligent.\"\nMs Banks also hopes the silver lining of the week's row would be more of the public understanding how the process works. \n\"When I joined the committee, I had only a very limited view of what the committee did and actually what happened in Parliament and how Parliament really worked,\" she said.\n\"I have learnt so much over the last four years and hopefully this process becoming 'newspaper worthy', so to speak, will reassure the public.\"\nShe concluded: \"If this whole debacle has made people more aware of the system and of how the system works then I think that can only be a good thing.\"\nYou can listen to The Week in Westminster at 11:00 GMT on Saturday 6 November on BBC Radio 4, or you can listen back to the programme on BBC Sounds.

Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

And I'd get really bloated. It was so bad that I couldn't wear any of my normal trousers or jeans. I just lived in leggings instead.\n\"I was tired and moody and couldn't do things that I would normally enjoy, like going out for a meal with mates.\"\nLaura says she was \"fobbed off\" by some healthcare professionals who, she says, dismissed her condition and recommended laxatives for one of her symptoms - constipation. \nShe is now under Prof Parkes's care and has found ways to better manage her condition. \n\"It's much better now, and if I do have a flare-up there I things I can do to change it.\"\nMedication may be needed, but there are some other things that can help too.\nTo ease bloating, cramps and wind, consider:\nFor constipation:\nFor diarrhoea:\nSource: NHS "

introducing a \"right of appeal\" for MPs under investigation.\nHe told the BBC that allowing MPs to formally appeal against the published conclusions of the MPs' standards watchdog \"speaks to British values\". \nMr Zahawi also denied claims Prime Minister Boris Johnson wanted the system changed to avoid an inquiry into the redecoration of his Downing Street flat.\nBut speaking to reporters later, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the government's actions were \"all about\" stopping investigations into the PM.\n\"It's because Boris Johnson does not want to be held [to] account for his actions,\" she added.\nThe row began on Wednesday when the government ordered its MPs to oppose a 30-day suspension for Mr Paterson and review the whole investigation process.\nThe Commons Standards Committee had proposed the sanction after a damning report by Parliament's standards commissioner Kathryn Stone found he had misused his position as an MP to benefit two firms he worked for as a paid consultant.\nBut after fierce criticism from opposition parties and some Conservative MPs, who refused to vote for the move, Downing Street backtracked, meaning Mr Paterson would face suspension after all.\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there was anger among some Tories that they had been ordered to vote for the controversial plan only to see it dropped the following day, with one telling her it had \"destroyed a lot of goodwill\" with Downing Street.\nOn Friday, No 10 said Mr Johnson had \"full confidence\" in Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg and chief whip Mark Spencer, who reportedly pushed Tory MPs hard to back the changes.\nChris Bryant, chairman of the Commons Standards Committee, told the i newspaper that Mr Rees-Mogg's position was \"untenable\" after the government's U-turn on Thursday.\nMr Bryant said: \"I personally think the Leader of the House's position has become untenable. \n\"He has created a crisis for Parliament by standing out and talking for 45 minutes in favour of a motion that was the direct, polar opposite of the rule of law.\"\nAfter Thursday's U-turn, Mr Paterson, who denies wrongdoing, announced he would stand down as MP for North Shropshire and seek a life \"outside the cruel world of politics\". \nHe has insisted his approaches to ministers had been to alert them about defects in safety regulations, and that the probe into his behaviour was unfair. \nOn Friday, the former environment and Northern Ireland secretary also said he would be \"stepping aside\" from his consultancy work.\nA spokesperson for one of his employers, healthcare diagnostics company Randox, said it acknowledged his desire to step down \"at this difficult time\" and they wished \"Owen and his family well in their future endeavours\".\nLabour has confirmed it intends to stand a candidate in the by-election to replace him - after initially exploring the idea of teaming up with other opposition parties to back an independent \"anti-sleaze\" candidate in the contest.\nSpeaking on Friday, Mr Zahawi said the government still wanted to change the standards system but it had \"made a mistake\" in attempting to \"conflate\" this with Mr Paterson's case.\nHe said the government now wanted to \"separate those things out\" and \"do this properly\".\n\"To admit a mistake, I think, is the right thing to do, and the grown-up thing to do,\" he added.\nHe insisted ministers would continue to put forward plans for a \"fairer system\" for investigating MPs, including giving them the right to appeal against the watchdog's findings. \nHowever, it remains unclear whether opposition parties will collaborate with the government over its plans for reform. \nAsked on Friday whether Labour would co-operate, Ms Rayner said her party did not want to link any potential talks to any particular case. \nBut she added: \"If there are discussions outside of individual cases about how we can improve systems, then of course we'll have those discussions.\" \nLabour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats had all vowed to boycott a special committee Tory MPs had wanted to set up to conduct a review.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said Mr Johnson \"must explain how he intends to fix the immense harm he has done to confidence in the probity of him and his MPs\".\nLabour and the SNP have also insisted Standards Commissioner Kathryn Stone must be allowed to continue her work scrutinising other MPs.\nOn Friday, Labour called for the commissioner to investigate whether the prime minister needed to declare a free holiday he received last month in the MPs' register of interests.\nIt came after Mr Johnson declared his stay at a Spanish villa owned by the family of Tory minister Lord Goldsmith in a separate list of ministers' interests.\nThe PM's spokesman has argued this was the correct place for Mr Johnson to declare the holiday, as it was provided by another minister. \nMr Paterson has been a paid consultant for clinical diagnostics company Randox since 2015 and to meat distributor Lynn's Country Foods since 2016, earning a total of \u00a3100,000 a year on top of his MP's salary.\nMPs are allowed to have these jobs, but are not allowed to be paid advocates - using their influence in Whitehall for the company's gain.\nThe committee concluded that Mr Paterson had breached this rule on paid advocacy by:\nMr Paterson was also found to have broken conduct rules by:\nFull guide to the controversy\nWho's who in the Owen Paterson row?"

      "text": "Costa Rica has become the first country in the world to make Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for children.\nThe jab will join the extensive list of basic childhood vaccinations already required by law, health officials said.\nThe country signed a deal with Pfizer to acquire doses to start vaccinating all under-12s from March 2022.\nEarlier this week, the US health regulatory bodies approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for children aged five to 11.\nMost children are unlikely to get seriously ill if they catch Covid-19 but may still be infectious, even with no symptoms. The vaccine could help stop them from spreading the virus to others.\nCosta Rica's deal with Pfizer will see it receive 3.5 million doses, of which 1.5 million will be reserved for those aged five to 11. The others will be for third doses to be given to first responders, the elderly population and immunosuppressed people.\nTo date, about 55% of the population have been fully vaccinated in the country, according to Our World in Data figures. \nMore than 70% of those aged between 12 and 19 have now received at least one dose of the vaccine, officials say.\nThe US decision to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for children aged five to 11 has cleared the way for 28 million young Americans to get vaccinated. They are given a jab with a third of the dosage administered in adults.\nOfficials at the Food and Drug Administration determined that the vaccine was around 91% effective in preventing Covid-19 in young children, and that their immune response was comparable to that seen in people aged 16 to 25. No serious side effects were found by researchers.\nMore countries are expected to follow suit."

Morgan will always be in our hearts and our memories. We will miss her dearly.\"\nMorgan was described as \"the best that she could be\".

She was amazing in every way.\n\"She has left a void in our lives that will never be filled.\"\nShe worked for the Cardiff and Vale health board as a specialist in poisons information, providing advice to healthcare professionals managing poisoned patients.\nA statement from colleagues described her as a \"gifted and dedicated scientist\" who made significant contributions to the field of toxicology and presented her work at an international level.  \n\"She will be remembered for her calm, friendly and totally professional manner - even when faced with the most difficult of cases,\" they said.\n\"Through her lovely personality, Nikki made many friends during her time in public service and will be sorely missed by her friends and colleagues.\"\nOne of those on the trip, Vickie Mckinven from Milford Haven, said Mr O'Dwyer died attempting to rescue two fellow paddleboarders who had got into difficulty near the weir.\nThe family of Mr O'Dwyer said he \"gave his life to save others\", describing him as a \"devoted husband, father, son and brother\". \n\"He devoted his life to contributing to society in his many adventures in raising money for different causes,\" his family said.\n\"Paul was a water baby.

The explosion occurred when people tried to collect the fuel, the NDMA said. \nOne report said a bus was completely burnt, while nearby shops and market stalls were caught up in the flames.\nBrima Bureh Sesay, the head of Sierra Leone's National Disaster Management Agency, said there were many \"burnt corpses\".\n\"It's a terrible, terrible accident,\" he told local media in a video shared from the scene. \nUmaru Fofana, freelance journalist, Freetown\nAt the scene of the accident, there are body parts still lying in burnt-out vehicles. Also here are what's left of the petrol tanker and the truck that rammed into it. \nMotorbike-taxi riders nearby started collecting the leaking fuel, causing a traffic jam. Shortly after, there was an explosion. \nThe fireballs spread into the surrounding area and onto the vehicles caught in the traffic. \nThe authorities say most of the dead have now been received at the central morgue in Freetown, with the critically injured admitted to hospitals across the city. The army, police and fire force are all at the scene. \nThe port city of Freetown, which is home to just over a million people, has faced several serious disasters in recent years. \nIn March, more than 80 people were injured after a major fire in one of the city's slums left more than 5,000 people displaced. \nAnd in 2017 over 1,000 people were killed after heavy rains led to a mudslide that swept through the city, leaving around 3,000 people homeless.

      "tags": "European Commission,Brexit",
      "text": "There will be \"serious consequences\" if the UK triggers Article 16, European Commission (EC) Vice-President Maros Sefcovic has warned.\nMr Sefcovic said the move would be \"serious for Northern Ireland as it would lead to instability and unpredictability\".\nHis comments follow a meeting with the UK's Brexit minister in Brussels over the protocol dispute.\nLord Frost said progress at the meeting was \"limited\".\nHe said gaps could still be bridged through intensive negotiations.\nThe protocol is the special Brexit deal agreed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\nIt keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU.\nBut it also creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  \nThe EU has proposed measures to ease the checks and controls for goods crossing the Irish Sea.\nBut the UK is demanding fundamental reform and there is growing speculation it will trigger Article 16 - which allows parts of the protocol to be unilaterally suspended if they are causing serious difficulties - in the coming weeks.\nMr Sefcovic said triggering Article 16 would be serious for EU-UK relations \"as it would mean a rejection of EU efforts to find a consensual solution to the implementation of the protocol\".\nHe said that despite a \"big move\" by the EU on its proposals, \"until today we have seen no move at all from the UK side\".\nFollowing Friday's meeting, a UK spokesperson said Lord Frost had indicated \"the EU's proposals did not currently deal effectively with the fundamental difficulties in the way the protocol was operating\".\n\"He underlined that the UK's preference was still to find a consensual solution that protected the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and the everyday lives of people in Northern Ireland,\" the spokesperson added.\nBefore the meeting, Lord Frost had warned time was running out on the talks.\nHe had said the UK was not going to trigger Article 16 on Friday, although this was \"very much on the table and has been since July\".\nThere is growing speculation that the UK is planning to use Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol in the coming weeks.\nThe Irish government says such a move would be \"reckless and irresponsible\", and Maros Sefcovic has warned it could result in \"serious consequences\".\nUltimately, the EU could impose tariffs on UK goods - but that would only be possible after a lengthy arbitration process.\nThe arbitrators would first have to find that the UK is in breach of the protocol.\nThen the UK would have to refuse to remedy that breach, at which point the EU could retaliate under the terms of the wider Brexit deal, the TCA.\nIt could require another arbitration process to rule whether the use of tariffs is proportionate retaliation.\nThere is a potentially faster legal track - known as infringement proceedings - which could lead to the UK being fined.\nRead the full analysis here.\nLord Frost added that if the gap narrowed, the commission listened to what was said in the UK command paper and looked at the situation in Northern Ireland, that could help move things forward.\nHe would not give a timescale on how long negotiations could last but said they were trying to reach agreement and were going to \"carry on trying\".\nThe European Commission has also ruled out talk about deadlines but it is understood the EU could look to legally challenge any move by the UK to trigger Article 16.\nUltimately, the EU could impose tariffs on UK goods, but that would only be possible after a lengthy arbitration process. \nEC spokesman Daniel Ferrie told reporters in Brussels on Friday that the commission was \"fully concentrated on finding solutions\". \nHe said the EU's proposals were \"far-reaching and ambitious\".  \nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he expected to see decisive action on the protocol before the end of November.\nSir Jeffrey, whose party opposes the protocol, said he would meet Lord Frost next week to discuss the issue.\n\"The protocol is harming Northern Ireland, it is harming our economy, it is harming our political place in the union and that's why I want to see new arrangements put in place that respect Northern Ireland's place within the UK internal market,\" he said.\n\"I hope agreement can be reached but if it can't then within weeks I want to see the UK government taking decisive action.\"\nThe EU accepts the Northern Ireland Protocol is causing difficulties for many businesses but its proposed measures to ease checks and controls for goods crossing the Irish Sea have not been accepted by the UK government.\nIt is seeking more wide-ranging reform of the protocol. \nLast month, Lord Frost said the UK government would not trigger Article 16 \"gratuitously or with any particular pleasure\".\nArticle 16 can be triggered if the protocol is leading to serious \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\" that are liable to persist.\nIf the UK was to use Article 16 to suspend most controls on goods going from GB to NI, that could cause significant problems for Ireland.\nIt could reopen questions about goods being controlled as they cross the Irish border or as they leave Ireland for the rest of the EU.\nTaoiseach (Irish PM) Miche\u00e1l Martin has said it would be \"irresponsible and reckless\" for the UK to trigger Article 16.\nMeanwhile, a survey has indicated that the protocol is not a top priority for most people across Northern Ireland, including unionists. \nUnionist parties in Northern Ireland oppose the protocol, as they say it undermines their place in the UK. \nIt ranked fourth on the list of priorities behind health, Covid recovery and the economy.\nThe survey also shows the majority of the 1,000 people asked would support remaining in the UK if a border poll was held \"tomorrow\".\nReacting to the survey, Sir Jeffrey said he did not agree that people do not care about the protocol, saying it was a \"big issue for many people, particularly those businesses that are being harmed\". \n\"They do care about the protocol and they also care, as I do, about other issues like health, like Covid recovery, the economy.\n\"These things are important and they are all inextricably bound up in our membership of the union.\"\nCommissioned by the University of Liverpool, the survey questioned people across all of Northern Ireland's council areas last month.\nOf those who responded, 39% described themselves as unionist, 26% nationalist and 33% neither unionist or nationalist\nThe survey indicated that just over 9% said the protocol was their biggest concern.  \nWhen broken down, just 12% of unionists said the protocol was the important issue for them.\nMore than 60% also said they wanted the Stormont Executive to remain in place until the Assembly election in May.\nWhen asked how they would vote in a border poll \"tomorrow\", 58% of those surveyed supported remaining in the UK, with 29% voting for a united Ireland."

We'll have another update for you tomorrow.\nPeople living in England will be able to book their appointment for a coronavirus booster jab a month in advance from Monday. The change comes as part of government efforts to speed up the rollout of a third vaccine dose to the over-50s and vulnerable people. The current system means you cannot book an appointment until at least six months after your second. But the government said the coming winter was going to be \"challenging\" and vaccines were the best way to protect people.\nA professional footballer has opened up about his struggles with long Covid, which has left him unable to play after contracting the virus more than a year ago. Finlay Macnab says he suffers from \"extreme fatigue\" and feels like he has played a 90-minute game even after just walking up the stairs. The 20-year-old AFC Wimbledon midfielder also explained he struggled with keeping his heart rate down, with even the act of standing causes it to spike.\nCosta Rica has become the first country to make Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for children. This means the jab will join the existing list of basic vaccinations required to have in childhood. The country has signed a deal with pharmaceutical company Pfizer to begin the process of vaccinating under-12s from March next year. The deal will see the country received 3.5 million doses, of which 1.5 million will be used to vaccinate children aged five to 11.\nThe BBC's health and science correspondent James Gallagher has written a helpful round-up explaining the latest trends in coronavirus data, as well as talking to public health experts about the current situation. He points to falling case numbers, which were just over 34,000 on Friday as well as the falling infection levels in schoolchildren. However, James emphasises cases are rising in older adults and speaks to experts who are also concerned about the dangers of sharp rises in case numbers and the risks of relaxing too much. \nA teenager who became famous after taking up painting in lockdown doesn't want to become an artist in the future . Makenzy Beard, from Swansea, started painting on canvasses in her garden shed and hit headlines when a portrait of a neighbour was featured by the Royal Academy of Arts. But the 14-year-old said she didn't think she wanted painting as a career as it might ruin her enjoyment of picking up a brush.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nThe weekday morning coronavirus briefing is being paused for two weeks to tell you five things you need to know about the COP26 climate summit.\nFor more about the booster jab rollout, head here.
