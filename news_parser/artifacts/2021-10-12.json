      "tags": "Data breaches,Cardiff,GDPR,Personal data,Data protection",
      "text": "Hundreds of footballers have threatened legal action against the data collection industry, which could change how information is handled. \nLed by former Cardiff City, Leyton Orient and Yeovil Town manager Russell Slade, 850 players want compensation for the trading of their performance data over the past six years.\nThey also want an annual fee from the companies for any future use.\n\"Letters before action\" have been sent to 17 big firms, alleging data misuse.\nData ranges from average goals-per-game for an outfield player to height - however, Mr Slade has previously expressed concern this is sometimes wrong.\nIf the group pursues legal action and is successful, it could lead to a radical change of a multi-billion pound industry behind professional sport that trades on players' information. \nSlade's legal team said the fact players receive no payment for the unlicensed use of their data contravenes General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules that were strengthened in 2018.\nUnder Article 4 of the GDPR, \"personal data\" refers to a range or identifiable information, such as physical attributes, location data or physiological information.\nBBC News understands that an initial 17 major betting, entertainment and data collection firms have been targeted, but Slade's Global Sports Data and Technology Group has highlighted more than 150 targets it believes have misused data.\nWhile receiving a fee for the use of their data might not have much impact on the high earners of the Premier League, Slade feels strongly that those lower down the pyramid, in both the men's and women's game, would see tangible benefits.\n\"It's incredible where it's used,\" Slade said. \"On one player, and I'm not talking about a Premier League player or even a Championship player, there was some 7,000 pieces of information on one individual player at a lower league football club.\n\"There are companies that are taking that data and processing that data without the individual consent of that player.\n\"A big part of our journey has been looking at that ecosystem and plotting out where that data starts, who's processing it, where it finishes and that's a real global thing.\n\"It's making football - and all sports - aware of the implications and what needs to change.\"\nThe use of data in sport is nothing new. Its collection, distribution and use has become a staple part of the modern sporting environment, be it by clubs to manage player performance, or by third party companies to base things like odds on.\nIf the move is successful, the implications could have far-reaching effects beyond football.\nBBC News understand discussions are already underway within other professional sports to bring potential legal action regarding the trading of data.\nFormer Wales international Dave Edwards, one the players behind the move, said it was a chance for players to take more control of the way information about them is used.\nHaving seen how data has become a staple part of the modern game, he believes players rights to how information about them is used should be at the forefront of any future use.\n\"The more I've looked into it and you see how our data is used, the amount of channels its passed through, all the different organisations which use it, I feel as a player we should have a say on who is allowed to use it,\" he said.\n\"Anyone else in the world would have that say. Just because we're footballers and we're in the public domain that gets overlooked.\n\"If you were in another job, if you were a teacher or a lawyer and this sort of details was being passed around your field of work it wouldn't sit right with that person.\n\"I don't think we, as individuals really differ from that.\"\nThe lawyer behind Global Sports Data and Technology's action, Chris Farnell, believes it could be start of a sport-wide reshaping of how data is traded.\n\"This will be significant change if the precedent is set throughout football and how data is used throughout sport in general,\" he said.\n\"It will change significantly how that data is being used and how it's going to be rewarded.\""

      "tags": "Israel & the Palestinians,Republic of Ireland,Israel,Books",
      "text": "Irish author Sally Rooney is at the centre of a controversy after refusing to allow her new book to be translated into Hebrew by an Israeli company.\nThe acclaimed writer said it was in support of calls to boycott Israel over its policies towards the Palestinians.\nShe said it would \"be an honour\" to have Beautiful World, Where Are You translated into Hebrew by a company which shared her political position.\nA senior Israeli minister said such boycotts were a form of anti-Semitism.\nRooney issued a statement clarifying her action after being accused of refusing to allow her novel to be translated into Hebrew at all.\nThe allegations came after it emerged that she had turned down a bid by Israeli publisher Modan for the rights to translate the book.\nShe said that while she was \"very proud\" that her two previous novels - Conversations With Friends (2017) and Normal People (2018) - had been translated into Hebrew, \"for the moment, I have chosen not to sell these translation rights to an Israeli-based publishing house\".\nCiting a recent report by Human Rights Watch which accused Israel of practising apartheid, Ms Rooney said her decision was in support of the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for a complete boycott of Israel.\nShe could not, she said, \"accept a new contract with an Israeli company that does not publicly distance itself from apartheid and support the UN-stipulated rights of the Palestinian people. \n\"The Hebrew-language translation rights to my new novel are still available, and if I can find a way to sell these rights that is compliant with the BDS movement's institutional boycott guidelines, I will be very pleased and proud to do so.\" \nApartheid was a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government against the black majority in South Africa from 1948 until 1991. \nIsrael has long claimed BDS opposes the country's very existence and is motivated by anti-Semitism. It vehemently rejects any comparison with apartheid and called the HRW report \"preposterous and false\".\nRooney's stance was met with an outpouring of anger and praise on social media.\nThe Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel said Palestinians \"warmly welcomed\" her decision, while others said she had been misrepresented.\nRooney's clarification though did not assuage critics, who said it made no difference to her intentions.\nTweeting in Hebrew, Israel's Diaspora Minister Nachman Shai said: \"The cultural boycott of Israel, anti-Semitism in a new guise, is a certificate of poor conduct for her and others who behave like her.\"\nThe Israel-Palestinian conflict has long been a battleground for those in the arts world, as well as celebrities and academics. Earlier this year, Rooney signed an open letter in support of Palestinian artists and writers accusing Israel of crimes against the Palestinian people.\nRooney has received several book prizes in the UK, including The Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year Award in 2017 and a Costa Book Award in 2018. \nBeautiful World, Where Are You was published last month to warm reviews."

      "tags": "Retailing,Gender,United States,California",
      "text": "California has become the first US state to require large retailers to display toys and childcare items in gender-neutral ways.\nThe new law, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday, does not ban boys and girls sections in shops.\nBut large stores must have also have a separate, gender-neutral section.\nThese must display \"a reasonable selection\" of toys and childcare items, regardless of whether they've been marketed towards a particular sex.\nCompanies will face a $250 (\u00a3184) fine for their first violation, and $500 (\u00a3368) penalties for others.\nThe new law was passed by California's state legislature last month, and will come into effect in 2024 now it has been signed by Governor Newsom.\nIt will apply to retailers with 500 or more employees across their California stores.\nClothing will be unaffected, but the law will affect toys and any \"childcare items\" intended to aid sleep, relaxation, feeding, teething or sucking.\nIn its wording, it said the changes would help consumers spot \"unjustified differences in similar products\" and tackle gender bias in children's products.\nDemocrat Assemblyman Evan Low, one of the law's co-authors, has previously said the bill was inspired by his staff member's eight-year-old daughter, who asked her mother why she had to go to the boys section to find a certain toy.\n\"The segregation of toys by a social construct of what is appropriate for which gender is the antithesis of modern thinking,\" said Mr Low in a statement.\nHe said that categorising toys by gender had \"led to the proliferation of science, technology, engineering and mathematics-geared toys\" in boys sections, while those for girls were directed towards pursuits like \"caring for a baby, fashion, and domestic life.\"\nThe Consumer Federation of California, a consumer advocacy group, has been among those in favour of the law.\nIn a statement to The Sacramento Bee newspaper, it said separating products by gender \"helps to disguise the unfortunate fact that female products are often priced higher than male products.\"\nSome US retailers have already taken steps away from gender stereotypes in their businesses. In 2015, Target announced that it would stop using some gender-based signs in its stores.\nBut in the last two years, similar bills to enforce gender-neutral commercial spaces have been shot down in California's legislature.\nDetractors have argued that it infringes on free speech, and business owners' ability to adapt to the free market.\nOne of the most most vocal critics has been the California Family Council, a conservative advocacy group. It has accused gender-fluid clothing entrepreneur Rob Smith of lobbying for the bill for his own commercial gain.\nYou may be interested in watching:"

      "tags": "Manchester,Bury",
      "text": "The family of a man killed in the Manchester Arena attack say he was \"badly let down\" by some members of the emergency services.\nJohn Atkinson, 28, was one of 22 people who died in the bombing on 22 May 2017.\nA public inquiry has previously heard he might have survived had he been given treatment more quickly.\nMr Atkinson's family said mistakes had been made and \"precious time was allowed to ebb away while John needed urgent hospital treatment\".\n\"This should never have been allowed to happen. John had so much to give,\" they added.\nThe inquiry heard healthcare worker Mr Atkinson lost a significant amount of blood as he laid in agony on the foyer floor for 47 minutes before being carried downstairs.\nAbout 20 minutes later, he went into cardiac arrest and was taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary but he was pronounced dead a short time later. \nLast week, consultant paramedic Dan Smith, the operational commander for North West Ambulance Service (NWAS), told the inquiry he was \"truly sorry\" if any decision he made impacted on his survivability.\nIn a statement read outside the court on Monday, Mr Atkinson's family said they could not accept this apology. \n\"Actions speak louder than words, and we wait to see what actions are taken to ensure this never happens again,\" they added in a statement read on their behalf by their lawyer Richard Scorer, from Slater and Gordon.\nThe family said Mr Atkinson \"was kind, intelligent and would light up any room he walked into\".\n\"He was the best uncle to his nephews, most caring of sons and brothers, he worked with young adults with autism and he looked forward to being a foster father,\" they added.\nThe inquiry earlier heard how Mr Atkinson had pleaded with NWAS senior paramedic Phillip Keogh not to let him die.\nMr Keogh treated him about an hour after the explosion but it was another 30 minutes before he was moved to an ambulance. \nHe agreed Mr Atkinson had been left waiting too long to be taken to hospital, reducing his chances of survival. \nThe delay was \"inadequate\", he told the inquiry. \nMr Atkinson, from Bury, died shortly after arriving at the Manchester Royal Infirmary one hour and 35 minutes after the bomb was detonated in the arena foyer.  \nHe was brought down from the foyer on a metal barrier and put on the floor of Manchester Victoria railway station concourse, the inquiry heard. \nMr Keogh said it was \"obvious he had lost a lot of blood\" and he had several makeshift tourniquets on his legs.\nHe said he was worried about Mr Atkinson developing hypothermia as he had been left in the doorway and was not covered in blankets. \nThe inquiry heard Mr Atkinson had pleaded with the paramedic \"don't let me die\". \nMr Keogh said he had tried to comfort him by telling him he would not let him die, but said he \"already had grave concerns for [his] outcome\". \n\"I thought then that his chances of survival were absolutely slim but I wasn't going to tell him the truth because that's just not what you do,\" he said. \nThe inquiry was told Mr Keogh lost most of his equipment just before he treated Mr Atkinson.  \nMr Keogh accepted that Mr Atkinson should have been given a blood clotting agent earlier, which was in his lost equipment bag, however he told the court he did not believe it would have saved his life.\nMr Atkinson went into cardiac arrest as he was being placed on an ambulance stretcher, the inquiry heard. \nMr Keogh described the difficulty of carrying out chest compressions as he was wheeled to an ambulance.\nThe paramedic, who had previously served in Afghanistan as a reservist army paramedic, told the court that he went directly to Manchester Arena despite being told he should go to a rendezvous point because there may have been an active shooter. \nHe said: \"I was aware that people were injured at the arena and if I wasn't going to go, then who was going to go?\"\nThe inquiry continues. \nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "title": "Covid: UK's early response worst public health failure ever, MPs say",
      "tags": "NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK's failure to do more to stop Covid spreading early in the pandemic was one of the country's worst public health failures, a report by MPs says.\nThe government approach - backed by its scientists - was to try to manage the situation and in effect achieve herd immunity by infection, it said.\nThis led to a delay in introducing the first lockdown, costing thousands of lives, the MPs found.\nBut their report highlighted successes too, including the vaccination rollout.\nIt described the approach to vaccination - from the research and development through to the rollout of the jabs - as \"one of the most effective initiatives in UK history\".\nBut campaigners criticised the report for failing to focus on those who had died, saying references to practical issues, including problems with laptops, was \"laughable\".\nThe 150-page document, Coronavirus: Lessons learned to date, is from the Health and Social Care Committee and the Science and Technology Committee, and MPs from all parties.\nIt predominantly focused on the response to the pandemic in England. The committees did not look at steps taken individually by Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nThe MPs called the pandemic, which has claimed more than 150,000 lives in the UK and nearly five million worldwide so far, the \"biggest peacetime challenge\" for a century.\nSome early failings, the report suggested, resulted from apparent \"group-think\" among scientists and ministers.\nIt meant the UK was not as open to different approaches on earlier lockdowns, border controls and test and trace as it should have been.\nA woman whose twin sisters died within three days of one another after testing positive for Covid says the report from MPs uses the success of the vaccine programme to deflect from earlier failures.\nZoe Davis' sisters Katy and Emma, who were both nurses, died in April 2020.\nShe says: \"Nobody is saying that the vaccine programme hasn't been phenomenal but the frustrating thing is that's a deflection of what is actually being brought to attention and the overall message is that Covid failures have cost lives.\"\nLindsay Jackson, from Derbyshire, whose mother died with Covid, said the report confirmed her fears she had about care home visits in March 2020.\n\"I knew in my own mind the lockdown was too slow, I knew the social care sector wasn't being looked after, I knew people shouldn't have been released from hospital without tests, and this just confirms that.\"\nShe is calling for the government to move to a public inquiry now to see if anyone is culpable.\nConservative MPs Jeremy Hunt and Greg Clark, who chair the committees, said the nature of the pandemic meant it was \"impossible to get everything right\". \n\"The UK has combined some big achievements with some big mistakes. It is vital to learn from both,\" they said.\nCabinet Office minister Stephen Barclay said scientific advice had been followed and the government had made \"difficult judgements\" to protect the NHS.\nHe said the government took responsibility for everything that happened - saying the government would not shy away from any lessons to be learned at the full statutory public inquiry, expected next year.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the report was a \"damning indictment\" and showed the errors and failures of running down the NHS before the pandemic.\nHe called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to apologise to the bereaved and hold the public inquiry as soon as possible. \nWhen Covid hit, the government's approach was to manage its spread through the population rather than try to stop it - or herd immunity by infection as the report called it.\nThe MPs said this was based on dealing with a flu pandemic, and was done on the advice of its scientific advisers on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). \nBut the idea was not challenged enough by ministers in any part of the UK. Although other parts of Europe were guilty of this too, the MPs added.\nToo little was done in the early weeks to stop Covid spreading, the MPs said, despite evidence from China and then Italy that it was a virus that was highly infectious, caused severe illness and had no cure.\n\"The veil of ignorance through which the UK viewed the initial weeks of the pandemic was partly self-inflicted,\" the report said.\nAsked whether herd immunity had been a policy in the early days, Mr Hunt said he did not think there was any desire for the whole population to be infected.\nHowever, he said there was a \"fatalism that it was likely that in the end, that will be the only way that we will stop the progress of the virus\".\nDecisions on lockdowns and social distancing during those early weeks - and the advice that led to them - were described as \"one of the most important public health failures the UK has ever experienced\".\nThe advice from scientists changed on 16 March 2020 - with a lockdown announced a week later.\n\"This slow and gradualist approach was not inadvertent, nor did it reflect bureaucratic delay or disagreement between ministers and their advisers,\" the report said, describing it as a \"deliberate policy\".\n\"It is now clear that this was the wrong policy, and that it led to a higher initial death toll than would have resulted from a more emphatic early policy. In a pandemic spreading rapidly and exponentially, every week counted.\"\nA Liverpool FC and Atletico Madrid football match on 11 March - as a pandemic was declared by the WHO - and the Cheltenham Festival of Racing between 10 and 13 March, may have spread the virus.\nMr Barclay said hindsight was \"an issue\". Had the government known how much the country would be willing to endure, lockdown may have come sooner, the minister added.\nThe MPs also highlighted how ministers in England rejected scientific advice to have a two-week \"circuit-breaker\" in the autumn.\nThey said it was impossible to know whether that would have prevented the second lockdown in November, although they pointed out it had not in Wales.\nThe UK was one of the first countries in the world to develop a test for Covid in January 2020, but failed to translate that into an effective test-and-trace system during the first year of the pandemic, the report said.\nTesting in the community stopped in March 2020 and for weeks during the first peak only those admitted to hospital were tested.\nIt was not until May that the NHS Test and Trace system was launched in England, but the report described its start as \"slow, uncertain and often chaotic\".\nIt said the system was too centralised, only later making use of the expertise in local public health teams run by councils.\nBut it praised the target set by then Health Secretary Matt Hancock to get to 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, saying it played an important part in galvanising the system.\nThe greatest praise though was reserved for the vaccination programme and the way the government supported the development of a number of vaccines, including the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\nIt said the whole programme was one of the most effective initiatives in history, and will ultimately help to save millions of lives here and across the world.\nA key step, taken early on following a suggestion from chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, was to set up a task force that combined the talents of scientists, the NHS and the private sector, led by the \"bold leadership\" of venture capitalist Kate Bingham.\nThe development of treatments, such as dexamethasone, for Covid through the UK Recovery Trial was another area where the UK's response was genuinely world-leading, the report said. \nAnd the NHS and government were also credited with the way hospital intensive care capacity was increased to ensure the majority who needed hospital treatment received it.\nThe report's recommendations include comprehensive government plans for future emergencies, a bigger role for the armed forces in emergency response plans, and considering a government and NHS volunteer reserve database.\nThe MPs said the pandemic had also exacerbated existing social, economic and health inequalities which would need addressing.\nThe report highlighted \"unacceptably high\" death rates in ethnic minority groups and among people with learning disabilities and autism.\nFor ethnic minorities, there were a variety of factors, including possible biological reasons and increased exposure because of housing and working conditions. \nFor people with learning disabilities, not enough thought was given to how restrictions would have a detrimental impact on them - particularly in terms of accessing health care more generally. Do not resuscitate orders were also used inappropriately.\nThere was a lack of priority attached to care homes too at the start of the pandemic.\nThe rapid discharge of people from hospital into care homes without adequate testing or isolation was a prime example of this.\nThis, combined with untested staff bringing infection into homes from the community, led to many thousands of deaths which could have been avoided.\nScience minister George Freeman said it was too early for any proper discussion about blame or fault.\nAsked about the higher UK death toll, he said: \"A lot of that is actually to do with the very, very heavy obesity-related cardiometabolic chronic disease cohort that we've been carrying for years - that's a failure of public health in this country over decades.\"\nLobby Akinnola, of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, said Mr Freeman's comments were \"grossly offensive\", adding that \"the statutory inquiry cannot come soon enough\".\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "tags": "Greenhouse gas emissions,Our Planet Now,Carbon dioxide,Extinction,Effects of global warming,Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "World temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life.\nLeft unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species. \nWe face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.\nClimate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.\nThe rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. \nWhen these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.\nThe world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.\nTemperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100. \nHowever, unless further action is taken, the planet could still warm by more than 2C by the end of this century. A report in 2021 by the Climate Action Tracker group calculated that the world was heading for 2.4C of warming by the end of the century.\nIf nothing is done, scientists think global warming could exceed 4C in the future, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels and irreversible loss of plant and animal species. \nExtreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods. \nWith further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as farmland turns into desert. In other regions, the opposite is happening, with extreme rainfall causing historic flooding - as seen recently in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nPeople in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse.\nOur oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already lost half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change.\nWildfires are becoming more frequent as climate change increases the risk of hot, dry weather. \nAnd as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change.\nIn a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.\nScientists believe at least 550 species could be lost this century if action is not taken. \nClimate change has different effects in different areas of the world. Some places will warm more than others, some will receive more rainfall and others will face more droughts. \nIf temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:\nCountries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C. \nThe UK is hosting a summit for world leaders, called COP26, in November, where countries will set out their carbon reduction plans for 2030. \nMany countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.\nExperts agree that this is achievable, but it will require governments, businesses and individuals to make big changes.\nMajor changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives can limit our impact on the climate:\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nTop image from Getty Images.

      "tags": "Children,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All children aged 12 to 15 in the UK are to be offered one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab. \nIt follows a recommendation from the UK's four chief medical officers that vaccinating them would help reduce disruption to their schooling this winter and benefit those growing up in the poorest areas.\nThe UK's advisory body, the JCVI, said there was only a marginal benefit to vaccinating adolescents on health grounds alone and stopped short of recommending it - but it did advise vaccinating children over 12 with specific underlying health conditions who are at greater risk.\nThere is general agreement that this was a really tricky call to make.\nStrong opinions have been expressed on all sides, by scientists, doctors, teachers and parents alike.\nThe JCVI focused squarely on the health benefits of vaccination to children themselves - not on the impact to their schooling or other people.\nChildren's risk from Covid isn't zero but the chances of them becoming seriously ill from Covid are incredibly small. Deaths among healthy children are extremely rare - most have life-limiting health conditions.\nThat means there needs to be a clear and obvious advantage to giving them a jab. \nHowever, a very rare side-effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines has made that calculation a lot more complicated. \nPaul Hunter, professor of medicine at University of East Anglia, says there's been intense pressure on the JCVI and he can understand why they have been cautious.\nResearch on millions of people who've had the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) shows there's a tiny risk of myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart, which is more common in young people - and particularly younger boys - after a second dose. It can cause chest pain and a pounding heart, but symptoms usually clear up in days. \nNo vaccine or drug is ever 100% safe, and data from the US shows the numbers of children affected are very small. \nFor every million Pfizer second doses given to 12-17-year-old-boys, around 60 had the condition (compared with eight in a million among girls). The rates in this age group are higher than in older ones - and it's why only one dose for 16 and 17-year-olds in the UK has been recommended, for now.\nBut being infected with Covid has consequences for teenagers' health too - including their hearts - so how big is that risk?\nA recent US study suggests having Covid-19 could be six times more likely to trigger myocarditis in young men than the vaccine, with a rate of about 450 per million infections. \nHowever, the long-term effects of myocarditis after vaccination and the wider health impacts of Covid in children in the short and long-term are still not known.\nJust because countries have access to the same data doesn't mean they will reach the same standpoint on this finely-balanced question.\nCountries are influenced by a variety of different factors - from vaccination rates in adults to political pressure and fears over another wave of Covid. \nThe US, for example, has vaccinated more than 10 million over-12s and concluded that the benefits of protecting against Covid illness and its complications  \"far outweigh\" the small potential risk of an adverse reaction to the vaccine. \nFrance, Italy, Canada, Spain, Israel and many other countries are all vaccinating this age group for the same reason.\nVaccinating secondary-school-age children wouldn't stop the virus circulating in schools or in society more generally.\n\"Even if 100% of people in the UK were vaccinated - and their pets - the virus would still spread,\" Prof Hunter says.\nBut vaccines for teens are still likely to reduce infections in that age group, and could help keep more children in school over winter, although it's unclear how much it would limit wider community spread.\nThe government's scientific advisers recently said that 40-70% of children in secondary schools may already have been infected by the start of term, meaning many have some in-built protection.\nThen there's the question of whether encouraging more over-18s to have a vaccine would be a more productive aim, given their greater risk, with more than 12% still reluctant to even have one? \nIn the end it comes down to choice, and a fine balance between a very rare side-effect from the vaccine, and a very low risk to children themselves from Covid."

      "text": "The UK's largest commercial port says the supply chain crisis has caused a logjam of shipping containers.\nThe Port of Felixstowe, which handles 36% of the UK's freight container traffic, blamed the busy pre-Christmas period and haulage shortages.\nHowever, it said the situation has been improving over the last few days.\nShipping giant Maersk told the BBC it is re-routing some of its biggest ships away from the port.\nThe Financial Times first reported on Tuesday that Maersk was re-routing ships away from Felixstowe to other European ports, where smaller vessels will be used for UK deliveries.\nLars Mikael Jensen, head of global ocean network at Maersk, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Drive programme that some of its largest 20,000-container ships were waiting outside Felixstowe for between four to seven days.\n\"We've taken those measures because we saw, because of the big ships, there is a limit to how many berths they can call in Felixstowe, and because its slower, it took longer to handle every ship,\" he said.\n \"Instead of wasting time waiting, we progressed to the next stop, and arranged that the boxes are relayed from that port rather than wait for a week and then discharge.\"\nProblems at Felixstowe come as retailers and other groups warn of mounting concern about stocks in the run-up to Christmas trading.\nThe port has blamed several factors for the build-up of shipping containers, including the busy pre-Christmas peak, haulage shortages, poor vessel scheduling, and the impact of the pandemic.\nOn top of this, there are a high number of empty containers currently sitting at the port. Felixstowe said it is asking shipping lines to remove them as quickly as possible.\n\"The vast majority of import containers are cleared for collection within minutes of arriving and there are over 1,000 unused haulier bookings most days,\" the port stressed.\n\"However, the situation is improving and there is more spare space for import containers this week, than at any time since the beginning of July, when supply chain impacts first started to bite.\"\nIndustry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers with several sectors from retailers to domestic refuse collection affected. The government recently drafted in military personnel to help deliver fuel and to issue emergency temporary visa to foreign drivers.\nThe shortage has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic, Brexit, tax changes and a backlog of HGV driver tests.\nTim Morris, head of the Major Ports Group, which represents port operators, said the industry had been had been hit by a whole host of issues, including Brexit border changes, global demand for goods travelling by sea, and the pandemic. \n\"It has not been easy and there have been times of real stress on the ports system,\" he said. \"Ports have taken significant action to respond to the challenges and build resilience.\"\nThe problem is not just confined to the UK. Ports across the world have also suffered significant delays. Retailers have highlighted particular issues in China and east Asia, where pandemic restrictions and poor weather conditions have affected shipping.\nSarah Treseder, chief executive of the trade group UK Chamber of Shipping, said there are reports of dozens of ships forced to wait outside ports in America and Asia.\n\"We anticipate the disruption will continue while the underlying market volatility stabilises,\" she said."

      "text": "There is no room for big spending announcements for hard-pressed public services in this month's Budget, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.\nThe influential think tank has published new analysis, suggesting borrowing will be lower than forecast.\nBut the IFS says if the chancellor hopes to balance the government's finances, he will still have to keep a tight rein on spending.\nThat's despite his planning the biggest tax rises for more than 25 years.\nMr Sunak is due to deliver the next Budget on 27 October.\n\"Rishi Sunak, a Conservative chancellor, is presiding over an increase in the tax burden to record levels in the UK and an increase in the size of the state (public spending as a fraction of national income) to levels not seen since the days of [Margaret] Thatcher,\" said IFS director Paul Johnson.\n\"Yet the combined effects of ever-growing spending on the NHS, and an economy smaller than projected pre-pandemic, mean that he is still likely to be short of money to spend on many other public services,\" he said.\nMr Johnson said that meant \"little or no scope\" to increase spending on things such as local government, the justice system and further education, which have seen sharp cuts over the last decade.\nSpending on services other than health, such as defence, schools and aid, might also have to increase by less than Mr Sunak was planning pre-pandemic, the IFS said.\nMr Johnson said the chancellor would be \"hoping against hope\" that the economy performed better than expected over the next few years, pushing up tax revenues that would \"help to dig him out of what still looks like a fair-sized hole\".\nThe IFS produces analysis of the country's finances in its Green Budget every year. Like a government green paper, the aim is to inform and provoke discussion around budgetary decisions. \nThe report highlights the UK's strong economic recovery this year, in the wake of the vaccine roll-out, meaning that borrowing this year could be more than \u00a350bn lower than was forecast in March. But it says less rapid growth after this year's bounce back would mean the public finances improve more slowly in the years to come.\nAnyone making forecasts like these a year ago would have been laughed at and called a crazy optimist. \nThe amount the government is expected to borrow this financial year is \u00a350bn less than was predicted even just back in March. \nThat suggests those arguing against cutting public spending too soon, for the sake of reducing that borrowing, were right.\nIn a pandemic, they argued, to prioritise sorting out the public finances before securing the economic recovery was putting the cart before the horse.\nIn the meantime, the vaccine-led recovery has brought tax money rolling into the Treasury much faster than was expected.\nWith 7% economic growth predicted this year and borrowing dropping rapidly, we can now see how quickly, when the economic horse is accelerating, the public finance cart comes trundling behind.\nChristian Schulz, director of European Economics at investment bank Citi, which collaborated on the Green Budget, said the global economic outlook had improved.\nHowever, the UK economy was still likely to be 4% short of its pre-pandemic trajectory at the end of 2021, he said.\n\"The medium-term recovery also remains far from secure,\" said Mr Schulz. \"Instead, an uneven rebound to date points to a more profound Brexit- and Covid-related reconfiguration in the years ahead.\nThe Green Budget analysis also found:\nThe IFS suggested that in order to cope with long-term pressures on spending, the chancellor might find he needs to raise taxes further, on top of the 1.25% health and social care levy announced last month.\nFor the levy to meet future spending demand in those areas, the IFS estimates it could need to more than double to 3.15% by the end of this decade."

      "text": "The government is looking at how to tackle \"embodied carbon\" as part of an upcoming building strategy. \nDevelopers may have won praise in the past for demolishing draughty buildings for energy-efficient replacements. \nBut engineers now say existing buildings should be kept standing due to the amount of carbon emitted when original building materials were made - known as embodied carbon.  \nA government spokeswoman said they were working on this issue.\nAnd Business minister Lord Callanan told a recent conference that it was \"one of the areas we want to look at\".\nBut despite the peer saying the government was in \"the final stages\" of creating its new heat and building strategy, neither gave more detail about what measures may appear. \nMaking steel, concrete and bricks for buildings creates a lot of carbon, with concrete alone causing 8% of global emissions.\nAs a result, climate experts are urging ministers to make it hard for developers to demolish buildings without first exploring ways to refurbish and extend them.\nThe chairman of the government\u2019s advisory climate change committee, Lord Deben, said the government had been slow to accept this reversal of established thinking and ministers had not had \"the will and the clout to develop these policies\".\n\u201cWe need to think differently,\" he said. \"It\u2019s not acceptable to pull buildings down like this. We have to learn to make do and mend.\"\nLord Deben said there needed to be a planning law to stop giving permission for demolitions, adding: \"We are simply not going to win the battle against climate change unless we fight on every front.\"\nLord Callanan told a recent conference run by Property Week: \u201cWe\u2019re in the final stages of building our Heat and Building Strategy at the moment. This is one of the areas we want to look at.\"\nExperts said one simple step would be to make firms planning large scale developments to calculate the total impact on the climate before starting work - something that is already mandatory in several countries.\nBut it is not yet clear how far ministers will go, partly because the issue is relatively new to Whitehall. \nThe problem is huge but barely discussed, with the built environment creating 27% of the UK\u2019s emissions. \nThe engineering giant Arup calculated around 50% of the whole-life emissions of a building could come from the carbon emitted during construction and demolition.\nAnd this proportion will only grow as buildings are increasingly cooled and heated using low-carbon electricity \u2013 shifting more of the carbon burden on to the construction process.\nThe government itself has been embroiled in a row about the embodied emissions that will be created in the construction of a new \u201cJustice Quarter\u201d, combining courts and a police headquarters in London\u2019s Fleet Street.\nThe Architects\u2019 Journal, which has been campaigning on the issue, urged ministers to insist that the existing buildings are refurbished, rather than demolished.\nThe journal has calculated that the difference between expanding the old buildings and replacing them amounts to 19,180 tonnes of CO2 \u2013 that\u2019s the equivalent of 4,171 passenger cars driven for a year.\nThe Ministry of Justice - which oversees the Courts and Tribunals Service - told the journal it was a matter for the City of London, as it was developing the site.\nA government spokeswoman told BBC News that embodied carbon was \"an issue and one that we have been working on addressing for some time\u201d.\nShe said the government was already supporting a number of construction projects that aimed to reduce carbon emissions, improving supply chains, and software for simultaneous cost and carbon modelling. \nBut she declined to comment further in advance of the coming heat and buildings strategy.\nThe chief executive of the UK Green Building Council, Julie Hirigoyen, said it was \"very good news that ministers are at last looking at this\".\nShe told BBC News: \u201cWe really must come to grips with the issue of embodied carbon in buildings \u2013 we\u2019ll never hit our climate targets unless we do.\"\nFollow Roger Harrabin on Twitter @rharrabin."

      "title": "Will Russia-Ukraine tensions push up UK gas bills?",
      "tags": "Personal finance,Energy industry,Inflation,Oil & Gas industry,Natural gas",
      "text": "High energy prices are already causing problems for households in the UK and across Europe, but geopolitical tensions threaten to make matters even worse.\nWith an estimated 100,000 Russian troops massed on the border with Ukraine, there are fears that Vladimir Putin is poised to order an invasion.\nSurging gas prices have already caused a number of UK energy suppliers to go bust - and supply shortages are the last thing anyone needs.\nNot directly. The UK sources very little of its gas from Russia - less than 5%, in fact.\nHowever, that is not the case for the EU, which gets about half of its gas from there. \nAny Russian attempt to seize Ukrainian territory is likely to prompt economic sanctions by Western powers.\nIn response, Russia would be expected to \"weaponise\" its natural resources by cutting supplies of gas to Europe.\nThe wholesale cost of gas would then rocket, sending prices higher everywhere.\nAmong possible sanctions, there is talk of excluding Russia from cross-border payment systems, which would mean that European countries would have trouble even buying Russian gas in the first place.\nAbout half of UK gas supplies are of domestic origin, from the North Sea. The UK has been a big producer of gas since the mid-1960s, but output has fallen since 2000 and usage continues to rise.  \nAnother one-third of the UK's gas comes through pipelines from Norway. \nThe rest consists almost entirely of imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which arrive in Britain by sea from countries such as Qatar, the US and even Trinidad and Tobago.\nThe small amount of Russian gas that does reach the UK comes in LNG form.\nLNG supplies are particularly sensitive to global market prices and are sold to whoever pays the most, with China one of the keenest bidders.\nThe government says the UK's energy bill crisis is due to high global gas prices, not security of supply.\nIt says the UK has a \"diverse and secure\" range of suppliers. \nHowever, that could change quite rapidly if Russian gas becomes scarce, causing a knock-on effect as other countries scrabble for alternative supplies.\nDemand for gas is rising across Europe and some fear the UK could be physically - and perhaps politically - at the back of the queue. \nWhat's more, the UK has scant storage facilities. It's been increasingly operating a \"just-in-time model\", which means it's more affected by short-term price fluctuations in the wholesale gas market. \nThe government stresses it's \"not complacent\". \nAnd if needed, it does have the power to impose emergency measures, such as ordering big industrial customers to temporarily stop using gas.\nBut the biggest factor - the weather - is beyond its control. Our best hope for avoiding problems is if the rest of the winter turns out to be mild, breezy and wind power-friendly.\nA perfect energy storm was brewing during 2021. \nA cold winter around the world sent gas demand rising, depleting stores. \nThose reserves would normally have been replenished over the summer. But output dropped because many major producers were catching up with maintenance postponed during lockdowns. \nMeanwhile, calm weather reduced the amount of electricity generated by wind power. \nAs a result, wholesale gas prices have more than quadrupled over the past year.\nThe UK has been badly hit because it's one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas - 85% of homes use gas central heating, while gas also generates a third of our electricity. \nEven without a big freeze or a Russian supply squeeze, bills are heading up. \nHouseholds have seen their energy bills kept in check by the government's price cap, which limits the amount suppliers can charge, but this is due to be revised on 1 April.\nAs a result, fuel bills could increase by another 50% in the next few months, the energy industry has said.\nWhatever happens, economists say wholesale gas prices are unlikely to drop before storage facilities fill up again - and that's not likely until spring. \nRising energy prices have already contributed to a big surge in the UK's cost of living, which is increasing at rates not seen for 30 years.\nThe energy bill crisis, along with soaring food costs, drove inflation to 5.4% in the 12 months to December, up from 5.1% the month before, in another blow to struggling families.\nThe last time inflation was higher was in March 1992, when it was 7.1%.\nBusinesses too have been feeling the strain, with five business groups writing to Chancellor Rishi Sunak asking for support for firms on energy costs.\nThe rise in global wholesale gas prices has been felt across Europe.\nSome suggest Brexit has meant the UK is at a disadvantage when it comes to getting the best deal. \nWhen it was in the EU, the UK was part of the Internal Energy Market which can enable countries to access electricity more smoothly and at lower cost. \nHowever, the way gas is traded has been largely unaffected, which means leaving the EU has not had a significant impact. \nCountries that rely heavily on imported gas, such as Italy and Spain, have been particularly hard hit. Their governments have directly cut prices and raised taxes on energy company profits respectively.\nThe price cap has meant the UK's gas bills have until now been typically lower than the EU average.\nBut the rise in prices comes on top of other economic problems such as labour shortages and increasing food prices, adding up to an unwelcome rise in the cost of living."

      "text": "North Korea's leader has vowed to build an \"invincible military\" in the face of what it says are hostile policies from the United States, state media report. \nKim Jong-un added that weapons development was for self-defence, and not to start a war.\nMr Kim made the comments at a rare defence exhibition while flanked by a variety of large missiles.  \nNorth Korea has recently tested what it claims to be new hypersonic and anti-aircraft missiles.\nThe South meanwhile has recently tested its own submarine-launched weapon.\nIn his speech at the Self-Defence 2021 exhibition held in the North's capital, Pyongyang, Mr Kim addressed the military build-up in the South and said that North Korea did not want to fight its neighbour.\n\"We are not discussing war with anyone, but rather to prevent war itself and to literally increase war deterrence for the protection of national sovereignty,\" he said.\nMr Kim, surrounded by an array of military hardware including tanks, accused the US of stoking tensions between North and South Korea.\nHe said there was \"no behavioural basis\" to make North Korea believe that the US was not hostile.\nThe US under President Joe Biden has repeatedly said it is willing to talk to North Korea, but has demanded Pyongyang give up nuclear weapons before sanctions can be eased. North Korea has so far refused.\nKim Jong-un didn't just talk about his new military might - he showed it to us.\nThis was the equivalent of a military parade. We have not seen this kind of defence exhibition since Mr Kim took power.\nSurrounded by intercontinental ballistic missiles and portraits of him dressed in military uniform, he told those gathered that he felt \"bottomless pride\" as he touched the missiles.\nAnd he made it clear that he's not done building his arsenal, which he says he needs as a deterrent.\nHe vowed to continue work on his wish list of weapons, while noting that South Korea was doing the same by building up its defence force in recent years.\nThis is Mr Kim's way of telling those criticising his arms programme that they are hypocrites. He wants Pyongyang to have the right to build up its military - just like Seoul.\nYet, just days earlier he urged his officials to focus on improving the lives of North Korean people as they face a \"grim\" economic situation.\nWith limited funds and under strict economic sanctions, can he really build an \"invincible\" force and help his people?\nAnd if it comes to a choice - what will it be?\nNorth Korea is banned from testing ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons by the UN. It has repeatedly flouted these bans and has been heavily sanctioned as a result.\nLast month, the UN atomic agency said North Korea appeared to have restarted a reactor which could produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, calling it a \"deeply troubling\" development.\nNorth Korea has always maintained that it needs to continue developing weapons for defence.\nBut observers say it is also being used as a way to rally the impoverished country. North Korea is thought to be in dire economic straits after authorities shut borders to stop the spread of Covid-19. \nCrucial supplies like food and fuel have been cut off from China, North Korea's main political and economic ally.\nMr Kim, unusually, wore sandals with socks paired with a formal dark suit at the exhibition, prompting some renewed speculation outside North Korea that this could be related to his health.  \nMr Kim is thought to have had medical problems linked to his weight, including gout which can result in foot swellings. He had been seen limping in public in the past.\nReuters quoted Colin Zwirko, an analyst with Seoul-based NK News, as saying: \"He lost a significant amount of weight in a short period in May, and in September he was seen standing on padded mats during long speeches, which is not typical.\""

      "title": "Thailand to reopen for some vaccinated visitors on 1 November",
      "text": "Thailand plans to end Covid quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated travellers from at least 10 low-risk nations from 1 November, officials say.\nPM Prayuth Chan-ocha admitted that \"this decision comes with some risk\" - but it is seen as a key step to revive the country's collapsed tourism sector.\nThe 10 nations seen as low risk include the UK, China, Germany and the US.\nThe country has been recording more than 10,000 positive infections daily since July. \nIt has fully vaccinated around 33% of its almost 70 million people. Half the population has received one dose.  \nMr Prayuth said Thailand would also allow entertainment venues to reopen on 1 December and permit alcohol sales.\nHe added that the authorities were planning to open Thailand for more countries on that date.\nMr Prayuth's comments came in a televised address on Monday. \nReferring to visitors from 10 low-risk nations, he stressed that \"when they arrive, they should present a [negative] Covid test... and test once again upon arrival\".\nIf the second test is also negative, any visitor from those countries \"can travel freely like Thais\", the prime minister said.\nBut he warned that the government would act decisively if there were to be a spike in infections or an emergence of a highly contagious variant of Covid-19.\nIt is estimated that Thailand - popular for its sandy beaches and non-stop nightlife - lost about $50bn (\u00a337bn) in tourism revenue in 2020. \nThe economy suffered its deepest contraction in more than two decades as a result of the pandemic.\nThailand was the first country outside China to record a Covid-19 case in January last year. \nIt took the drastic step of sealing its borders in April, effectively killing off a tourist industry accounting for perhaps 20% of GDP, but managed to cut new daily infections to just single figures, one of the best records anywhere. \nThis year though, with the arrival of the Delta variant, infections have soared, from a total of less than 7,000 at the end of 2020, to 1.7 million today. The argument for keeping out foreign visitors to contain Covid became much less persuasive, especially with tourist-related businesses pleading for restrictions to be eased.\nThe success in containing Covid last year had another unforeseen consequence; it led the Thai government to believe it need not rush to order vaccines. The result has been a tardy and at times confused vaccine programme, and a public outcry. \nThe need for some economic good news is in large part what has driven it to start reopening, well before reaching its own declared target of getting 70% of the population vaccinated. \nIt is proceeding cautiously though, with only 10 countries on the list until the end of the year. Like other countries in the region Thailand's health system has limited ICU capacity; in August ICU units in Bangkok were quickly overwhelmed by the number of serious Covid cases.\nIn any case, even with an end to the two week quarantine requirement, a recovery to the 40 million tourists who came in 2019 is unlikely next year, or even the year after.\nJust over 70,000 visitors came into the country in the first eight months of this year, compared with 40 million in the whole of 2019.\nThailand has reported more than 1.7 million confirmed Covid cases since the pandemic began, with nearly 18,000 deaths, according to America's Johns Hopkins University."

      "title": "Brexit: Lord Frost proposes 'entirely new' NI protocol",
      "tags": "NI Brexit,Brexit",
      "text": "Brexit Minister Lord Frost has proposed plans for an entirely new protocol to replace the existing Northern Ireland Protocol.\nIn a speech to diplomats in Portugal on Tuesday, he described his new legal text as \"a better way forward\".\nThe protocol is the special Brexit deal agreed for Northern Ireland to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. \nUnionists argue it undermines Northern Ireland's constitutional position in the UK and creates a trade barrier. \nIn a plea to the European Union to allow for \"significant change\" to post-Brexit rules governing trade with Northern Ireland, Lord Frost said his proposed text would support the Good Friday Agreement.\nHe said it was forward-looking, improved on the current \"excessively rigid\" protocol, and would allow the EU and UK to \"get back to normal\" by removing \"the poison\" from their relationship.\nWith the EU expected to put forward proposals on Wednesday, Lord Frost again warned Brussels London could unilaterally waive some of the terms of its agreement if the bloc failed to budge.\n\"We have a short, but real, opportunity to put in place a new arrangement, to defuse the political crisis that is brewing, both in Northern Ireland and between us,\" Lord Frost said.\nHowever, Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Louise Haigh said the move to replace the protocol was \"stoking tension while solving nothing\". \nIn a tweet, the Labour MP said Lord Frost's speech \"sets the stage for another destabilising stand-off, with the agreement businesses and communities need further away than ever\". \n\"Stability, jobs and livelihoods depend on real progress in Northern Ireland in the coming weeks,\" she said. \n\"It would be a serious abdication of responsibility to block a pragmatic way forward and provoke more poisonous instability.\"   \nLord Frost urged the EU to look carefully at the UK's new legal text, and said the existing protocol could not survive, as it did not have support right across Northern Ireland.\nHe also warned the UK could still trigger Article 16 - which allows either side to effectively override large parts of the agreement - if the EU and UK could not agree on changes to the existing protocol.\n\"We would not go down this route gratuitously or with any particular pleasure but it is our fundamental responsibility to safeguard peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland and that is why we cannot rest until this situation is addressed,\" said Lord Frost.\nThere are two schools of thought about how this latest negotiation is shaping up.\nThe first is that Lord Frost's hard line on the European Court of Justice (ECJ) is standard pre-negotiation tactics, aimed at grinding out another concession or two.\nAfter all the Brexit process has always delivered a deal, even at times when it seemed improbable.\nThe UK government wants to remove the ECJ from its oversight role as part of the Northern Ireland Protocol, saying as long as it continues the protocol will never survive. \nThe EU, on the other hand, has said it would be very hard for the protocol to continue without the court's oversight.\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney has warned that the UK's demands on the protocol could cause \"a breakdown in relations\" with the EU.\nHe has hinted that maybe the UK doesn't want a deal unless it's total victory.\nUnder that scenario, the UK would go through the motions before triggering Article 16.\nIt would use this to gut the protocol while calculating that the EU's ability to retaliate is limited or or at least would take a long time to amount to anything.\nWe should find out which view is right by the end of this year.\nThe Brexit minister said the protocol represented \"a moment of EU overreach when the UK's negotiating hand was tied\" and that it could not \"reasonably last in its current form\".\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed up to the protocol as part of his Brexit agreement in 2020, but has since argued it was agreed in haste and was no longer working for the people of Northern Ireland.\nThe EU has repeatedly said it would not renegotiate the protocol, criticising the UK for reneging on an agreement that both sides signed in good faith.\nThe UK government also wants to reverse its previous agreement on the oversight role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which is the EU's highest court.\nLord Frost said his new text proposed reliance on \"international arbitration instead of a system of EU law ultimately policed in the court of one of the parties\".\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - Northern Ireland's largest unionist party - said if the current protocol was not replaced with a long-term solution Northern Ireland would be exposed to \"further harm and instability\". \nThe DUP leader has previously warned his party may quit Stormont if its demands over the protocol are not met.\nBut Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the protocol was an international treaty that \"recognises the special status of this island.\"\nIts implementation, the Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president added, was \"not negotiable\".\n\"The conduct of the British government throughout these negotiations has been duplicitous and disgraceful and is an effort to break yet another international agreement\".\nShe said: \"The attempts by the Tories and the DUP to undermine the protections and opportunities of the Protocol and impose a hard border must be opposed\".\nUlster Unionist assembly member Steve Aiken said it was \"self-evident\" the existing protocol was not working.\nHe said the party would consider the UK government's legal text and the EU proposals due on Wednesday.\nThese will focus on easing practical problems, rather than changing oversight arrangements.\nBut Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry MP said Lord Frost had \"chosen to enter into another layer of delusion\".\nMr Farry said short of the UK \"rejoining the Customs Union and Single Market, there is no alternative than for the UK to work with the EU in a spirit of partnership to achieve as many mitigations and flexibilities as possible.\"\nSDLP MLA Matthew O'Toole said Lord Frost's remarks represented a \"deliberate distortion of facts and contempt for people here\".\nHe said Lord Frost had negotiated the protocol, agreed to its terms and \"backed Boris Johnson's campaign to sell it during the last general election\".\nTraditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said: \"If, as Lord Frost says, it is the UK that governs Northern Ireland, then, there must be an end to the European Union's writ in this part of the United Kingdom.\n\"Put simply, it requires an end to the Protocol in all its parts.\" \nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he hoped the UK government was \"serious about moving on in partnership\".\nHe said Wednesday's EU proposals \"will deliver practical solutions to make the Protocol work better\".\nOn Monday, Mr Coveney accused the UK of repeatedly dismissing EU proposals for the protocol ahead of their publication."

      "title": "Betsi Cadwaladr: Hospital restructuring blamed for amputation",
      "text": "A distraught wife says her husband faces losing both his legs due to flawed restructuring by a health board.\nVascular services were centralised by Betsi Cadwaladr health board at Glan Clwyd hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, in April 2019. \nBut it was controversial, and resulted in several high profile resignations. \nThe health board says it remains \"committed to providing a stable, high quality vascular service for north Wales\".\nIt says it has \"invested \u00a32.3m in a state-of-the art hybrid vascular theatre\" at Glan Clwyd hospital.\nEarlier this year, Arfon MS Sian Gwenllian called for the overhaul of vascular services to be undone.\nThe vascular system is made up of arteries and veins, and is the body's way of circulating blood between the heart and different organs.\nEsyllt Calley from Llanllyfni, Gwynedd, is adamant that removing specialist services from her local hospital in Bangor has been detrimental to patients like her husband.\nSince 2019, people from around north Wales have had to travel to access a centralised vascular service in Bodelwyddan.\nPete Calley, 51, is currently a patient at Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor, awaiting an operation to amputate his second leg because of complications originating from diabetes he has lived with for 22 years. \nSix years ago he had toes amputated at Glan Clwyd hospital, but Mrs Calley claims the surgery was not conducted properly which she said led to a further operation and months of rehabilitation. \nHe returned to Glan Clwyd 18 months ago needing to have his leg amputated. Mrs Calley said they had to operate three times within a week.\nMrs Calley said her husband now has Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) after undergoing several operations at the Glan Clwyd site, where vascular services are now centralised. He is refusing to return there for treatment.\n\"He's been affected so badly. Just saying the name 'Glan Clwyd' is enough to send him into a panic attack. I feel I've lost the man I married. I love my husband, but he's changed.\"\nShe said Betsi Cadwaladr health board had now agreed to fund his treatment at a Liverpool hospital.\nBreaking down in tears, Mrs Calley was adamant the restructuring of the vascular services in north Wales had affected her husband's health.\n\"I know Pete would still have his leg if it wasn't for Glan Clwyd. And he certainly wouldn't be a double amputee,\" she said.\n\"Within two years of having the vascular unit at Glan Clwyd, he's facing becoming a double amputee. In six years as a patient at Ysbyty Gwynedd, he lost no more than two toes.\n\"I just don't understand why they moved a unit that was so good.\"\nProfessor Dean Williams, who resigned from his position as head of the vascular unit in Ysbyty Gwynedd in 2019, said he had helped develop a world-class limb salvage unit at the hospital.\nHe said he had received assurances from senior staff at Betsi Cadwaladr health board that this service would remain at the Bangor site, despite centralisation at Glan Clwyd.\n\"When the centralisation went ahead, all major vascular surgery and emergency admissions were removed from Bangor,\" said Prof Williams.\n\"To have agreements thrown away, see a world-class service dismantled and then see the predicted consequences of that decision unfold in front of us was difficult and is still difficult to witness.\"\nBethan Russell-Williams, who was an independent board member at Betsi Cadwaladr, also resigned over the plans to reform vascular services, and said she had no regrets.\n\"Patient outcomes are much worse now than they were when services were available at Ysbyty Gwynedd,\" she said. \n\"More patients are having major lower limb amputations, and more patients are dying following major lower limb amputations.\"\nResponding to the allegations, Dr Nick Lyons, executive medical director of Betsi Cadwaladr, said: \"Even in this large health board area, we do not have the volume of complex vascular cases for teams to keep their skills and expertise up at each of the three acute hospitals.\" \nDr Lyons said a review conducted last year by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) found \"that the service has a robust surgical on-call arrangement and appropriate pathways for emergency and complex vascular intervention\".\n\"The RCS noted the commitment from all involved to improve the service and that 'an excellent foundation' is in place to continue the development and improvement of the vascular service in north Wales,\" he added.\nThe Welsh government said: \"We cannot comment on individual cases and this is a matter for the health board. We are in regular dialogue with the health board and will continue to monitor progress within the vascular service.\""

      "text": "The number of job vacancies in the UK has hit a record high, according to the latest official figures.\nVacancies hit 1.1 million between July and September, the Office for National Statistics said, the highest level since records began in 2001.\nThe largest increase in vacancies was in the retail sector and in motor vehicle repair, it said.\nThe UK unemployment rate was estimated at 4.5%, compared with a rate of 4% before the pandemic.\nThe ONS said the number of employees on payrolls showed another monthly increase, rising 207,000 to a record 29.2 million in September.\n\"The jobs market has continued to recover from the effects of the coronavirus, with the number of employees on payroll in September now well exceeding pre-pandemic levels,\" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS.\n\"Vacancies also reached a new one-month record in September, at nearly 1.2 million, with our latest estimates suggesting that all industries have at least as many jobs on offer now as before the onset of Covid-19.\"\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said it was \"encouraging\" to see the government's jobs strategy working.\n\"The number of expected redundancies remained very low in September, there are more employees on payrolls than ever before and the unemployment rate has fallen for eight months in a row.\"\nHowever, Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said labour market shortages \"could stunt\" the UK's economic recovery from the pandemic.\n\"The recovery is testing the capacity of the economy to adjust to a new post-pandemic environment, a task made more difficult by the reduced availability of overseas workers,\" she said.\n\"Acute skill shortages have pushed vacancies to record levels for a second month in a row in September, as employers struggled to find skilled staff.\"\nMark Jenkins, a supply chain director for London-based food wholesaler Brakes, says pressure on the industry is \"extreme\". Staff retention is a problem, he says.\n\"For every two people we hire, only one person stays, because there are other jobs in the market.\n\"Wages have gone up by 15% to 20% in some parts of the business in order to attract the right kind of people. And on top of that we're paying retention bonuses to hang on to the staff we do have.\n\"Everything is making it really difficult for us to service our customers\". \nMark says the cost of higher wages will have to be passed on.\n\"Our suppliers are passing on costs, we're passing some of those costs to our customers, and at the end of the day, the consumers will feel the pain.\"\nSectors that had large increases in vacancies included accommodation and food services, professional activities and manufacturing. Hospitality is the sector with the most vacancies per 100 workers.\nA shortage of lorry drivers, which the industry has blamed on factors including Covid, Brexit and tax changes, has affected fuel supplies in recent weeks and also disrupted food supply chains.\nThe Institute for Employment Studies (IES) said labour shortages were \"affecting the whole economy, and where likely between a quarter and a third is explained by lower migration\".\nTony Wilson, director of the IES, said there were now fewer unemployed people per vacancy than at any time in at least 40 years.\nIn particular this is down to fewer older people in work and more young people in education he said.\n\"These shortages are holding back our economic recovery, and won't fix themselves by just exhorting firms to pay people more.\"\nThe number of people who were economically inactive - those who were not looking for work - fell by 91,000 compared to the previous quarter, but rose by 50,000 compared with last year.\nIt's a good time to be looking for a job.\nThe number of vacancies hit another record high of 1.1 million and average weekly earnings, including bonuses, are 7.2% higher than this time last year.\nHowever, these numbers contain a number of Covid-related distortions.\nThe wage numbers are flattered by comparisons to last year when furlough schemes depressed wages and hours worked.\nIf you strip that out wage rises are closer to 4%.\nThat is higher than inflation currently, but the Bank of England expects inflation to rise to at least 4% by the end of the year.\nThat will offset wage rises for those lucky enough to get them.\nBut it will see lower living standards for the many who won't: 5.6 million public sector workers, for example.\nHigher wages have understandably been welcomed by the government, but there is less evidence of the higher skills that it is hoped will accompany them.\nAnd the high number of vacancies suggest that there is now a mismatch between the jobs people want and the ones that are available.\nLike other sectors, the construction industry is struggling to fill vacancies at the moment.\nKaty Jordan runs Storey homes, a small house-building company in Bedfordshire. She's having trouble recruiting for certain roles such as site managers, and is having to pay staff more to keep them.\n\"It's really tough. What we're finding is that it's difficult to employ people on a permanent basis because it's easy for our site staff to have their heads turned by more money elsewhere.\"\nKaty is having to raise wages to attract people to the company, and keep the people she already has, but she says that's not addressing a shortage of skills and experience in the industry.\n\"We're paying people what we need to pay them to attract them to come to work for us, because the labour market is so hot at the moment, but what we're not seeing is the productivity of those people adding value to our business on all levels and at all times, and that's what businesses need.\"\n\"It's great that people can earn more money. We want people to be attracted to the construction industry. But we're not attracting people with the right skills at the moment,\" she says.\nThe record level of vacancies and hiring rates in September \"bode well for the million workers coming off furlough in October\", the Resolution Foundation think tank said, and should \"help limit any increases in unemployment\".\nThe furlough scheme, which saw the government pay towards wages during the Covid pandemic, ended at the end of September with nearly one million workers expected to have been on it.\nHowever, a wave of potential job cuts has not happened, early data has suggested.\nThe ONS data showed annual growth in average pay, excluding bonuses, was 6% in the June-to-August period.\nHowever, the ONS stressed again this figure has been affected by the impact on lower paid jobs during the pandemic and also by comparisons with last year when more workers were on furlough.\nThe number of people unemployed in the June-to-August period fell by 126,000 to 1.5 million, the ONS said, while the number employed rose 235,000 to 32.4 million.\nThe rise in employment coupled with the strong wage growth \"increases the chances of the Bank of England raising interest rates in the coming months despite other evidence that the economic recovery is spluttering\" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.\nThe Bank could become the first major central bank to raise interest rates since the beginning of the pandemic as inflation shoots up.\nInflation is expected to rise above 4% by the end of the year, fuelled by rising energy costs.\nBut the Bank is watching to see how many people became unemployed after the end of the furlough programme before making a decision."

Industry predictions suggest gas prices could go up by as much as 50%.\nThere is a separate energy market in Northern Ireland, with two gas suppliers, and prices have risen sharply for consumers there too.\nThere's been a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies over the past year.\nAs a result, wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. At the end of December, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about \u00a32,000 next year.\nReasons for the increase include:\nThere are a number of technical and geopolitical issues at play as well, which mean many countries across Europe are grappling with the same problems.\nHowever, the UK is hit relatively hard-hit because it is one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas. Around 85% of homes have gas central heating, and it also generates a third of the country's electricity. \nStorage capacity in the UK is also lower than in some other European countries.\nSince wholesale gas prices started to spike, more than 20 retail energy suppliers have collapsed in the UK. \nThis is largely because the energy price cap prevented retailers from passing on higher wholesale prices to their customers.\nSeveral smaller companies, with fewer reserves, could not weather this.\nFailed firms include Bulb Energy, with 1.7 million customers. Because of its size, it was put into \"special administration\", and is now run by the government, through Ofgem.\nNearly four million customers have been affected. Many households saw their energy prices rise when their supplier went bust, and they were switched over to a more expensive deal with another supplier.\nThe government faces calls from energy companies, the opposition, and even some of its own MPs, to do more to prevent prices from rising too much.\nSuggestions include:\nIn the past, consumers have been encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise.\nBut at the moment better offers - including fixed deals - are simply not available.\nPeople already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, householders are being encouraged to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.\nThe Energy Saving Trust says that simple changes to our homes and habits could offset the current price rises.\nMany companies face a considerable rise in their bills. That could mean they have to: \nEnergy-intensive industries are particularly exposed, but the problem affects every company that has to pay energy bills - even if it is just to heat an office or shop."

      "text": "A record Euromillions jackpot will roll over after no ticket holder won in Tuesday's draw. \nBut the \u00a3184m prize will not be added to for the next draw on Friday as it has reached its maximum level.\nThe previous largest UK prize was in 2019 when an anonymous ticket-holder won the \u00a3170m Euromillions jackpot.\nCamelot's Andy Carter said \"any money that would have gone into the jackpot will now boost prizes in the next winning prize tier\".\nTuesday's winning numbers were 06, 13, 22, 45, 49 with Lucky Stars 10, 11. The Millionaire Maker Selection was ZKZF66866.\nThe National Lottery said a \"huge influx of players\" before the 19:30 BST cut-off time caused its website and app to run slower than normal - although some customers said they were unable to access the website at all.\nSpeaking ahead of the draw, Mr Carter said he had seen a wide range of reactions from winners over the years.\n\"I've seen people be sick with excitement, I've seen people resign their job on the spot, I've seen people jumping up and down.\n\"I've known husbands who haven't told wives and wives who haven't told husbands, I've been to homes where there's literally a party going on already,\"  said Mr Carter, whose job it is to advise winners.\nThe jackpot for Euromillions - which is played in nine European countries - is currently capped at \u20ac220m, meaning that once it reaches that point it cannot roll over again and add extra prize money. \nThat cap was reached on Friday and the jackpot will stay at the same level for five draws unless it is won.\nBut on the fifth occasion the jackpot amount must be won - even if that means sharing it among all those ticket-holders who are just one number short.\nThe Euromillions jackpot cap rises by \u20ac10m whenever it is won somewhere in one of the nine countries. The cap was most recently raised in February this year. It can keep rising until a maximum of \u20ac250m.\nMr Carter or one of his colleagues would be among the first people to speak to any winner, to provide them with advice and put them in touch with previous winners.\n\"If you've won a large amount of money, the best thing you can do is go and have a cup of tea with another winner, because they're the people that will truly understand,\" Mr Carter said.\nWith \u00a3184m under their belt, a UK winner could buy a house in each of the top 10 priciest streets in the UK, including in Kensington Palace Gardens in London, where the average house price is nearly \u00a330m."

She wears basketball shorts and gold teeth, and sings about wanting a boy who's \"so hood, so good, so damn taboo\".\nSome people say it is wrong for white people to profit from imitating stereotypically black characteristics - when black people themselves have been held back for having the very same characteristics. \nBut Nicki Minaj said: \"There's a lot of women out here in the United States that tan, get bigger lips. \n\"I wear straight blonde hair when I want to.\"\nNicki went on to say Jesy's bandmates were only \"calling [her] out\" to help their \"personal vendetta\" against her.\nShe said: \"Don't wait a decade after you've made millions with the person.\"\nJesy laughed as Nicki Minaj referred to her ex-bandmates as \"clowns\". So far, there's been no response from Leigh-Anne or the rest of the band.\nJesy later said: \"My intention is never to offend people of colour with this video and my song.\n\"When I was in the video with [Nicki], I didn't even have any fake tan on. I'd been in Antigua prior to that for three weeks.\n\"I'm just really lucky that as a white girl, when I'm in the sun I tan so dark.\n\"My hair's naturally curly, I've always had curly hair. I wanted to get a wig that emulated the same texture as my hair, I genuinely didn't think I was doing anything wrong.\"\nIn a recent interview with Vulture, Jesy said: \"I'm very aware that I'm a white British woman; I've never said that I wasn't.\"\nNewsbeat has asked Jesy Nelson's label Polydor to comment about the video but so far, there's been no response.\nSome fans have been asking how this video was approved, and why the artists decided to discuss it on Instagram live.\nGeorge Griffiths is a freelance pop music critic, and he was tuned in last night. He told Newsbeat he found it \"really chaotic\".\n\"I know everything is managed by PR and management to a certain degree but that did not look managed at all.\n\"This was to celebrate her debut single with Nicki Minaj, Boyz, and there wasn't a lot of celebration involved.\n\"It took a turn for the worst and didn't really recover. It was awkward to watch it I can't imagine how awkward it would have been to participate in it.\"\nBut George says that it doesn't need to taint the past success of Little Mix.\n\"When you see members of a pop group argue, fans kind of rewrite history. But all those great moments happened and just because this has happened now it doesn't invalidate all the strength and the happiness The Little Mix put forward before the split.\"\nJesy Nelson is not the first person to be accused of blackfishing.

It is unclear if Mr Khalili has obtained this visa, or if he is travelling to the US.\nSince 2008, approximately 70,000 Afghans have been resettled in the US on an SIV."

      "text": "Firms hit by a sharp surge in energy prices are expected to get government help worth hundreds of millions of pounds, the BBC understands.\nGlass, ceramic and paper manufacturers have warned that rising prices may mean they have to charge customers more.\nOn Monday, business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng submitted a formal proposal asking the Treasury to help such firms.\nThe Department for Business expects the prime minister to back its proposals, which could involve state-backed loans.\nThe government is reluctant to prop up companies which would normally be competitive, which is why support is likely to involve loans rather than grants.\nThe Treasury is said to be still analysing the proposal. Number 10 has declined to comment. \nBusinesses have said they hope for a \"swift response\" on the plans.\nHigh energy costs have been forcing manufacturers in energy-intensive industries such as steel and chemical manufacturing to warn of higher prices for their goods as they pass on increases to consumers.\nOther firms have said they may be forced to shut down their factories if the rising cost of gas and electricity makes it uneconomic for them to produce their goods.\nDr Richard Leese, chair of the Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) - an umbrella group for several manufacturers including ceramics and paper, told the BBC's Today programme that a quick response from the Treasury to the proposals was \"crucial\".\n\"We need preventative action to stop the issue spreading further.\"\nDr Leese said firms in the sector faced higher tax and levies than European rivals. He said firms had put forward \"practical and sensible\" measures for help, and denied that government help would put any additional burden on taxpayers.\nGareth Stace, the director general of the trade body UK Steel, said he had yet to see details of the proposals put forward.\nHe warned that without adequate support, plants could close and jobs could be under threat as high energy costs bite.\n\"The key test in this proposal is are we now going to be on an equal footing with steelmakers in Germany?,\" Mr Stace said.\n\"If this package results in us still paying 80% more for energy than our competitors in continental Europe, then really this will really be a flimsy sticking plaster on what is really a major crisis that we are going through at the moment.\"\nKendal paper manufacturer James Cropper PLC has been in business since 1845 and is one of the biggest employers in the area.\nToday, it also makes home insulation and carbon paper, with energy bills working out at about \u00a360,000 every single week.\nIts chief executive, Phil Wild, told BBC Breakfast: \"Any price increase is significant for a manufacturer like ours that consumes the energy that we do. \n\"As it happens, we're probably OK here because of some actions we've put in place, but I can see some of those businesses may not make it.\"\nHe added that the recent increase in gas prices had highlighted the need for energy intensive firms to start using more renewable forms of energy, rather than fossil fuels and gas.\nBut in the short-term, paper, glass, steel and ceramics manufacturers \"are really looking to the government for help to get them over that hump\", he said.\nThe proposals by Business Secretary Kwarteng follow days of conversations with leaders from affected industries, as well as a very public row with the Treasury about the status of talks between the government departments.\nDemands for support from energy-intensive industries have been growing louder, but not all companies are affected in the same way.\nSome have long-term contracts to buy energy at fixed prices, protecting them from short-term increases, but others do not. \nBusinesses themselves have called for their energy costs to be capped, in the same way that households currently benefit from a price cap imposed by regulator Ofgem.\nBut that would risk simply passing on the extra costs to energy suppliers, says our correspondent.\nDirect subsidies would add to the burden on taxpayers, at a time when Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to seek to curb public spending in his next Budget on 27 October.\nThere are many reasons, both in the UK and around the world. \nThere's been a shortage of gas and energy in many countries as they emerged from lockdown and industry reopened. \nA cold winter in Europe last year also put pressure on supplies and, as a result, less gas is being stored than normal. \nOn top of that, the UK has fewer gas storage facilities than some countries - meaning it buys more on the wholesale market and is exposed to sharp price rises. \nThere's also increased demand from Asia (which also suffered a cold winter) for liquefied natural gas. And there is a suspicion that Russia, a major gas supplier, is restricting output - an accusation it denies - which, following the law of supply and demand, has fuelled price rises.\nThis has helped push up gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia. Since January, they've risen 250%. And prices have soared 70% since August alone.\nRead more here"

A source said an urgent solution was needed. \nIt's now up to the Treasury to decide whether to accept them.\nBBC political correspondent Adam Fleming said earlier that business minister Lee Rowley, rather than Mr Kwarteng, was due to lead Monday's meeting - and would lead another with steel bosses on Tuesday.\nMinisters also met industry leaders on Friday.\nDave Dalton, chief executive of the British Glass trade body called for \"immediate action\" following that meeting.\nHe said some members of his group might have to shut production permanently, although no firm had been forced to do so yet.\nAdrian Curry, managing director of UK-based Encirc, one of the largest container glass plants in Europe, said industry was not asking for a bailout, but the situation for some companies was critical.\n\"We pay more for our energy than competitors in other countries,\" he told the BBC. He said his company would normally spend \u00a340m a year on energy, but was now looking at bills up to \u00a3100m.\nThere are many reasons, both in the UK and around the world. \nThere's been a shortage of gas and energy in many countries as they emerged from lockdown and industry reopened. \nA cold winter in Europe last year also put pressure on supplies and, as a result, less gas is being stored than normal. \nOn top of that, the UK has fewer gas storage facilities than some countries - meaning it buys more on the wholesale market and is exposed to sharp price rises. \nThere's also increased demand from Asia (which also suffered a cold winter) for liquefied natural gas.

      "text": "A detective investigating the circumstances of serial killer Stephen Port's first homicide felt that the case was likely to be one of murder and told senior officers of his concerns.\nAnthony Walgate, 23, was found dead outside Port's flat block in June 2014.\nDet Ch Insp Tony Kirk tried to establish a murder inquiry, an email shown to an inquest jury revealed.\nPort would go on to murder three more men using the date rape drug GHB before homicide detectives took on the case.\nThe inquest jury at Barking Town Hall also heard evidence from Det Ch Insp Christopher Jones, the senior murder detective involved in the case in the week after the death.\nDet Ch Insp Jones told the hearing it was \"not possible\" that detectives would have taken the case less seriously because Mr Walgate was \"young, gay and working as an escort\".\nThe jury, which is examining the Metropolitan Police's handling of the investigation, heard Det Ch Insp Kirk's email was sent a week after Mr Walgate's body was found outside Port's flat in Cooke Street in Barking, east London.\nIt set out that it was known to the force that Port, now 46, had lied to officers about not knowing Mr Walgate, who he had in fact arranged to meet two days before the killing. \nA post-mortem examination found that the 23-year-old died as a result of ingesting high levels of the date rape drug GHB.\nThe jury heard how Det Ch Insp Kirk pointed out in his email that Port had previously had an allegation made against him that he had drugged and raped another man, and had no means of paying the \u00a3800 Mr Walgate charged for his work as an escort - which was how the two men came to meet each other.\nIn the message, to Supt John Sweeney of Homicide Command, Det Ch Insp Kirk said: \"I feel we as an organisation have a duty to his (Mr Walgate's) friends and family to get to the bottom of his death in what are increasingly suspicious circumstances.\n\"This investigation concerns the death of a young and what appears to be a fit and healthy male and, on the balance of probabilities, at the hands of another. \n\"I appreciate that a murder charge might not be the final outcome, but the investigation is becoming increasingly complex.\"\nSupt Sweeney decided to leave the investigation with the less experienced detectives in the Barking borough command, the inquest heard.\nJurors were also told that detectives did not then carry out a vital download of Port's laptop requested by the homicide team. \nThe laptop, which had been seized by police, contained evidence of him using search terms to do with drugging and raping boys, the inquest heard.\nThe paramedic who found Mr Walgate's body previously told the jury he had regarded it as an \"unexplained suspicious death\".\nSpeaking on Monday, Det Ch Insp Jones explained that in his opinion at the time, the death was unexplained - but he said he had not been told the post-mortem examination had found bruises suggesting Mr Walgate had been moved while he was still alive. \nNor had he been told that dead man's underpants were inside out and back to front, the jury heard.\nPort's next two victims, Gabriel Kovari, 22, and Daniel Whitworth, 21, were found dead by the same dog-walker three weeks apart beneath a large maple tree in a corner of the same cemetery, at St Margaret's Church.\nMr Kovari's body was found on 28 August 2014 and Mr Whitworth's was discovered on 20 September, in almost exactly the same spot.\nThe final victim, aspiring police officer Jack Taylor, 25, was found near the cemetery on 14 September 2015.\nIn 2016, Port was found guilty at the Old Bailey of the four murders and sentenced to a whole-life order.\nThe inquest hearing continues."

      "tags": "Sarah Everard murder,Metropolitan Police Service,Greenwich",
      "text": "Radio presenter Emma Wilson has said Sarah Everard's murderer Wayne Couzens flashed her and that Met Police officers laughed when she reported it.\nThe Magic FM DJ - who is also known as Emma B - said he exposed himself to her when she walked past an alleyway in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2008.\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour she recognised him when she saw his photo in news reports.\nThe Met Police is investigating the presenter's complaint. \nMs Wilson told the programme she was \"so very sure\" it was Couzens - who at the time was a volunteer officer with Kent Police - and that it \"adds to the clamour of chances there were to stop this man\".\nCouzens - who went on to become a Met Police officer - was given a whole-life term last month for the kidnap, rape and murder of Ms Everard.\nThe police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), is looking into the Met's handling of three other alleged indecent exposure incidents involving Couzens, including two said to have taken place in south London three days before he murdered Ms Everard.\nThe other allegation centres around a report of how Kent Police investigated a claim in 2015. Details of a car linked to Couzens had been passed on to police but he was not identified. \nA Met Police review found that an allegation Couzens exposed himself outside a fast-food restaurant in the days before he murdered Ms Everard had been allocated for investigation, but by the time of the marketing executive's abduction it was not concluded.\nThe IOPC said two Met officers had been served with misconduct notices for possible breaches of professional standards in relation to the incident.\nMs Wilson said she knows it was Couzens who exposed himself to her as he had a \"face that doesn't go anywhere, it stays with you\".\nShe explained how she ran into a nearby shop to alert police who then visited her to take a statement. \n\"They were asking me what I could see... he was playing with himself and there were specifics about his state of arousal that they thought were quite amusing. It was really humiliating,\" Ms Wilson said.\n\"I remember clearly saying to them, 'I really hope this is all he needs to do' and I said that at the time because I was so struck by how feeble their response was.\"\nThe presenter said the incident was \"aggressive, it was purposeful, it was calculated\" and that \"it wasn't this comic character that we have of this local peeping Tom or the local flasher in the flasher mac\".\n\"There's a really big part of me that hopes it wasn't him because if it was, this is horrific that it could have gone on for so very, very long.\"\nThe Met Police said at the time, that a search of the area was conducted but the suspect could not be found. CCTV inquiries were unsuccessful and the matter was passed on to the local safer neighbourhoods team for intelligence.\nThe force added that to the best of its knowledge, it was \"not aware\" of any reports before his March arrest where he had been named as a suspect. \nIt said if it received any allegations it would investigate.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Met Police Deputy Commissioner Bas Javid acknowledged there was a \"crisis\" of confidence in policing in the wake of Ms Everard's murder.   \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: \"We want women and girls particularly to feel safe in communities. \n\"There's a lot of work to be done to rebuild that trust and give people the confidence to come forward.\"\nHe said as well as the independent review into the force's standards and culture, the Met Police was taking other steps to be \"proactive\".\nThose measures include undertaking an examination of all ongoing sexual and domestic abuse allegations against officers and staff, and significantly boosting the number of officers who investigate police misconduct."

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Grenfell Tower Inquiry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new report by MPs has put the government's decision-making during the coronavirus pandemic under the spotlight.\nIt's led to fresh calls for an independent public inquiry to begin straight away - but the government says it will not start before the spring.\nThe report, by the Health and Social Care Committee and the Science and Technology Committee, says the late lockdown in the early stages of the pandemic is \"one of the most important public health failures the United Kingdom has ever experienced\".\nIt also describes the start of the NHS Test and Trace system as \"slow, uncertain and often chaotic\", although it also highlights the success of the vaccination programme.\nThe MPs' report, which predominantly focuses on the response to the pandemic in England, is nothing to do with the official public inquiry, which will have a different remit and format.\nIn May, the prime minister announced that he intended to launch an inquiry into the pandemic in the first half of 2022. \nHe told MPs a delay was necessary to avoid putting too much stress on the NHS, advisers and government while there was the risk of a winter surge later this year.\nThe exact aims and remit - known as the terms of reference - will be announced closer to the start of the inquiry next year. \nThis is partly to allow time for the UK government to work with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on the scope.\nSeparately, Scotland plans to start its own inquiry later this year.\nThe job of a public inquiry is to respond to \"public concern\" about a particular event or set of events - such as the pandemic. \nAccording to a leading specialist lawyer, it must ask three questions: \nAn inquiry has the power to make people appear as witnesses, and to provide documentation and material evidence.\nAt the end, the inquiry usually draws up a report and makes recommendations to the government.\nPrevious high-profile public inquiries have included investigations into the UK's role in the Iraq war, the events of Bloody Sunday in Northern Ireland and the phone-hacking scandal.\nBoris Johnson has promised the chair of the inquiry will be appointed by Christmas.\nMinisters can appoint whoever they like to lead an inquiry but they must be independent from the government. \nJudges are often used but sometimes other experts are chosen. \nWhether the chair is a judge or not does not affect the legal powers of the inquiry.\nThe chair can call whoever they want - whether they are witnesses to an event or people with a particular expertise.\nFailing to turn up to evidence sessions or provide documents without a reasonable excuse is a criminal offence under the 2005 Inquiries Act. \nIn England and Wales, it can lead to a sentence of up to 51 weeks in prison.\nUnless there are good reasons to hold sessions behind closed doors, it is likely most evidence sessions will be on TV and online. The prime minister confirmed that evidence will be given \"in public, under oath\".\nThe Leveson Inquiry into practices of the press - set up following the phone-hacking scandal - heard evidence from well-known figures such as Piers Morgan, Hugh Grant and Rupert Murdoch.\nSome evidence sessions during the inquiry into the Iraq war were held in private either due to national security concerns or protect the identity of witnesses.\nThere are 10 currently under way - these include inquiries into the Grenfell Fire and the Manchester Arena bombing, as well as wider topics such as undercover policing and child sexual abuse.\nIt is up to the government whether to launch an inquiry. \nAccording to legislation passed in 2005, ministers can set one up if they think \"particular events have caused, or are capable of causing, public concern\", or if \"there is public concern that particular events may have occurred\".\nThere is no time limit on how long inquiries can last but they often take years to complete. This is partly because of the huge amount of evidence that needs to be read.\nThe Chilcot Inquiry, which looked at the Iraq War, was published in 2016, seven years after it started taking evidence, while the Bloody Sunday inquiry took 12 years.\nDame Deidre Hine, who authored a review into the swine flu pandemic, told the BBC, \"Looking at what will have to be the terms of reference and the ground it (the inquiry) has to cover, I can't see it reporting in less than two to three years.\""

      "tags": "Wales business,Cardiff,Menai Bridge,Employment,Hospitality industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A shortage of skilled workers has created a \"crazy period\" for the Welsh jobs market, a leading recruitment firm has said.\nCardiff-based Yolk Recruitment said candidates were in a \"position of control and power\".\nThe firm said clients' job vacancies had increased by 35% compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nOfficial figures show numbers in work in Wales rose by 25,000 in the three months to August.\nThere were also 44,000 more people in employment compared to the same quarter last year, Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showed.\nDespite this, unemployment in the three months to August increased by 0.2% to 4% overall - below the UK average of 4.5%.\nResearchers suggest that the shortage of skilled workers will remain a challenge for the next five years.\nSteven Lloyd, 47, from Gilfach, near Bridgend recently retrained as an HGV driver.\n\"The passion was always HGV and lorries, but unfortunately - with the cost - I was never able to afford the outlay for the training,\" said Steven.\nHe previously drove buses, but after being made redundant during the pandemic, retrained for his dream job. \nThe cost, which can run into thousands of pounds, has been covered by Remploy, which Steven was referred to by his Job Centre in Porth, Rhondda Cynon Taf.\n\"It has made my dream come true really, it is just wonderful,\" he said. \n\"With lorries, you are delivering goods, you're in the cab on your own - with the radio on, you can sing along. But it is also just being part of a team, especially with the shortage [of drivers]. You are contributing something really valuable at the moment.\"\nChief operating officer of John Raymond Transport, Geraint Davies, said the Bridgend-based company had turned to organisations such as Remploy after struggling to recruit drivers through the usual channels.\nThe company has had to increase wages to attract workers and while it has 140 drivers, could easily employ another 15 or 20 if they were available, he said.\n\"It is a crazy period that we have seen, especially since the start of the summer,\" said Pavan Arora, chief commercial officer for Yolk Recruitment in Cardiff.\nHis own team of recruiters has expanded to deal with the boom in vacancies.\nThe recruitment office has a gong which staff will strike when job deals are completed. It is being struck a lot these days.\n\"Right now, as a business, we have seen an increase of around 35% in demand compared to pre-pandemic levels. So that's 35% more jobs available and open,\" he said.\nThere have been well-publicised shortages among lorry drivers, but sectors including technology companies and financial services firms are also having difficulty finding staff.\nHospitality continues to struggle too, with wages increasing and some pubs and restaurants closing temporarily because of a lack of staff.\nMr Arora recalled thousands of applicants were chasing a few jobs as the pandemic took hold last year, but the reopening of society has flipped the jobs market. It means some job candidates have a choice of roles, and can demand increased salaries or more flexible working patterns.\n\"It is your pickings, it is your time, the position of control and power is in your court slightly,\" Mr Arora said.\n\"What you have to be aware of is that there are a lot of counter offers. So there are a lot of employers that are trying to retain staff as they look to leave a business.\n\"That is a challenge for new employers, but also candidates have to be aware that maybe they can get more from their current employer before going to the employment market, because everyone is feeling the pinch of how crazy the current jobs market is.\"\nThe shortage of skilled labour, even for entry level roles, is preoccupying businesses. Research by the Open University found the majority of Welsh companies it surveyed had suffered as a result of the shortage of workers.\n\"Employers are facing skills shortages, they are finding it challenging to recruit people into their businesses,\" said Rhys Griffiths, the business relationship manager for the Open University.\n\"Covid is having an impact on some of the decisions and challenges that they are facing,\" he added.\n\"But we have been tracking the skills shortage. What is apparent is that the skills shortages have been there for a number of years and will continue.\"\nUniversities and colleges are working with businesses to offer apprenticeships or tailored training, but the Open University's research found that firms expect staffing issues to continue for the next five years.\nHospitality businesses are already attempting to work with training providers to address the shortage.\nHospitality businesses are already attempting to work with training providers to address the shortage.\nThe north Wales restaurant group Dylan's is launching an academy, and will work with schools and colleges to recruit and train staff by providing a qualification and a guaranteed job.\nThe restaurant's head of marketing, David Retallick, said it was the company's response to the crisis in recruitment across the hospitality sector.\n\"It is an opportunity for us to offer working experience alongside the apprenticeship programmes that already exist. \n\"This is our own Dylan's spin on how we bring up and develop young people in the industry - allowing people to break in slowly, rather than giving them a shock-horror treatment where they go to their first job and they suddenly realise that they are really in the deep end.\"\nMr Retallick said the trainees would have working patterns that aimed to shed the image of antisocial hours and low pay that had traditionally been attached to hospitality jobs.\nHe said: \"We are limiting hours, we are not putting people on weekend work or on double shifts, and we are paying above the minimum wage for 16 to 21 year olds. We are just making sure it as well-facilitated by the business as possible.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Energy industry,Food industry,CO\u2082 shortage",
      "text": "A deal to avert another carbon dioxide crisis in the food and drink industry has been extended until early 2022.\nUS firm CF Industries, a key CO2 producer in the UK, has agreed to continue supplies of the gas. \nIt said that should give the government and firms time to find other sources of CO2, used in fizzy drinks and for keeping food fresh, as well as to stun pigs and chickens before slaughter.\nFirms will now have to pay more for their CO2, but it is unclear how much.\nLast month, the government stepped in to subsidise one of the firm's plants after its shutdown due to high gas prices threatened food supplies.\nCF Industries suspended production at two sites - Cheshire and Billingham - which make 60% of the UK's commercial carbon dioxide. \nIt reopened its Billingham plant in north-east England after the government agreed to meet the costs of running it for three weeks.\nBillingham produces up to 750 tonnes of CO2 per day as a by-product of producing ammonia for fertiliser. CF Industries' plant at Ince in Cheshire remains closed with no date given for a reopening.\nThe government said: \"CO2 suppliers have agreed to pay CF Fertilisers a price for the CO2 it produces that will enable it to continue operating while global gas prices remain high, drawing on support from industry and delivering value for money for the taxpayer.\"\nThe agreement meant industry could have confidence it would receive future CO2 supplies, without further taxpayer support, said the government.\nThe British Meat Processors Association said the agreement provided \"some reassurance that supplies will be maintained\". \n\"However, industry has been given no detail on what the price will be or how it will be calculated going forward,\" a spokesperson added. \n\"We understand that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng took the decision to temporarily exempt parts of the CO2 industry from competition law to facilitate this agreement. What we need now is some detail and transparency around how the new pricing structure will work.\"\nIan Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said the agreement was \"welcome news\".\nBut he added: \"The increased cost of buying CO2 is yet another burden on the food and drink industry, which is already facing enormous stresses. \n\"This will, of course, add more pressure on prices for shoppers and diners.\"\nBy Ben King, business reporter\nIt looks like there will be enough CO2 to keep Christmas beers bubbly - but after that, there are no guarantees.  \nThere's an ominous line in the CF Industries press release. They expect CO2 users to develop \"robust alternative sources\" between now and January. \nThat won't be easily done. Lots of industrial processes produce CO2, but few produce a stream so pure and reliable that you'd want to dissolve it in your lemonade. \nDistributor Nippon Gases has warned that supply is tight across Europe, so imports will be hard to come by. \nThe government says that the firms which need the CO2 from Billingham will be paying more for it - and whatever long-term solution does emerge, it's likely to be more expensive too.\nBut the UK only needs about 600,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. At about \u00a3200 a tonne before the current crisis, that's about \u00a3120m, relatively small beer for industries that count their turnover in the billions.\nCompared to the other pressures those industries face - staff shortages, and higher costs for energy and shipping - more expensive CO2 is an extra cost they don't need, but it won't be their biggest headache. \nWhen CF shut its facilities after making fertiliser became uneconomic because of the rising price of wholesale gas, it cut off a vital source of CO2 for other sectors.\nSupermarkets began reporting limited stocks of some food items, while the pig industry warned that if slaughterhouses could not process animals, then farmers would have to cull their stocks.\nThe US firm said it now expected the UK government and industrial gas customers to \"develop robust alternative sources of CO2 as part of a long-term solution for meeting demand in the country\".\nLast month, it emerged the British food industry would be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with CF Industries to restart production in the UK. \nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from \u00a3200 per tonne to \u00a31,000.\nHouseholds, too, are being hit by higher energy bills, with those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, seeing bills go up by \u00a3139 to \u00a31,277 a year on average.  \nSeveral energy suppliers, unable to pass on wholesale prices to consumers on fixed deal, have gone out of business. Their customers have been switched to other suppliers, but will be put on variable contracts that will be higher than previous deals. \nMeanwhile, the business department has sent the Treasury a formal request for support for energy-intensive industries hit by high gas prices, the BBC understands. \nIt came after talks between ministers and industry leaders earlier on Monday.\nA source said: \"Everyone in government understands the importance of this situation.\n\"We need to solve this quickly.\"\nDetails of the proposal from Mr Kwarteng have not been disclosed but are thought to focus on a temporary solution to high energy prices. \nOn Sunday, Mr Kwarteng told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme the situation was \"critical\" and said he was \"looking to find a solution\".\nMr Kwarteng said there were Treasury talks about support measures to ease the impact on firms. However, a Treasury source later said the business secretary had been \"mistaken\".\nSectors such as ceramics, paper and steel manufacturing have called for a price cap, though talks with government on Friday failed to reach a solution."

      "tags": "Floods,Climate change",
      "text": "Hundreds of people could die in floods in the UK, the Environment Agency has warned in a hard-hitting report that says the country is not ready for the impact of climate change. \nEarlier this year in Germany, dozens of people died in floods. \n\"That will happen in this country sooner or later\" unless the UK becomes more resilient to increasingly violent weather, the agency concludes.\nEmma Howard Boyd, chair of the agency, said: \"It is adapt or die.\"\nThe apocalyptic tone is deliberately intended to startle governments, companies and communities into preparing for global warming effects such as higher sea levels and more extremes of rainfall and drought.\nThe new report, seen by the BBC ahead of its publication on Wednesday, assesses the country's readiness to cope with the many different risks of climate change.\nIn its response, environment department Defra said it was taking key measures to protect the UK from the effects of global warming.\nWe are currently heading for an increase in the global average temperature of just under 3C by the end of the century.\nBut the agency projects that even a smaller rise of 2C would have severe consequences:\nAccording to Ms Howard Boyd: \"We can successfully tackle the climate emergency if we do the right things, but we are running out of time to implement effective adaptation measures.\n\"Some 200 people died in this summer's flooding in Germany. That will happen in this country sooner or later, however high we build our flood defences - unless we also make the places where we live, work and travel resilient to the effects of the more violent weather the climate emergency is bringing.\"\nRead more about the COP26 summit here.\nThe agency calls for new thinking on flood protection, closer partnerships between government and businesses, and projects to restore natural systems that absorb carbon and hold back rainwater.\nMs Howard Boyd added: \"With the right approach we can be safer and more prosperous. So let's prepare, act and survive.\"\nThe loss of life in Germany last July is a reminder of the last time flooding led to a massive death toll in the UK.\nBack in 1953, a storm surge killed 307 people in England and 19 in Scotland.\nThat tragedy forced a radical rethink about flood protection and a massive investment in coastal defences that eventually led to the Thames Barrier in London.\nNow, as officials across the UK weigh up future phases of flood defence, the report identifies what it calls five \"reality checks\" about climate change:\nThe agency calls for new thinking on flood protection, saying that \"business as usual\" approaches are no longer adequate.\nIn practical terms, that means better co-ordination between companies, national agencies and local authorities, with businesses and homeowners encouraged to take basic steps to flood-proof their own properties. \nIt wants more investment in natural ways of reducing flood risk, such as restoring upland areas that can retain rainwater upstream and improving management of the soil so there's less run-off. \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nThe agency also suggests trialling new arrangements and technologies for warning local communities about flood risks, and having closer coordination with other emergency services. \nThe agency acknowledges that billions of pounds have been spent on flood defences - and that more is earmarked.\nAnd it recognises that the UK, as host of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow next month, is highlighting the importance of helping communities and nature adapt to climate change.\nIn response, Defra highlighted several key measures designed to adapt to a changing climate: \u00a35.2bn to protect 336,000 properties from flooding and coastal erosion better; a national framework to manage water supplies; and a \u00a3640m Nature for Climate Fund to tackle climate change and adaptation together.\nA spokesperson said: \"We are taking robust action to improve resilience to climate change across the whole country and economy, and adaptation to climate change is integrated in policies throughout government.\n\"We're also using our COP26 presidency to drive climate adaptation around the world, protecting communities and natural habitats.\"\nFollow David on Twitter.\nDo you have any questions about the forthcoming COP26 global climate conference in Glasgow?\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

Of course it's never easy to draw the line, so to speak, but to look on as 40 million people descend into chaos because there's no electricity supply or financial system - that cannot and must not be the goal of the international community.\"\nBy Yogita Limaye, BBC News, Kabul\nThe takeover of this country has caused a massive shock to an economy that was just about surviving. \nBanks were closed for many days after the Taliban seized control, and while many have opened now, accessing cash is still difficult.\nMany businesses shut down because their owners fled the country fearing for their lives. Many of those who had jobs haven't received salaries for months. \nWith no cash in the market, there has been a sharp rise in prices of day to day necessities including food. An already difficult situation created by war and drought has become much worse. \nWomen who had jobs and supported their families can no longer work and are now entirely dependent on handouts. \nIn Kabul, hundreds of people are still living in the open in tents with harsher winter months fast approaching. \nDevelopment aid given by foreign countries and agencies to Afghanistan, which helped to put cash into the economy, is all but frozen. This, on the ground, means that people who worked on development projects are out of jobs. \nThe global community faces a tough decision - how to reach the Afghan people, without recognising a Taliban government.  \nThe chancellor said the Taliban must grant access to all UN bodies delivering aid, and stressed the need for the rights and girls and women to be respected.\nMrs Merkel's words were echoed by Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who was hosting the virtual summit.\nHe said G20 countries had to have contact with the Taliban but that did not mean recognition of the Islamist group's government.\nNot all G20 leaders were present - Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin sent representatives - but Mr Draghi said all participants had agreed on the need to provide more aid.\nThe leaders also discussed ways to prevent Afghanistan becoming a haven for militants such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group, and the need to provide safe passage for foreign nationals and Afghans hoping to leave Afghanistan.\nThe summit came as Western and Afghan officials met in Qatar to discuss aid, terrorism concerns and evacuation of foreigners.\nThese were the first direct talks between the two sides since US troops left Afghanistan and the Taliban took power in August.\nThe recent international moves come as Afghanistan faces what aid workers fear is a severe humanitarian crisis. \nAfghans have been describing their difficulties to the BBC.\n\"Nothing can be found, and even if it is available, it's too expensive and not affordable,\" one retired man said. \"I was paid last year and am still waiting on my salary, I have nothing to eat with my children.\"\nAnother, a government employee in the northern town of Takhar, complained that officials were lying about the payment of salaries.\n\"I've received nothing,\" he said. \"What type government is this?\u202f If an employee doesn't go to work, there would be complaints and an investigation. But if he's not being paid, how can he survive?\"\nUN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned at a donor conference last month in Geneva that the poverty rate was soaring and public services were close to collapse. \nSome 40% of the country's GDP - national output - comes from aid, according to the World Bank. \nThe US froze $10bn (\u00a37.3bn) of the country's central bank assets after the Taliban captured Kabul on 15 August.\nFor the poor in Kabul, the priority is staving off starvation, the BBC's Jeremy Bowen recently reported from the Afghan capital.

      "text": "Tory MP James Gray has been asked to step back from activities with a charity, after reports he mixed up two ethnic minority ministers at an event, saying \"they all look the same to me\". \nThe MailOnline has reported he confused then-vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi with Health Secretary Sajid Javid.\nFollowing the event, St John Ambulance said it did not \"tolerate racism\".\nMr Gray acknowledged that he mixed up the two men but denies saying \"they all look the same to me\".\nSpeaking to the BBC, the North Wiltshire MP said: \"I think I said 'I mixed you up', something like that\", adding that it was a \"very silly non-story\".\nHe said he hadn't been contacted by the charity about stepping back from his role and had even received an invitation on Tuesday to one of their events.\nHe also denies reports Mr Zahawi - who was born in Iraq - spoke to him about the incident at the event, adding that the men are close friends.\nThe BBC has been told the charity spoke to Mr Gray over a week ago about stepping back from his involvement with the charity and that the invitation to the MP from St John Ambulance was inadvertently sent out and would be retracted.\nAsked for a response, the Conservative Party said: \"These comments were misjudged. We do not tolerate racism or discrimination of any kind.\"\nMr Gray has been accused of making the remarks in September at a reception in Parliament held to celebrate the work of St John Ambulance's volunteers and staff during the coronavirus pandemic. \nAs a Commander in the Order of St John, the parent charity of St John Ambulance, Mr Gray was hosting the event. \nAccording to the reports, he was introducing Mr Zahawi to the stage but instead referred to him as Sajid Javid, who was also at the event.\nAfter his mistake, the MP is said to have told the audience: \"They all look the same to me.\"\nFollowing the event, the charity said it had asked Mr Gray to step back from activities with the organisation. \nA spokesman said: \"St John does not tolerate racism in any way, shape or form. \n\"We spoke with James Gray following the event about our values as an open, inclusive and progressive charity.\"\nLast month, Mr Gray apologised for joking that \"a bomb\" should be delivered to the office of Labour Party chair Anneliese Dodds.\nSpeaking to the Mail on Sunday, he said: \"It was a foolish remark,\" he told the Mail on Sunday, adding: \"I meant no offence and hope none was taken.\"\nEarlier this year Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner also confused Mr Javid - who has Pakistani heritage - with another politician - referring to him as \"Sadiq Javid\" apparently partly confusing him with Labour London Mayor Sadiq Khan."

      "text": "There is no room for big spending announcements for hard-pressed public services in this month's Budget, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.\nThe influential think tank has published new analysis, suggesting borrowing will be lower than forecast.\nBut the IFS says if the chancellor hopes to balance the government's finances, he will still have to keep a tight rein on spending.\nThat's despite his planning the biggest tax rises for more than 25 years.\nMr Sunak is due to deliver the next Budget on 27 October.\n\"Rishi Sunak, a Conservative chancellor, is presiding over an increase in the tax burden to record levels in the UK and an increase in the size of the state (public spending as a fraction of national income) to levels not seen since the days of [Margaret] Thatcher,\" said IFS director Paul Johnson.\n\"Yet the combined effects of ever-growing spending on the NHS, and an economy smaller than projected pre-pandemic, mean that he is still likely to be short of money to spend on many other public services,\" he said.\nMr Johnson said that meant \"little or no scope\" to increase spending on things such as local government, the justice system and further education, which have seen sharp cuts over the last decade.\nSpending on services other than health, such as defence, schools and aid, might also have to increase by less than Mr Sunak was planning pre-pandemic, the IFS said.\nMr Johnson said the chancellor would be \"hoping against hope\" that the economy performed better than expected over the next few years, pushing up tax revenues that would \"help to dig him out of what still looks like a fair-sized hole\".\nThe IFS produces analysis of the country's finances in its Green Budget every year. Like a government green paper, the aim is to inform and provoke discussion around budgetary decisions. \nThe report highlights the UK's strong economic recovery this year, in the wake of the vaccine roll-out, meaning that borrowing this year could be more than \u00a350bn lower than was forecast in March. But it says less rapid growth after this year's bounce back would mean the public finances improve more slowly in the years to come.\nAnyone making forecasts like these a year ago would have been laughed at and called a crazy optimist. \nThe amount the government is expected to borrow this financial year is \u00a350bn less than was predicted even just back in March. \nThat suggests those arguing against cutting public spending too soon, for the sake of reducing that borrowing, were right.\nIn a pandemic, they argued, to prioritise sorting out the public finances before securing the economic recovery was putting the cart before the horse.\nIn the meantime, the vaccine-led recovery has brought tax money rolling into the Treasury much faster than was expected.\nWith 7% economic growth predicted this year and borrowing dropping rapidly, we can now see how quickly, when the economic horse is accelerating, the public finance cart comes trundling behind.\nChristian Schulz, director of European Economics at investment bank Citi, which collaborated on the Green Budget, said the global economic outlook had improved.\nHowever, the UK economy was still likely to be 4% short of its pre-pandemic trajectory at the end of 2021, he said.\n\"The medium-term recovery also remains far from secure,\" said Mr Schulz. \"Instead, an uneven rebound to date points to a more profound Brexit- and Covid-related reconfiguration in the years ahead.\nThe Green Budget analysis also found:\nThe IFS suggested that in order to cope with long-term pressures on spending, the chancellor might find he needs to raise taxes further, on top of the 1.25% health and social care levy announced last month.\nFor the levy to meet future spending demand in those areas, the IFS estimates it could need to more than double to 3.15% by the end of this decade."

      "text": "The head of the academy that awards the Nobel Prizes in science has said it will not introduce gender quotas.\nGoran Hansson, head of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said they want people to win \"because they made the most important discovery\".\nSince its inception in 1901, 59 Nobel Prizes have gone to women.\nMaria Ressa was the only woman honoured this year. Marie Curie was the first woman to get the prize - and remains the only woman to get it twice.\n\"It's sad that there are so few women Nobel laureates and it reflects the unfair conditions in society, particularly in years past, but still existing. And there's so much more to do,\" Mr Hansson told the AFP news agency.\n\"We have decided we will not have quotas for gender or ethnicity,\" he said, adding that the decision was \"in line with the spirit of Alfred Nobel's last will\".\nSwedish industrialist and chemist Alfred Nobel founded the prizes in his will, written in 1895 - a year before his death.\n\"In the end, we will give the prize to those who are found the most worthy, those who have made the most important contributions,\" he said.\nAnd while more women are being recognised now compared to previous decades, Mr Hansson said, that number was increasing \"from a very low level\".\n\"Keep in mind that only about 10% of the professors in natural sciences in western Europe or North America are women, and even lower if you go to East Asia,\" he said.\nHowever, the scientist said they would \"make sure that we have an increasing portion of women scientists being invited to nominate, and we will continue to make sure we have women on our committees - but we need help, and society needs to help here\".\n\"We need different attitudes to women going into sciences... so that they get a chance to make these discoveries that are being awarded,\" he added.\nLast year, scientists Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna became the first two women to share the honour when they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing the tools to edit DNA.\nIt was the first time any of the science prizes had been awarded to two women without a male collaborator also listed on the award.\nAt the time, Prof Charpentier said: \"I wish that this will provide a positive message specifically for young girls who would like to follow the path of science... and to show them that women in science can also have an impact with the research they are performing.\"\nShe added that there was \"a clear lack of interest in following a scientific path, which is very worrying\".\nOther notable women to have won the award include child education activist Malala Yousafzai, who was jointly awarded the Peace prize in 2014; virologist Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi, who discovered HIV and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2008; and Toni Morrison, whose work explored the harsh realities of racism in the US, won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993.\nMarie Curie was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize, winning the Physics award in 1903. She was also the first person, and remains the only woman, to have won multiple Nobel Prizes, after winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911."

      "tags": "Coronavirus public inquiry,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Welsh government,NHS Wales,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan has apologised for the mistakes made by the Welsh government in its initial handling of the pandemic.\nShe was responding to a report by MPs which said the UK's early response to the pandemic is one of the worst ever public health failures. \n\"I'm prepared to apologise to all of those who have suffered,\" she said.\nThe report said the slow move to lockdown led to a higher initial death toll than if ministers acted sooner.\nIt said the slow move into restrictions - backed by UK government scientists and adopted by the UK's central and devolved governments - was \"wrong\" and \"deliberate\".\nThe study, written by two House of Commons committees, claimed scientific advisers and government suffered \"a degree of group think\".\nWales and the rest of the UK went into lockdown on 23 March - while the policy was controlled by ministers in Cardiff, early on they acted alongside the Westminster government.\nThere were 2,289 deaths in Wales due to Covid, and 2,512 deaths involving Covid, in the first wave of the pandemic up to the end of July 2020. \nOpposition parties reiterated calls for a Wales-only public inquiry, with Plaid Cymru saying the Welsh government \"must take responsibility for its actions\".\nIn the Senedd, First Minister Mark Drakeford declined to say whether he agreed the early response was one of the worst ever public health failures in the UK, and said he had not read the report.\n\"I've been asked the question many times, 'Were there things that you would have done differently had you known then what you know now?' \" he said.\n\"We didn't know those things then, we were following the advice that we had at the time.\"\nHe said as \"our knowledge grew\" ministers have \"not hesitated to take our own decisions where we thought that was in the best interests of Wales\".\nThere have been a total of 8,262 deaths where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate up to 24 September this year.\nSpeaking at a press briefing, Ms Morgan said: \"Of course I'm prepared to apologise to all of those who have suffered during the pandemic. \n\"This was a new disease that we'd never seen before. None of us knew how it was going to impact, none of us knew how it was going to spread, none of us had any idea that it could be spread even without showing any symptoms.\"\nShe added: \"Of course we made mistakes at the beginning of that process, because of the lack of information and data and knowledge that we have now learned.\n\"I think we have a duty and responsibility to say sorry to people where we've made mistakes.\"\nBut the minister argued it would have been \"extremely difficult\" to have locked down Wales before England, because of the border and \"because furlough was not available\".\nShe said since then, the Welsh government has taken a \"far more cautious approach compared to that of the rest of the United Kingdom\".\nBut Ms Morgan denied that the Welsh government had suffered from group think - when a group of individuals reaches a consensus without critical reasoning.\nA decision to scrap community testing for coronavirus early in the pandemic was described by the report as a \"serious mistake\".\nWales, in common with the rest of the UK, took the same approach. Ms Morgan partly blamed this on a limitation on the number of tests available at the time.\nFigures showed that there were 157% more care home deaths from all causes than there would be normally in April 2020, with 1,171 in total.\nThe daughter of a man who died from Covid last year said it was \"good to have an apology\" but said it was \"slightly qualified\".\nCatherine Griffiths, whose father Harry Griffiths died with Covid in his Aberystwyth care home, told BBC Wales: \"They didn't know what was happening in the first wave but they knew what was happening in the second wave, my father died in the second wave.\n\"They should have protected people they should have acted and learned from countries in the Far East. While we were going into the second wave they were asking people to do quick tests before they enter care facilities, and we weren't doing that.\"\nMs Griffiths is part of the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru group, which is calling for a dedicated public inquiry for Wales into decisions made about the pandemic. \nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the report showed the \"fatalistic approach at the heart of this Westminster government\" but also called for a Welsh public inquiry.\nPlaid health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"The Welsh government must take responsibility for its actions - good and bad, and there should be no avoidance of detailed scrutiny.\"\nWelsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said: \"The pandemic was an unprecedented crisis and as these reports show decision-makers in government followed the science and evidence provided by experts.\"\nHe added the report shows \"why we need a Wales-specific Covid inquiry\".\nHowever Mark Drakeford argued in the Senedd that the report strengthens the argument for the Welsh \"experience to be properly investigated within the wider UK context\".\nThe first minister has backed a UK government inquiry, but has not ruled out a Wales-only effort if he is not satisfied with what is set up by the UK government.\nMr Drakeford told the Senedd he was yet to receive a reply to a letter to Communities Secretary Michael Gove on the 10 September setting out a \"series of tests\" the Welsh government would apply \"to give us confidence\".\nThe first minister said he was hoping to have a meeting with the prime minister in the coming days, and added he expects devolved governments to be \"properly involved\" in the appointment of the UK government's inquiry chair.\nDuring the press conference it was announced that the Welsh government had set a target of offering all 12 to 15-year-olds a Covid vaccine by the end of October.\nThe government also said all residents of care homes will have been offered a booster by the same date. \nDr Gill Richardson, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Vaccines, said she expected the majority of people over 50 or who have an underlying health condition to have been offered their booster by the end of the year. \nA Welsh government statement said the committees' report \"does not scrutinise decisions made by any of the devolved governments in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland\".\n\"Some actions and decisions in the pandemic response were taken at a UK level on a four-nations basis - we have always been open to working together where there are shared decisions and shared responses. \n\"We have followed the advice of our medical and scientific advisers and have taken a more cautious approach. Independent reports, by Audit Wales, have shown our approach to testing, for example, was less costly and more efficient than that taken by the UK government.\""

Pharmacies, banks and post offices were also permitted to stay open.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford urged people in Wales to go out just once a day to shop for basic food and to exercise close to home.\nAll social events, as well as gatherings of more than two people in public, were banned.\nThe lockdown came exactly one week after the confirmation of the death of the first person in Wales with Covid-19.\nThe 68-year-old, who had underlying health conditions, died in Wrexham Maelor Hospital.\nThis came just over two weeks after the first confirmed case. On 28 February, chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said the adult - linked to Swansea's Bishop Gore School - contracted the virus in northern Italy.\nThere have been 2,408 deaths involving coronavirus in Wales, up to 19 June.\nLess than 24 hours into lockdown, Welsh ministers were given a host of new powers in a bid to tackle coronavirus.\nPoliticians in the Senedd passed a motion giving their consent to the law without a vote, which meant authorities could take people into, or keep them in, quarantine, curb or ban mass gatherings and close premises.\nAt 20:00 on the first Thursday of lockdown, a tradition began that would involve millions of people up and down the country - Clap for Carers.\nThought up by Annemarie Plas, who was inspired events in her home country of the Netherlands, it saw people take to their doorsteps, windows and balconies to clap their hands and bang their pots and pans to give a boost to the people working on the front line.\nThe final weekly clap was held on 28 May after Annemarie herself said it would be \"beautiful\" to end it after 10 weeks.\nAs it turned out, this was not the end - people have been asked to take part in an annual Clap for Carers, starting on 5 July - the 72nd anniversary of the creation of the UK's National Health Service.\nIn the early days of the pandemic, one corner of Wales earned the unwanted title of the country's hotspot.\nAneurin Bevan health board, which covers the old county of Gwent in south east Wales, recorded 358 cases by 26 March and there were fears the area could be \"following Italy\".\nIt had more than double the number of cases of any other health board, although that trend did not continue and the latest stats show two other health board now have more cases.\nIn April, the first minister admitted coronavirus testing had not \"been good enough\" after a drive-in testing centre for key workers was shut on Easter Monday - a move that one politician said \"beggars belief\".\nJust one day after admitting this, the Welsh Government faced more pressure after it scrapped its target of 5,000 tests a day by mid-April with Mr Drakeford himself calling parts of the plan unachievable.\nNo new targets were set after this date - at which point the Welsh government only had the capacity to do 1,300 tests a day at most.\nPlaid Cymru called the move a \"scandal\", while the Tories accused ministers of \"piecemeal disorganisation\".\nMinisters - much like the rest of us - have got very familiar with the Zoom video-conferencing app during lockdown, but for the man at the forefront of Wales' fight against coronavirus, one virtual meeting made headlines for all the wrong reasons.\nHealth Minister Vaughan Gething had to apologise to his Labour colleague Jenny Rathbone after he was caught swearing about her after forgetting to turn his microphone off.\n\"What the [expletive] is the matter with her?\" he said, much to the amusement of several of his colleagues.\nWales largest health board, Betsi Cadwaladr, was criticised after it failed to report its daily cases.\nOn one Thursday, it announced 84 deaths in one go, making it seem as though Wales had seen the biggest daily jump in confirmed deaths, but it actually included Betsi's figures for a whole month.\nThis was followed four days later by a second health board - Hywel Dda in west Wales - admitting it had under-reported its deaths by 31.\nMay brought some good news as Mr Drakeford said the peak of the virus had passed, heralding the news the first relaxation of lockdown rules could begin, almost two months after they were imposed.\nSubsequently, people were allowed to exercise outside more than once a day and some garden centres began to reopen.\nFor the first six weeks of lockdown, Wales, England and Scotland all took the same approach with the message \"stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives\".\nThis changed on 10 May when England shifted to a message of \"stay alert\" as the UK government allowed people to travel further and spend more time outdoors.\nHowever, Mr Drakeford urged people in Wales to still stay home \"wherever you can\".\nOnly from 1 June were people in Wales allowed to meet with friends or family from another household, but they were still urged to stay within five miles of their home.\nJune saw some glimmers of normality return, including professional sports being allowed to resume, the announcement schools would reopen at the end of the month and how a post-coronavirus Cardiff city centre would look.\nWith England and Wales now having different rules and restrictions in place, one Welsh minister attacked his Westminster counterparts, saying the UK government had \"given-up\" on a science-led approach to coronavirus.\nThis came after England's easing of lockdown before Wales led to confusion, with police in one area of Wales having to turn away 1,000 cars in just two days. Officers said many of the people they spoke to claimed not to know they were breaking the law.\nThe end of June saw outbreaks of coronavirus at three different meat and food factories.\n2 Sisters on Anglesey has had 210 confirmed cases, with Rowan Foods in Wrexham reporting 166. \nKepak in Merthyr Tydfil has told household contacts of the 130 of its workers who have tested positive to self-isolate.\nOn Monday, Mr Drakeford announced that families from two different households would be allowed to spend time in each other's homes as of 6 July.\nPeople must choose and stick with one other home, which cannot be changed once arranged.\nIt follows similar \"support bubble\" schemes elsewhere in the UK. \nSo cooking, exercising and even hugging are now back the agenda for families as Wales, like the rest of the world, takes slow but steady steps towards a normal life once again.\nThe most obvious political theme of the past 100 days has been the divergence in the four nations' approach to this crisis.\nThe difference in approach between governments in Wales and England caused confusion at times, but it also did more than any other event in the past 20 years to increase people's understanding of devolution.\nIt has also raised the profile of the first minister and Welsh Labour leader, Mark Drakeford, who had previously been struggling for visibility among Welsh voters.\nThis matters because there's a Senedd election looming next May and an election is always the acid test in politics.\nIrrespective of how well or badly they think Mr Drakeford's government has handled the crisis, can we expect to see a higher turnout?\nIn the 20 years of devolution in Wales, fewer than half of eligible voters have taken part in Senedd elections. This time around, voters know how much power Welsh ministers have over their daily lives, so will more of them want a say in deciding who to give that power to?"

      "tags": "Companies,Energy industry,Kwasi Kwarteng",
      "text": "Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has not committed to any additional government help for businesses struggling amid record gas prices.\nSome industries have warned firms could be forced to shut down operations.\nMr Kwarteng said he was working closely with the chancellor over possible support for energy intensive sectors - but a Treasury source denied this.\nThe business secretary said domestic customers would not see a change to the energy price cap this winter.\nAsked on BBC One's Andrew Marr programme whether there would be additional government help for energy-intensive companies, Mr Kwarteng described the situation as \"critical\" and said he was \"looking to find a solution\".\nWhen Andrew Marr suggested this sounded like a \"yes\" the business secretary said: \"No, it doesn't sound like yes at all. \n\"We already have existing support and we're looking to see whether that's sufficient to get us through this situation.\"\nSpeaking to Times Radio Mr Kwarteng, who met leaders from heavy industry on Friday, said he was not going to commit to \"any firm figure or subsidy\" for companies.\nAsked about whether the government would ensure factories would not have to close if they could not pay for gas he said it was a commercial decision and \"up to them\".\nHe added: \"We are not in the business of bail-outs. What we are in the business of is ensuring security of supply and that is what I am focused on.\"\nWholesale gas prices have risen 250% since January.\nCEO of British Glass Dave Dalton, who was at Friday's meeting with Mr Kwarteng, said some of the confederation's \"significant\" members were \"teetering on the edge\". \n\"I think some companies are staring down the ability to survive, absolutely - ultimately that obviously cascades on to jobs and impacts on the consumer,\" he told the BBC. \nGareth Stace, director general of UK Steel, said he was frustrated by the lack of action to support businesses.\nHe told the BBC that without help in the next week or so, there would be \"significant and permanent damage to the UK steel sector\".\nUnite leader Sharon Graham said the country was \"contemplating factory shutdowns across viable manufacturing and businesses\" and that workers were \"worried sick\".\nBusinesses have been shouting louder and louder for support through this period of soaring energy prices.\nThis morning, the business secretary told the BBC he was listening to their concerns - but would not commit to any extra support.\nThose industries that use a lot of energy for manufacturing say that the time for working out a way forward has long gone. \nThe director general of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, expressed his frustration, saying pauses in steel production will only increase. \nThe government says the current situation emphasises the need for a revolution in how we generate energy, moving towards home-grown renewables.\nBut that's little comfort for those businesses dependent on energy from fossil fuels now, competing with intense demand in a global market.\nOn the Andrew Marr show, Mr Kwarteng denied asking for \"billions\" from the Treasury to subsidise energy-intensive businesses and said supply itself was \"not an issue\".\nA Treasury source said the business secretary had been \"mistaken\" to say that he had been working on possible support measures with the Chancellor Rishi Sunak.\nBridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government \"needs to get a grip\" and called for \"urgent answers on who exactly is running the show\". \n\"The two key government departments responsible for the current cost of living crisis have spent this morning infighting about whether they were in talks with each other. What a farce,\" she said.\nShe also accused the government of having \"put its out of office on\", referring to reports that the prime minister is on holiday in Spain.\n A number of Conservative MPs have called for the government to take action to support heavy industry.\nThe SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford called on the UK government to \"nurse\" businesses through the crisis, describing it as a \"perfect storm\".\nThe domestic consumer energy price cap, which is reviewed every six months, sets the maximum level a supplier can charge a consumer on a standard tariff in England, Wales and Scotland. \nMr Kwarteng told Marr that protecting consumers was his \"first and foremost objective\" and as such the price cap would stay at its current level until its next update which is due to in April.\nSome suppliers say the cap is just delaying an inevitable increase in consumer prices and should be reviewed more regularly.\nEnergy regulator Ofgem has warned households will see further \"significant rises\" in the spring, when the cap is reviewed.\nAsked by Marr if he was sure the lights would stay on this winter, Mr Kwarteng said \"yes, I am\".\nDue to high gas prices household energy suppliers have been forced to sell gas for less than they can buy it due to the price cap, leading some to fail.\nLast month, nine domestic energy supply companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers and on to higher rates.\nPaul Richards, chief executive of Together Energy, which he said is currently making losses, said while he supported a price cap to protect customers, the current mechanism \"is not fit for industry, nor is it fit for customers\".\nHe said it protected customers in the short term but somewhere between \u00a31bn and \u00a33bn in costs would be spread back across business and households as a result of suppliers going bust.\nThe founder of OVO Energy Stephen Fitzpatrick told Marr that it has been \"too easy\" for companies to enter the energy market and that there will be more companies in difficulty.\nHe said the market was a complicated one, and he thought some people had not understood the risks."

It's estimated to have around 10,000 fighters at large in the Middle East. \nFurther afield it remains a dangerous security threat in countries as far apart as Afghanistan and Mozambique.\nIraq's Security Media Cell said the detainee was close to the new leader of IS, Amir Mohammed Said Abdul Rahman al-Mawla, who replaced Baghdadi after he killed himself during a US special forces raid on his hideout in Syria in 2019. \nAlthough Mr Kadhimi did not reveal where Mr Jasim had been captured, a senior Iraqi military source told AFP news agency it had happened in Turkey. There was no immediate response from Turkish authorities to the report.\nEarlier this year, the Iraqi government announced it had killed another alleged deputy IS leader, Jabir Salman Saleh al-Isawi, as well as the leader of IS in southern Iraq, Jabbar Ali Fayadh.\nIS once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from eastern Iraq to western Syria and imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people.\nDespite the group's defeat on the battlefield in Iraq in 2017 and in Syria two years later, it is estimated that thousands of militants remain active in both countries."

      "text": "The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance says his job is \"not to sugarcoat\" reality when speaking to the PM about Covid.\nHe said he had to give Boris Johnson and MPs the evidence - not worrying whether they would like it. \nIn a BBC Radio 4 interview, he also said \"you've got to go sooner than you want\" when it comes to taking action.\nHe was speaking before a report said the UK's early Covid response was one of the worst public health failures.\nThe MPs' report said the government's approach was to try to manage the situation and in effect achieve herd immunity by infection - but this led to a delay in introducing the first lockdown, costing thousands of lives.   \nSir Patrick told The Life Scientific: \"My mantra for a long time during this (pandemic) has been... you've got to go sooner than you want to in terms of taking interventions. \n\"You've got to go harder than you want to, and you've got to go more geographically broad than you want to.\n\"And that is the Sage advice. And that's what I've been saying. And I will say it going forward, and the prime minister knows that's what I think. And he knows that's what I would do in that situation.\"\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, he had told the BBC in March 2020 that the aim was to \"reduce the peak\" of infections and that the population would build up a \"degree of herd immunity\". \nBut in the new interview, he stressed that as more evidence came in, the scientific judgements changed.\n\"For a politician, that feels like a U-turn, or for the media that often feels like a U-turn,\" he said. \"It's not a U-turn - this is new evidence that gives you a new position: this is the way we progress, the way we learn.\"\nSir Patrick told interviewer Prof Jim Al-Khalili his job was \"to give the scientific evidence as best you can, unvarnished - not worrying about whether the person hearing it is going to like it or dislike it\".  \nHe said: \"I view my job as giving scientific advice, like it or not, to the prime minister and cabinet to enable them to make decisions.\n\"My job is not to sugarcoat it. My job is not to tell them things they want to hear... it's to make sure that they understand what the science at that moment is saying, what the uncertainties are, and to try to make that as clear as possible.\"\nHe said he and fellow scientists were labelled as \"gloom-mongers\" by some parts of the media, and added: \"Maybe we were, but we were trying to just tell people as we saw it, and as the experts were helping us understand it, what the situation was, and therefore what the options might be.\" \nSir Patrick, who often spoke alongside the prime minister at Downing Street press conferences at the height of the pandemic, described it as \"an incredibly fraught period\". \nHe said there was \"massive uncertainty, lots of unknowns, and huge decisions that ministers and the prime minister had to make, and a lot of it very informed by science\". \n\"Did I spend my entire days feeling calm? No, I didn't. And, you know, there were times when, of course, it was incredibly busy as well,\" he said. \nSir Patrick also said there were times he doubted his abilities, saying: \"All of us felt times when there was enormous pressure, and you just felt, am I doing a good job? Am I the right person in the job at the moment? Am I able to get the evidence through clearly enough or not?\"\nHe said it was \"not enough as a science adviser to say, I went in there and told them\", but rather he wanted to make sure \"this has been properly understood\". \nBut he said the most difficult part of the job had been press intrusion into his personal life. \n\"Those are the times when you thought actually you know, is this really something I can do?\" he said. \n\"When you've got my family being affected by press, being intrusive into things that weren't actually germane to the job I was doing, that was probably the most difficult time actually.\" \nAs for the current coronavirus situation, Sir Patrick said he had personally reduced his contacts and wore a mask in crowded places. \nThere will be a \"balancing act\" over the next few months, and winter \"will be a big pressure for sure\", said Sir Patrick, adding: \"We're not out of the woods yet.\"  \nYou can hear the full interview on Radio 4 at 20:00 BST on Tuesday"

      "text": "A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit.\nIt aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough.\nThe agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade:\nEmissions\nIt was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a greenhouse gas which causes climate change.\nThis is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a \"climate catastrophe\". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. \nCoal\nFor the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.  \nHowever, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to \"phase down\" rather than \"phase out\" coal after a late intervention by China and India. \nDeveloping countries\nThe agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy.\nThere's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (\u00a372bn) a year by 2020 was missed.\nWhile some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the \"start of a breakthrough\", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. \nFossil fuel subsidies\nWorld leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas.\nHowever, no firm dates have been set.\nA flurry of other announcements were made:\nThe world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, pledged to cooperate more over the next decade in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy.\nChina has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. \nLeaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - promised to stop deforestation by 2030.\nThis is seen as vital, as tress absorb vast amounts of CO2. \nSimilar initiatives haven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed.\nA scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030 was agreed by more than 100 countries. \nMethane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. \nThe big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.\nFinancial organisations controlling $130tn agreed to back \"clean\" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries.\nThe initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets.\nHowever, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. \nMost commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed.\nOnly a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. \nCOP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 Paris Agreement. \nSix years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming \"well below\" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.\nCOP stands for \"Conference of the Parties\", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. \nThe goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach net zero by mid-century.\nNext year's COP27 summit is in Egypt.\nTop image from Getty Images.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nThe UK's failure to do more to stop Covid spreading early in the pandemic was one of the worst ever public health failures, a joint report by two committees of MPs says. A policy of trying to achieve herd immunity led to a delay in locking down that cost lives, say the MPs from all parties. However, they also praise several \"big achievements\", calling the vaccination process - from research to rollout - \"one of the most effective initiatives in UK history\". The government says it will learn lessons from the report.\nGovernment borrowing this year could be more than \u00a350bn lower than was forecast in March, thanks to the UK's strong economic recovery in the wake of the vaccine rollout, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. But \"ever-growing spending on the NHS, and an economy smaller than projected pre-pandemic\" will mean there is no room for big spending announcements on other public services, says the think tank's director Paul Johnson.\nIf you're seeking some winter sun, Thailand could soon be an option. The country plans to end quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated travellers from at least 10 nations - including the UK - from 1 November, officials say.\nIt could be a good time to be seeking work, according to the boss of a Cardiff-based employment agency. Whereas thousands of applicants were chasing a few jobs as the pandemic took hold, candidates are now in \"a position of control and power\", with the number of vacancies among his clients up 35% on pre-pandemic levels, says Yolk Recruitment's Pavan Arora (below). BBC Wales looks at the effect on businesses.\nIt's fair to say wine merchant Matt Ellis likes a drink.

      "title": "UK job vacancies reach 20-year high",
      "tags": "Unemployment,Employment,UK economy,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "The number of job vacancies in the UK has hit a record high, according to the latest official figures.\nVacancies hit 1.1 million between July and September, the Office for National Statistics said, the highest level since records began in 2001.\nThe largest increase in vacancies was in the retail sector and in motor vehicle repair, it said.\nThe UK unemployment rate was estimated at 4.5%, compared with a rate of 4% before the pandemic.\nThe ONS said the number of employees on payrolls showed another monthly increase, rising 207,000 to a record 29.2 million in September.\n\"The jobs market has continued to recover from the effects of the coronavirus, with the number of employees on payroll in September now well exceeding pre-pandemic levels,\" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS.\n\"Vacancies also reached a new one-month record in September, at nearly 1.2 million, with our latest estimates suggesting that all industries have at least as many jobs on offer now as before the onset of Covid-19.\"\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said it was \"encouraging\" to see the government's jobs strategy working.\n\"The number of expected redundancies remained very low in September, there are more employees on payrolls than ever before and the unemployment rate has fallen for eight months in a row.\"\nHowever, Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said labour market shortages \"could stunt\" the UK's economic recovery from the pandemic.\n\"The recovery is testing the capacity of the economy to adjust to a new post-pandemic environment, a task made more difficult by the reduced availability of overseas workers,\" she said.\n\"Acute skill shortages have pushed vacancies to record levels for a second month in a row in September, as employers struggled to find skilled staff.\"\nMark Jenkins, a supply chain director for London-based food wholesaler Brakes, says pressure on the industry is \"extreme\". Staff retention is a problem, he says.\n\"For every two people we hire, only one person stays, because there are other jobs in the market.\n\"Wages have gone up by 15% to 20% in some parts of the business in order to attract the right kind of people. And on top of that we're paying retention bonuses to hang on to the staff we do have.\n\"Everything is making it really difficult for us to service our customers\". \nMark says the cost of higher wages will have to be passed on.\n\"Our suppliers are passing on costs, we're passing some of those costs to our customers, and at the end of the day, the consumers will feel the pain.\"\nSectors that had large increases in vacancies included accommodation and food services, professional activities and manufacturing. Hospitality is the sector with the most vacancies per 100 workers.\nA shortage of lorry drivers, which the industry has blamed on factors including Covid, Brexit and tax changes, has affected fuel supplies in recent weeks and also disrupted food supply chains.\nThe Institute for Employment Studies (IES) said labour shortages were \"affecting the whole economy, and where likely between a quarter and a third is explained by lower migration\".\nTony Wilson, director of the IES, said there were now fewer unemployed people per vacancy than at any time in at least 40 years.\nIn particular this is down to fewer older people in work and more young people in education he said.\n\"These shortages are holding back our economic recovery, and won't fix themselves by just exhorting firms to pay people more.\"\nThe number of people who were economically inactive - those who were not looking for work - fell by 91,000 compared to the previous quarter, but rose by 50,000 compared with last year.\nIt's a good time to be looking for a job.\nThe number of vacancies hit another record high of 1.1 million and average weekly earnings, including bonuses, are 7.2% higher than this time last year.\nHowever, these numbers contain a number of Covid-related distortions.\nThe wage numbers are flattered by comparisons to last year when furlough schemes depressed wages and hours worked.\nIf you strip that out wage rises are closer to 4%.\nThat is higher than inflation currently, but the Bank of England expects inflation to rise to at least 4% by the end of the year.\nThat will offset wage rises for those lucky enough to get them.\nBut it will see lower living standards for the many who won't: 5.6 million public sector workers, for example.\nHigher wages have understandably been welcomed by the government, but there is less evidence of the higher skills that it is hoped will accompany them.\nAnd the high number of vacancies suggest that there is now a mismatch between the jobs people want and the ones that are available.\nLike other sectors, the construction industry is struggling to fill vacancies at the moment.\nKaty Jordan runs Storey homes, a small house-building company in Bedfordshire. She's having trouble recruiting for certain roles such as site managers, and is having to pay staff more to keep them.\n\"It's really tough. What we're finding is that it's difficult to employ people on a permanent basis because it's easy for our site staff to have their heads turned by more money elsewhere.\"\nKaty is having to raise wages to attract people to the company, and keep the people she already has, but she says that's not addressing a shortage of skills and experience in the industry.\n\"We're paying people what we need to pay them to attract them to come to work for us, because the labour market is so hot at the moment, but what we're not seeing is the productivity of those people adding value to our business on all levels and at all times, and that's what businesses need.\"\n\"It's great that people can earn more money. We want people to be attracted to the construction industry. But we're not attracting people with the right skills at the moment,\" she says.\nThe record level of vacancies and hiring rates in September \"bode well for the million workers coming off furlough in October\", the Resolution Foundation think tank said, and should \"help limit any increases in unemployment\".\nThe furlough scheme, which saw the government pay towards wages during the Covid pandemic, ended at the end of September with nearly one million workers expected to have been on it.\nHowever, a wave of potential job cuts has not happened, early data has suggested.\nThe ONS data showed annual growth in average pay, excluding bonuses, was 6% in the June-to-August period.\nHowever, the ONS stressed again this figure has been affected by the impact on lower paid jobs during the pandemic and also by comparisons with last year when more workers were on furlough.\nThe number of people unemployed in the June-to-August period fell by 126,000 to 1.5 million, the ONS said, while the number employed rose 235,000 to 32.4 million.\nThe rise in employment coupled with the strong wage growth \"increases the chances of the Bank of England raising interest rates in the coming months despite other evidence that the economic recovery is spluttering\" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.\nThe Bank could become the first major central bank to raise interest rates since the beginning of the pandemic as inflation shoots up.\nInflation is expected to rise above 4% by the end of the year, fuelled by rising energy costs.\nBut the Bank is watching to see how many people became unemployed after the end of the furlough programme before making a decision."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Vaccination,Pfizer,Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "Climate change is set to cause major changes across the world: sea levels will rise, food production could fall and species may be driven to extinction.\nThe UN has warned that the world needs to limit climate change to below 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. But scientists say that keeping to the 1.5C target will require \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes\" in all aspects of society.\nSo how warm has the world got and what can we do about it?\nThe world is now nearly one degree warmer than it was before widespread industrialisation, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\nThe global average temperature for the first 10 months of 2018 was 0.98C above the levels of 1850-1900, according to five independently maintained global data sets.\n(If you can't see this chart tap or click here) \nThe 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, with  2015-2018 making up the top four, the WMO says.\nIf this trend continues, temperatures may rise by 3-5C by 2100.\nOne degree may not sound like much, but, according to the IPCC, if countries fail to act, the world will face catastrophic change - sea levels will rise, ocean temperatures and acidity will increase and our ability to grow crops, such as rice, maize and wheat, would be in danger.\nAlmost 400 all-time high temperatures were set in the northern hemisphere during the summer of 2019. \nRecords were broken in 29 countries for the period between 1 May and 30 August. A third of the all-time high temperatures were in Germany, followed by France and the Netherlands.\nThese European records were set amid heatwaves across the continent that sent temperatures soaring in June and July.\nOver the period shown on the map below (May to August 2019), the yellow dots show where a heat record was broken on a given date, pink indicates places that were the hottest they had ever been in the month shown, and dark red represents a place that was the hottest since records began.\nMore than 30 all-time records were broken in the US, according to the Berkeley Earth data. In Japan, where 11 people died as a result of the summer heatwave, 10 all-time temperature highs were set.\nIf we add up all the promises to cut emissions made by countries that are party to the Paris climate agreement, the world would still warm by more than 3C by the end of this century.\nOver the past few years, climate scientists have shifted the definition of what they believe is the \"safe\" limit of climate change.\nFor decades, researchers argued the global temperature rise must be kept below 2C by the end of this century to avoid the worst impacts. \nCountries signing up to the Paris agreement pledged to keep temperatures \"well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C\".\nBut scientists now agree that we actually need to keep temperature rises to below 1.5C.\nThe countries emitting the most greenhouse gases by quite a long way are China and the US. Together they account for more than 40% of the global total, according to 2017 data from the European Commission's Joint Research Centre and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.\nUS environmental policy has shifted under the Trump administration, which has pursued a pro-fossil fuels agenda.\nPresident Donald Trump has begun the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris climate change agreement.\nMr Trump said the deal struck in 2015 would disadvantage US businesses and workers.\nAlmost all (95%) of cities facing extreme climate risks are in Africa or Asia, a report by risk analysts Verisk Maplecroft has found. \nAnd it's the faster-growing cities that are most at risk, including megacities like Lagos in Nigeria and Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nSome 84 of the world's 100 fastest-growing cities face \"extreme\" risks from rising temperatures and extreme weather brought on by climate change. \nThe extent of Arctic sea ice has dropped in recent years. It reached its lowest point on record in 2012.\nSea ice has been reducing for decades, with melting accelerating since the early 2000s, according to the UK Parliament's Environmental Audit Committee.\nThe Arctic Ocean may be ice-free in the summer as soon as the 2050s, unless emissions are reduced, the committee has said.\nThe extent of Arctic sea ice in 2019 was tied with 2007 and 2016 as the second lowest on record. The maximum extent, reached in March 2019, was tied with 2007 as the seventh lowest in the 40-year satellite record.\nWhile governments need to make big changes - individuals can play a role too. \nScientists say we all have to make major changes to our lifestyles, in order to avoid severely damaging climate change.\nThe IPCC says we need to: buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter; eat more locally sourced seasonal food - and throw less of it away; drive electric cars but walk or cycle short distances; take trains and buses instead of planes; use videoconferencing instead of business travel; use a washing line instead of a tumble dryer; insulate homes; demand low carbon in every consumer product.\nOne of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact on the planet is to modify your diet to include less meat - according to recent studies. \nScientists say we ought to eat less meat because of the carbon emissions the meat industry produces, as well as other negative environmental impacts. \nA recent study published in the journal Science highlighted a massive variation in the environmental impact of producing the same food.\nFor example, beef cattle raised on deforested land produces 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than those reared on natural pastures.\nCrucially, the analysis shows that meat with the lowest environmental impact still creates more greenhouse gas emissions than growing vegetables and cereal crops in the least environmentally-friendly way.\nBut as well as altering our diets, research suggests that farming practices need to change significantly to benefit the environment.\nBy Nassos Stylianou, Clara Guibourg, Daniel Dunford, Lucy Rodgers, David Brown and Paul Rincon\nCorrection 24 February 2020: A previous version of this story said that \"the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet is to modify your diet to include less meat\". This has been amended to now refer to \"one of the biggest,\" taking account of different individual lifestyles and circumstances. We have also replaced the in-line link with a research article on 'The global impacts of food production'."

      "tags": "Companies,Energy industry,Food industry,CO\u2082 shortage",
      "text": "A deal to avert another carbon dioxide crisis in the food and drink industry has been extended until early 2022.\nUS firm CF Industries, a key CO2 producer in the UK, has agreed to continue supplies of the gas. \nIt said that should give the government and firms time to find other sources of CO2, used in fizzy drinks and for keeping food fresh, as well as to stun pigs and chickens before slaughter.\nFirms will now have to pay more for their CO2, but it is unclear how much.\nLast month, the government stepped in to subsidise one of the firm's plants after its shutdown due to high gas prices threatened food supplies.\nCF Industries suspended production at two sites - Cheshire and Billingham - which make 60% of the UK's commercial carbon dioxide. \nIt reopened its Billingham plant in north-east England after the government agreed to meet the costs of running it for three weeks.\nBillingham produces up to 750 tonnes of CO2 per day as a by-product of producing ammonia for fertiliser. CF Industries' plant at Ince in Cheshire remains closed with no date given for a reopening.\nThe government said: \"CO2 suppliers have agreed to pay CF Fertilisers a price for the CO2 it produces that will enable it to continue operating while global gas prices remain high, drawing on support from industry and delivering value for money for the taxpayer.\"\nThe agreement meant industry could have confidence it would receive future CO2 supplies, without further taxpayer support, said the government.\nThe British Meat Processors Association said the agreement provided \"some reassurance that supplies will be maintained\". \n\"However, industry has been given no detail on what the price will be or how it will be calculated going forward,\" a spokesperson added. \n\"We understand that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng took the decision to temporarily exempt parts of the CO2 industry from competition law to facilitate this agreement. What we need now is some detail and transparency around how the new pricing structure will work.\"\nIan Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said the agreement was \"welcome news\".\nBut he added: \"The increased cost of buying CO2 is yet another burden on the food and drink industry, which is already facing enormous stresses. \n\"This will, of course, add more pressure on prices for shoppers and diners.\"\nBy Ben King, business reporter\nIt looks like there will be enough CO2 to keep Christmas beers bubbly - but after that, there are no guarantees.  \nThere's an ominous line in the CF Industries press release. They expect CO2 users to develop \"robust alternative sources\" between now and January. \nThat won't be easily done. Lots of industrial processes produce CO2, but few produce a stream so pure and reliable that you'd want to dissolve it in your lemonade. \nDistributor Nippon Gases has warned that supply is tight across Europe, so imports will be hard to come by. \nThe government says that the firms which need the CO2 from Billingham will be paying more for it - and whatever long-term solution does emerge, it's likely to be more expensive too.\nBut the UK only needs about 600,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. At about \u00a3200 a tonne before the current crisis, that's about \u00a3120m, relatively small beer for industries that count their turnover in the billions.\nCompared to the other pressures those industries face - staff shortages, and higher costs for energy and shipping - more expensive CO2 is an extra cost they don't need, but it won't be their biggest headache. \nWhen CF shut its facilities after making fertiliser became uneconomic because of the rising price of wholesale gas, it cut off a vital source of CO2 for other sectors.\nSupermarkets began reporting limited stocks of some food items, while the pig industry warned that if slaughterhouses could not process animals, then farmers would have to cull their stocks.\nThe US firm said it now expected the UK government and industrial gas customers to \"develop robust alternative sources of CO2 as part of a long-term solution for meeting demand in the country\".\nLast month, it emerged the British food industry would be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with CF Industries to restart production in the UK. \nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from \u00a3200 per tonne to \u00a31,000.\nHouseholds, too, are being hit by higher energy bills, with those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, seeing bills go up by \u00a3139 to \u00a31,277 a year on average.  \nSeveral energy suppliers, unable to pass on wholesale prices to consumers on fixed deal, have gone out of business. Their customers have been switched to other suppliers, but will be put on variable contracts that will be higher than previous deals. \nMeanwhile, the business department has sent the Treasury a formal request for support for energy-intensive industries hit by high gas prices, the BBC understands. \nIt came after talks between ministers and industry leaders earlier on Monday.\nA source said: \"Everyone in government understands the importance of this situation.\n\"We need to solve this quickly.\"\nDetails of the proposal from Mr Kwarteng have not been disclosed but are thought to focus on a temporary solution to high energy prices. \nOn Sunday, Mr Kwarteng told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme the situation was \"critical\" and said he was \"looking to find a solution\".\nMr Kwarteng said there were Treasury talks about support measures to ease the impact on firms. However, a Treasury source later said the business secretary had been \"mistaken\".\nSectors such as ceramics, paper and steel manufacturing have called for a price cap, though talks with government on Friday failed to reach a solution."

      "tags": "Nazi Germany,Neo-Nazism,Germany,Anti-Semitism",
      "text": "Germany's Protestant Church and other authorities have condemned the reuse of the vacant burial plot of a Jewish music professor for a neo-Nazi.\nThe remains of Prof Max Friedlaender were moved to another site in 1980, but a tombstone still commemorates him at the cemetery outside Berlin.\nA Holocaust denier was buried there on Friday after the grave's reuse was approved.\nThe local bishop called it \"a terrible mistake\". \nBishop Christian St\u00e4blein visited the site on Tuesday.\nThe burial plot is in one of Germany's largest Protestant cemeteries, in Stahnsdorf near Potsdam.\nProf Friedlaender, who died in 1934, was from a Jewish family but was a member of the Protestant Church. He was a bass singer and musicologist who specialised in the songs of Franz Schubert.\nGerman media report that Henry Hafenmayer, the man now buried in the plot in Stahnsdorf, was a Holocaust denier and blogger linked to several neo-Nazi groups. \nNeo-Nazi supporters laid wreaths on the grave, with nationalist messages and ribbons adorned with the Nazi-era iron cross symbol. They placed a portrait of Hafenmayer in front of Prof Friedlaender's shrouded tombstone.\nThe memorial was covered by the cemetery officials as is usual practice when a grave site is reused, the Church said.\nAmong the mourners was Horst Mahler, a neo-Nazi who has spent years in jail for racist incitement, German media report.\nIn an apologetic statement, Bishop St\u00e4blein said the burial was \"a terrible mistake and shocking occurrence, in view of our history\". The bishop, who leads the Church in that part of Germany, said \"we must immediately see whether and what we can undo\".\nPictures of the funeral were posted on Flickr by RechercheNetzwerk.Berlin, an organisation campaigning against anti-Semitism.\nThe organisation says Hafenmayer published anti-Semitic propaganda on his blog, called \"End of the Lie\", and glorified Nazism.\nThe Church said that Hafenmayer's representative had originally requested a more central burial plot, which had been refused by the cemetery authorities as there were many Jewish graves in that area. \nThe selection of Prof Friedlaender's former plot appears not to have been turned down because the cemetery records recorded him as Protestant.\nPolice and officers from the department of state protection were present at the funeral, the Church said, and the cemetery authorities were aware of the dead man's neo-Nazi links. \nThe president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany said that he was shocked at what had happened.\nJosef Schuster said it was unbearable that right-wing extremists should \"haunt\" the grave of Prof Friedlaender, and in doing so they had desecrated his memory.\nThe Protestant Church itself had approved Hafenmayer's being given a plot (though not this specific one) despite his neo-Nazi connections, on the principle that everyone had the right to a final resting place, it said, but there were no Protestant ministers at the ceremony.\nJewish graves and Holocaust memorials have been vandalised previously by neo-Nazis in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.\nThe Berlin official in charge of combating anti-Semitism, Samuel Salzborn, has launched a legal action against the mourners for allegedly disturbing the peace of the dead and for racial incitement."

      "text": "The UK's failure to do more to stop Covid spreading early in the pandemic was one of the country's worst public health failures, a report by MPs says.\nThe government approach - backed by its scientists - was to try to manage the situation and in effect achieve herd immunity by infection, it said.\nThis led to a delay in introducing the first lockdown, costing thousands of lives, the MPs found.\nBut their report highlighted successes too, including the vaccination rollout.\nIt described the approach to vaccination - from the research and development through to the rollout of the jabs - as \"one of the most effective initiatives in UK history\".\nBut campaigners criticised the report for failing to focus on those who had died, saying references to practical issues, including problems with laptops, was \"laughable\".\nThe 150-page document, Coronavirus: Lessons learned to date, is from the Health and Social Care Committee and the Science and Technology Committee, and MPs from all parties.\nIt predominantly focused on the response to the pandemic in England. The committees did not look at steps taken individually by Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nThe MPs called the pandemic, which has claimed more than 150,000 lives in the UK and nearly five million worldwide so far, the \"biggest peacetime challenge\" for a century.\nSome early failings, the report suggested, resulted from apparent \"group-think\" among scientists and ministers.\nIt meant the UK was not as open to different approaches on earlier lockdowns, border controls and test and trace as it should have been.\nA woman whose twin sisters died within three days of one another after testing positive for Covid says the report from MPs uses the success of the vaccine programme to deflect from earlier failures.\nZoe Davis' sisters Katy and Emma, who were both nurses, died in April 2020.\nShe says: \"Nobody is saying that the vaccine programme hasn't been phenomenal but the frustrating thing is that's a deflection of what is actually being brought to attention and the overall message is that Covid failures have cost lives.\"\nLindsay Jackson, from Derbyshire, whose mother died with Covid, said the report confirmed her fears she had about care home visits in March 2020.\n\"I knew in my own mind the lockdown was too slow, I knew the social care sector wasn't being looked after, I knew people shouldn't have been released from hospital without tests, and this just confirms that.\"\nShe is calling for the government to move to a public inquiry now to see if anyone is culpable.\nConservative MPs Jeremy Hunt and Greg Clark, who chair the committees, said the nature of the pandemic meant it was \"impossible to get everything right\". \n\"The UK has combined some big achievements with some big mistakes. It is vital to learn from both,\" they said.\nCabinet Office minister Stephen Barclay said scientific advice had been followed and the government had made \"difficult judgements\" to protect the NHS.\nHe said the government took responsibility for everything that happened - saying the government would not shy away from any lessons to be learned at the full statutory public inquiry, expected next year.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the report was a \"damning indictment\" and showed the errors and failures of running down the NHS before the pandemic.\nHe called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to apologise to the bereaved and hold the public inquiry as soon as possible. \nWhen Covid hit, the government's approach was to manage its spread through the population rather than try to stop it - or herd immunity by infection as the report called it.\nThe MPs said this was based on dealing with a flu pandemic, and was done on the advice of its scientific advisers on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). \nBut the idea was not challenged enough by ministers in any part of the UK. Although other parts of Europe were guilty of this too, the MPs added.\nToo little was done in the early weeks to stop Covid spreading, the MPs said, despite evidence from China and then Italy that it was a virus that was highly infectious, caused severe illness and had no cure.\n\"The veil of ignorance through which the UK viewed the initial weeks of the pandemic was partly self-inflicted,\" the report said.\nAsked whether herd immunity had been a policy in the early days, Mr Hunt said he did not think there was any desire for the whole population to be infected.\nHowever, he said there was a \"fatalism that it was likely that in the end, that will be the only way that we will stop the progress of the virus\".\nDecisions on lockdowns and social distancing during those early weeks - and the advice that led to them - were described as \"one of the most important public health failures the UK has ever experienced\".\nThe advice from scientists changed on 16 March 2020 - with a lockdown announced a week later.\n\"This slow and gradualist approach was not inadvertent, nor did it reflect bureaucratic delay or disagreement between ministers and their advisers,\" the report said, describing it as a \"deliberate policy\".\n\"It is now clear that this was the wrong policy, and that it led to a higher initial death toll than would have resulted from a more emphatic early policy. In a pandemic spreading rapidly and exponentially, every week counted.\"\nA Liverpool FC and Atletico Madrid football match on 11 March - as a pandemic was declared by the WHO - and the Cheltenham Festival of Racing between 10 and 13 March, may have spread the virus.\nMr Barclay said hindsight was \"an issue\". Had the government known how much the country would be willing to endure, lockdown may have come sooner, the minister added.\nThe MPs also highlighted how ministers in England rejected scientific advice to have a two-week \"circuit-breaker\" in the autumn.\nThey said it was impossible to know whether that would have prevented the second lockdown in November, although they pointed out it had not in Wales.\nThe UK was one of the first countries in the world to develop a test for Covid in January 2020, but failed to translate that into an effective test-and-trace system during the first year of the pandemic, the report said.\nTesting in the community stopped in March 2020 and for weeks during the first peak only those admitted to hospital were tested.\nIt was not until May that the NHS Test and Trace system was launched in England, but the report described its start as \"slow, uncertain and often chaotic\".\nIt said the system was too centralised, only later making use of the expertise in local public health teams run by councils.\nBut it praised the target set by then Health Secretary Matt Hancock to get to 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, saying it played an important part in galvanising the system.\nThe greatest praise though was reserved for the vaccination programme and the way the government supported the development of a number of vaccines, including the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\nIt said the whole programme was one of the most effective initiatives in history, and will ultimately help to save millions of lives here and across the world.\nA key step, taken early on following a suggestion from chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, was to set up a task force that combined the talents of scientists, the NHS and the private sector, led by the \"bold leadership\" of venture capitalist Kate Bingham.\nThe development of treatments, such as dexamethasone, for Covid through the UK Recovery Trial was another area where the UK's response was genuinely world-leading, the report said. \nAnd the NHS and government were also credited with the way hospital intensive care capacity was increased to ensure the majority who needed hospital treatment received it.\nThe report's recommendations include comprehensive government plans for future emergencies, a bigger role for the armed forces in emergency response plans, and considering a government and NHS volunteer reserve database.\nThe MPs said the pandemic had also exacerbated existing social, economic and health inequalities which would need addressing.\nThe report highlighted \"unacceptably high\" death rates in ethnic minority groups and among people with learning disabilities and autism.\nFor ethnic minorities, there were a variety of factors, including possible biological reasons and increased exposure because of housing and working conditions. \nFor people with learning disabilities, not enough thought was given to how restrictions would have a detrimental impact on them - particularly in terms of accessing health care more generally. Do not resuscitate orders were also used inappropriately.\nThere was a lack of priority attached to care homes too at the start of the pandemic.\nThe rapid discharge of people from hospital into care homes without adequate testing or isolation was a prime example of this.\nThis, combined with untested staff bringing infection into homes from the community, led to many thousands of deaths which could have been avoided.\nScience minister George Freeman said it was too early for any proper discussion about blame or fault.\nAsked about the higher UK death toll, he said: \"A lot of that is actually to do with the very, very heavy obesity-related cardiometabolic chronic disease cohort that we've been carrying for years - that's a failure of public health in this country over decades.\"\nLobby Akinnola, of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, said Mr Freeman's comments were \"grossly offensive\", adding that \"the statutory inquiry cannot come soon enough\".\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

There was no option but to think outside of the box.\"\nHe said he came up with the plan while looking at the list of addresses on the orders he has already received. \nHe is offering customers a \u00a310 discount if they will deliver a tree to someone else living nearby.\nMr Corrie said: \"I've put this idea to friends and some laughed but others said they think people will help, especially when they know how desperate I am.\n\"Customers know of the global staff shortage so I'm sure most will be willing to help.\n\"Quite often people have room on their roof racks for more than one tree.\"\nHis business sells about 1,500 trees each year, supplied by Charlie Spurway at the Harburn Estate in West Lothian."

The legion speaks into our silence. The legion stitches back together our shattered experience and makes us whole.\"\nThe dean went on: \"War poets have observed again and again that we cheer and clap when armies march out. Later, when the wounded are being ferried back, the cheering tends to stop. We want to move on. We always want to move on.\n\"I do wonder if we will really learn the lessons from this pandemic, or whether we will give in to all the voices that want to turn the page. But the legion always remembers and tells truths we must not forget.\"\nDuring the service, retired Lt Gen James Bashall, the Royal British Legion's national president, took part in a rededication reaffirming the charity's commitment to its work, and Princess Anne gave a Bible reading. \nOther readings were given by Gen Sir Nick Carter, Chief of the Defence Staff, and Victoria Cross hero Colour Sgt Johnson Beharry.\nThe Queen had been pictured using a stick in 2003 after surgery on her right knee, but the Westminster Abbey service is thought to be the first time she has used one at a major public event. \nThe use of the aid, and arriving by the Poet's Yard entrance which was a shorter walk to her seat than the traditional Great West Door, are both understood to have been arranged for the Queen's comfort. Buckingham Palace did not comment. "

      "tags": "Swansea Bay University Health Board,Coronavirus vaccines,Swansea,Vaccination,Port Talbot",
      "text": "\"Because I'm younger I'll be able to fight it off, but I feel for the elderly.\"\nMackenzie Itzstein got the Covid vaccine to protect his grandparents - at 22, he believed he was low risk.\nBut even teenagers are being hospitalised with \"serious Covid\", Swansea Bay's public health director has said.\nKeith Reid called on more sports clubs and celebrities to back a campaign to encourage people to get the vaccine.\nMackenzie was living with his grandparents when they all contracted Covid. \nSpeaking to BBC Wales alongside other young people at the Bulldogs Boxing and Community Centre in Port Talbot, he said: \"I was in the family home with my Nana and Grampa and they had it too. \n\"I was more concerned for them rather than me,\" he said, believing younger people were relatively safe from the virus. \nThis is a common myth public health boss Mr Reid is keen to dispel. He said his own health board has recently seen cases of young people being admitted to hospital.\n\"Young people do get serious Covid,\" he said. \n\"We've seen 45 young people in hospital in the last three months - by young people, I mean below the age of 15, treated for Covid. \n\"And we've also seen a lot of cases where young people have taken Covid home and shared it with other household members, some of whom have been quite vulnerable.\"\nSeren Jenkins, 22, rejected any notion that young people might feel \"invincible\" - that Covid wouldn't affect them so severely.\n\"I'm sure there are loads of younger people that are like that, but I know loads of older people who've been exactly the same - everyone's probably done so many things wrong, I don't think it's fair to put it on one age group.\"\nWhen lockdown was announced she said she was \"pretty careful\". \n\"I didn't see my family for about 14 weeks.\" \nShe has had Covid, has been vaccinated and says she routinely wears masks in shops and on public transport. But lockdown has had an unexpected effect.\n\"I think it's had a really positive influence on me - I tend to not really say no to anything any more.\"\nNeath Port Talbot recently had the highest rate of Covid cases across the UK, as well as the highest case rate among the under-25s in Wales. \nVaccine take-up rates amongst the under-30s are also the lowest - albeit they were last to be offered the jab.\nBut not all sports clubs have backed a campaign to encourage people to get the Covid vaccine, according to Mr Reid.\nOf the region's two top sports clubs, he said, only the Ospreys had backed the drive.\n\"One avidly supported our vaccine campaign, another one haven't,\" he said.\nBut Swansea City FC said it was committed to helping the local vaccination programme and the stadium had been provided free of charge as a Covid testing facility.\nThe club said its players and staff were spoken to regularly by its medical team about safety and vaccinations, adding that \"we respect them with the decisions that they undertake for both themselves and their families.\"\nMr Reid said seeing role models having the jab gave fans \"a lot of assurance that vaccines are safe and effective\". \n\"We've seen the contrast between two really high level sporting teams within Swansea Bay region - one who avidly supported our vaccine campaign and have been very prominent in the community and another one who haven't,\" he said.  \n\"And that's due to attitudes amongst players themselves.\" \nIt is understood fewer than half the players at most Premier League and English Football League clubs have been vaccinated.  \n\"Undoubtedly people from other walks of life, and especially from sporting walks of life, can have great influence on the health behaviour of our communities and it's to their credit when they stand up and do that,\" said Mr Reid. \nNudges like these can be all the more important when considering the health of a local authority area like Neath Port Talbot. \n\"We saw the arrival of a new highly transmissible and infectious version of coronavirus at the same time that people were starting to move around more freely and mix more freely and I think that's what's driven up the rates,\" said Mr Reid.\n\"With schools going back when Delta (variant) was already pretty prevalent in the region - that's just added an extra element to the mix and we've seen rates in school kids in particular drive those headline figures.\"\nShane Miller, 18, who works part time at Bulldogs Boxing Club in Port Talbot, said it was an easy decision to be vaccinated, as he works with people with disabilities at the club and needed to be cautious.\n\"I know a lot of people were very relaxed about Covid,\" he said. \"I know two people who don't want the vaccine - they don't like needles or they just don't believe in Covid. \n\"I try and explain it's safer to have it, just in case, but it's the type of people who just don't listen.\"\nHe added transport can be an issue for those travelling to vaccination centres. \"They could do them in local chemists - if it was more local than that I think more people would have a better chance of getting there.\"\nIt is a point acknowledged by Keith Reid.\n\"It's much more difficult if you're working or you've got childcare responsibilities to get along to a vaccination centre,\" he said.\n\"We've seen a slower rise in coverage in those age groups, partly maybe because of the difficulty of getting along to vaccination - and higher scepticism I think, about what's the benefit of getting vaccinated.\"\nProfessional boxer Connor McIntosh, 26, said he and his girlfriend were expecting their first child during lockdown - Bronagh May is now a year old.\n\"I didn't even leave the house - we weren't going to take any risks,\" said the construction health and safety consultant.\n\"I've had my first jab and I'll have my second in the next couple of weeks - I'll have to have it done before my first professional fight anyway, for safety measures.\"\nBut did he have any reservations?\n\"Not really - it's a tough one, it's come out really quick - a lot of people don't know exactly what's in them - you get a lot of people on Facebook thinking they're proper scientists and they know exactly what's in them - but if it's going to make things go back to normal quicker, then I think yeah, everyone should have them.\n\"I think if everyone plays ball and just helps each other out, hopefully we can all get through it and things will go back to normal sooner rather than later.\"\nRhodri Williams' parents both work in the NHS - one for the ambulance service, one as a nurse.\n\"The only time I would go out of the house was to go for a run with my brother, once a day,\" said the 22-year-old, who has had both his jabs.\n\"The people that are coming out and saying that the vaccine could kill them, or the government are putting stuff in it - they're the people that would go to Mexico and have their jabs no problem, but they're not getting anything out of this so they don't see the point in getting it. \n\"Some people don't want it because they don't know what's in it - but they don't know what's in their cigarettes or their vapes either.\n\"I've got a season ticket down the Swans - the first game back against Sheffield United was a bit of a shock, because I hadn't been around that many people since Covid. \n\"It wasn't that I was scared, it was more that I had a bit of anxiety about going with all these people, but when you're in the game it's brilliant how they do it - where I was sitting there was plenty of spacing and I didn't feel at all at risk there.\"\nSo does he agree that sports stars and celebrities have a role here?\n\"I've seen a lot of people, especially on TikTok and Instagram - celebrities filming their experiences of going to get a vaccine and putting it in a positive light - and maybe that's going to inspire a couple of the younger people to go and get their vaccine.\"\nIn a statement, Swansea City said it \"is committed to assisting with the regional vaccination programme in the Swansea Bay area.\n\"The club places great emphasis on its role within the community and we are already engaging with the local health board about ways in which we can help in the future.\n\"Our players and staff receive regular dialogue from the club's medical team regarding public safety and vaccinations, and we respect them with the decisions that they undertake for both themselves and their families. \n\"Swansea City placed great importance on its role during the pandemic, such as opening its doors to the NHS for healthcare training purposes and providing our North Car Park as a Covid testing facility. Both of these ran for over a year without any charge being made by the club, while other venues rented out their facilities at a cost.  \n\"The club would also like to place on record its sincere thanks to all those who have, and continue to, play an active and important role in the vaccination programme.\""

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nOur health correspondent Nick Triggle considers the joint report by two committees of MPs that describes the UK's early Covid response as one of the worst ever public health failures. Nick breaks down the report's findings - including the UK's focus on flu, a lack of testing, and the trap of group think. Read his analysis here.\nMeanwhile, the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance says his job is \"not to sugarcoat\" reality when speaking to the PM about Covid. He said he had to give Boris Johnson and MPs the evidence - not worrying whether they would like it. In a BBC Radio 4 interview given before the MPs' report was published, he also says \"you've got to go sooner than you want\" when it comes to taking action.\nThe number of job vacancies in the UK has hit a record high, amid a continued recovery of the jobs market from Covid. Vacancies hit 1.1 million between July and September, the Office for National Statistics said, the highest level since records began in 2001. The largest increase in vacancies was in the retail sector and in motor vehicle repair.\nThe economic recovery has weakened in most rich nations due to the impact of the Delta variant of coronavirus, the International Monetary Fund says. The fund cut its 2021 growth forecasts for advanced economies.\nSports clubs and community groups had to shut during the coronavirus pandemic, stripping some people of their valued support networks.

      "tags": "National Crime Agency,Passports",
      "text": "Ten people in London and Kent have been arrested on suspicion of supplying fraudulent passports to more than 100 high-level organised criminals. \nEarly-morning raids in South London, Kent, Essex and Merseyside followed an international police investigation. \nThe gang is accused of supplying passports to clients including jailed drug dealer Jamie Acourt, a suspect in the murder of Stephen Lawrence.\nThose arrested are suspected of using paid \"lookalikes\" to obtain passports.\nThe National Crime Agency (NCA) said the gang used the \"lookalikes\" to apply for legitimate replacement passports, but using a criminal's photo, rather than their own.\nJacque Beer, the NCA's regional head of investigations, said: \"This is one of the most significant NCA investigations of recent times.\n\"We believe that this group's activities has enabled some of the most serious organised criminality in the UK and around the world.\"\nShe said if the suspects were convicted, it would have \"dismantled a criminal service that allowed drug and firearm traffickers, suspected murderers, and fugitives to evade detection and operate internationally under false identities.\"\nMs Beer said the hope is the case will lead to the \"strengthening of safeguards against criminal exploitation of the UK passport issuing system\".\nOfficers smashed down the doors of a flat in south London at 05:00 BST on Monday and arrested a 66-year-old man.  \nHe is suspected of being a broker between criminals looking for fraudulent passports, and those willing to supply them. \nSix men and three women believed to be members of the crime group were also arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of public justice and making false instruments. \nThese raids took place in Sutton, Sydenham, Rotherhithe, Hackney, Battersea and Hayes in Kent. The suspects are aged between 34 and 71.\nThe investigation began several years ago when HM Passport Office discovered criminals were using a \"loophole\" to obtain legitimate passports with fraudulent details.\nAccording to the NCA, the gang are believed to have sourced passports for specific criminal clients who wanted to hide their identity.\nThey would find someone who looked like the client and pay them to apply for a replacement passport. Someone else would be paid to countersign the application. \nBut when the passport form was sent in, the client's photo would be used instead of the image of the \"lookalike\" original passport holder.\nThe NCA alleges the gang found people prepared to, in effect, sell their personal details for passport applications in return for payments of \u00a32,000.\nBecause the passports were not simply forged and therefore appeared legitimate, they were extremely valuable within the criminal underworld.\nFourteen men suspected of receiving the passports or helping to countersign documents were arrested in Kent, Essex and Merseyside. They are aged between 38 and 73. \nThe NCA and HM Passport Office have been tracking individuals using the fraudulent passports for years. \nAs a result, the BBC has been told that more than 100 people said to be senior figures in organised crime have been arrested. \nChris Farrimond, deputy director of operations at the NCA, explained: \"These were serious criminals, who, for one reason or another, could not make use of their normal passport. \n\"Either they were on the run, or they were so involved in criminal business that they wanted to keep their activities under the radar.\"\nThey are believed to include Jamie Acourt, extradited from Spain and jailed for drug offences. \nThe NCA suspect he was a client of the gang, and says he would not have been tracked down had it not been for the fact he was travelling on a passport supplied fraudulently.\nIn 2018, the agency told the BBC that Acourt had been tracked using \"intelligence methods\". \nThe NCA believes passports were also supplied to Richard Burdett, jailed with his brother Daniel for importing 16 guns into the UK.\nBurdett was arrested in July 2019 after being stopped by police in Amsterdam. To confirm his identity he produced a genuine British passport, bearing his photo but fraudulently obtained.\nHe had used it to travel to Ireland to evade police in the UK, his trial was told.\nPassports were also supplied to organised crime organisations in Scotland and Ireland.\nSecurity Minister Damian Hinds said: \"This is a fantastic result and will do significant damage to the serious organised crime groups who want to inflict misery on our shores and around the world.\"\n\"The close working between the NCA and Her Majesty's Passport Office has been at the heart of this hugely successful operation.\"\n\"The government is working to make the UK border one of the most effective and secure in the world, which will also support our ambition of dismantling ruthless organised crime groups.\""

      "text": "Firms hit by a sharp surge in energy prices are expected to get government help worth hundreds of millions of pounds, the BBC understands.\nGlass, ceramic and paper manufacturers have warned that rising prices may mean they have to charge customers more.\nOn Monday, business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng submitted a formal proposal asking the Treasury to help such firms.\nThe Department for Business expects the prime minister to back its proposals, which could involve state-backed loans.\nThe government is reluctant to prop up companies which would normally be competitive, which is why support is likely to involve loans rather than grants.\nThe Treasury is said to be still analysing the proposal. Number 10 has declined to comment. \nBusinesses have said they hope for a \"swift response\" on the plans.\nHigh energy costs have been forcing manufacturers in energy-intensive industries such as steel and chemical manufacturing to warn of higher prices for their goods as they pass on increases to consumers.\nOther firms have said they may be forced to shut down their factories if the rising cost of gas and electricity makes it uneconomic for them to produce their goods.\nDr Richard Leese, chair of the Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) - an umbrella group for several manufacturers including ceramics and paper, told the BBC's Today programme that a quick response from the Treasury to the proposals was \"crucial\".\n\"We need preventative action to stop the issue spreading further.\"\nDr Leese said firms in the sector faced higher tax and levies than European rivals. He said firms had put forward \"practical and sensible\" measures for help, and denied that government help would put any additional burden on taxpayers.\nGareth Stace, the director general of the trade body UK Steel, said he had yet to see details of the proposals put forward.\nHe warned that without adequate support, plants could close and jobs could be under threat as high energy costs bite.\n\"The key test in this proposal is are we now going to be on an equal footing with steelmakers in Germany?,\" Mr Stace said.\n\"If this package results in us still paying 80% more for energy than our competitors in continental Europe, then really this will really be a flimsy sticking plaster on what is really a major crisis that we are going through at the moment.\"\nKendal paper manufacturer James Cropper PLC has been in business since 1845 and is one of the biggest employers in the area.\nToday, it also makes home insulation and carbon paper, with energy bills working out at about \u00a360,000 every single week.\nIts chief executive, Phil Wild, told BBC Breakfast: \"Any price increase is significant for a manufacturer like ours that consumes the energy that we do. \n\"As it happens, we're probably OK here because of some actions we've put in place, but I can see some of those businesses may not make it.\"\nHe added that the recent increase in gas prices had highlighted the need for energy intensive firms to start using more renewable forms of energy, rather than fossil fuels and gas.\nBut in the short-term, paper, glass, steel and ceramics manufacturers \"are really looking to the government for help to get them over that hump\", he said.\nThe proposals by Business Secretary Kwarteng follow days of conversations with leaders from affected industries, as well as a very public row with the Treasury about the status of talks between the government departments.\nDemands for support from energy-intensive industries have been growing louder, but not all companies are affected in the same way.\nSome have long-term contracts to buy energy at fixed prices, protecting them from short-term increases, but others do not. \nBusinesses themselves have called for their energy costs to be capped, in the same way that households currently benefit from a price cap imposed by regulator Ofgem.\nBut that would risk simply passing on the extra costs to energy suppliers, says our correspondent.\nDirect subsidies would add to the burden on taxpayers, at a time when Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to seek to curb public spending in his next Budget on 27 October.\nThere are many reasons, both in the UK and around the world. \nThere's been a shortage of gas and energy in many countries as they emerged from lockdown and industry reopened. \nA cold winter in Europe last year also put pressure on supplies and, as a result, less gas is being stored than normal. \nOn top of that, the UK has fewer gas storage facilities than some countries - meaning it buys more on the wholesale market and is exposed to sharp price rises. \nThere's also increased demand from Asia (which also suffered a cold winter) for liquefied natural gas. And there is a suspicion that Russia, a major gas supplier, is restricting output - an accusation it denies - which, following the law of supply and demand, has fuelled price rises.\nThis has helped push up gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia. Since January, they've risen 250%. And prices have soared 70% since August alone.\nRead more here"
