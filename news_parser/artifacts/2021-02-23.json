      "tags": "Grenfell Tower fire,Grenfell Tower Inquiry",
      "text": "The use of a company's cladding at Grenfell Tower was \"an accident waiting to happen\", one of its bosses has agreed at a public inquiry.\nClaude Schmidt said \"maybe yes\" to a barrister's description of the risk.\nMr Schmidt, Arconic's French president, was giving his fifth day of evidence to the Grenfell Tower public inquiry.\nThe inquiry heard that even after the fire, an \"error\" on a draft product certificate for the cladding suggested it could be used on tall buildings.\nMr Schmidt was being questioned by Richard Millett QC, the inquiry's senior counsel, about the weeks after the fire on 14 June 2017, which led to 72 deaths.\nArconic's cladding panels had quickly emerged as a likely cause of the swift spread of flames across Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, west London.\nOn 26 June, Arconic withdrew the product from the market for buildings taller than 18m, claiming that it had realised it was being \"incorrectly used\", including on Grenfell.\nMr Millett asked him \"isn't the reality that Grenfell, as far as the use of Reynobond PE 55 [cladding] was concerned, that it was an accident waiting to happen and only then did you withdraw it from the market\".\nMr Schmidt's response, as translated from French, was \"maybe yes.\"\nBut he said the company \"were among the only ones to withdraw the product from the market. It was because we couldn't control the supply chain.\"\nArconic's case is that it realised after the fire it could not be sure customers would use its flammable polyethylene version of the cladding safely.\nMr Millett said \"wasn't that all the more reason to stop selling\".\n\"Yes\", Mr Schmidt agreed.\nHe said that the decision not to sell the cladding for high-rise buildings was not made because it was \"inherently dangerous\" but said it did \"have certain characteristics which, if it is used incorrectly, can increase the risk of fire spread\".\nThe inquiry says the cladding was a major cause of the rapid spread of flames during the disaster and this phase of its hearings are determining why it was used.\nThe inquiry has heard, and Mr Schmidt also agreed, that for 12 years before the Grenfell fire, Arconic failed to reveal poor fire test data for the cassette form of its cladding to an important British building industry body.\nThe British Board of Agr\u00e9ment had issued a standards certificate for the product, relied on by the industry, which suggested all versions of the cladding met British standards.\nThis document was sent to the contractors for Grenfell. They selected the Arconic cladding, and a design which would use it in exactly the cassette configuration which the tests suggested would allow fires to spread.\nEven after the fire, a redrafted BBA certificate continued to claim better fire test data than the company had.\nIt also emerged at the inquiry that a BBC investigation into Arconic in 2018 prompted the Board to challenge the cladding firm about what information it had been given.\nThe BBC had discovered the series of poor fire tests reports, commissioned by Arconic, which have been at the heart of this phase of the inquiry.\nThey were carried out in France, but were not published in the UK, and not passed to the British Board of Agr\u00e9ment.\nIn March 2018 the BBC shared them with the Board, which confirmed the information, crucial to the product certificate, had not been handed over.\nChallenged by the BBA, Mr Schmidt said he was \"happy\" to send them.  Brian Moore, from the BBA, responded that it was \"concerning\" to hear that Arconic had the reports.\nBut despite this exchange of emails, they were never handed over, due to legal advice, Mr Schmidt said.\nBy this point, the inquiry, and the police had begun in-depth investigations."

      "tags": "Spotify,Streaming,YouTube,Apple",
      "text": "Raising the price of music streaming services could lead to a rise in piracy, MPs have been told.\nThe music industry has been keen to increase prices for some time, saying it could help artists earn more money.\nBut Spotify told MPs it was wary of tweaking its monthly \u00a39.99 subscription fee, which hasn't changed in a decade. \nIf music becomes \"unaffordable to consumers\", warned chief legal officer Horacio Gutierrez, it could end up \"pushing them back into online piracy\".\nGutierrez was giving evidence to a digital, culture, media and sport select committee inquiry into the economics of streaming. \nIt was set up last year to investigate whether musicians are being paid fairly by services like Spotify, Amazon Music and Apple Music.\nAll three appeared before MPs on Tuesday, but much of the talk was about one of their rivals - YouTube. \nApple Music's Elena Segal said it was difficult for streaming services to compete with the music available on Google's video-streaming site.\n\"Competing with free is very difficult,\" she said. \"It's challenging to compete on an un-level playing field.\n\"They don't necessarily have licenses for all the music that they use, and they don't need to,\" she said, referring to the \"safe harbour\" laws that protect YouTube from legal claims when users upload copyrighted material. \n\"Even when they do have licenses, the amount they pay... is less.\"\nSegal added that the mere fact of YouTube's existence prevented other streaming services from raising their prices. \nAnother factor, she explained, was that the same songs are available on almost every music streaming service, unlike Netflix and Disney Plus, which can lure customers in with original films and TV shows.\n\"Those things do make it challenging to just put prices up in a vacuum...  because people can just opt to go to free or to another service that will have the same music,\" she said.\nHowever, both Amazon and Spotify conceded they would not end their free, ad-supported services if YouTube was to disappear.\nIt is not the first time that the DCMS inquiry has heard accusations against YouTube. \nThe company was accused of \"making an absolute fortune from other people's work\" by committee chair Julian Knight MP, after being told that YouTube paid UK record labels \u00a335m in 2020, about half what they earned from selling vinyl records.\nBy contrast, Spotify said they generated \u00a3474m for the UK music industry last year.\nHowever, Katherine Oyama, director of government affairs and public policy at YouTube said the company's payments were \"absolutely on a par\" with Spotify and other streaming platforms.\nEarlier this month, she told MPs YouTube had paid $3 billion (\u00a32.1billion) to the global music industry in 2019. \nPressed on the BPI's claims, Oyama said record labels were pointing fingers at YouTube \"to alleviate hard questions about their own industry\". She also called for more \"transparency\" on how the money paid to the industry was divided up before going to artists and songwriters.\nEarlier sessions of the inquiry saw testimony from Chic's Nile Rodgers and members of Radiohead and Elbow, as well as executives from all three major labels. \nElbow frontman Guy Garvey said the way artists are paid for audio streams was \"threatening the future of music\".\n\"That sounds very dramatic,\" he told MPs, \"but if musicians can't afford to pay the rent... we haven't got tomorrow's music in place.\"\nBy contrast, Universal Music UK's chairman and chief executive, David Joseph, told the inquiry that artists were \"very happy with the investment, very happy with advances\" they currently received.\nHe was interrupted by SNP MP John Nicolson, who said: \"I think you're living in cloud cuckoo land here if you really believe that.\"\nMuch of the discussion has centred around whether artists receive a fair share of the \u00a31bn generated in the UK when their music is played online.\nAt Tuesday's session, all three streaming companies said they were willing to investigate new ways of distributing money.\nOne such suggestion is the user-centric payment system where, if you only listen to Dua Lipa, your entire subscription fee would go directly to her. \nUnder the current system, all the money earned by streaming services is pooled before being distributed according to market share - so if Dua accounts for 1% of all streams on Spotify, she and her label receive 1% of the money.\n\"We would definitely be open to looking for alternative models and considering them,\" said Spotify's Horacio Gutierrez. Paul Firth of Amazon Music agreed, saying, \"we should take a look at a number of these approaches\" to see whether they really benefit the artist.\nSegal, however, cautioned that a new approach would need to be agreed by everyone who supplies music to the streaming services before it could be implemented. \nAt present, Spotify is believed to pay between \u00a30.002 and \u00a30.0038 per stream, while Apple Music pays about \u00a30.0059. YouTube pays the least - about \u00a30.00052 (or 0.05 pence) per stream.\nAll of that money goes to rights-holders, a blanket term that covers everything from massive record companies to artists who release their own music. The cash is then divided up between everyone involved in making the record.\nOften, the recording artist will only receive about 13% of the revenue, with labels and publishers keeping the rest. Songwriters and studio musicians receive even less.\nIndependent labels tend to make more equitable deals, with some offering a 50/50 split of the profits. Artists who self-release their music stand to receive more - but may find it hard to compete with the promotion and marketing a major label can supply.\nTuesday's hearing was the last session before MPs write their report on the streaming economy. \nIt featured a brief cameo for The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who recently signed a lucrative deal to produce and host podcasts for Spotify.\n\"Can Harry and Megan save the music business?\" asked conservative MP Steve Brine.\n\"That seems a little bit premature,\" laughed Gutierrez, who conceded that the duke and duchess had been signed because they were good \"box office\".\n\"At the end of the day, it goes back to attention economics,\" he said. \n\"The product is valued on the bas[is] of how many users it can attract, how many streams it will attract, which in turn determines how many advertisers are willing to advertise on the podcast. \n\"There is a market that is emerging for talent in that regard\".\nHowever, the couple's podcast won't generate any additional revenues for musicians on Spotify, unless they play licensed music within the show itself.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Tech giants Google and Facebook have too great a share of the UK online advertising market, the boss of the UK's competition watchdog has said.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) would like regulatory changes to deal with that market dominance, its boss Andrea Coscelli told the BBC.\nGoogle and Facebook have faced criticism from competition and other regulators in the past.\nFacebook said it faces \"significant competition\" online from rival firms.\nGoogle has also been approached for comment by the BBC.\nWhen questioned by the BBC's media editor Amol Rajan, Mr Coscelli said that the two tech giants have a \"duopoly\" in the UK when it comes to digital advertising, which can often be bad for competition.\nGoogle and Facebook have about an 80% share of the UK's \u00a314bn digital advertising market, which is \"not an ideal situation\", Mr Coscelli said.\n\"We think it would be good if we got to a situation where others had a bigger share of the market,\" he said.\nHe also described the fact that Google holds about 90% of the UK's \u00a37.3bn search advertising market as a \"problem\".\nFacebook currently has a more than 50% share of the \u00a35.5bn display advertising market in the UK, which is too much, Mr Coscelli said.\n\"When companies have too much economic power, that creates a number of distortions, first for competitors, secondly for consumers, and at some level potentially in terms of the political process as well, in some cases,\" he said.\n\"We, in general terms, like to see markets more competitive, with more players, with more diversity of players, because we think that delivers better outcomes.\"\nA Facebook spokesman said its platform \"gives millions of people and businesses in the UK the opportunity to connect and share.\"\nHe added: \"Advertisers can and do freely move their [advertising] spending between TV, radio, print, outdoor and online. \n\"And in online advertising itself, we face significant competition from the likes of Google, Apple, Snap, Twitter and Amazon, as well as new entrants like TikTok, which keeps us on our toes.\"\nMr Coscelli stopped short of saying that Facebook and Google should be broken up.\n\"Our current proposal is not to break them up, it's to have pro-competitive regulation to deal with some of the issues, but it would allow the companies to maintain all the current activities that they have,\" he said.\nThe CMA said in December it plans to issue Facebook, Google and the other tech giants a set of rules customised to each firm to rein in \"anti-competitive behaviour\" and give consumers \"more control over how their data used\".\nIt is set to create a Digital Markets Unit within itself to draw up the rules and govern compliance, although legislation is required which may not be introduced until 2022.\nSilicon Valley firms have recently faced increasing scrutiny from other regulatory bodies around the world. \nBefore the UK's exit from the European Union, competition regulation for global or pan-European companies was done through Brussels.\nGoogle has been hit with a number of competition fines by the European Commission over the years, including a \u20ac1.49bn (\u00a31.28bn) fine in 2019 for blocking rival online search advertisers.\nFacebook is also facing competition action in the United States from federal regulators and more than 45 state prosecutors who are accusing the social media company of taking illegal action to buy up rivals and stifle competition."

This was 6,067 deaths above the five-year average.\nLooking at deaths compared to what we might normally expect to see, from previous years - so-called \"excess\" deaths is seen as a reliable measure.\nFor the week, there were 760 deaths in total - 4.3% above average; in London, for example, excess deaths were more than 42% above average.\nThe total number of deaths involving Covid up to 12 February, when registrations in the following days are counted, stands now at 7,296.\nThese are deaths where Covid either suspected or confirmed by doctors, as a contributory factor, although it is estimated that the virus is the underlying cause in around 90% of these deaths.\nUnlike the daily snapshot given by Public Health Wales, these also include all deaths which occur in settings including all care homes, hospices and people's homes.\nAccording to the ONS figures, we can now see deaths finally falling, with the peak of the second wave happening on 11 January, when there were 83 deaths.\nThis was higher than the peak of the pandemic's first wave, when 73 deaths occurred on 12 April.\nDecember and January brought 3,049 deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales; this is 44% higher than during April and May, the worst two months of the first wave."

      "text": "Tesla boss Elon Musk has lost his title as the world's richest person after a recent slide in the electric carmaker's shares, the main driver of his wealth.\nTesla shares have tumbled more than 20% since hitting a high of more than $880 in early January.\nThey suffered especially steep falls this week, tied to the firm's recent risky $1.5bn (\u00a31bn) investment in Bitcoin.\nThe drop returned Amazon boss Jeff Bezos to the top spot on the rich list.\nThe risk of being associated with the notoriously volatile Bitcoin - which has fallen sharply in recent days - may have prompted some Tesla investors to sell their shares, even if the firm has not been hurt by the declines, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said.\n\"By Musk and Tesla aggressively embracing Bitcoin... investors are starting to tie Bitcoin and Tesla at the hip,\" he said.  \n\"The recent 48-hour sell-off in Bitcoin and added volatility has driven some investors to the exits on this name in the near-term.\" \nBitcoin's value jumped nearly 50% in the weeks after Tesla revealed it had purchased $1.5bn of the currency and planned to accept it as payment. \nBut since climbing above $57,000 on Sunday, the cryptocurrency has dropped nearly 20%. It was trading at less than $48,000 on Tuesday - still higher than when Tesla disclosed its bet.\nJust as Mr Musk was credited with helping to fuel Bitcoin's rise, he may also have himself to blame for some of the recent Bitcoin declines. \nIn an exchange on Twitter over the weekend Mr Musk wrote that the price of Bitcoin did \"seem high lol\".\nAlso driving the cryptocurrency lower were comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who sounded a warning on Bitcoin on Monday. She called it an \"extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions\".\nThe comments follow a recent surge of interest in Bitcoin, after major US firms such as Mastercard and Bank of NY Mellon followed Tesla's lead in announcing plans to incorporate the digital currency into their operations.\nMr Musk's attention to Bitcoin comes as Tesla faces other challenges. \nThe firm recently halted most sales of the lowest-priced version of its Model Y SUV, with Mr Musk citing a desire to improve the car's range.\nEarlier this month, Chinese regulators summoned the firm over safety and quality issues, after reports of battery fires and abnormal acceleration.\nRival carmakers such as General Motors and Volkswagen have also stepped up their focus on electric vehicles in recent months.\nThe struggles follow an astonishing rise in Tesla shares in 2020, when prices leapt from less than $90 to more than $700.\nThe increase propelled Mr Musk past Amazon boss Jeff Bezos in the world's richest rankings for the first time in January, while also raising questions about whether that value made sense for a firm that produces a fraction of the cars of its rivals. \nThe two billionaires have been vying for the top spot in the weeks since. \nThe more than 8% decline in Tesla's share price on Monday was the biggest since September and wiped more than $15bn off Mr Musk's net worth, according to Bloomberg. Shares fell a further 2% on Tuesday.\nMr Musk's tweets have also famously triggered sharp moves in Tesla shares, including last year when the firm lost $14bn in market value after he wrote that its share price was too high."

      "text": "The government is being urged to give GCSE and A-level students more information about this year's exams as soon as possible. \nHead teachers say it would help pupils deal with the disruption caused by the recent Omicron surge.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh governments have confirmed that face coverings will remain compulsory in high schools. \nAll UK schools must offer face-to-face teaching to every age group, and provide effective online learning for pupils who are absent or isolating.\nThe specific Covid measures in place vary across the nations. \nAll school staff and secondary school pupils are asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week (three in Wales).\nIn England, secondary school pupils no longer need to wear masks in the classroom, and won't be required to wear them in communal areas from 27 January.\nA teachers union has urged the government to give GCSE and A-level students information about this year's exams ahead of the planned update on 7 February. Pupils will be offered a choice of topics in some subjects, but don't yet have the final details. \nIn Wales, some schools have reintroduced year-group bubbles, and have staggered start and finish times. Face coverings will remain compulsory in classrooms and communal areas until the end of the February half term, when schools will be expected to revert to their normal timetable. Rules will be reviewed on 10 February. \nIn Northern Ireland, schools reopened with the same measures as last term. New guidance says all primary and post-primary pupils in a class where there are multiple Covid cases should take an LFT. The overall guidance to schools will be reviewed in mid-February.\nIn Scotland, social distancing remains in place, pupils are separated into groups where possible. Pupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the 1m (3ft) social distancing rule still applies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the guidance for schools was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nThe latest data for England shows that 415,000 pupils (5.1%) were absent for Covid-related reasons on 20 Jan, up from 3.9% on 6 January.\nOver the same period, 4.5% of teachers and leaders were off because of Covid, although a quarter of schools had absence rates above 15%.\nIn addition, 4.7% of teaching assistants and other staff were off for Covid-related reasons. \nThe latest data in Northern Ireland shows that on 24 January, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covid - the highest rates since the new term began.\nIn Scotland on 21 January, 30,238 students (4.4%) were missing from school due to Covid-related reasons. \nMany schools have told the BBC they can't find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. A number of supply teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.\nEngland's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says the government is considering options to deal with staff shortages. \nHe previously urged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response.\nMr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes in the event of teacher shortages. \nBut teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children.\nYes - as long as they don't have any of the main Covid symptoms, under-18s don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. \nSimilarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. \nHowever, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advised to take LFTs for at least seven days. \nAll primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland should take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. \nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the second jab typically given 12 weeks after the first.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has also recommended that booster doses should be offered to children aged:\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has also been approved for five to 11-year-olds who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from Covid. \nThe JCVI also recommends that primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, but it's not yet clear when they might get the doses.\nChildren who aren't considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after testing positive for Covid before being vaccinated.\nVentilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid. \nIn England, the government is making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. \nLabour says this isn't enough, but the Department for Education says the units are only required in areas where doors and windows cannot be opened effectively.\nSome 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors had already been promised for England's schools to help identify areas with poor ventilation, but teaching unions complained this won't solve the problem. \nThe Scottish government gave \u00a3100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.\nThe Welsh government has a \u00a36m programme to increase air circulation and purity which will provide 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines."

Adjusting for this, the ONS said underlying wage growth was \"likely to be under 3%\".\nThe ONS said 1.74 million people were unemployed in the October to December period, up 454,000 from the same quarter in 2019.\n\"Our survey shows that the unemployment rate has had the biggest annual rise since the financial crisis,\" said Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics.\n\"However, the proportion of people who are neither working nor looking for work has stabilised after rising sharply at the start of the pandemic, with many people who lost their jobs early on having now started looking for work.\"\nDespite this, Mr Athow told the BBC's Today programme that the true underlying picture was not yet clear due to the high number of people still on furlough. \nHe said figures from early February suggested that about six million people were currently furloughed, adding: \"There is a huge amount of uncertainty about what will happen to them when that scheme ends.\"\nThe Bank of England is forecasting that the unemployment rate will rise sharply, peaking at an estimated 7.8% later in the year.\nKeighlie Holt is a 20 year-old hairdresser from Blackpool, which has the highest youth unemployment in the UK. The impact of covid on her industry means she has has only worked for a fraction of the year.\nShe is now retraining as a social media analyst: \"Last year I did what felt like, literally, three months of work. \n\"December wasn't anywhere near what it's like on any other December, that's normally our busiest time. And then it just wasn't going to go back to normal. No one wanted to get their hair done. No, I wasn't going anywhere.\"\nToday's labour market figures show that pay was up by an average of nearly 5% compared with a year ago - a much bigger pay rise than has been typical for most of the past decade. \nIf you're an employee you may not recognise that figure as anywhere near your own pay rise; a big part of it is because it is an average figure. \nIf you remove nearly 730,000 workers from employers' payrolls, many of whom have been in low-paid occupations such as accommodation and food services - where pay rises have been modest or non-existent - then it flatters the average. \nHowever, even allowing for those \"compositional\" effects, the Office for National Statistics estimates that there was still pay growth of 3% overall - far more than inflation at 0.7%.\nAnd in some sectors it was better than that: according to the ONS, pay in health and social work rose by an average of 6.2% - some modest compensation, perhaps, for the risks those workers have been taking. \nThe Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is preparing for next week's Budget, which is expected to set out further plans to help the labour market.\n\"I know how incredibly tough the past year has been for everyone, and every job lost is a personal tragedy,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\"At the Budget next week I will set out the next stage of our Plan for Jobs, and the support we'll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery.\"\nLabour's shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, claimed some businesses were \"throwing in the towel\" because the government was taking too long to confirm what business support would be available to them over the next six months.\nMs Dodds criticised the government for announcing its roadmap to ending lockdown \"without the clarity of business support\".  She told the BBC ministers \"may relish the theatre of budget\" but it was \"wrong to put decisions off until the Budget\", as some businesses had decided to \"give up\".  "

We have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow,\" he said on Monday.\nThe president and vice-president, and their spouses, then observed a moment of silence outside the White House during a candle-lighting ceremony.\nConfirmed US infections now stand at 28.1 million, also a global record.\n\"Today I ask all Americans to remember. Remember those we lost and remember those we left behind,\" President Biden said, calling for Americans to fight Covid together.\nThe president ordered all flags on federal property to be lowered to half mast for the next five days.\nAt the White House, he opened his speech by noting that the number of American deaths from Covid was higher than the death toll from World War One, World War Two, and the Vietnam War combined.\n\"Today we mark a truly grim, heartbreaking milestone - 500,071 dead,\" he said.\n\"We often hear people described as ordinary Americans,\" he went on to say. \"There's no such thing, there's nothing ordinary about them. The people we lost were extraordinary. They span generations. Born in America, emigrated to America.\"\n\"So many of them took their final breath alone in America.\"\nHe drew on his own experience with grief - his wife and daughter were killed in a car crash in 1972 and one of his sons died from brain cancer in 2015.\n\"I know what it's like to not be there when it happens. I know what it's like when you are there holding their hands; there's a look in their eye and they slip away,\" he said.\n\"For me, the way through sorrow and grief is to find purpose.\"\nMr Biden's approach to the pandemic is different to his predecessor, Donald Trump, who cast doubt on the impact of the deadly virus and was viewed as having politicised the wearing of masks and other measures needed to prevent the spread of the virus.\nOn 19 January, one day before Mr Biden took office, he held an event to mark 400,000 Americans dying of the disease.\nMonday's event, marking the latest death toll, comes about one month later.\nElsewhere in Washington, the bells at the National Cathedral tolled 500 times, once for every 1,000 Americans lost during the pandemic.\nAlthough numbers are now going in the right direction, hospital admissions - and deaths - remain high, as the key statistics show:\nDr Ashish Jha, dean of the school of public health at Brown University, told BBC News: \"A year ago I could not have imagined that half a million Americans would lose their lives to this disease.\n\"We have so much capability, so many resources... this was all preventable and should not have happened. And yet here we are.\"\nThe nation's top immunologist, Dr Anthony Fauci, told CNN on Sunday: \"People decades from now are going to be talking about this as a terribly historic milestone in the history of this country, to have these many people to have died from a respiratory-borne infection.\"\nAmericans' average life expectancy has dropped by one full year due to Covid-19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week. The change has been most acute among racial minorities, who have been disproportionally affected by the deadly virus.\nBlack men suffered the largest decline, with life expectancy dropping by three years between January and June 2020.\nAnd Hispanic men saw a fall in life expectancy of 2.4 years during that period. \nWhen did you first say 'coronavirus'?\nAbout a year ago, the pandemic hit. We're asking you to search through old text messages and find the first time the term coronavirus (corona or Covid) came up in your conversations.\nWhat do you remember from that exchange?

      "text": "Scotland's former first minister Alex Salmond has made accusations of a \"malicious and concerted\" attempt to remove him from public life.\nThe claim appears in papers published ahead of his appearance at a Holyrood inquiry into the Scottish government's mishandling of complaints against him.\nMr Salmond names people he alleges to have been part of moves to damage his reputation.\nNicola Sturgeon insisted any accusation of a conspiracy was \"not true\".\nShe told the BBC that there was \"not a shred of evidence\" that Mr Salmond could show to prove his claims.\nOn Monday evening the Scottish Parliament's committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints made Mr Salmond's submission public.\nIn it he said: \"The inescapable conclusion is of a malicious and concerted attempt to damage my reputation and remove me from public life in Scotland.\n\"It is an attempt which would, in fact, have succeeded but for the protection of the court and jury system and in particular the Court of Session and the High Court of Justiciary.\n\"However, underlying all of this and perhaps the most serious issue of all is the complete breakdown of the necessary barriers which should exist between government, political party and indeed the prosecution authorities in any country which abides by the rule of law.\"\nMr Salmond is due to face questions from members of the Holyrood committee when he goes before them on Wednesday.\nThe inquiry was established after the government conceded an internal investigation of two harassment complaints against the former first minister had been \"unlawful\".\nHe was awarded more than \u00a3500,000 in legal expenses following the judicial review case, and was subsequently acquitted of charges of sexual assault in a separate High Court trial.\nMr Salmond names people he believes helped to damage his reputation - including Nicola Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell and her chief of staff, Liz Lloyd. He also described the Crown Office as \"not fit for purpose\" under its current leadership.\nIn the published document he asserts: \"I leave to others the question of what is, or is not, a conspiracy but am very clear in my position that the evidence supports a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort amongst a range of individuals within the Scottish government and the SNP to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned.\n\"That includes, for the avoidance of doubt, Peter Murrell (chief executive), Ian McCann (compliance officer) and Sue Ruddick (chief operating officer) of the SNP together with Liz Lloyd, the First Minister's Chief of Staff.\n\"There are others who, for legal reasons, I am not allowed to name.\"\nHe added: \"The real cost to the Scottish people runs into many millions of pounds and yet no-one in this entire process has uttered the simple words which are necessary on occasions to renew and refresh democratic institutions - 'I Resign'.\n\"The committee now has the opportunity to address that position.\"\nMr Salmond believes his successor has misled parliament and breached the ministerial code. The code states ministers who knowingly mislead parliament would be expected to resign.\nMSPs previously decided against publishing the submission the former first minister made to a separate inquiry, which is considering whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code.\nThe Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) then concluded \"on balance\" it would be \"possible\" for the document to be published.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: \"What we have not seen is a shred of evidence to back these wild claims up.\n\"Now, in front of the parliament, the burden of proof is on Alex Salmond. It is time for insinuation and assertion to be replaced with actual evidence.\"\nA Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) spokesman said it took seriously its responsibility to uphold the law and to protect the dignity and rights of \"all those who come into contact with COPFS\".\nHe added that Scotland's prosecutors had acted \"independently and in the public interest at all times\" in relation to the case.\nAn additional written submission by Ms Lloyd said she rejected the conspiracy allegation in \"its entirety\" and was not \"substantiated by any evidence and is founded on a number of claims, that are false\".\nAn SNP spokesman said: \"This is just more assertion without a shred of credible evidence.\n\"Several of the women have already made clear how utterly absurd it is to suggest they were part of a conspiracy to bring him down. And yet Alex Salmond is still making these ridiculous and baseless claims and lashing out at all and sundry.\""

He was later acquitted by the Senate, becoming the first president in US history to be impeached twice.\nAll three officials agreed that there appeared to be a level of co-ordination and planning from the crowd.\nMr Sund said that pipe bombs that were placed at the edge of the security perimeter appeared to be intended to draw law enforcement away from the Capitol building.\n\"When the group arrived at the perimeter, they did not act like any group of protesters I had ever seen,\" said the 30-year police veteran.\n\"A clear lack of accurate and complete intelligence across several federal agencies contributed to this event and not poor planning by the United States Capitol Police,\" he added.\nCapitol Police Captain Carneysha Mendoza described the clashes, telling lawmakers that she has chemical burns on her face from attackers that still have not fully healed.\n\"Of the multitude of events I've worked in my nearly 19-year career in the department, this was by far the worst of the worst,\" she said. \n\"We could have had 10 times the amount of people working with us, and I still believe the battle would have been just as devastating.\"\nThe officials also said that an FBI report, warning that protesters had been preparing for \"war\", had failed to reach security officials on the eve of the attack.\nFormer House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving said that despite media reports, \"optics played no role in my decision around security\".\nHe denied reports that officials did not want military troops at the Capitol out of concern that it would generate bad publicity.\nHis account appeared to be in direct conflict with Mr Sund, who testified that Mr Irving had \"stated he was concerned about the 'optics' of having National Guard present\".\n\"We all agreed the intelligence did not support\" calling in the troops, said former Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger.\nMr Sund added that no civilian police force would have been equipped that day to repel the massive crowd. \nSenator Amy Klobuchar, who is leading the hearing, said Pentagon officials will be called next week to testify about the deployment of National Guard troops.\nSenators say the hearings will help determine new security measures - including a permanent fence - being considered for the Capitol in the wake of the attack.\nAt the time, US lawmakers were meeting inside the Capitol to certify Joe Biden's presidential victory.\nThere was a pro-Trump rally that day on the National Mall, at which the former president spoke.\nHe repeated unfounded claims that the election was stolen from him, and told those gathered: \"If you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore.\"\nHe also told them to protest peacefully but encouraged them to go to the Capitol and have their voices heard.\nThousands of his supporters then made their way to the seat of government, overwhelmed the security and smashed their way into the building.\nAt least 200 people have been charged for their role in the Capitol breach.\nOver 140 Capitol police officers and 65 Washington DC police officers were injured in the hours-long melee.\nCapitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, a 12-year veteran of the force, died following clashes with protesters. Two more Capitol Police officers took their own lives in the weeks after the riot."

      "text": "Scotland's youngest pupils are returning to the classroom for the first time since the Christmas break.\nIt is stage one in a phased reopening of schools which have been closed to all but a minority of pupils since the beginning of January. \nEducation Secretary John Swinney insisted \"detailed clinical analysis\" assured him it is safe. \nBut concerns have been raised about the measures in place to reduce risk of transmission.\nMr Swinney told BBC's Good Morning Scotland that case prevalence data would be closely monitored to determine the impact of the phase one return.\nBut he said Scotland would not be following England, where all pupils are due to return to school on 8 March.\nAsked if it would be \"dangerous\" to send everyone back on that date, Mr Swinney said: \"I wouldn't have clinical authorisation to do that.\"\nThe deputy first minister added: \"We will move as quickly as we possibly can do but we have to do it within the scientific and clinical advice that is available to us.\"\nMr Swinney also urged parents to act responsibly during the first phase of lockdown easing.\nHe added: \"The biggest threat to the opening of schools is not outbreaks in schools. It is community transmission.\"\nEpidemiologist Dr Deepti Gurdasani told BBC Scotland at the weekend there was some evidence from England that younger children could bring infections back into homes. \nBut Prof Devi Sridhar, chairwoman of global public health at Edinburgh University, said the return of schools was about balancing the \"risks and benefits\".\nShe told BBC Good Morning Scotland: \"There will likely be cases emerging in schools over the next few weeks but the vast majority of schools should be fine, and that we have to keep perspective on.\"\nShe said the majority of scientific evidence was that there is an \"age gradient\" in infections - with very few outbreaks in nurseries but with teenagers and university students much more prone to infection. \nProf Sridhar added: \"I think what we have to do is work back up through that gradient. We are doing that starting with primaries and early years - the approach Denmark has also taken.\" \nOn Sunday the deputy first minister pointed to documents prepared by a government expert advisory group which states that younger children are less likely to catch or pass on the virus than older children and adults. \nAre you a parent or a teacher?

You can also get in touch in the following ways:\nPlans to reopen schools have been welcomed by opposition parties but the Scottish Conservatives have urged the government to publish plans for helping pupils catch-up with schooling they have missed. \nAs well as the youngest children returning to school, a small number of senior secondary pupils will be allowed into school buildings on a part-time basis to complete work for national qualifications. \nOther age groups will continue to learn from home and it is unlikely they will return to the classroom before 15 March at the earliest. \nIn primary schools measures to minimise the spread of the virus include regular hand-washing, open windows, and 2m physical distancing between adults, and between adults and children. \nStaff will also be offered regular lateral flow tests. \nResources to support learners, teachers and parents during lockdown.\nProf Jason Leitch, the national clinical director, has written to parents asking them to play their part in the safe return.\nHe urged them to: \nAppealing to parents not to relax the rules elsewhere, he reminded them that indoor play dates are not allowed  - though children can play together outside. \nAnd he said parents should continue to work from home if they are able to do so. \nMr Swinney's safety assurance came after an epidemiology expert raised concerns about the knock-on effects of sending children back to school. \nDr Deepti Gurdasani, of Queen Mary University of London, said data from England showed primary school children were two times more likely to be the first Covid case in a household, and once infected were two times more likely to infect their contacts. \nSpeaking to BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show, she said children aged six and above should wear masks in schools and more attention should be paid to ventilation. \nThe EIS teaching union has also raised concerns about school safety and have said a blended learning model - with about half of pupils in classes at any one time - would be more appropriate.

      "text": "The reopening of Scotland's economy - including shops, bars, restaurants, gyms and hairdressers - is expected to start from 26 April, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced.\nShe said it was hoped that the country's stay at home restrictions could be lifted on 5 April.\nFour people from two households will be allowed to meet outdoors from 15 March.\nAll primary pupils and S4 to S6 secondary students could return to school from that date.\nHowever, pupils in the first three years of secondary school are unlikely to return until after the Easter holidays.\nMs Sturgeon said the Scottish government's strategic framework was \"deliberately cautious\" at this stage.\n\"But in the coming weeks, if the data allows and positive trends continue, we will seek to accelerate the easing of restrictions,\" she said.\nHowever, opposition parties said the statement \"fell short\" of expectations and lacked clarity on its \"ultimate goal\", while business leaders called for more detail.\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that shops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality in England could reopen on 12 April.\nUnder a four-step plan to ease lockdown south of the border, all legal limits on social contact could be lifted by 21 June if strict conditions are met.\nMs Sturgeon said the aim in Scotland was to move fully back to a levels system of restrictions from the last week in April.\n\"At that stage, we hope that all parts of the country currently in level four will be able to move out of level four and back initially to level three - possibly with some revision to the content of the levels.\"\nThe first minister said that from 26 April, the government would expect to see a \"phased but significant re-opening of the economy, including non essential retail, hospitality and services like gyms and hairdressers\". \nMore detail will be set out in mid-March, including the order in which parts of the economy will reopen.\nThe aim is for a \"progressive easing\" of the level four restrictions at three-week intervals.\nScotland's youngest children and some senior pupils returned to the classroom on Monday, and Ms Sturgeon said schools were the \"immediate priority\".\nIt is hoped that the next phase will see the remaining primary school pupils return from 15 March, with more senior pupils back in the classroom \"for at least part of their learning\".\nDeputy First Minister John Swinney told Radio Scotland's Drivetime show that this would not just be senior pupils studying for qualifications, and that he wanted to see all S4 to S6 pupils \"back into the school system\" on this date if the data allows.\nThe rules on outdoor mixing would also be relaxed on that date, with up to four people from two households allowed to meet, and non-contact sports for under-18s resuming.\nThe final phase of the return to school would take place from 5 April, a date when school pupils will be at the start or middle of their Easter holiday break. \nIt is also hoped to lift the stay at home restrictions from that date. At least six people from two households should be able to meet together outdoors, and communal worship will be allowed to resume.\nThe timing of major religious festivals - such as Easter - will be taken into account when deciding the exact date.\nThe levels system of restrictions would then be reintroduced from 26 April, along with a \"more substantial\" reopening of society and the economy.\n\"It is important to stress, of course, that all of this depends on us continuing to suppress the virus now - and continuing to accept some trade-offs for a period, for example on international travel,\" said Ms Sturgeon.\n\"However, if we do so, I am optimistic that we can make good progress in returning more normality to our lives and the economy.\"\nAnalysis by Lucy Whyte, BBC Scotland education correspondent\nScotland may have been among the first of the four nations to get any pupils in class, but it looks like it could be one of the last to have all pupils back to in-person learning.\nThis plan could see more children, especially primary pupils, allowed back in the classroom by 15 March, a week after England.\nBut the full return of Scotland's schools might not happen until a month later.\nThe decision to stick with a phased approach will be welcomed by teaching unions, who will also be glad to see the inclusion of blended learning initially for senior pupils.\nThe 5 April date for the potential full return to class is at the start of the Easter holidays for most, so really we are talking about the middle of that month before everyone is back.\nWill the first minister go faster? She has made clear that she will if she can, and there is a precedent when she accelerated the full return to school in August last year.\nOn that occasion she could demonstrate that numbers were on her side.\nThe Scottish Conservatives' Holyrood leader, Ruth Davidson, said the statement \"fell short of public expectations\".\n\"We didn't get information about when measures like social distancing will end and when we will be able to do something as basic as give a loved one a hug,\" she said.\n\"Everyone understands that we might not be able to give people absolute certainty - but they were at least expecting the first minister to give them some kind of hope. \n\"Nothing has been published about what happens after 26 April. This isn't a route map out of Covid, it is holding document.\"\nMs Sturgeon said dates became \"more arbitrary\" the further you looked into the future.\n\"It is like putting your finger in the wind and coming up with a date that is not firmly based in the evidence,\" she said.\nScottish Labour's interim leader, Jackie Baillie, said the statement lacked clarity on its \"ultimate goal\".\nShe also called for a revised testing strategy which includes mass community testing where appropriate.\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie voiced concern that vaccine passports were \"slowly gaining traction\" and said: \"We don't want a two tier society which would exacerbate inequalities.\"\nScottish Green Party co-leader Patrick Harvie also raised fears that vaccine passports could make social inequality worse.\nTracy Black, director of CBI Scotland, said many Scottish businesses would be \"left feeling deflated\" as there was still \"considerable uncertainty\" about how and when they could reopen their doors.\nShe said businesses recognised it was right to take a cautious approach, but \"will have been looking for more detail than the partial timetable that has been provided\".\nLiz Cameron, the chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said: \"It is important that Scotland remains as closely in step with the four nations as is possible.\n\"A competitive disadvantage to business communities elsewhere in the UK will only add insult to the injury already caused by the pandemic.\" \nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Edinburgh,Self-isolation,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A father wants the Scottish government to reconsider its Covid quarantine rules after his son was told he had to isolate in a hotel for 10 days.\nAntonio Caraballo's 10-year-old son Sami, who lives with his mother in Finland, flew to Edinburgh on Saturday to see his father.\nMr Caraballo expected Sami to self-isolate at the family home and filled out pre-flight paperwork accordingly.\nBut on arrival, border officials insisted he had to isolate in a hotel.\nBecause he is a child, Mr Caraballo has had to quarantine with him, at a total cost of more than \u00a32,400.\nThe Scottish government said children under 11 were exempt from having to be tested for Covid-19 on arrival to Scotland, but not from having to stay in a quarantine hotel.\nThe rule means that Sami will spend 10 days of his 14-day visit in a hotel room, and Mr Caraballo, who is a key worker at an oil and gas firm, has to do his work from there.\nMr Caraballo told BBC Scotland: \"Sami lives in Finland with his mother and usually we see a lot of each other, but because of the pandemic, he has not been here since last summer. We didn't see him at Christmas.\n\"We had to balance the risks of my son travelling from a country with a low number of cases to a country with a high number of cases. \n\"But we brought him for his own wellbeing. Now I am so frustrated for him.\"\nSami's parents had organised an extra week off school to add to his week-long half term break known as the \"ski holiday\" in Finland. The school were happy to let him spend time with his family.\nMr Caraballo arrived at the airport to collect his son on Saturday but instead of taking him home to isolate there, ended the day in a quarantine hotel.\n\"I got a call from the border agent,\" he said. \"He said he didn't need a Covid test but he had to go to the hotel. They said because my child is underage an adult would have to go with him. We had to try to book the quarantine hotel online and then my wife and Sami's sister Amelia, who is three, only saw him for five seconds as the two of us were escorted away.\"\nMr Caraballo has tried to appeal against the decision and was given a helpline to call by the hotel staff. Unfortunately this turned out to be an invalid number.\nHe is finding it difficult to speak to anyone who can help.\n\"The most frustrating thing is that there doesn't seem to be anyone who is accountable,\" he said. \"There is no-one to call, no-one to speak to at the hotel.\"\nCoronavirus restrictions on travel and visiting other households in Scotland carry an exemption for shared parenting. People are allowed \"to travel to participate in or facilitate shared parenting or between two parts of an extended household\".\nMr Caraballo feels that when a child is visiting a parent, there should be an exemption, or the ability to self-isolate at home.\nHe said: \"We thought we were doing the right thing flying him into Edinburgh. If we had him arrive in another part of the UK there would have been a loophole.\"\nDifferent rules set by the UK and Scottish governments mean that arrivals to airports in England who travel on to Scotland, do not have to quarantine in a hotel unless they arrive from a country on the red list.\nFor the moment all plans are on hold and Sami will have just three days with his family after the hotel stay.\nA family \"late Christmas dinner\" has been postponed.\nMr Caraballo said Sami was bored and frustrated but is resilient.\nHe added: \"It's just a shame. The whole point of bringing him here was to cheer him up.\"\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \"We understand how difficult this is for families with children, but to manage the risk of importing new variants and to give vaccine deployment the best chance of bringing us closer to normality these limits on international travel are necessary. \n\"The clinical advice is clear that a comprehensive system of managed quarantine is essential to minimise the impact of new Covid-19 variants. This means children must enter managed isolation regardless of whether they are accompanied or unaccompanied. We must restrict how many exemptions are in place otherwise the policy will not be effective.\" \nAre you currently in hotel quarantine?

      "tags": "Space exploration,United States",
      "text": "The first bone cancer survivor to become an astronaut. The first person with a prosthetic body part to visit space. And the youngest American ever to orbit Earth.\nThese are the impressive firsts that could soon be attributable to 29-year-old Hayley Arceneaux. \nIn January, the physician assistant was picked to join the crew of the world's first all-civilian space mission.\nMs Arceneaux was ecstatic but, at first, she had to keep her lips sealed. \n\"I've held onto the biggest secret of my life for a month and a half. So now I get to share it with the world,\" she told the BBC.\nHer selection for the historic mission was announced on Monday by the St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, where Ms Arceneaux was once a cancer patient as a child and now works.\nLater this year, she will launch from Florida on a Falcon 9 rocket made by SpaceX, the company founded by business mogul Elon Musk.\n\"I think this mission is going to inspire people in so many ways,\" Ms Arceneaux said. \"It shows them that anything is possible.\"\nThere will be no professional astronauts on board the spacecraft.\nRather, Ms Arceneaux will be joined by two contest winners and flight commander Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire who is paying for the entire mission.\nThe mission is the pet project of Mr Isaacman, who announced on 1 February that he had bought the rocket launch.\nMr Isaacman is aiming to use the flight to raise $200m (\u00a3142m) for St Jude, half of which he said he will donate himself.\nOf the four available seats on the spacecraft, one was offered to a member of staff at the hospital.\n\"From the start, we wanted a crew member that represented the mission's spirit of hope,\" Mr Isaacman said. \"I can't think of a better person than Hayley to fulfil that responsibility.\"\nFor Ms Arceneaux, the flight will be the realisation of a feat she never thought was possible.\nAt the age of 10, Ms Arceneaux was a bone cancer patient at St Jude. \nAs part of her treatment at the hospital, Ms Arceneaux had chemotherapy and surgery to replace some of her leg bones with artificial ones.\nIn a different era, Ms Arceneaux's prosthetic leg bones would have grounded her ambitions for space travel as a Nasa astronaut, because of the agency's strict medical requirements.\nBut the emergence of private space missions in recent years has enabled more of us to reach for the stars.\n\"Until this mission, I could have never been an astronaut,\" Ms Arceneaux said. \"This mission is opening space travel to people who are not physically perfect.\"\nMs Arceneaux was at home in Tennessee when she got the \"out of the blue\" call on 5 January asking if she would join the mission.\nHer response? \"Immediately, I said, 'yes, yes please'.\"\nAfter checking with her family to \"make sure they were not adamantly opposed\", and her brother and sister-in-law who - as aerospace engineers - \"really reassured me how safe space travel is\", she agreed to join the crew.\nMr Isaacman is planning to select and reveal the remaining two crew members by March.\nOne will be the winner of a sweepstake competition, whose proceeds will be donated to St Jude. \nThe other will go to the winner of a contest which asks entrepreneurs to design an online store using software made by Shift4, Mr Isaacman's payment technology company.\nOnce selected, the crew will undergo a rigorous, months-long training programme, including mission simulations in zero gravity. \nMs Arceneaux -  the flight's medical officer - has already tried on her space suit. It was \"so cool\" but \"heavier than I expected\", she said.\nShe will presumably get used to it by the time the rocket lifts off from Florida's Kennedy Space Center, sometime at the latter end of 2021.\nThen, Ms Arceneaux will be wearing the suit for several days as her spacecraft - a SpaceX Dragon capsule - circles the globe.\nAt the end of the mission, the Dragon will re-enter Earth's atmosphere for a soft-water landing off the east coast of the US.\nAre Ms Arceneaux's nerves jangling?\n\"I'm really not nervous. I've met the lead engineers for every aspect of this mission. I really trust them.\"\nCompared to what she went through as a child, space travel should be no problem.\n\"Getting to represent cancer patients and survivors is an incredible honour. It really wasn't that long ago that I was in their shoes,\" she said.\n\"When you're going through cancer treatment, you're so focused on the day-to-day. It can be really difficult to look toward the future. I hope that this mission will allow them to imagine their future.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new four-step plan to ease England's lockdown could see all legal limits on social contact lifted by 21 June, if strict conditions are met.\nShops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality could reopen on 12 April in England under plans set out by the PM.\nFrom 17 May, two households might be allowed to mix in homes, while the rule of six could apply in places like pubs.\nIt requires four tests on vaccines, infection rates and new coronavirus variants to be met at each stage.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs the plan aimed to be \"cautious but irreversible\" and at every stage decisions would be led by \"data not dates\".\nThere was \"no credible route to a zero-Covid Britain nor indeed a zero-Covid world\", he said.\nMr Johnson later told a Downing Street news conference the coming spring and summer would be \"seasons of hope, looking and feeling incomparably better for us all\".\nHe described the plan as a \"one-way road to freedom\" but said he could not guarantee it would be irreversible \"but the intention is that it should be\".\nIt comes as the first data on the UK's coronavirus vaccine rollout suggested it was having a \"spectacular\" impact on stopping serious illness.\nAs part of the first step of the plan for easing lockdown in England:\nSecondary school pupils can access tests and will be required to wear face coverings in classrooms and shared spaces like corridors.\nThere will be a gap of at least five weeks between each of the plan's subsequent steps to allow for the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed.\nThe second step from 12 April would see major parts of the economy permitted to reopen:\nBut wider social contact rules will continue to apply in all settings - meaning no indoor mixing between different households will be allowed.\nMr Johnson confirmed the end of hospitality curfews - and requirements to eat a substantial meal alongside alcohol.\nHe said a review of international leisure travel restrictions would be announced by 12 April at the earliest.\nFunerals continue with up to 30 people, and weddings with up to 15 guests.\nThe third step will come from 17 May - if the data allows - and will see the \"rule of six\" abolished for outdoor gatherings, replaced with a limit of 30 people:\nUp to 30 people will be able to attend weddings, receptions, funerals and wakes.\nMr Johnson said this step would also \"consider the potential role of Covid status certification\" - which could refer to so-called \"vaccine passports\" - in helping indoor venues to reopen safely.\nBefore the fourth step, ministers will carry out a review into social distancing and other \"long-term measures\" designed to reduce transmission, including the \"one metre plus\" rule and the wearing of face coverings.\nThey will also consider whether to lift the \"work from home\" guidance, which the government says people should continue to follow until the review has been completed.\nThe fourth step from 21 June will potentially see all legal limits on social contact removed, with the final closed sectors of the economy reopened - such as nightclubs.\nThe government hopes that - from this date - restrictions on weddings and funerals will also be abolished.\nMusic and events leaders called for more financial support for the sector, with the boss of one live music trade body saying his industry is \"at the back of the queue to re-open\" once restrictions are lifted.\nMPs will vote on the roadmap in late March.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the plan but said certainty was needed over the future of the government furlough scheme for both businesses and workers.\nProf Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, said he thought the roadmap struck the \"right balance\" - but warned reopening schools risks increasing the number of cases reported each day.\nSpeaking later at the Downing Street briefing, UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was \"very important\" to leave a gap of five weeks between the changes in the roadmap to avoid \"flying blind\".\nSir Patrick also said \"baseline\" measures - such as face coverings in certain situations, hand washing, and self-isolation - may be necessary next winter.\nThe vaccines are working well and infection levels have fallen to a fifth of what they were since the start of the year.\nSo why, many may ask, is there such caution?\nThe answer lies in the mountain of data published by the government as it unveiled its roadmap.\nAmong the documents was modelling done by Imperial College London.\nIt showed a rapid easing of restrictions could lead to surge in deaths over the summer and a total of 80,000 deaths by the middle of 2022.\nThere is much uncertainty about scenarios like this - for one thing it did not take into account any seasonal impact that the warmer weather could bring by reducing spread of the virus.\nThe gradual lifting could, by comparison, reduce that to around 30,000. That would bring it in line with the sort of deaths we could see during a bad flu winter.\nUK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty says that should be the context in which we judge Covid now.\nThe devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions but have largely moved in the same direction, though at different speeds, during the pandemic.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland would return to a tiered system of restrictions when lockdown measures are eased.\nIt means different parts of the country could be under different rules. Ms Sturgeon added that she would set out the likely phases for a gradual lifting of restrictions on Tuesday. \nIn Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he hopes the \"stay-at-home\" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. \nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster wants its executive to discuss the reopening date for schools following Mr Johnson's announcement in England.\nThe prime minister addressed the 1922 backbench committee of Conservative MPs tonight.\nHe faced criticism of what some saw as slow progress in removing restrictions.\nOne participant suggested he was talking \"gibberish\" when he compared his routemap to a motorway journey.\nAnother said the PM had been \"rattled\".\nWhat annoyed some MPs was an apparent lack of flexibility in the plan with restrictions not being lifted \"before\" certain dates.\nHe was urged to keep open the possibility of bringing these dates forward if data allowed but there was \"no backtracking\" on the five-week wait between steps.\nThe prime minister also said that \"a debate had to be had\" on domestic vaccine passport certificates.\nIt came as a further 10,641 coronavirus cases were reported on Monday, alongside another 178 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nMore than 17.7 million people across the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, according to latest government figures."

This lacks respect and tact.\"\nShe also shared a message of support from basketball star Candace Parker, who wrote: \"I'm sorry you and your girls continually have to deal with [expletive] like this. It's not fair it's not right.\"\nMeek Mill, whose real name is Robert Rihmeek Williams, appeared to respond on Twitter, writing: \"[Expletive] your feelings\".\n\"I don't think we on the same signal y'all... I don't see what y'all see.\"\nHe subsequently clarified that these tweets were not aimed at Bryant and her family.\n\"I apologised to her in private earlier today not to the public,\" he wrote. \"Nothing I say on my [Twitter] page [is] directed to an internet viral moment or the family of a grieving woman! If you care about someone grieving, change the subject!\"\nMill's song, a collaboration with fellow rapper Lil Baby surfaced online last week. \nIt is not clear how the track leaked, and it has now been deleted from social media and YouTube.\nThe rapper initially suggested his lyrics had been misinterpreted. \n\"Somebody promo a narrative and y'all follow it\u2026. y'all internet antics cannot stop me,\" he wrote. \"They paying to influence y'all now \u2026 its almost like mind control 'wake up.'\"\nThe rapper previously petitioned the National Basketball Association to change its logo to a silhouette of the Black Mamba to honour Bryant.\nThe sportsman, a five-time NBA champion, played for the LA Lakers throughout his career and is considered one of the greatest players in the game's history.\nHe was on his way to a tournament in Thousand Oaks last January when the helicopter he was in crashed into a hill just north of Los Angeles.\nEarlier this month, US safety investigators said the pilot had probably become disorientated amid fog.\nIn its official finding, The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said Ara Zobayan, who also died in the crash, told air traffic controllers the helicopter was climbing out of heavy cloud when it was actually descending.\n\"This manoeuvre is consistent with the pilot experiencing spatial disorientation in limited visibility conditions,\" said NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt.\n\"We are talking about spatial disorientation where literally the pilot may not know which way is up or down, whether he or she is leaning left or right.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Jason Leitch,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The first minister has confirmed that Scotland will be in full lockdown until \"at least\" the end of February.\nNicola Sturgeon said the current restrictions were working, but added the level of Covid infections clearly remained \"too high\".\nHow much progress does Scotland need to make before lockdown can begin to be eased?\nScotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, has talked about using World Health Organisation (WHO) indicators when calculating the level of Covid-19 transmission in the country.\nHe told BBC Scotland this week that the Scottish government was aiming to get the number of cases below 50 per 100,000 people and the percentage of people testing positive under 5% before it would consider relaxing restrictions.\nDoing both of these things would put Scotland in the WHO's \"level 2\" category of community transmission, where it's judged there is a \"moderate incidence\" of locally acquired infections.\nThe WHO's seven categories range from \"no active cases\" to \"level 4\" community transmission, when the general population is at high risk of being infected.\nIn the organisation's guidance on implementing measures to control Covid-19, the WHO also lists two other ways of calculating the levels of Covid in a population: hospital admissions and death rates.\nGovernments using this guidance will balance these indicators against the other health harms and economic impacts caused by lockdown measures.\nIt's also likely the Scottish government would want to see rates remain below the WHO thresholds for sustained periods, rather than briefly dipping below the line.\nThe WHO advises governments to look at their weekly confirmed cases per 100,000 people and then average the figure out over a 14-day period.\nBy this measure, Scotland had a rate of 165 cases per 100,000 people on 2 February.\nThere's been a sustained decline in this figure since the middle of January, but the rate is still well above the WHO's level 2 threshold of 50.\nThe last time Scotland was below 50 cases per 100,000 was at the beginning of October.\nIt's difficult to compare this rate with the first outbreak in the spring as there was no mass testing earlier in the pandemic.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe figure it's aiming for is 5%, which again would put Scotland in the WHO's \"level 2\" of community transmission.\nLike infection rates, the number is declining, but there's still some way to go.\nThe WHO says governments should look at the number of weekly deaths \"attributed\" to Covid-19 per 100,000 people and average them out over 14 days.\nA death rate of two per 100,000 people or less needs to be achieved to indicate \"level 2\" community transmission, according to the WHO.\nThis chart counts deaths in Scotland within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19. If the wider definition of all death certificates mentioning the virus were used, the rate would be slightly higher.\nThe rate in Scotland is currently just over seven and has not yet begun to decline.\nThe full lockdown in the spring ended on 28 May, although the easing of restrictions was phased over several weeks during the summer.\nFigures on Covid-19 hospital admissions are currently available up to 22 January, when the 14-day average of weekly admissions was 22.\nThe WHO threshold in this instance is 10 cases per 100,000.\nThe 14-day average has not yet begun to decline significantly, but daily admissions appear to have peaked on 11 January, according to Public Health Scotland figures.\nIn the spring, the decline in infection rates was followed by a decline in hospital admissions and finally a fall death rates.\nIf this pattern is repeated, then a corner may have been turned in this second wave - but there is still a long way to go before the rates of infections, hospital admissions and deaths are where the Scottish government would like them to be.\nIn the world race to vaccinate, Israel is out in front after giving first jabs to more than half its adult population. So, what are we learning from their mass vaccination programme?\nAssessments by the Israeli Ministry of Health (MoH) report signs that infection and illness in the over-60s is being driven down. The fall appears to be most pronounced in older people and areas furthest ahead in their immunisation efforts. This suggests it is the vaccine, and not just the country's current lockdown, taking effect.\nThe MoH data suggests infections and illnesses fell consistently from 14 days after receiving a first jab onwards.\nIn Scotland just under 14% of those aged over 16 have had an injection with England at more than 18%; Wales at nearly 17% and Northern Ireland at 15.59%.\nInfectious disease specialist Dr Susan Hopkins told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme on Sunday that the UK should see its vaccination programme, which began on 8 December, reducing Covid illness within the next fortnight.\nWhile the current vaccines are said to be highly effective in preventing severe sickness in individuals there had been less assurance over whether they could prevent virus transmissibility. However, early research on the Oxford-AstraZenenca vaccine points to good news. \nThe results of a study, which has not yet been formally published, suggest that the vaccine may have a \"substantial\" effect on transmission of the virus.\nIt means the jab could have a greater impact on the pandemic, as each person who receives it will indirectly protect others too.\nAs well as showing an effect on transmission, the study found the vaccine offered 76% effective protection from a single dose for three months.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

Prosecutors formally placed Mr Depardieu under investigation in December 2020. \nHe is free but under judicial supervision. \nThe woman's lawyer, Elodie Tuaillon-Hibon, told AFP she hoped her client's \"private sphere\" would be respected as the case unfolded.\nAble to combine bearish physicality with emotional delicacy on screen, he has appeared in some 170 films, getting his big break in 1973 with Les Valseuses (Going Places).\nHe won the best actor award for Cyrano at Cannes in 1990, and was nominated for an Oscar for the same role.\nGreen Card, an English-language comedy made the same year, brought him further acclaim outside the French-speaking world.  \nOff-screen, he made headlines in recent years for attacking French tax laws, moving to Belgium in protest. \nIn 2013, he took Russian citizenship, with his decree of naturalisation signed personally by President Vladimir Putin.

      "text": "The wife of jailed Mexican drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n has been arrested in the US on suspicion of drug trafficking, US authorities say.\nEmma Coronel Aispuro, 31, was detained at Dulles International Airport outside Washington DC.\nShe is charged with participating in a conspiracy to distribute heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana.\nGuzm\u00e1n is currently serving a life sentence in Colorado for drug trafficking and money laundering.\nThe 63-year-old is a former head of the Sinaloa cartel, which officials say was the biggest supplier of drugs to the US.\nHis trial in 2019 heard shocking revelations about his life, from drugging and raping girls as young as 13 to carrying out the cold-blooded murders of former cartel members and rivals. \nMs Coronel Aispuro appeared via video link before a federal judge at a court in Washington DC on Tuesday and was ordered to remain in detention for the time being.\nProsecutor Anthony Nardozzi said Ms Coronel Aispuro had \"worked closely\" with members of the Sinaloa cartel and had possessed the \"financial means to generate a serious risk of flight\".\nAs well as facing drug trafficking charges, she is also accused of conspiring with others to help her husband escape from prison in Mexico in 2015.\nHe was sprung from Mexico's maximum-security Altiplano prison after his sons bought a property near the prison and a GPS watch smuggled into the prison gave diggers his exact location. He escaped by riding a specially adapted small motorcycle through the tunnel.\nCourt documents said Ms Coronel Aispuro was allegedly involved in planning another prison escape for her husband before he was extradited to the US in January 2017.\nShe has not commented on the charges.\nMexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said the arrest was \"a matter that the United States will decide\" but added that he hoped the US would share more of the details. \nMs Coronel Aispuro is a dual US-Mexico citizen, a former beauty pageant winner and journalism student, and the mother of twins with Guzm\u00e1n. According to previous interviews gave to US media, she first met Guzm\u00e1n at a dance when she was 17 and he was 49. \nShe attended nearly every day of her husband's three-month trial in New York, during which she heard not only grim accounts of murder and rape, but also claims he had spied on her and other mistresses. \nShe came under the media spotlight during that trial. In one instance, she appeared to laugh during the tearful testimony of one of Guzm\u00e1n's mistresses. On another day she and Guzm\u00e1n wore similar velvet jackets, which many people interpreted as a show of solidarity.\nShe remained supportive of Guzm\u00e1n throughout, saying at the end of the trial: \"I don't know my husband as the person they are trying to show him as, but rather I admire him as the human being that I met, and the one that I married.\"\nGuzm\u00e1n came from a poor family in Sinaloa state, north-west Mexico. His organised crime business grew so big that he entered Forbes' 2009 list of the world's richest men at number 701, with an estimated worth of $1bn (\u00a3709m)."

      "tags": "Aviation accidents and incidents,Boeing,Aviation safety,United Airlines,Air travel",
      "text": "One of the fan blades in the plane engine that failed shortly after take-off in Denver showed signs of metal fatigue, investigators say.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said the blade would undergo further examinations.\nFlight 328 was able to make an emergency landing at Denver airport on Saturday, but parts of the engine fell on homes. No-one was hurt.\nBoeing has recommended grounding all its 777 aircraft with the same engines.\nIt said 128 jets should be suspended until inspections had been carried out. United Airlines, Egyptair, and operators in Japan and South Korea have all said they will not be flying their Boeing-777s.\nThe NTSB said late on Monday that two fan blades on Flight 328's Pratt & Whitney engine had broken. One of them showed signs of metal fatigue, and investigators believe it broke off and chipped the second blade.\nNTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said the blades would be flown to a Pratt & Whitney laboratory for further examination by NTSB safety inspectors.\n\"Our mission is to understand what happened and why it happened so that we can keep this from happening again,\" he said.\nUnited Flight 328 was carrying 231 passengers bound for Honolulu when it suffered a failure in its right-hand engine. Passengers on board the Denver flight described a \"large explosion\" shortly after take-off and the plane began shaking violently and losing altitude.\nFortunately the plane was able to return safely to Denver airport but debris from the engine was found scattered over a residential area in nearby Broomfield town. Fragments were found on a football field and what appeared to be the front of an engine-casing landed in the front garden of a home.\nOn the same day as the Denver incident, an engine failure on a 30-year-old Boeing 747 freighter saw debris fall on a town in the Netherlands. Parts of what appeared to be turbine blades landed on the town of Meerssen, with one blade found embedded in a car roof, according to Reuters. Two people on the ground, one a child, were slightly injured.\nThe aircraft, which had left Maastricht bound for New York, landed safely in Liege in neighbouring Belgium.\nAircraft engine failures are rare. Uncontained failures, where debris can erupt from the engine in any direction are mercifully very rare indeed. But an uncontained failure is also much more dangerous.\nA modern twin-engine airliner is designed to be able to fly safely for hours using a single engine.\nThe shrapnel from an uncontained failure, however, can cause serious damage to the rest of the plane, and if it passes through the cabin, it can be lethal. Experts say the failure in the Denver incident appears to have been uncontained, but the damage to the aircraft itself was thankfully minor.\nAlso worrying is that the incident itself appears to have a number of similarities with another failure that occurred on a United Airlines flight in 2018.\nIf the cause in this case is found to be the same - and remember, it may not be - that would raise questions about why the response to that incident from the manufacturer and regulators was unable to prevent a repeat.\nSaturday's engine failures are another blow for Boeing after its 737 Max aircraft was grounded for 18 months following two aviation accidents that left 346 people dead.\nLast December a Japan Airlines 777 flight was forced to return to Naha Airport due to a malfunction in the left engine - the plane is the same age as the 26-year-old United Airlines plane from Saturday's incident. \nIn 2018, the right engine of a United Airlines plane broke shortly before it landed in Honolulu. Following an investigation, the NTSB said the incident was caused by a full-length fan blade fracture. "

Then he uttered the words that we never really want to hear on an online lesson: 'My dad is having a seizure.\"\nMr Cannon-Jones lives in Cardiff, a 30-minute drive from where the boy, Rhys, lives.\n\"I felt utterly helpless because I'm so far away, but I had to do something,\" he explained.\n\"First, I asked Rhys to remain calm. At this point I could hear dad in the background was having difficulties breathing.\"\nYou may also be interested in:\nMr Cannon-Jones' attention then turned to making sure the other children on the call, watching a \"show and tell\", could not see or hear what was going on.\nHe asked Rhys if he could call any family living nearby, and called the school himself to see if staff were available to go to the boy's home.\n\"As the situation developed, they had managed to get hold of grandpa who had come around and was assisting,\" said Mr Cannon-Jones.\n\"Then about five minutes later or so, the child came back on the video call to say dad was okay, they had managed to get him on the sofa, he was comfortable and was breathing normally.\"\nHe added: \"That was a huge relief.\"\nAsked how he managed to remain calm, Mr Cannon-Jones said: \"Honestly, I don't know. In the moment my teacher brain activated - the calm kicked in and I just did what I felt like I had to do.\"\nTeachers have been using video call technology to deliver lessons since schools closed were shut in December amid a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases, with the youngest children returning to classrooms on Monday in a phased reopening of schools.\nThe episode, on February 10, was not the first time Rhys's father, Dean Williamson, has had a seizure, having developed epilepsy following surgery for a brain tumour in 2018.\nMr Williamson said the last thing he remembered was being on his knees looking for a card.\n\"My eldest son said, 'I'm going to ring my mum', but she wasn't answering. Then James tried his nanny. She said she would ring his bampy [grandfather] and luckily he was doing some work at my cousin's house which is near here.\"\nJames said he had done his best to help his father when he collapsed. \n\"I managed to lift him up, then I kept on trying to call my mum,\" he said.\n\"I felt like I was able to do it but I think Rhys felt way too scared to come [too close].\"\nMr Williamson was full of praise for his sons and everyone who helped that day, reserving special mention for the school.\n\"The boys were amazing and the school have been fantastic. They looked after James and Rhys the next day as they went into school.\n\"The headmaster called [my wife] Claire and said they were looking to recognise how Mr Cannon-Jones reacted.\""

      "text": "Secondary school pupils could all be back in school after the Easter break, the Welsh Government says.\nEducation Minister Kirsty Williams said it was \"her preference\" older pupils return after the holidays, which end on 12 April.\nThe news comes as three-to-seven year olds return to classrooms in Wales in a phased return to face-to-face teaching.\nOther primary pupils, and years 11 and 13, are due to return on 15 March if Covid case rates continue to fall.\nHowever, on Anglesey, the return has been delayed until 1 March, with the infection rate on the island the highest in Wales - 112.8 cases per 100,000 people, compared to a national average of 80 per 100,000. \nIn England, all schools are expected to reopen from 8 March, but a more phased approach is planned in Wales.\nMs Williams told a press conference her plans for schools were \"consistent with UK-wide advice\".\nThe Welsh Conservatives said many parents would be \"frustrated\" and questioned why some other sectors, such as non-essential retail, were earmarked for opening before all pupils go back.\nPlaid Cymru backed the phased return, but the NAHT union said suggestions of an Easter return were \"premature\". \nMs Williams had said on Sunday she hoped more pupils would return if cases continued falling.\nMeanwhile, pupils in years 11 and 13, and those in further education settings, will be tested twice a week, alongside education staff.\nThe Covid case rate in Wales is currently 80 per 100,000 people - the lowest of the UK nations - and Wales' R number is between 0.7 and 0.9, Public Health Wales estimates.\nUnder current proposals non-essential Welsh retailers may begin reopening from 15 March, which is before the bulk of secondary school pupils return.\nAsked about this, Ms Williams said the Welsh Government would \"balance needs\" for the entire population when lifting restrictions. \nThe government would \"use what available headroom we have to prioritise children and young people - that will not change\", she said.\nBut, there \"may be other headroom that allows us to do other things\".\nA decision on when older pupils can return will be taken before the Easter holidays.\nStudents in years with exams may return from 15 March, but Ms Williams said it would not \"necessarily be a return to full time on-site learning\".\n\"That potentially is looking at rotas, cutting class sizes, different types of timetabling so that children can get the face to face contact that they need, but looks to minimise the impact of opening up on the overall public health situation,\" the minister added.\nLisa Freeman's four-year-old son Ethan was returning to his reception class at Ysgol Hamadryad in Cardiff.\nShe said he was \"very nervous\" and he did not really talk about going back to school, so they had \"broached the subject slowly\".\n\"He's struggled with the online lessons,\" Ms Freeman said.\n\"I think, as a four-year-old, being sat behind a computer screen has been very difficult for him. He just didn't engage as much as we would have like him to.\"\nMs Freeman said she was concerned there would be further school closures as it had \"very much affected him\".\n\"Hopefully this is the last time - I think it would be really harmful to pull him out of school again,\" she said.\n\"He hasn't left my side since the beginning of December really. I think it's quite frightening, we try to keep the news off as much as possible [around him].\n\"Just to be around his peers I think is huge for his age group.\"\nVictoria Rosser, from Cwmbran, whose five-year-old son will return on Thursday, said she was not sure if it was the right time for children to return.\n\"I'm a little anxious as I'm a shielding parent who hasn't received the second vaccine, however, I feel more confident than I did in September,\" she said.\nMs Rosser, a former teacher, said her son was excited but also \"a little nervous\" to return to school.\n\"Even though he's in Year 1, he's only spent just over half a year in school,\" she said.\n\"Children of similar age, who haven't had the opportunity to learn at home, could have had changes made to their neuro pathways forever. \n\"So even though I'm scared to send my son back to school, I will, because we are yet to learn the damage it has done to them.\"\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said many parents will be \"frustrated\" after hearing that some students will not return to school until after Easter.\nThe party's education spokeswoman Suzy Davie added the Welsh Government \"can't really claim to have school students as its priority when it eases other restrictions before the return of all pupils to the classroom\".\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price repeated his call for teachers to be vaccinated.\nBut he added: \"I think the Welsh approach, which is also the Scottish and the Northern Irish one, is the right one and that's taking it in a step by step cautious way rather than doing it all at once\".\nBut Laura Doel, director of headteachers union NAHT Cymru, said ministers should guard against moving too quickly.\n\"Given that many schools are only reopening their doors to foundation phase this week, we need to be careful about giving parents and learners false hope,\" she said. \n\"Statements about a full return after Easter are premature and unhelpful at this stage.\"\nThe Welsh Government said under the current circumstances punitive measures, including fines, would not be appropriate.\nIt said some authorities might deem it necessary to pursue \"a small number of cases relating to persistent absence\" which were unrelated to the pandemic and where there were concerns about the welfare of the child. \nTeaching staff will now be tested twice weekly for Covid, and \u00a35m will be spent on face coverings and other equipment.\nTy Golding - head teacher at Ysgol y Ddraig in Llantwit Major and Holton Primary School in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan - said his staff were \"excited\" at returning to school and \"addressing those wellbeing and learning needs\".\nBut he acknowledged some parents and staff still needed reassuring.\n\"The biggest challenge for us - which hopefully will be incident-free and quiet and all about settling back in - is winning hearts and minds in the community with parents and staff, making sure everyone feels safe and secure,\" he told BBC Radio Wales..\nAsked whether he felt teachers and school staff should be prioritised for a Covid-19 vaccine, Mr Golding said he did, adding it was important they felt \"a sense of prioritisation\".\nMinisters said children aged three to seven had been prioritised to return to school first, due to evidence showing Covid spread less quickly among the youngest children, who can also be more difficult to teach remotely.\nThe Welsh Government had said it expected to see pupils returning from Monday but it would be \"done in a phased and progressive way\".\nPrimary schools in some parts of north Wales have said they would not have children back until later in the week, after concerns over higher case rates.\nWrexham, Anglesey, Denbighshire, Gwynedd and Flintshire are delaying the immediate return of younger pupils - with pupils back in class by Friday.\nCeredigion, the county in Wales with the lowest case rate, is also operating a phased return where children will attend for one day in the first week with a full return expected from 3 March.\nMs Williams said at the weekend the next Welsh Government review would look at whether older exam year pupils could return, alongside the remaining primary school year groups. That includes Years 11 and 13, and college students.\nIn the same interview Ms Williams said: \"Our priority will be to use whatever headroom we have to maximise face-to-face learning for Years 11 and 13, and many head teachers that we're consulting with would like some flexibility to get some Year 10 and Year 12 students in as well.\n\"But we might have to do that on a routine basis, allowing us to cut the number of children in the class down, helping to keep those schools as Covid-secure as possible.\"\nMs Williams also said some university students were due to return to campus this week for practical assessments.\nShe said the Welsh Government was working with universities \"to bring back students when it's safe and appropriate to do\"."

      "tags": "Companies,Social media,Apps,Cyber-security",
      "text": "Audio-only social network Clubhouse has confirmed that a user managed to stream content from the app on their website.\nThe app allows users to participate in public or private audio chatrooms, promising that the content has to be experienced live and is not recorded.\nUS cyber-security researchers said a user found a way to stream feeds from multiple chatrooms on Sunday.\nClubhouse confirmed the spill, which is when data is released to a place that is not authorised to have access to it.\nThe firm told Bloomberg it had banned the user and installed new \"safeguards\" to prevent conversations from being streamed again.\nClubhouse told the BBC that recording or streaming without the explicit permission of the speakers violates the app's terms and conditions.\nA spokeswoman said: \"Over the weekend, an individual temporarily streamed multiple rooms from their own feed to a website. \n\"This individual's account has been permanently banned from the service and we have added additional safeguards to prevent people from doing this in the future.\"\nStanford University's Internet Observatory reported the incident first, but the programme's chief technology officer David Thiel stressed that the data spill was not malicious or a \"hack\". Instead, he said that it seemed a user had decided to violate Clubhouse's terms.\nAustralian cyber-security researcher Robert Potter, who built the Washington Post's cyber-security operations centre, agrees. \nHe explained that a \"data spillage\" was different to a \"data breach\", in that data breaches are deliberate and usually carried out by someone hacking into a system to steal data.\nA data spillage, on the other hand, is an incident whereby confidential information is released into an environment that is not authorised to have access to the information.\nAccording to him, the incident occurred because a user had realised that it was possible to be in multiple chatrooms at once.\nBy understanding how this worked, the user could connect a Clubhouse API to his website, and essentially \"share\" his login remotely with anyone on the internet who wanted to listen to the audio chats from the app.\n\"If you're popular, people will make a third-party app that scrapes data from the service, for example all the third-party programs that scrape information from Twitter,\" Mr Potter told the BBC.\nSunday's incident comes after Clubhouse made assurances that user data couldn't be stolen by cyber-criminals or state-sponsored hackers, in response to a warning from Stanford University's Internet Observatory, which is headed by Facebook's former security chief Alex Stamos.\nStanford's cyber-security researchers discovered several security flaws, including the fact that the users' unique ID numbers and the ID numbers of the Clubhouse chatrooms they created were being transmitted in plaintext and it could be possible connect IDs to specific user profiles.\nThe researchers were also concerned that the Chinese government could gain access to the raw audio files on Clubhouse's servers, because its back-end infrastructure is provided by a real-time engagement API firm called Agora, which has offices in both Shanghai and San Francisco. \nWhen Agora went public on Wall Street in June, it mentioned in its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that in China it would be required \"to provide assistance and support in accordance with the law for public security and national security authorities to protect national security or assist with criminal investigations\".\nStanford Internet Observatory informed Clubhouse about the security flaws and on 12 February said that it was working with the app firm to improve its security. \nWhile it might sound alarming to hear that audio conversations on Clubhouse can be taken out of the app, this isn't exactly new.\nUsers are already using the video and audio recording functions on their devices to capture conversations had by celebrities like Elon Musk and Kevin Hart, and uploading them to YouTube. \nAgain, this is against the app's terms of service, but it does mean that no-one should expect their conversations to actually be private, warns Mr Thiel.\n\"Consider Clubhouse chats to be semi-public, given issues with Agora and the fact we all have microphones,\" he tweeted.\nMr Potter thinks the problem is more that Clubhouse is young and still immature as a service.\n\"I feel like there's a bunch of users who got really enthusiastic because it's a new thing and because you need an invitation, the conversations must be private,\" he said. \n\"It happened with Zoom and Tiktok - again and again, we see an app that has really high growth, it goes viral, and then they have a privacy problem, or they find lots of problems that weren't so big a deal when they were smaller, and cyber-security comes later.\"\nHe added that consumers needed to be realistic about what services do with their data.\n\"I think people just need to realise that the privacy and cyber-security of newer social media platforms isn't going to be as good as mature ones,\" said Mr Potter. \n\"If you're going to be an early adopter and try out new apps and new smartphones, there's going to be bugs.\""

      "text": "The death of an MI6 agent whose naked body was found inside a locked holdall at his London flat is to be reviewed.\nMetropolitan Police investigators said new information about Gareth Williams, who died in 2010, had come to light.\nThe body of Mr Williams, from Anglesey, was discovered at his Pimlico flat, and a coroner later concluded he was unlawfully killed. \nA year later, in 2013, the Met concluded the 31-year-old had died as a result of an accident.\nAt the 2012 inquest into Mr Williams' death, coroner Fiona Wilcox reached her conclusion based \"on the balance of probabilities\".\n\"[However] most of the fundamental questions in relation to how Gareth died remain unanswered,\" she said. \nThe Sunday Times has now reported a scientist believes DNA profiling advances meant it may now be possible to get fresh information from a single hair found at the flat where Mr Williams was discovered dead, on August 23, 2010.\n\"There is an established review process for investigations whereby new information and/or forensic opportunities are considered,\" a Metropolitan Police spokesman said.\n\"At this stage no forensic review has been commissioned.\n\"However, the MPS is reviewing this new information and will assess whether there are any new investigative opportunities in this case.\"\nIn 2013, Mr Williams' family said they stood by the coroner's findings.\n\"We are naturally disappointed that it is still not possible to state with certainty how Gareth died and the fact that the circumstances of his death are still unknown adds to our grief,\" they said, in a statement at the time.\n\"We consider that on the basis of the facts at present known, the coroner's verdict accurately reflects the circumstances of Gareth's death.\"\nLater that year the Met concluded a three-year investigation into Mr Williams' death.\nAt that time, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt said he was satisfied it was \"theoretically possible\" Mr Williams could have padlocked the bag from the inside, although \"many questions remain unanswered\" as to the circumstances of his death.\nBut he said there was no evidence the MI6 officer had intended to take his own life or his death was connected to his work.\nThere were 10 to 15 DNA traces in the flat from which it was not possible to gain full profiles, but all other DNA profiles and fingerprints had been eliminated, said DAC Hewitt.\nHe acknowledged the coroner, having studied \"all the evidence available at that stage\", had made \"the logical inference that it was more likely someone else was involved in Gareth's death\".\n\"At the end of our investigation, based on the evidence, or where we have been unable to find positive evidence, we believe that it is a more probable conclusion that there was no other person present when Gareth died,\" Mr Hewitt said.\n\"But the reality is that for both hypotheses, there exist evidential contradictions and gaps in our understanding.\"\nHamish Campbell, the detective who led the initial inquiry, told the Sunday Times he suspects Mr Williams' death was linked to his private life and not connected to his work."

      "text": "\"Climate change is a threat to our security,\" Boris Johnson told world leaders as he chaired a United Nations Security Council session.\nIt is the first time a British PM has chaired such a meeting since 1992.\nOther speakers included broadcaster Sir David Attenborough, UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and Sudanese climate activist Nisreen Elsaim.\nThe UK holds the presidency of the Security Council this month and hosts the COP26 climate summit in November.\nThe summit in Glasgow will be attended by dozens of world leaders and is likely to be the most significant round of talks since the global Paris Agreement to tackle climate change was secured in 2015.\nAt the council meeting, Mr Johnson said some would argue \"all this green stuff from a bunch of tree-hugging tofu-munchers\" is not a suitable subject for a UN meeting.\n\"I couldn't disagree more profoundly,\" he said adding that the council need to act to protect \"peace, security and stability\" around the world.\n\"Whether you like it or not it is a matter of when, not if, your country and your people will have to deal with the security impact of climate change,\" he said.\nHe also highlighted measures the UK was taking to reduce emissions and stressed the importance of helping vulnerable countries \"adapt and build resilience\".\nA Greenpeace spokesperson accused the PM of \"weapons-grade hypocrisy\" for demanding action while \"planning new coal mines at home and stripping funds for carbon-cutting energy efficiency measures\". \n\"Until the government starts taking the prime minister's advice, his climate leadership will lack any credibility,\" they said.\nThis is the latest in a series of prime ministerial rallying calls on climate change. \nThe year is providing a remarkable stage for Boris Johnson's ambition on the topic - from the Security Council to the chairmanship of G7 in June, culminating in the vital Glasgow climate summit in November.\nBut as he bestrides the global stage, the PM is under fire for his performance at home.\nHis crucial project to cut emissions from home heating - the Green Homes Grant - is in disarray, with the chancellor pulling out funds.\nHis government is building the high-speed rail HS2, which is likely to be adding to carbon emissions until the back half of the century. And he's promoting a \u00a327bn road-building programme.\nWhat's more, the PM is risking his international reputation by permitting a new coal mine in Cumbria while urging other nations to relinquish coal. \nEnvironmentalists say it's time for him to match words with deeds.\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin\nSpeaking at the start of the meeting, Sir David said climate change posed \"threats to security of a new and unprecedented kind\".\nHe said changes in patterns of weather would \"turn forests into deserts and drown great cities\".\nAnd he warned that the world is \"perilously close to tipping points that once past will send global temperatures spiralling catastrophically higher\".\n\"If we continue on this path we will face the collapse of everything that gives us our security - food production, access to water, ambient temperatures and ocean food chains,\" he said.\nHowever he also said the COP26 conference, new technologies and public support for change offered \"grounds for hope\".\nMs Elsaim - who chairs the UN's Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change - told the meeting that her country of Sudan was top of the list \"when it comes to climate instability\". \nShe said drought and food insecurity would lead to large-scale migration making \"conflict inevitable\".\nThe UN Security Council is made up of five permanent members  - China, France, Russia, the UK and the US - and 10 non-permanent members elected for two-year terms.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Everybody has to \"play their part\" to meet the dates for England's lockdown to be eased, Matt Hancock has said.\nBut it is currently \"too early\" to say how long social distancing will be in place, the health secretary said. \nThe aim is for measures like masks to become a \"matter of personal responsibility\", rather than law, in the future.\nBoris Johnson has outlined a strategy that could see restrictions lifted by 21 June - if strict conditions are met. \nNicola Sturgeon is to reveal plans to ease restrictions in Scotland later.\nShe has said Scotland will return to a tiered system, meaning different parts of the country could be under different rules. \nThe health secretary told the BBC it is \"vital\" that \"everybody plays their part\" to make sure \"that we hit these dates and get out of this as soon as we possibly can, safely\".  \nPeople should be able to hug friends and family from 17 May, when the most vulnerable groups have had two coronavirus vaccine jabs, he said. \nMr Hancock said eradicating Covid-19 completely is \"not going to be possible\" and that everyone would have to \"learn to live with it\", as we do with flu. \nHe said he wanted measures to become a \"matter of personal responsibility and social norms\" that could see people choosing to wear masks on public transport, for example.\nThere is already evidence that the vaccines were working, with the number of deaths \"coming down really sharply\", he added. \nHe urged people to take up their vaccine offer, amid warnings the virus could persist in inner city communities where uptake is low. \nDr Mike Tildesley, reader in mathematical modelling of infectious diseases at the University of Warwick and member of government advisory group SPI-M, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this was a \"real concern\". \n\"It's really important that we get the vaccines out to those deprived communities to prevent a potential wave of infections occurring as we do unlock,\" he added. \nMr Hancock said it is \"absolutely on all of us\" to get the vaccine when invited. \nThe latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show coronavirus deaths continue to decline. In the week of 12 February, there were 17,136 deaths registered in the UK, down by 1,710 on the previous week. \nDeaths are still running above usual levels for this time of year, however. They were 26% higher than the average for the same week over the past five years. \nIn the first step of the prime minister's roadmap, all pupils in England's schools are expected to return to class from 8 March, with mass testing and wider use of face masks in secondary schools.\nThere will be a further easing on 29 March, with groups of up to six people or two households allowed to gather in parks and gardens.\nShops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality, as well as self-contained holiday accommodation, could reopen on 12 April. A review of international leisure travel restrictions will be completed by this date.  \nFrom 17 May, two households or a group of six may be able to meet indoors in a pub or other hospitality venue such as restaurants.\nCinemas, museums, hotels, performances and sporting events will also reopen, with up to 30 people able to attend weddings, receptions, funerals and wakes.\nThe final step from 21 June will potentially see all legal limits on social contact removed, with the final closed sectors of the economy reopened - such as nightclubs.\nProgressing along the schedule will depend on four tests: the success of the vaccine rollout, evidence of vaccine efficacy, an assessment of new variants, and keeping infection rates below a level that could put unsustainable pressure on the NHS.\nThere will be a gap of at least five weeks between each of the plan's subsequent steps to allow for the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed. \nOn Monday, Mr Johnson told a Downing Street news conference he could not guarantee his plan would be irreversible \"but the intention is that it should be\".\nHe added that the coming spring and summer would be \"seasons of hope, looking and feeling incomparably better for us all\".\nAs part of its plans, the government wants to determine whether offering \"Covid status\" certificates, which could be used by people to demonstrate they had received a vaccine or a negative coronavirus test, could help venues open again.  \nMr Johnson acknowledged there were \"clearly some quite complex issues, some ethical issues\" but later told a meeting of his own MPs that \"a debate had to be had\". \nMPs will vote on the roadmap in late March. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the plan but said certainty was needed over the future of the government furlough scheme for both businesses and workers.\nLabour shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that without clarity on business support - like the VAT reduction and the business rates holiday - \"many businesses are simply throwing in the towel now and we cannot afford that in the UK when we've already had record redundancies\".  \nConservative MP Steve Baker, deputy chair of the Covid Recovery Group of Tory lockdown-sceptics, said the \"pace of change will be a hammer blow\" to industries such as aviation, hospitality and the arts.\nThe devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions.\nIn Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he hopes the \"stay-at-home\" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. \nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster wants its executive to discuss the reopening date for schools following Mr Johnson's announcement in England.\nA further 10,641 coronavirus cases were reported on Monday, alongside another 178 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nMore than 17.7 million people across the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, according to latest government figures.\nHow will you be affected by the plan to ease Covid restrictions?

      "text": "The Scottish Parliament has published a revised version of submissions from Alex Salmond after the Crown Office raised \"grave concerns\" about it.\nMr Salmond's papers named people he alleges were part of a \"malicious\" attempt to remove him from public life.\nThe parliament later removed one of the documents and republished it in another form.\nIt came after MSPs on the parliament's corporate body met to discuss a letter that was sent by the Crown Office.\nA spokesman for the Crown Office said: \"In all cases where the Crown becomes aware of issues of potential contempt, these will be considered carefully and action will be taken if considered appropriate.\" \nThe documents were published ahead of Mr Salmond's scheduled appearance before the inquiry that is investigating the Scottish government's botched handling of harassment complaints against him.\nMr Salmond's submission included claims from the former first minister that there had been a \"complete breakdown of the necessary barriers which should exist between government, political party and the prosecution authorities\".\nAnd he alleged that there was \"a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort amongst a range of individuals within the Scottish government and the SNP to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned.\"\nThe people named by Mr Salmond in his submissions include Nicola Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell, who is the chief executive of the SNP, and Ms Sturgeon's chief of staff, Liz Lloyd. \nMr Salmond has also accused Ms Sturgeon, who succeeded him as first minister and SNP leader, of misleading parliament and breaching the ministerial code.\nMs Sturgeon has denied the allegations and told BBC Scotland that there was \"not a shred of evidence\" to back up his claims of a conspiracy.\nMr Salmond's lawyers said the parliament's decision to withdraw and then republish a revised version of his submission was a \"significant surprise and concern\" and could have \"a material bearing on whether he is able to attend\" the evidence session on Wednesday.\nThey added: \"As matters stand, we have advised him that the apparent intervention from the Crown suggests that there has to be a material risk to him in speaking to his submission. He cannot be placed in legal jeopardy.\"\nScottish Labour interim leader Jackie Baillie called for the Lord Advocate - who is both head of the Crown Office and a member of the Scottish government - to make a statement in parliament. \nShe added: \"Given the significant public interest, I have asked the presiding officer to publish the letter from the Crown Office to the parliament, so that we can better understand the restrictions placed on the corporate body.  \n\"Too much time and money has been spent on this sordid tale. The committee must be able to get on with its work, unobstructed and without information being inappropriately withheld.\" \nThe inquiry committee has been examining what went wrong with the government's internal investigation into sexual harassment complaints against Mr Salmond that were made by two female civil servants.\nThe government had to pay legal expenses of more than \u00a3500,000 to Mr Salmond after it admitted it had acted unlawfully during the investigation. \nMr Salmond was later cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault against a total of nine women after a High Court trial last year.\nAlex Salmond's submissions to the Holyrood inquiry lay out his version of events. \nThey were paving the way for him to appear in front of the committee and give evidence in person  - something Mr Salmond had said he would not do that unless his evidence was published. \nHe wants his side of the story put on the record and is concerned because unless the statements are published the committee cannot refer to them in their findings. \nThe committee has published a revised version. Now Mr Salmond is considering whether it is enough for him to give evidence tomorrow.\nMr Salmond also claims in his written submission that the Crown Office - Scotland's prosecution service - is \"not fit for purpose\" under its current leadership.\nAnd he said there had been a \"complete breakdown of the necessary barriers which should exist between government, political party and indeed the prosecution authorities in any country which abides by the rule of law.\"\nHe added: \"The real cost to the Scottish people runs into many millions of pounds and yet no-one in this entire process has uttered the simple words which are necessary on occasions to renew and refresh democratic institutions - 'I Resign'.\n\"The committee now has the opportunity to address that position.\"\nMSPs on the inquiry committee previously voted against publishing Mr Salmond's submission, before the parliament's corporate body later concluded that \"on balance\" it would be possible for the document to be published.\nResponding to the publication of the documents on Monday night, a Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) spokesman said it took seriously its responsibility to uphold the law and to protect the dignity and rights of \"all those who come into contact with COPFS\".\nHe added that Scotland's prosecutors had acted \"independently and in the public interest at all times\" in relation to the case.\nAn additional written submission to the inquiry by Ms Lloyd said she rejected the conspiracy allegation in \"its entirety\" and was not \"substantiated by any evidence and is founded on a number of claims, that are false\".\nAn SNP spokesman said: \"This is just more assertion without a shred of credible evidence.\n\"Several of the women have already made clear how utterly absurd it is to suggest they were part of a conspiracy to bring him down. And yet Alex Salmond is still making these ridiculous and baseless claims and lashing out at all and sundry.\""

But it needs to be laid out very clearly.\"\nMeanwhile in Swansea, Hiatus, a sustainability conscious surf, outdoors and lifestyle store, had to delay it's opening due to the pandemic.\nThe company's director, Matt Bryer, explained they finally managed to open the shop in September 2020, but said the past few months have been \"challenging.\" \n\"You've never had to be as dynamic as you have now,\" he said.\nMr Bryer said it feels like \"neglect\" when he sees other sectors \"getting access to more funding\".\n\"It seems like we might be misunderstood on how we operate, how our cashflow operates and how our commitments operates,\" he said.\nMr Cottam also called on the Welsh Government to offer security on funding for businesses with relief for certain sectors to be extended by a year.\n\"We would like to see Welsh Government commit to 100% rates relief holiday,\" he said.\n\"That will just give businesses a little bit of breathing space they need to get back up and running and to help restart the economy.\"\nThe FSB wants the Welsh and UK governments to provide consistent messages and trading conditions.\nA Welsh Government spokesperson said it will move to the alert level three in \"gradual steps, assessing the impact as we go along\".\nIt said a first step, in the next three weeks, would be to consider the rules around non-essential retail and close contact services, and the possibility of re-opening self-contained accommodation for Easter.\n\"We recognise everyone wants certainty and to be able to plan for the future, and that businesses want to be open and trading - we want that to happen as soon as it is safe to do so,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"We are actively reviewing our options for providing further support for firms aligned to the review process and have active planning in place to extend if required.\"\nIt added that the Welsh Government has provided \u00a3650m to help businesses through the December to March period in addition to a \u00a3180m support fund for the tourism, hospitality and leisure sectors."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

I think there is a strong case that we need to prioritise the education of our young people and get them back as soon as possible.\"\nMr Weir said quick movement was particularly needed on issues around primary schools.\n\"We've got the immediate return of P1 to P3 - I don't see why there can't be immediate movement for the rest of primary schools,\" he said.\n\"The damage that is being done, both from an educational point of view but from a wider societal point of view in terms of issues around mental health and the long term future of our young people are also critical.\n\"There's nowhere that's entirely risk free but I think [schools] represent a relatively safe place.\"\nThis latest Stormont split over schools feels all too familiar.\nOn Thursday the executive said it had agreed a phased approach, even though DUP ministers had been advocating a quicker return.\nBut just a few days later we are witnessing more friction over the issue within the executive.\nHow Stormont handles this developing row will indicate what might come down the track with managing wider plans to exit lockdown.\nRead more: Stormont school return split all too familiar\nMrs Foster has said she wants the Stormont executive to \"revisit\" its discussion about the reopening date for schools in Northern Ireland.\nShe was speaking after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his lockdown exit plan, with 8 March set for the return all schoolchildren in England.\n\"Unfortunately our health advisors didn't think that that was the right way forward,\" she said.\n\"I understand that we have to take a safe and sustainable way forward but I hope that we can now revisit that again because I know full well from my own experience the kitchen table is no substitute for a classroom.\"\nDeirdre O'Kane, the principal of St Patrick's and St Brigid's College in Claudy, County Londonderry, described Mr Weir's comments as \"confusing and frustrating\".\n\"Any change to announced plans for the return of school should be based on scientific evidence and the advice from health officials,\" she said.\nCollin Torrens, the principal of Lisnagelvin Primary School in Londonderry, questioned why DUP ministers were pressing for a quicker return to the classroom for all pupils after the executive had agreed a plan last week.\n\"One minute it's not safe to go back and the next it is,\" he said.\n\"The sooner we get pupils back to school the better for everybody - that is what everyone wants - but only if it's safe.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in's education spokesperson Pat Sheehan said \"nothing has changed since last Thursday\".\n\"The [chief medical officer] told us last week that the reopening of schools completely would lead to a rise in the R number by between 0.3 and 0.7,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"If the R rate at the minute is sitting around 0.75 - even if we only hit that lowest number it brings us back above one and we're back in the exact same situation again.\n\"It's disappointing that Arlene wants to go and make policy on the hoof in interviews on the TV last night.\"The only thing that has changed is that Boris Johnson has decided to make a decision for England.\n\"You would think by now that the DUP would have learned not to hitch their wagon to Boris.\"\nThe SDLP MLA Daniel McCrossan said he was disappointed to see a \"rush to change\" the phased-return strategy for schools.\n\"We cannot risk the progress we have made against Covid-19 by rushing to act,\" he added.\nThere are no plans at present for school staff to be vaccinated in Northern Ireland, according to Mr Swann.\nResponding to a question from DUP MLA William Irwin, the health minister said they would not be looking at specific occupations but would continue to follow Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) guidance which focuses on age and clinical profiles.\n\"I am aware piece of work JCVI looking at specific occupational cohorts that may be at more risk,\" he said.\n\"But as of yet we haven't received any further update and until I do receive further guidance I will be maintaining and sticking current guidance that we have to date because  it has worked for us so far in regards where we see decrease in the number infections in our care homes, infections in society but also the decrease in the number of hospitalisations that we are also seeing.\""

      "tags": "Human rights,United Nations,Sri Lanka",
      "text": "Sri Lanka is facing a new UN resolution calling on it to hold human rights abusers to account and deliver justice to victims of its 26-year civil war.\nBritain and others have circulated a draft of the resolution among UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) member states.\nIt is expected to be adopted at the end of the four-week UNHRC spring session in Geneva, which began on Monday.\nSri Lankan forces and Tamil rebels were accused of atrocities during the war, which killed at least 100,000 people.\n\"The victims from all communities of Sri Lanka's brutal civil war are, a decade later, still awaiting justice for loved ones murdered or missing, and dealing with the repercussions of violence and conflict,\" said Lord Ahmad, Britain's minister of state for South Asia and the Commonwealth.\nGermany and Canada are among the six countries in the Britain-led Core Group on Sri Lanka.\nLord Ahmad said the resolution was a vital step towards reconciliation and peaceful relations among all of Sri Lanka's diverse communities and faith groups.\nThe UN estimates that up to 40,000 people, mostly civilians from the minority Tamil community, were killed in the final stages of Sri Lanka's war against the Tamil Tiger rebels, who were crushed in May 2009. Other reports put the figure higher. The UN human rights office accused both sides of atrocities during the conflict.\nThousands went missing during the war and the Sri Lankan security agencies are blamed for the disappearance of Tamil rebels who either surrendered or were captured.\nSince then, the families of Tamils who were killed or went missing have demanded justice and accountability. The Sri Lankan government has consistently denied targeting civilians and rejects all allegations it is guilty of enforced disappearances.\nFollowing international pressure, the then Sri Lankan government in 2015 committed to investigate violations and hold war crimes trials supported by foreign judges, as part of a consensus resolution at the UNHRC. \nBut current Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa withdrew from the UN resolution in February 2020, months after he was elected on a nationalist platform by voters from the Sinhala majority. Last year he reassured his supporters of an end to the \"era of betraying war heroes\" -  referring to legal action against soldiers accused of rights abuses.\nMr Rajapaksa led the war effort as the powerful defence secretary under his elder brother Mahinda, who was president from 2005 to 2015. He rejects allegations that war crimes were committed on his orders. \n\"The Sri Lankan government is not resisting any form of accountability within our constitution. Our constitution does not provide [options] for foreign judges,\" the current foreign minister, Dinesh Gunawardena, told the BBC as the UNHRC session was about to begin.\nGotabaya Rajapaksa has also set up a three-member commission to look into what the government described as \"political victimisation\" of government officials by the previous government.\nIn a scathing report released last month, the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, said: \"Nearly 12 years on from the end of the war, domestic initiatives for accountability and reconciliation have repeatedly failed to produce results, more deeply entrenching impunity, and exacerbating victims' distrust in the system.\"\nMs Bachelet's report will be submitted to the UN Council meeting later this week. \nBut the Sri Lankan foreign minister rejected the report, saying: \"The ground situation is totally different to what the commissioner's report is. That's why Sri Lanka disagreed with her, with documents, evidence and detailed reports and answered her draft report.\"\nRights groups say under the current government, activists and those seeking justice for abuses committed during the war face threats and intimidation. \n\"If you go to the north and the east [Tamil areas], the surveillance is very high. Civil society organisations are visited regularly [by security agencies] and it is a form of harassment,\" Bhavani Fonseka, a human rights lawyer, said.\nThousands of Tamils and members of the Muslim and Christian communities held a massive rally earlier this month. They marched from the east to the north - despite a ban because of Covid - to highlight their grievances.\nWhile the Tamil community called for accountability and justice for the crimes committed during the civil war, Muslims complained about the forced cremation of Covid victims by the government, which they say is against Islamic practices. \nTamils say the reconciliation process and accountability are being systematically undermined by the current government.\nFor example, they point out that last year President Rajapaksa pardoned a soldier, Sunil Ratnayake, who'd been sentenced to death for killing eight Tamil civilians, including a five-year-old and two teenagers, in the village of Mirusuvil in northern Jaffna region in 2000. \nIt was one of the few convictions from the civil war era, and the UN said the pardon was \"an affront to victims\". \nMs Bachelet's report also pointed out that after assuming power, President Rajapaksa had appointed senior military officials who were implicated in United Nations reports into alleged war crimes during the final years of the conflict.\nThe government denies those accusations.\nFor people like Asha Nagendran, a Tamil from the north-eastern city of Trincomalee, justice appears further away than ever. \nSri Lankan security forces took her 25-year-old son for investigation in 2008. She has not heard from him since.\n\"The UN should not give any more time to the Sri Lankan government,\" Ms Nagendran said. \"A body set up by international representatives should investigate and address our plight.\""

      "text": "The first results of the UK vaccination programme suggests it is having a \"spectacular\" impact on preventing serious illness.\nResearch led by Public Health Scotland found at four weeks after the first dose, hospital admissions were reduced by 85% and 94% for the Pfizer and AstraZeneca jabs respectively.\nIt is the first sign of the real world impact of vaccination in the UK.\nFigures for England are expected to be released later.\nAmong the over 80s, there was an overall 81% reduction in the numbers admitted to hospital.\nThe researchers did not look at the impact on transmission - whether people who were vaccinated passed it on - or whether immunity waned over time.\nThe preliminary data from the EAVE II project covers 1.14 million vaccinations given in Scotland between 8 December and 15 February.  \nThe study looked at the numbers being admitted to hospital with Covid among this population and compared it to those admitted who were not vaccinated.\nIn total, there were just over 8,000 people who ended up in hospital, but only 58 were among the vaccinated group after the four-week mark.\nLead researcher Prof Aziz Sheikh said the results were \"very, very\" impressive and both vaccines were working \"spectacularly\".\n\"These results are very encouraging and have given us great reasons to be optimistic for the future.\"\nTrials of both vaccines had suggested they would have a significant impact at preventing hospitalisations.\nBut for the Pfizer vaccine studies, that had involved a second dose being given after three weeks.\nThe UK has adopted a policy of delaying the second jab of both vaccines by three months, which had led some to question whether the approach would give sufficient immunity.\nThe trials of the AstraZeneca looked at a longer dosing interval so there was more confidence about that vaccine.\nDr Josie Murray, of Public Health Scotland, said the findings were \"brilliant news\" and suggested the vaccine programme was working.\nScotland is a good place to do this kind of observational study of how the vaccines are working in the real world.  \nIts population size and use of individual patient identifiers (known as CHI numbers) enable scientists to track data from the entire population and get results quickly. And while it's still early days, the data indicates that a first dose of either vaccine prevents most people becoming seriously ill.\nThere are limitations of course. The study only tracked those who were admitted to hospital and whether they had had a vaccine or not.  \nIt didn't count anybody who had died from Covid in a care home, for example.  And it didn't look at transmissibility, only the risk of becoming seriously ill.   \nOther similar studies are being conducted across the UK but this data will be seen as extremely encouraging."

      "tags": "NI education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There is a \"strong case\" for all pupils in Northern Ireland to return to classrooms by 8 March, Education Minister Peter Weir has said.\nHe said he believed health officials at Stormont had been \"over-cautious\" in recommending a phased return.\nOn Monday his party leader First Minister Arlene Foster had called for the executive to revisit its plan.\nMr Weir said he wanted to see \"movement across the board\" in getting pupils back into classrooms more quickly.\nSpeaking in the assembly, Health Minister Robin Swann says he is not aware of any advice around the phased re-opening of schools having changed.\nEarlier on BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme, Mr Weir said he had advocated a full return in his paper to executive colleagues last week but that health advisers preferred a staged approach, with year groups going back at different times.\nThe executive is due to meet on Thursday to discuss its \"pathway-to-recovery\" blueprint.\n\"Anything that I put forward has been examined and predates what's happening in England,\" said Mr Weir.\n\"Obviously we want to look at what's happening in other jurisdictions but I've indicated that my preferred option was to see everyone returned to school on the 8 March.\n\"Indications certainly at that stage were given by some of the health advisers that they felt taking that full step was premature, which is why the executive at least moved forward on the initial steps.\n\"However well parents are providing that home-schooling, however well that work is being done also by schools, in terms of remote learning, it can't be a subsidiary for face-to-face teaching, it is effectively a second best.\n\"With some of the emerging evidence we've seen this week in Scotland... I think there is a strong case that we need to prioritise the education of our young people and get them back as soon as possible.\"\nMr Weir said quick movement was particularly needed on issues around primary schools.\n\"We've got the immediate return of P1 to P3 - I don't see why there can't be immediate movement for the rest of primary schools,\" he said.\n\"The damage that is being done, both from an educational point of view but from a wider societal point of view in terms of issues around mental health and the long term future of our young people are also critical.\n\"There's nowhere that's entirely risk free but I think [schools] represent a relatively safe place.\"\nThis latest Stormont split over schools feels all too familiar.\nOn Thursday the executive said it had agreed a phased approach, even though DUP ministers had been advocating a quicker return.\nBut just a few days later we are witnessing more friction over the issue within the executive.\nHow Stormont handles this developing row will indicate what might come down the track with managing wider plans to exit lockdown.\nRead more: Stormont school return split all too familiar\nMrs Foster has said she wants the Stormont executive to \"revisit\" its discussion about the reopening date for schools in Northern Ireland.\nShe was speaking after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his lockdown exit plan, with 8 March set for the return all schoolchildren in England.\n\"Unfortunately our health advisors didn't think that that was the right way forward,\" she said.\n\"I understand that we have to take a safe and sustainable way forward but I hope that we can now revisit that again because I know full well from my own experience the kitchen table is no substitute for a classroom.\"\nDeirdre O'Kane, the principal of St Patrick's and St Brigid's College in Claudy, County Londonderry, described Mr Weir's comments as \"confusing and frustrating\".\n\"Any change to announced plans for the return of school should be based on scientific evidence and the advice from health officials,\" she said.\nCollin Torrens, the principal of Lisnagelvin Primary School in Londonderry, questioned why DUP ministers were pressing for a quicker return to the classroom for all pupils after the executive had agreed a plan last week.\n\"One minute it's not safe to go back and the next it is,\" he said.\n\"The sooner we get pupils back to school the better for everybody - that is what everyone wants - but only if it's safe.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in's education spokesperson Pat Sheehan said \"nothing has changed since last Thursday\".\n\"The [chief medical officer] told us last week that the reopening of schools completely would lead to a rise in the R number by between 0.3 and 0.7,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"If the R rate at the minute is sitting around 0.75 - even if we only hit that lowest number it brings us back above one and we're back in the exact same situation again.\n\"It's disappointing that Arlene wants to go and make policy on the hoof in interviews on the TV last night.\"The only thing that has changed is that Boris Johnson has decided to make a decision for England.\n\"You would think by now that the DUP would have learned not to hitch their wagon to Boris.\"\nThe SDLP MLA Daniel McCrossan said he was disappointed to see a \"rush to change\" the phased-return strategy for schools.\n\"We cannot risk the progress we have made against Covid-19 by rushing to act,\" he added.\nThere are no plans at present for school staff to be vaccinated in Northern Ireland, according to Mr Swann.\nResponding to a question from DUP MLA William Irwin, the health minister said they would not be looking at specific occupations but would continue to follow Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) guidance which focuses on age and clinical profiles.\n\"I am aware piece of work JCVI looking at specific occupational cohorts that may be at more risk,\" he said.\n\"But as of yet we haven't received any further update and until I do receive further guidance I will be maintaining and sticking current guidance that we have to date because  it has worked for us so far in regards where we see decrease in the number infections in our care homes, infections in society but also the decrease in the number of hospitalisations that we are also seeing.\""

      "tags": "Unemployment,Economics,UK economy,Office for National Statistics,Unemployment in the UK,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The unemployment rate has risen to its highest level in almost five years, with younger workers bearing the brunt of the job losses, official figures show.\nThe UK's jobless rate rose to 5.1% in the three months to December, with the number of people on company payrolls down 726,000 on pre-pandemic levels. \nAlmost three-fifths of these were younger than 25 years.\nThere were, however, some early signs of stabilisation in the jobs market.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there was a small increase in the numbers of employees paid through payroll over the past couple of months, with 83,000 more people on the books in January compared with the previous month.\nAverage pay rose, too, by 4.7% including bonuses, although this was said to be a statistical quirk rather than a sign of lasting wage growth, \nStatisticians said this was partly because of the disproportionate fall in the number of young, typically lower-paid workers. Adjusting for this, the ONS said underlying wage growth was \"likely to be under 3%\".\nThe ONS said 1.74 million people were unemployed in the October to December period, up 454,000 from the same quarter in 2019.\n\"Our survey shows that the unemployment rate has had the biggest annual rise since the financial crisis,\" said Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics.\n\"However, the proportion of people who are neither working nor looking for work has stabilised after rising sharply at the start of the pandemic, with many people who lost their jobs early on having now started looking for work.\"\nDespite this, Mr Athow told the BBC's Today programme that the true underlying picture was not yet clear due to the high number of people still on furlough. \nHe said figures from early February suggested that about six million people were currently furloughed, adding: \"There is a huge amount of uncertainty about what will happen to them when that scheme ends.\"\nThe Bank of England is forecasting that the unemployment rate will rise sharply, peaking at an estimated 7.8% later in the year.\nKeighlie Holt is a 20 year-old hairdresser from Blackpool, which has the highest youth unemployment in the UK. The impact of covid on her industry means she has has only worked for a fraction of the year.\nShe is now retraining as a social media analyst: \"Last year I did what felt like, literally, three months of work. \n\"December wasn't anywhere near what it's like on any other December, that's normally our busiest time. And then it just wasn't going to go back to normal. No one wanted to get their hair done. No, I wasn't going anywhere.\"\nToday's labour market figures show that pay was up by an average of nearly 5% compared with a year ago - a much bigger pay rise than has been typical for most of the past decade. \nIf you're an employee you may not recognise that figure as anywhere near your own pay rise; a big part of it is because it is an average figure. \nIf you remove nearly 730,000 workers from employers' payrolls, many of whom have been in low-paid occupations such as accommodation and food services - where pay rises have been modest or non-existent - then it flatters the average. \nHowever, even allowing for those \"compositional\" effects, the Office for National Statistics estimates that there was still pay growth of 3% overall - far more than inflation at 0.7%.\nAnd in some sectors it was better than that: according to the ONS, pay in health and social work rose by an average of 6.2% - some modest compensation, perhaps, for the risks those workers have been taking. \nThe Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is preparing for next week's Budget, which is expected to set out further plans to help the labour market.\n\"I know how incredibly tough the past year has been for everyone, and every job lost is a personal tragedy,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\"At the Budget next week I will set out the next stage of our Plan for Jobs, and the support we'll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery.\"\nLabour's shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, claimed some businesses were \"throwing in the towel\" because the government was taking too long to confirm what business support would be available to them over the next six months.\nMs Dodds criticised the government for announcing its roadmap to ending lockdown \"without the clarity of business support\".  She told the BBC ministers \"may relish the theatre of budget\" but it was \"wrong to put decisions off until the Budget\", as some businesses had decided to \"give up\".  "

      "text": "It is \"impossible\" to give a date for the end of lockdown restrictions, one of Wales' top doctors says.\nDr Chris Jones, deputy chief medical officer, said there was a \"real risk\" of a third wave of Covid-19 cases if restrictions eased too quickly.\nHe was speaking after Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled a plan to end lockdown in England, by 21 June.\nThe Conservatives have called for the Welsh Government to produce a roadmap for the end of the Covid lockdown.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Dr Jones said there were \"probably greater risks\" now than at previous points in the pandemic because of the more transmissible variants.\nHe told Claire Summers that opening schools \"has a definite effect on the R-rate\", and how the new variants will affect infections is \"uncertain\".\n\"It is absolutely impossible in my view to say that on any one date in several months, that this will be the situation,\" he said in response to a question about Mr Johnson's announcement.\n\"I think we have to take things step by step.\"\nHe said all the UK's chief medical officers \"share the same view about the risks associated with relaxing restrictions,\" but added politicians had \"very difficult decisions\" to make.\nBut he said \"messaging to the public\" was \"very important\".\n\"To send the message that everything is going to be back to normal in a few months time, I think, is almost too open,\" he said.\n\"We are not out of the woods yet. There is a real risk of a third wave if restrictions are eased too quickly.\n\"We hope, from our cautious approach and step-by-step approach, will minimise the risk of that.\"\nIn England, the prime minister has set out a four-stage plan beginning on 8 March, with \"at least\" five weeks between each of the stages to allow time to assess the impact of relaxing some restrictions to be felt, and prepare for the next stage if possible.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has published a \"cautious\" framework to ending restrictions there, with the reopening of shops, bars, restaurants, gyms and hairdressers expected to start from 26 April.\nShe said it was hoped that Scotland's stay at home restrictions could be lifted on 5 April.\nHowever, Northern Ireland has renewed lockdown measures until 1 April.\nChildren in England are due to return to the classroom on 8 March.\nIn Wales, Foundation phase children, aged three to seven, are returning to school this week.\nIf conditions regarding the virus continue to improve, all primary years will be back in school on 15 March, along with pupils in exam years 11 and 13, and some pupils in years 10 and 12 who are due to sit exams.\nHowever, Education Minister Kirsty Williams said not all of those secondary-age pupils would be back in full time, which she hopes will happen from 12 April.\nIn Scotland all primary pupils and S4 to S6 secondary students could return to school from 15 March, but pupils in the first three years of secondary school are unlikely to return until after Easter.\nFrom 8 March in England, one nominated person will be able to visit a care home resident, but there is no date for this in Wales, where care home visits remain banned. \nCare Forum Wales is working with the Welsh Government to \"formulate a safe policy for visiting\".\nSomeone who is very keen to see visits start is Jen Sutton.\nHer mother Liz Jones is 82 and lives in a care home in Aberystwyth. Ms Sutton, who lives in Cardiff, is an only child and used to visit her mother regularly until the pandemic struck.\n\"I haven't seen her indoors since March and the only other visit I've had is 20 minutes in a garden pod end of July, beginning of August. Then they closed down again for various reasons. I've seen her on Skype but it's not the same,\" she said.\n\"I'd just like to see her through a window. If it meant me isolating for 10 days beforehand I would do that. I don't particularly want to go in. I'm quite happy to wave through a window.\n\"It's a human right isn't it, to see your family. It's not too much to ask.\"\nThis is one of the areas where Wales could be moving more quickly than England.\nOn Friday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said some non-essential shops and hairdressers could reopen on 15 March.\nBut this has raised questions over prioritising this when large numbers of secondary pupils will remain unable to return to the classroom.\nEngland is due to reopen all shops on 12 April, while in Scotland the provisional date is 26 April.\nFor most of us the rules for who we can meet indoors remain limited to the people we live with.\nUntil 27 February, only those who lived alone - or are single and live in a house share - and single parents had been able to form a so-called \"support bubble\".\nHowever, now families with babies are now allowed to meet up with one other household to form a bubble.\nIt means anyone with a child under the age of one can form an exclusive support bubble with another household, allowing them to meet indoors, and stay overnight in each others homes.\nThe rule change also allows teenagers - aged 16 to 17 - who do not live with an adult to form a support bubble with another household.\nSince Saturday 20 February , people in Wales have been able to exercise in groups of four, but only from a maximum of two households, and it must be exercise rather than \"socialising\", Mr Drakeford said.\nIn England, from 8 March people can exercise with one other person not from their household, but they will also be allowed to meet outdoors on a park bench for a chat, for example, expressly for the purpose of socialising.\nIn Scotland a provisional date of 15 March has been given for four people from two households to be allowed to meet outdoors.\nThen from 29 March, people in England will be able to meet in groups of up to six people from different households, or two groups from two households. They will be able to do this in private gardens as well as public spaces.\nDiscussions have been ongoing in Wales with the tourism sector about a potential reopening at Easter.\nThe country is again likely to be ahead of England on this, although no firm date has been mentioned yet, and Mr Drakeford said it would not be opened \"in one go\".\nMr Johnson's roadmap has holidays in self-contained accommodation used by one household being allowed from 12 April at the earliest, which misses the school holidays completely.\nMr Drakeford has talked of easing the stay at home requirement at the lockdown review on 12 March, if cases continue to decreased.\nHowever he has said there could be a \"stay local\" requirement in place, as there was in the arrangements during the autumn for people to remain in their local authority area.\nMr Johnson has said the stay at home rule in England will end on 29 March but people should stay as local as possible, while in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has said she hopes stay at home restrictions could be lifted on 5 April.\nAt present, only certain elite athletes in Wales are allowed to train together.\nNo dates have been mooted so far to allow people to get together for sport, including more individual distanced pursuits like golf or singles' tennis.\nThere are also no plans to reopen gyms.\nIn England, outdoor sports venues and formally organised outdoor sports can resume from 29 March. Gyms will be able to open from 12 April at the earliest.\nWhile in Scotland the possible date for reopening gyms and swimming pools has been mooted as 26 April.\nCurrently in Wales, only register offices and places of worship are open to perform marriages and guests are limited to the number who can be accommodated in the venue under the 2m social distancing regulations for different households.\nFrom 1 March, licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen for ceremonies.\nIn England, six people can currently attend but ceremonies are limited to those in exceptional circumstances, such as those who are terminally ill.\nFrom 8 March, all weddings with six people will be allowed. This will expand to 15 people on 12 April and 30 people on 17 May.\nNot any time soon in Wales, in a nutshell. There has been no date mooted, and Mr Drakeford said closures were unlikely to be revoked in the next six weeks.\nIn England, it is hoped people will be able to visit outdoor seating in restaurants and pubs from 12 April, and move indoors from 17 May.\nMeanwhile in Scotland pubs could reopen on 26 April."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There are \"deep and complex issues\" with using vaccine passports or certificates to prove someone's Covid \"status\", Boris Johnson has said.\nAnnouncing a review of the proposal, he said using certificates to allow visits to venues such as pubs and theatres was a \"novelty for our country\".\nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove will lead the review.\nMr Johnson said he was \"very optimistic\" most Covid restrictions in England can be lifted on 21 June.\nVaccine passports have been discussed by countries, including Greece, and operators such as Saga Cruises, as a way to safely reopen international leisure travel.\nBut ministers have frequently appeared to dismiss introducing a similar scheme domestically within the UK for hospitality or leisure activities.\nIt comes as Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said - if all goes to plan - she expects to see a phased but significant reopening of the Scottish economy in the last week of April.\nA further 8,489 coronavirus cases were recorded across the UK on Tuesday and 548 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total by that measure to 121,305.\nMore than 17.9 million people across the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, according to latest government figures.\nSpeaking during a visit to a south London school, Mr Johnson said the UK had \"never thought in terms of having something that you have to show to go to a pub or a theatre\".\nHe said there were \"ethical issues\" about the role of government \"in mandating\u2026 or banning people from doing such a thing\".\nHe added: \"We can't be discriminatory against people who can't have the vaccine, there might be a medical reason, or some people may genuinely refuse to have one - I think that's a mistake.\"\nBut the prime minister said it was possible to consider the issue at the same time as the rollout of the vaccine.\nIt is understood the review will not just consider vaccination history alone, with the possibility of negative Covid tests being recorded to gain access to some events or services, if required by the organisers. \nOne option could see the NHS app used to record both, with an individual then able to show their status on the app if required.\nThe government previously said it would consider how to facilitate Covid certificates for people who needed to travel to other countries which demanded them.\nThe review's findings are hoped to be available before the final stage of England's lockdown easing on 21 June, the earliest date by which ministers hope most Covid measures can end.\nBBC political correspondent Jessica Parker said the review marked a change of position from ministers but that, with businesses already looking at ways they could keep workers and customers safe, the government was looking to get ahead of things.\n\"The conversation was just happening anyway. Businesses were looking at ways to make their workplaces safe, organisations were looking at ways to try to make their customers safe and the government risked not being part of that conversation but eventually being brought into it anyway,\" she said.\nA No 10 spokesman said an international consensus needed to be built on how to allow greater foreign travel, which the UK was seeking to achieve via the G7 and other multilateral discussions. \n\"It will be for different countries to determine their own regimes in relation to the quarantine and who they want to allow in, and we want to try and work together to get some sort of international framework,\" he said.\nGreek tourism minister Haris Theoharis told the BBC last week that early technical discussions were under way with UK officials about how a potential passport scheme might work.\nSaga Cruises announced last month it would require all travellers to prove they had received two vaccine doses before departure.\n\"You will be required to bring the vaccination document and/or evidence with you as proof at the time of boarding,\" its website said.\nHolidays in the UK or abroad are not currently permitted under coronavirus restrictions. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said a review of how to return to international travel while managing risk from imported cases and virus variants would report on 12 April.\nMeanwhile, holiday firms and airlines have reported a surge in bookings since plans for easing lockdown in England were unveiled on Monday.\nLabour shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds told the BBC a review of vaccine passports was \"sensible\" but said it should be \"conclusive\" and consider all the evidence available.\nChristopher Dye, professor of epidemiology at Oxford University, told the BBC that vaccine passports would \"certainly be helpful in releasing the lockdown\" but they should not \"make things worse for people of lesser means\".\nMr Johnson said his roadmap for easing lockdown measures, laid out on Monday, was \"a cautious but irreversible approach\".\nDue to the vaccine programme, the country could \"look at that 21 June date with some optimism\".\nMr Johnson said each phase of unlocking restrictions -  such as children going back to school -  would be \"adding to the budget of risk\". \nThis is why time was needed between measures to \"observe\" the impact, he added.\nEarlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he wanted measures to become a \"matter of personal responsibility and social norms\" that could see people choosing to wear masks on public transport.\nThe devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions.\nOutlining her own roadmap, Ms Sturgeon said she hoped to end stay at home restrictions from 5 April in Scotland.\nMeanwhile in Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he hopes the country's \"stay-at-home\" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time.\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster wants its executive to discuss the reopening date for schools following Mr Johnson's announcement in England."

      "text": "Scotland's unemployment rate has fallen to 4.5% over the last quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nThe UK rate rose in the three months to December and is now at 5.1%, its highest level for nearly five years.\nThe employment rate among those aged 16 to 64 in Scotland fell slightly over the same period to 73.7%.\nThe Scottish government said the figures did not reflect the full impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\nSeparate HMRC early estimates for January 2021, also published on Tuesday, show there were 2,331,000 payrolled employees in Scotland - an increase of 8,000 from December 2020.\nHowever, the figure is 68,000 lower than a year ago.\nIt's hard to get an accurate count for unemployment when more than four million people across the UK are thought to be on furlough.\nMany more are also not seeking work, but they're under-employed - not working the hours they normally would.\nBut this latest data from the Office for National Statistics give some sense of the jobs market last year: Scottish unemployment up 26,000 and those in work down 43,000.\nBy year's end, the jobless rate was 4.5%: the UK, 5.1%.\nThe number claiming benefit because of no or low pay is 83% - up on January last year, and a higher rate than the UK.\nUnemployment is set to rise when furlough is withdrawn, although with business restrictions continuing well into summer, it is expected the Westminster budget next week will see furlough extended.\nReacting to the figures, Scotland's Business Minister Jamie Hepburn said they did not reflect the full impact of coronavirus or the outlook for employment.\nHe said: \"The Job Retention Scheme continues to play an important role in supporting employers and employees and, combined with the huge economic uncertainty caused by Brexit, this remains an extremely uncertain time for the economy and jobs.\n\"We have repeatedly called on the UK government to extend the Job Retention Scheme for as long as required - which will be beyond the current end date of April.\n\"The Scottish government continues to support employers, allocating over \u00a33bn to help businesses since the start of this pandemic.\"\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"I know how incredibly tough the past year has been for everyone, and every job lost is a personal tragedy.\n\"That's why throughout the crisis, my focus has been on doing everything we can to protect jobs and livelihoods.\n\"At the Budget next week, I will set out the next stage of our Plan for Jobs, and the support we'll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery.\"\nScottish Secretary Alister Jack said the figures reflected continuing challenges as a result of the Covid pandemic.  \nHe added: \"The UK government has taken quick and decisive action to support jobs and businesses across all parts of the UK. \nOur \u00a3280 billion support package which includes furlough, business loans and self employed schemes have so far protected nearly one million jobs and 100,000 businesses in Scotland.\"\nStuart McIntyre, head of research at the Fraser of Allander economic institute, said: \"With the prime minister announcing that the UK will be eased gradually out of lockdown, it seems inevitable that Rishi Sunak will need to keep his economic support measures - including furlough - in place for longer still.\n\"Lifting these support measures too early runs the risk of precipitating a sharp rise in unemployment. \n\"Given that we have come so far with this public health crisis, an extra few months of support makes clear economic sense.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Everybody has to \"play their part\" to meet the dates for England's lockdown to be eased, Matt Hancock has said.\nBut it is currently \"too early\" to say how long social distancing will be in place, the health secretary said. \nThe aim is for measures like masks to become a \"matter of personal responsibility\", rather than law, in the future.\nBoris Johnson has outlined a strategy that could see restrictions lifted by 21 June - if strict conditions are met. \nNicola Sturgeon is to reveal plans to ease restrictions in Scotland later.\nShe has said Scotland will return to a tiered system, meaning different parts of the country could be under different rules. \nThe health secretary told the BBC it is \"vital\" that \"everybody plays their part\" to make sure \"that we hit these dates and get out of this as soon as we possibly can, safely\".  \nPeople should be able to hug friends and family from 17 May, when the most vulnerable groups have had two coronavirus vaccine jabs, he said. \nMr Hancock said eradicating Covid-19 completely is \"not going to be possible\" and that everyone would have to \"learn to live with it\", as we do with flu. \nHe said he wanted measures to become a \"matter of personal responsibility and social norms\" that could see people choosing to wear masks on public transport, for example.\nThere is already evidence that the vaccines were working, with the number of deaths \"coming down really sharply\", he added. \nHe urged people to take up their vaccine offer, amid warnings the virus could persist in inner city communities where uptake is low. \nDr Mike Tildesley, reader in mathematical modelling of infectious diseases at the University of Warwick and member of government advisory group SPI-M, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this was a \"real concern\". \n\"It's really important that we get the vaccines out to those deprived communities to prevent a potential wave of infections occurring as we do unlock,\" he added. \nMr Hancock said it is \"absolutely on all of us\" to get the vaccine when invited. \nThe latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show coronavirus deaths continue to decline. In the week of 12 February, there were 17,136 deaths registered in the UK, down by 1,710 on the previous week. \nDeaths are still running above usual levels for this time of year, however. They were 26% higher than the average for the same week over the past five years. \nIn the first step of the prime minister's roadmap, all pupils in England's schools are expected to return to class from 8 March, with mass testing and wider use of face masks in secondary schools.\nThere will be a further easing on 29 March, with groups of up to six people or two households allowed to gather in parks and gardens.\nShops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality, as well as self-contained holiday accommodation, could reopen on 12 April. A review of international leisure travel restrictions will be completed by this date.  \nFrom 17 May, two households or a group of six may be able to meet indoors in a pub or other hospitality venue such as restaurants.\nCinemas, museums, hotels, performances and sporting events will also reopen, with up to 30 people able to attend weddings, receptions, funerals and wakes.\nThe final step from 21 June will potentially see all legal limits on social contact removed, with the final closed sectors of the economy reopened - such as nightclubs.\nProgressing along the schedule will depend on four tests: the success of the vaccine rollout, evidence of vaccine efficacy, an assessment of new variants, and keeping infection rates below a level that could put unsustainable pressure on the NHS.\nThere will be a gap of at least five weeks between each of the plan's subsequent steps to allow for the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed. \nOn Monday, Mr Johnson told a Downing Street news conference he could not guarantee his plan would be irreversible \"but the intention is that it should be\".\nHe added that the coming spring and summer would be \"seasons of hope, looking and feeling incomparably better for us all\".\nAs part of its plans, the government wants to determine whether offering \"Covid status\" certificates, which could be used by people to demonstrate they had received a vaccine or a negative coronavirus test, could help venues open again.  \nMr Johnson acknowledged there were \"clearly some quite complex issues, some ethical issues\" but later told a meeting of his own MPs that \"a debate had to be had\". \nMPs will vote on the roadmap in late March. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the plan but said certainty was needed over the future of the government furlough scheme for both businesses and workers.\nLabour shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that without clarity on business support - like the VAT reduction and the business rates holiday - \"many businesses are simply throwing in the towel now and we cannot afford that in the UK when we've already had record redundancies\".  \nConservative MP Steve Baker, deputy chair of the Covid Recovery Group of Tory lockdown-sceptics, said the \"pace of change will be a hammer blow\" to industries such as aviation, hospitality and the arts.\nThe devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions.\nIn Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he hopes the \"stay-at-home\" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. \nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster wants its executive to discuss the reopening date for schools following Mr Johnson's announcement in England.\nA further 10,641 coronavirus cases were reported on Monday, alongside another 178 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nMore than 17.7 million people across the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, according to latest government figures.\nHow will you be affected by the plan to ease Covid restrictions?

      "text": "People in England are no longer legally required to wear face masks in almost all public spaces, although they are still recommended in some settings. \nThe change is part of the government's decision to lift Plan B coronavirus measures in England.\nMasks are still required in many situations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nFrom Thursday 27 January:\nWhat are the latest changes to the UK's Covid rules?\nFace mask changes: 'We hope customers aren't discouraged'\nIn Scotland, masks must be worn in most indoor public spaces including public transport, shops and gyms (although they can be temporarily removed when exercising).\nThey must be worn in pubs and restaurants when not seated or dancing, and in the workplace in communal areas and canteens. \nThey are compulsory for all school staff as well as secondary school pupils and are required in indoor public spaces in universities.\nLike England, under-12s are exempt.\nFrom Friday 28 January, adults running organised sessions with under-5s will no longer need to wear face coverings. \nIn Northern Ireland, post-primary pupils must wear face coverings inside school buildings, as must staff if they can't socially distance.\nMasks must also be worn on public transport, in shops and hospitality venues unless you're sitting down to eat or drink.\nMasks aren't required in gyms or other exercise venues.\nHowever, people no longer have to show proof of exemption if they're not wearing a mask.\nUnder-13s don't have to wear masks in public indoor places, and primary school pupils are exempt from the rules on public transport.\nPeople no longer have to wear face masks by law in cafes, pubs, restaurants and nightclubs, but face coverings are required on public transport and  most public spaces, including shops.\nSecondary school pupils are being asked to wear masks in class until the end of half term. \nThe guidance in Wales applies to everyone aged 11 or over.\nIn England, Transport for London (TfL) officers and police can currently fine people \u00a3200 for their first offence. This drops to \u00a3100 if paid within 14 days. \nThe penalty doubles for each subsequent offence, with no discount for quick payment. So, a second penalty would be \u00a3400, a third \u00a3800, up to a maximum of \u00a36,400. \nIn Wales, the penalty for a first offence is \u00a360, with the fine doubling for each subsequent offence - up to a maximum of \u00a31,920. Repeat offenders can also be prosecuted in court where fines are unlimited.\nIn Scotland, the police can issue a penalty notice of up to \u00a360 for breaking the law on mask-wearing.\nEvidence suggests transmission mainly happens indoors where people are close together.\nCovering the nose and mouth reduces the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and while speaking.\nThe main purpose is to protect others although there is some evidence they offer protection to wearers.\nIt should:\nStandard surgical masks are acceptable. It is also possible to buy FFP2 and FFP3 masks used by healthcare workers which can offer higher protection. However, these must be fitted correctly to work."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

And while it's still early days, the data indicates that a first dose of either vaccine prevents most people becoming seriously ill.\nThere are limitations of course. The study only tracked those who were admitted to hospital and whether they had had a vaccine or not.  \nIt didn't count anybody who had died from Covid in a care home, for example.  And it didn't look at transmissibility, only the risk of becoming seriously ill.   \nOther similar studies are being conducted across the UK but this data will be seen as extremely encouraging."

He must also pay \u20ac42,000 ($51,000; \u00a336,300) in court expenses.\nThe two other defendants, brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio, who are also in their 50s, were also in the courtroom on Tuesday but did not speak.\nThe three men were charged with planning the assassination and triggering the bomb that killed Caruana Galizia near her home in October 2017. They were arrested in December the same year. The Degiorgio brothers have stuck to not guilty pleas.\nAccording to the Times of Malta newspaper, Muscat reached a plea bargain with prosecutors in the case, offering up information about the killing and renouncing his right to appeal.\nA fourth person, Maltese businessman Yorgen Fenech, has also been charged with complicity over the killing  - an allegation he denies. \nMr Fenech, who was arrested as he tried to sail away from Malta on a yacht in November 2019, is awaiting trial.\nCaruana Galizia, who was 53 when she died, spent 30 years as a journalist and relentlessly accused Maltese politicians and other officials of corruption in her popular Running Commentary blog.\nShe was a harsh critic of government and effectively triggered an early election in 2017 by publishing allegations linking the then-prime minister to the Panama Papers scandal.\nJoseph Muscat, who is not related to the suspect, denied the corruption allegations. He later resigned as prime minister in December 2019 after an investigation implicated his close associates in the murder.\nAfter her assassination, her son Paul hit out at what he called the country's \"mafia state\", saying his mother had been killed \"because she stood between the rule of law and those who sought to violate it\".\nFollowing the sentencing on Tuesday, the journalist's family said in a statement they hoped \"this development will begin the road for total justice for Daphne Caruana Galizia\".\nHer killing \"destroyed her right to life and removed her right to enjoy her family and grandchildren who were born after her murder\", it added."

The findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Human Behaviour. \nResearcher Damien Finch, who pioneered the mud wasp dating technique, said it was rare to find mud wasp nests both on top and underneath a single artwork.\nBut the team was able to sample both types to establish the artwork's minimum and maximum ages. \n\"We radiocarbon dated three wasp nests underlying the painting and three nests built over it to determine, confidently, that the painting is between 17,500 and 17,100 years old; most likely 17,300 years old,\" said Dr Finch, a geochronologist from the University of Melbourne. \nScientists say this estimation makes the artwork the oldest known intact painting in Australia.\nThe study's co-author Dr Sven Ouzman, from the University of Western Australia, added there could be a link between the kangaroo painting and the ancient art from other regions.\n\"This iconic kangaroo image is visually similar to rock paintings from islands in South East Asia dated to more than 40,000 years ago, suggesting a cultural link - and hinting at still older rock art in Australia,\" he said. \nEarlier this year, researchers found the world's oldest animal cave painting, a 45,000-year-old life-sized depiction of a pig, on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.\nIn South Africa, a hashtag-like doodle created 73,000 years ago is believed to be the oldest known drawing.\nCissy Gore-Birch, chair of the Balanggarra Aboriginal Corporation, noted the significance of the kangaroo rock art discovery for Aboriginal people and Australians.\n\"It's important that Indigenous knowledge and stories are not lost and continue to be shared for generations to come,\" she said."

      "text": "Scotland's youngest pupils are returning to the classroom for the first time since the Christmas break.\nIt is stage one in a phased reopening of schools which have been closed to all but a minority of pupils since the beginning of January. \nEducation Secretary John Swinney insisted \"detailed clinical analysis\" assured him it is safe. \nBut concerns have been raised about the measures in place to reduce risk of transmission.\nMr Swinney told BBC's Good Morning Scotland that case prevalence data would be closely monitored to determine the impact of the phase one return.\nBut he said Scotland would not be following England, where all pupils are due to return to school on 8 March.\nAsked if it would be \"dangerous\" to send everyone back on that date, Mr Swinney said: \"I wouldn't have clinical authorisation to do that.\"\nThe deputy first minister added: \"We will move as quickly as we possibly can do but we have to do it within the scientific and clinical advice that is available to us.\"\nMr Swinney also urged parents to act responsibly during the first phase of lockdown easing.\nHe added: \"The biggest threat to the opening of schools is not outbreaks in schools. It is community transmission.\"\nEpidemiologist Dr Deepti Gurdasani told BBC Scotland at the weekend there was some evidence from England that younger children could bring infections back into homes. \nBut Prof Devi Sridhar, chairwoman of global public health at Edinburgh University, said the return of schools was about balancing the \"risks and benefits\".\nShe told BBC Good Morning Scotland: \"There will likely be cases emerging in schools over the next few weeks but the vast majority of schools should be fine, and that we have to keep perspective on.\"\nShe said the majority of scientific evidence was that there is an \"age gradient\" in infections - with very few outbreaks in nurseries but with teenagers and university students much more prone to infection. \nProf Sridhar added: \"I think what we have to do is work back up through that gradient. We are doing that starting with primaries and early years - the approach Denmark has also taken.\" \nOn Sunday the deputy first minister pointed to documents prepared by a government expert advisory group which states that younger children are less likely to catch or pass on the virus than older children and adults. \nAre you a parent or a teacher? How do you feel about children returning to school? Share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist. You can also get in touch in the following ways:\nPlans to reopen schools have been welcomed by opposition parties but the Scottish Conservatives have urged the government to publish plans for helping pupils catch-up with schooling they have missed. \nAs well as the youngest children returning to school, a small number of senior secondary pupils will be allowed into school buildings on a part-time basis to complete work for national qualifications. \nOther age groups will continue to learn from home and it is unlikely they will return to the classroom before 15 March at the earliest. \nIn primary schools measures to minimise the spread of the virus include regular hand-washing, open windows, and 2m physical distancing between adults, and between adults and children. \nStaff will also be offered regular lateral flow tests. \nResources to support learners, teachers and parents during lockdown.\nProf Jason Leitch, the national clinical director, has written to parents asking them to play their part in the safe return.\nHe urged them to: \nAppealing to parents not to relax the rules elsewhere, he reminded them that indoor play dates are not allowed  - though children can play together outside. \nAnd he said parents should continue to work from home if they are able to do so. \nMr Swinney's safety assurance came after an epidemiology expert raised concerns about the knock-on effects of sending children back to school. \nDr Deepti Gurdasani, of Queen Mary University of London, said data from England showed primary school children were two times more likely to be the first Covid case in a household, and once infected were two times more likely to infect their contacts. \nSpeaking to BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show, she said children aged six and above should wear masks in schools and more attention should be paid to ventilation. \nThe EIS teaching union has also raised concerns about school safety and have said a blended learning model - with about half of pupils in classes at any one time - would be more appropriate.

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon is preparing to unveil details of Scotland's path out of lockdown.\nThe return of face-to-face education, sports activities for young people and \"limited\" social interaction for adults will be among the priorities. \nIt will begin with easing current level four restrictions before moving back into a geographically variable system. \nThe first minister has said all decisions will be \"driven by data rather than dates\".\nShe wants the country's gradual emergence from lockdown to be \"phased and sustainable\", with at least three weeks between each phase.\nIt comes a day after Scotland's youngest children returned to the classroom for the first time this year, though most pupils continue with home schooling. \nAnd it follows Boris Johnson's announcement that shops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality in England would reopen on 12 April if strict conditions were met as part of a four-step plan to ease lockdown. \nThe Scottish government has said its priority is still the suppression of the virus to the \"lowest possible level\".\nThe speed at which the changes happen will be largely dictated by Covid rates across the country and the impact that is having on the NHS. \nHow quickly the country is vaccinated will also be a big factor in the changes to lockdown restrictions. \nThe latest statistics show that more than 1.4m have now had their first jab, and the it is now being offered to people with underlying health conditions, and unpaid carers.\nResearch published on Monday has already revealed the vaccination programme is having a \"spectacular\" impact on preventing serious illness. \nAnd last week data appeared to show the Covid death rate is falling in older people's care homes - where all residents have now received their first dose. \nMs Sturgeon said: \"We know we cannot continue in lockdown indefinitely and we must plan a gradual phased return to as much normality as possible.\n\"We hope that more children will be able to return to school later in March. And we have published new guidance to enable an easing of restrictions on care home visiting from early March.\n\"Beyond that, giving people the ability to meet loved ones, initially outdoors, is a priority for easing restrictions within the current level four.\"\nMs Sturgeon said the aim was to move Scotland back to a levels system, which would also see the economy gradually reopen.\nAt Monday's government coronavirus briefing, she said she expected Scotland's route of lockdown would have \"broad similarities\" with England but it would not be identical.\nUK Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the UK would have to learn to live with coronavirus for some time rather than pursue an elimination strategy to rid the country of it completely.\nHe said such a policy was \"not possible\" for an \"open trading nation\" such as the UK, as the strategy did not work without entirely closing off borders. \nInstead, he said, the UK's plan was to replace lockdown measures with protection from the vaccine. \n\"It's because of this incredibly successful vaccine rollout across Scotland and right across the country that we are all\u2026 able to take appropriate steps out of lockdown and keep this virus under control.\" \nThe country's business sector is hoping the first minister's announcement will give them a sign of when they can possibly return to normal. \nThe Scottish Hospitality Group, which represents a number of big bar and restaurant operators, has called for a similar announcement to the UK government's indicative dates for hospitality reopening. \nThe prime minister hopes to see indoor hospitality and hotels reopen on 17 May and all legal limits on social contact lifted on 21 June at the earliest. \nA SHG spokesman said: \"We desperately want to see Nicola Sturgeon confirm similar plans for Scotland in her statement, and allow us to be a part of that. \n\"Anything less would be an incredible betrayal of those people whose livelihoods have been under threat for so long.\"\nMeanwhile Tracy Black, the director of the CBI in Scotland, told BBC Scotland's The Nine that businesses wanted certainty.\n\"We think the first minister will be more cautious [than in England],\" she said. \n\"It's so important to be be able to plan and work with staff so they know when they will come back to work. We need to see support continues if restrictions are in place - we don't want any cliff edges this year.\"\nAhead of the first minister's announcement, Scottish Labour called for a beefed-up testing system to be put in place. \nThe party's interim leader Jackie Baillie said: \"Infection rates are now being driven down by a combination of lockdown measures and the roll out of the vaccine - but keeping infection rates low will depend on rapidly identifying and containing any outbreaks. \n\"That is why we are calling for a renewed emphasis on testing - including asymptomatic community testing on a mass scale.\"\nScottish Liberal Democrats leader Willie Rennie said the country needs to see a \"clear plan for both allowing activities, perhaps outdoor first, to resume and for our NHS to be equipped to deal with the recovery\". \nHe added: \"We also need to see testing ramped up to squash future outbreaks as soon as they occur, as well as certainty for the many businesses who will dread being plunged back into the opaque tiers system.\" "

      "title": "Covid-19: Scotland lockdown roadmap unveiled and vaccine passports review",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nThe reopening of Scotland's economy - including shops, bars, restaurants, gyms and hairdressers - is expected to start in the last week of April, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced. She said there would be a \"progressive easing\" of restrictions before then, with four people from two households allowed to meet outdoors from 15 March. All primary and more secondary school pupils could also return from that date, after the youngest pupils returned to classrooms on Monday, while the government hopes to lift the stay at home restrictions on 5 April. \nBoris Johnson has promised a review into the use of vaccine passports, but said there were \"deep and complex issues\" to consider. The prime minister said the idea of Covid status certificates - having to show something to go to a pub or the theatre - was a \"novelty\" for the UK. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove will lead the vaccine passport review. The prime minister also said he was \"very optimistic\" Covid restrictions in England can be lifted on 21 June, but warned \"nothing can be guaranteed\" as he urged everyone to \"continue to be prudent\". \nAround one million high-grade masks used in the NHS may not meet the right safety standards and have been withdrawn. The Department of Health told the BBC there are 1.12 million of these masks either in use or in hospital stores and it has told staff to stop using them. Distribution of some gloves has also been suspended because they may not meet technical requirements. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said safety of front-line staff was an absolute priority and the affected masks and gloves represented a very small proportion of its overall stocks. Update: The DHSC originally told the BBC 12 million face masks had been affected. It has since said this figure is incorrect, and the number is 1.12 million.\nA father wants the Scottish government to reconsider its Covid quarantine rules after his son was told he had to isolate in a hotel for 10 days. Antonio Caraballo's 10-year-old son Sami, who lives with his mother in Finland, flew to Edinburgh on Saturday to see his father. Mr Caraballo expected Sami to self-isolate at the family home and filled out pre-flight paperwork accordingly. But on arrival, border officials insisted he had to isolate in a hotel - and because he is a child Mr Caraballo had to quarantine with him, at a total cost of more than \u00a32,400. The Scottish government said it understood how difficult the restrictions were for families with children but that limits on international travel were necessary to minimise the risk of importing new variants. \nAndy Cain usually plays football a few times a week but lockdown forced him to hang up his boots. Like many others, he's looking forward to getting back on the pitch, after the prime minister announced outdoor sport would be allowed to resume in England from 29 March. \"You don't realise how important it is until it's taken away from you,\" 25-year-old Andy says. \"With football, it's not about talking at length about our problems. You completely forget your problems because you're enjoying yourself.\" Along with other football fans, Andy has been telling Radio 1 Newsbeat what he misses most about the game.

      "tags": "Tourism,Companies,Coronavirus lockdown measures,TUI Travel,TUI Group,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Holiday firms and airlines have reported a surge in bookings since the plan for easing lockdown was unveiled.\nDespite questions over the return of international travel, the UK's biggest holiday firm, Tui, said bookings for foreign trips jumped 500% overnight.\nThe owner of UK-based holiday firms Hoseasons and Cottages.com said it sold a record 10,000 breaks.\nThe government said a decision on easing international travel would not happen until mid-May at the earliest.\nBut Tui said its bookings for July-onwards had soared with Greece, Spain and Turkey the most popular destinations.\nAmid uncertainty over when foreign travel will be allowed, some holidaymakers have their sights set on a UK break.\nSimon Altham, group chief commercial officer at Awaze, the company behind Hoseasons, said: \"Last year following similar announcements we saw bookings peak at one every 11 seconds, but this time demand has exceeded our expectations and comfortably broken that record.\"\nNat Sommers told the BBC she had booked a family trip to Yorkshire after Boris had announced his plans to ease lockdown.\n\"We'd been keeping our eye on a few places over the last few weeks in anticipation of lockdown being eased,\" she said.\n\"We just decided to go for it an book it in the hope that things would be back to relative normality come August.\"\nBoris Johnson has said a global travel taskforce would put forward a report by 12 April on how to return to international travel.\nThe government would then make a decision on removing restrictions on international travel, but not before 17 May at the earliest. \nAs the government has said dates could move for the start of international travel, Tui has said that anyone due to travel between 17 May and the end of June can change their booking to a later date without a fee.\nAndrew Flintham, managing director for Tui UK and Ireland, described the government's steps as \"positive\".\nThomas Cook said traffic to its website was up over 100% on Monday from 15:00 GMT onwards, with bookings \"flooding in\" for countries such as Greece, Cyprus, Mexico and the Dominican Republic.\n\"The government's announcement today is good news for those of us desperate to get away on holiday,\" said Thomas Cook's chief executive Alan French.  \n\"While we await more details, it's clear that the government's ambition is to open up international travel in the coming months and hopefully in time for the summer holidays.\"\nThere was a big leap in family bookings for the summer holidays, especially for August, as well as people booking for the October half term and Christmas, a Thomas Cook spokesman said.\nEasyJet reported a 337% surge in flight bookings and a 630% jump in holiday bookings for locations such as Alicante, Malaga, Palmo, Faro and Crete. \nThe airline's chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said Boris Johnson's announcement had \"provided a much-needed boost in confidence\" for its UK customers.\n\"We have consistently seen that there is pent up demand for travel and this surge in bookings shows that this signal from the government that it plans to reopen travel has been what UK consumers have been waiting for,\" he said. \nTour operator and airline Jet2 also reported a 1,000% increase in bookings in the 24 hours following the prime minister's announcement. Popular destinations include Spain, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, with a notable spike in demand from July onwards.\nIts chief executive, Steve Heapy, said: \"The government's announcement is the news [holidaymakers] have been longing for, and the continued surge in bookings shows how ready our customers are to get away to the sunshine on a real package holiday.\"\nWhile bookings are high, there are still plenty of questions about how international travel will resume - and no guarantees that it will start again in mid-May.\nThe industry has seen restrictions put on top of restrictions over the last few months, with visitors from entire continents banned, the introduction of quarantine hotels and multiple tests required.  \nRemoving them will take some careful unpicking. \nThe government has said that any removal will depend on the location of concerning variants, progress of vaccine rollouts here and abroad as well as death rates and hospital admissions.\nIt's also not just about us. Other countries will need to agree to allow British tourists in. But after fears they could be left off the roadmap, the travel industry is keen to make this plan and these dates work. \nAmanda Matthews, managing director and owner of Ramsbottom-based luxury travel agency network Designer Travel, said her firm had seen double the number of enquiries and new bookings for the summer. \n\"But we've also had hundreds of calls from people who've got bookings for travel in March, April, May and June - still very uncertain about whether they will be travelling or not,\" she told the BBC. \n\"Because there's no concrete date yet for the reopening of international travel, as a travel agent, we can't answer our existing clients' questions about holidays they've already booked for spring and summer. We've got no idea.\"\nWhile the roadmap has provided hope for summer holidays, retail expert Kate Hardcastle said there was also \"huge disappointment\" for the travel industry - particularly among domestic overnight accommodation providers such as mobile home holiday parks and holiday cottage providers.\n\"Easter is obviously a critical part of the travel calendar for travel agencies and the industry, so it's a lost opportunity, one less holiday to be able to sell within,\" she told the BBC.\n\"I also know a lot of families are dependent on Easter holidays as it tends to be cheaper and more cost effective than the summer holidays. It would be awful to think that some people are completely priced out of a holiday this year.\"\nBut data from hotel technology company Avvio suggests a heyday for upmarket UK hotels, with August revenue for 4- and 5-star hotels more than tripling as would-be holiday makers bank on domestic breaks being more likely.\nOn Tuesday, global hotels group InterContinental Hotels, which owns the Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn brands, said the sector was unlikely to see a recovery until later this year, dependent on vaccine rollouts.\n\"2021 has begun with many of these challenges still in place,\" chief executive Keith Barr said, as the company unveiled a $260m (\u00a3185m) loss."

      "tags": "Facebook,Australia",
      "text": "Facebook has announced it will restore news content to its users in Australia.\nThe tech giant has blocked news to Australians on its platform since last Thursday amid a dispute over a proposed law which would force it and Google to pay news publishers for content.\nAustralian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg had told him the ban would end \"in the coming days\", after the pair had talks.\nMr Frydenberg said amendments would be made to the law.\n\"Facebook has re-friended Australia,\" he told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday. \nThe government has been debating the law - seen as a possible test case for regulation globally - in the Senate, after it was passed in the lower house last week.\nLast Thursday, Australians woke up to find they could not access or share any news stories on their accounts. \nFacebook argued it had been forced to block Australian news in response to the proposed legislation.\nThe government's news code aims to set up a \"fairer\" negotiation process between the tech giants and news companies over the value of news content.\nBut it has been strongly opposed by Facebook and Google - both argue the code misunderstands how the internet works. Facebook has also said it gets little commercial gain from news content.\nBut the Australian government says the code is needed to \"level the playing field\" for news publishers, which have seen profits slump in the internet age. \nBy Tuesday evening it was reported that multiple companies, including the Guardian Australia and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, had resumed talks with the social media giant. \nSeven West Media, a large media company, then announced in a statement they had signed a letter of intent to provide its news content to the platform after reaching an agreement. \nFacebook said on Tuesday that it had been reassured by recent discussions with the government.\n\"Going forward, the government has clarified we will retain the ability to decide if news appears on Facebook so that we won't automatically be subject to forced negotiation,\" said Campbell Brown, vice president of global news partnerships at Facebook.\n\"We have come to an agreement that will allow us to support the publishers we choose to, including small and local publishers.\"\nFacebook already has its own \"showcase\" product - Facebook News Tab - through which it pays media organisations a fee to display their stories on its platform. This feature however, is only available in the UK and US. \nGoogle had also threatened to withdraw its primary search engine from Australia, but the company has recently agreed deals with local media companies.\nFacebook's move to ban Australian news was a big risk last week. It made global headlines - not least because it also initially restricted some government health-department and emergency services pages. \nSome have been perplexed by the move. Why would Facebook openly court such negative headlines? \nCritics called the move undemocratic - authoritarian even. There are claims that fake news on the platform increased since the ban - though that's difficult to prove. \nBut Facebook isn't the only voice to say these new laws are badly drafted. \nSir Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the web, said he was concerned that forcing companies to pay for certain content could make the internet \"unworkable\". \nThe proposed law was also seen by some as heavily influenced by the lobbying operations of media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp - which owns many of Australia's major newspapers. The law's intention was to protect struggling journalism, not to line the pockets of a media dynasty. \nThere does now appear to be movement on both sides. Crucially, Facebook objected to the idea of a \"forced negotiation' with news outlets, which it now believes is off the table. \nHowever although both sides have moved, and both will claim victory, this whole episode has damaged Facebook. \nPoliticians from across the world offered support to the Australian government - there were even accusations of bullying by the social network. \nAnd considering Facebook desperately doesn't want these laws replicated in other countries, antagonising Australia's allies may not have been the smartest of moves. \nThe government and Facebook have reached a compromise of sorts.\nAustralian authorities will introduce four further amendments, including one that means the government may not apply the code to Facebook if it can demonstrate a \"significant contribution\" to local journalism. \nThey include a two-month mediation period before government-enforced arbitration kicks in - giving parties more time to reach a private deal. \nAustralia's largest locally-owned company Nine Entertainment said it was \"pleased\" the government had found a compromise and was looking forward to resuming talks about a commercial arrangement.

      "title": "Covid: Why can't we unlock more quickly?",
      "tags": "Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The vaccine rollout is going well and cases have plummeted since lockdown began at the start of the year.\nAnd yet the road out of lockdown in England and elsewhere in the UK is slow and gradual.\nMinisters say they want to closely monitor the impact of each step before moving on to the next one. It is a process which will take four months at least.\nWhy is the government being so cautious?\nA key mantra in the lead up to the announcement is that each step forward must be irreversible. There must be no steps back. \nBut despite falling infection rates, the number of new daily cases still remains relatively high compared to summer and early autumn. It is still a very delicate position.\nPlus ministers have certainly been stung by the problems of last year, when the first unlocking saw areas in the North West and Midlands having restrictions quickly re-imposed.\nThen, during the autumn, some areas found themselves constantly moving up and down the tiers.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is adamant such chopping and changing cannot happen again. \"What we want to see is progress that is cautious, but irreversible.\"\nThe government has achieved its target of offering everyone over the age of 70 a jab by mid-February.\nIt means by the time schools open, the most vulnerable people in society should have built up a fair degree of immunity. But that still leaves significant numbers at risk.\nNearly half of those admitted to hospital with Covid are under 70. \nAnd with the numbers in hospital only just below the level they were at during the peak in the first wave, the NHS is not yet out of the woods.\nSchools are not considered a significant driver of infection. Cases still fell in November when England was in lockdown but schools remained open.\nBut there is still a concern re-opening them for all pupils could push up the rates. One of the big unknowns is the new more contagious variant which was not dominant back in November.\nResearch by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has predicted re-opening schools for all could push the R number - the average number of people an infected individual passes the virus on to - above one, prompting a growth in cases.\nThe break at Easter will provide an opportunity to assess the impact of the move - and is why ministers resisted calls to only send some year groups back.\nMutations are to be expected. Growing levels of immunity from further rollout of the vaccine will favour variants that can sneak past the vaccine.\nThat is because of what is known as selection advantage. Viruses change all the time, and the mutations that have an advantage will spread more easily.\nIn the future, when the population has a lot of immunity, mutations that can evade some of the immune response will be in a stronger position to spread.\nThat does not mean the mutations will render the vaccines completely ineffective - coronaviruses are more stable than flu, with which we see different strains circulating each year.\nBut experts have warned everything must be done to guard against mutation at such a delicate time.\nVaccinating when there is a lot of virus circulating is pretty unusual. Normally vaccines are given ahead of exposure.\nScientists believe having high levels of infection at a time when people are building up immunity will encourage mutations even more than normal. That, they warn, would be foolish.\nModelling carried out for the government by Imperial College London has looked at what would happen if there was a quick unlocking.\nIt suggested if restrictions were lifted by the end of April, there could be a surge in deaths in the coming months.\nAnd by next summer another 80,000 Covid fatalities could be seen.\nThe government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, says: \"The sooner you open up everything, the greater the risk of a resurgence. The slower the better.\"\nBut such modelling is by its very nature full of uncertainty, because of the assumptions that have to be made.\nFor example, this modelling has not taken into account seasonality.\nWould there really be a surge in the summer when people are outdoors and respiratory viruses tend not to thrive? \nIt is a risk ministers are simply not prepared to take. \nIn taking this approach, though, it is quite conceivable the government could quickly find itself under pressure.\nThe restrictions will continue to have a huge impact on people's lives and livelihoods for months to come.\nIf re-opening schools does not prompt a rise in cases, if the warmer weather helps and the vaccine impact really begins to kick in, infections and hospital admissions could fall to very low levels.\nA key phrase used in the lead up to the roadmap being unveiled was the importance of \"data not dates\".\nThat works both ways.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "tags": "Chris Whitty,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says that falling Covid-19 deaths in care homes and among the oldest Scots is the first \"hard evidence\" the vaccination programme is working. So, can this drop in deaths be attributed to the vaccine?\nFirst, it's worth looking at the progress made in vaccinating the oldest people in Scotland.\nAnd in short, progress has been good.\nAll residents in care homes for older people have now been vaccinated with a first dose - more than 30,000 people - according to Scottish government figures.\nFirst doses for this group were completed last week, with the bulk of the vaccinations being done in late December and the first half of January.\nUsing Public Health Scotland data, we can also see how many people in each age group have been vaccinated.\nThe Scottish government is vaccinating groups of people in line with the priorities set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, so older people have been first in line for the jab.\nNeither the Pfizer nor Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have an immediate effect.\nThe jabs will take two to three weeks to provide some level of protection, with maximum protection following administration of the second dose several weeks later.\nBecause of that, an instant drop in care home deaths would not be expected.\nHowever, the latest National Records of Scotland data shows that Covid deaths in care homes are falling as a proportion of the total number of deaths.\nIn the week beginning 28 December, 33% of all Covid deaths were in care homes. This figure has fallen every week since and last week reached 13%.\nThere were 42 Covid-19 deaths in care homes between 8 and 14 February, out of a total of 323 deaths.\nUsing NRS data, we can also see the number of deaths in each age group.\nLooking at the older age groups only, there are rises across all ages from late December, with a marked decline in deaths in the oldest age group towards the end of January.\nThe NRS counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19 and weekly deaths seem to have risen to a peak in mid-January.\nSince then, weekly deaths have fallen by about 29% overall, whereas deaths in the 85+ age group have seen a 45% cut.\nBBC News analysis, using data from England only also suggests the vaccine is starting to push the numbers down.\nCoronavirus deaths are falling faster for vaccinated than unvaccinated groups.\nOn average, deaths of over-80s fell by 53% between 28 January and 11 February, compared with 44% for under-80s.\nAt this stage, it's difficult to say for certain if the data shows \"hard evidence\" that the vaccination programme is working.\nReferring to the English figures this week, Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, said: \"The earliest indications would imply there is some effect.\n\"But I think it's too early to put a number on that. We would expect to see some evidence that is strong enough to put into the public domain in the next few weeks.\"\nScotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, strikes a similar note of caution.\n\"The care homes data is really good. It's the first signs that the vaccination is doing in the wild, what it did in the trials,\" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland.\n\"It's a little bit too early to say that's going to happen across all ages and all populations. So we have to be cautious.\"\nThe suppression of the virus by the current lockdown will undoubtedly be having an effect on the number of deaths. As the number of cases goes down, so the number of hospital admissions and deaths will fall.\nThis is exactly what happened in the spring, when deaths reached very low levels following the restrictions introduced in March.\nSince most of Scotland has been in full lockdown since the beginning of January - with a corresponding cut in case numbers - it is hard to disentangle this from the vaccine effect.\nBut the marked fall in care home deaths and in the over-85 age groups is encouraging, and as in England, gives some indication the vaccination programme is working."

      "text": "The Scottish government has announced a further easing of the Covid rules.\nGuidance urging people to work from home wherever possible is to be relaxed in favour of a \"hybrid\" system of office and remote working from Monday 31 January.\nRestrictions on large outdoor events came to an end on 17 January, then rules on indoor events and venues, including the need for table service in hospitality premises, were lifted on 24 January.\nNew guidance on working from home will come into effect on Monday 31 January.\nThis will recommend that employers consider a hybrid working system, with staff spending some time in the office and some time at home.\nBusinesses had previously been asked to enable staff to work from home where possible.\nThe requirement for physical distancing in settings where certain people are exempt from wearing face coverings - like those leading religious services or carrying out some receptionist duties - will be reduced from 2m to 1m from 31 January.\nAnd face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities with children under the age of five.\nFrom Friday 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to take a test after they arrive in Scotland.\nThose who are not fully vaccinated will still have to take a pre-departure test no more than two days before they travel, then take a PCR test on or before day two after their arrival.\nA raft of new measures introduced in December in response to the spread of the Omicron variant have already been removed.\nThese included limits on the number of people who could attend large public events; restrictions in pubs, restaurants and other indoor public places; and the closure of nightclubs.\nAdults and children aged 12 and over still have to wear face coverings in all the same indoor settings as before, such as shops, hospitality venues and public transport.\nBusinesses are legally required to take steps to reduce the spread of Covid, including physical distancing and screens.\nIn hospitality, face coverings can be removed while dancing, drinking and dining. Indoor venues are required to reduce crowding and collect the contact details of customers to help with Test and Protect.\nRetail and other sectors also have to ensure social distancing and manage customer flow.\nThe two-metre distancing rule remains in healthcare settings such as hospitals, doctors' surgeries and dentists.\nA vaccine passport scheme was introduced last year for entry to:\nUnder the scheme, anyone over the age of 18 must show proof - if asked - that they are fully vaccinated, or a negative lateral flow test.\nIf it is more than four months since your second jab you will need to show proof of a booster to be classed as fully vaccinated. The app has been updated to include boosters.\nProof of a negative LFD test will be needed before people can visit someone in hospital or a care home, or accompany someone to a medical appointment.\nPeople who test positive for Covid in Scotland will be allowed to exit self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests.\nThe first of these tests must be taken on the sixth day after testing positive and then at least 24 hours later. \nIn addition, household contacts of people with the virus can take a lateral flow test every day for seven days rather than going into self-isolation.\nThis applies to everyone in the household under the age of 18 or anyone over that age who has had the first, second and booster Covid jabs. \nIf one of these tests is positive, self-isolation will then be required for that person.\nAnyone identified as a close contact who is over 18 and four months old and not fully vaccinated will still be asked to self-isolate for 10 days and take a PCR test.\nFor those with symptoms of Covid, the advice remains to book a PCR test.\nHowever, people returning a positive lateral flow test who have no symptoms will no longer be required to take a PCR test to confirm the result. \nInstead, they will be asked to isolate immediately and report their result online so that Test and Protect can start the contact tracing process.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said no changes to the guidance for schools were being recommended at this stage - although this was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nPupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the one-metre social distancing rule is still in place.\nMs Sturgeon said young people wanted to see the back of masks as soon as possible, but that many understood they provided \"important protection\". She said the issue \"requires and will receive careful consideration\".\nAll secondary school children are being asked to take a lateral flow test twice a week. \nWhole classes no longer need to self-isolate when a pupil tests positive, with only the closest contacts of positive cases required to test and isolate.\nCarbon dioxide monitors - which assess how well-ventilated a space is - are also required in schools and childcare settings.\nUniversity and college students are being asked to test twice a week and before socialising with other households.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

The summer term starts on 12 April.\nThe first minister has previously suggested self-catering accommodation could reopen in time for Easter and non-essential retail could resume on 15 March.\nAt first minister's question time, Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: \"How can you allow, if there's any headroom going through the month of March, for schoolchildren to remain out of school and [also] be opening up other parts of the economy by lifting the restrictions?\"\nMr Drakeford said: \"We will return students to schools as fast as it is safe to do so.

Now they have some rough indication, pencilled in to the calendar, but far from all of them, and with distancing still required.\nIn contrast with Boris Johnson's approach for England, Nicola Sturgeon's statement at Holyrood was not a route map to a late summer of socialising, concerts, sports and travel. \nThe plan is far more cautious. Nicola Sturgeon's idea of release, maybe by late April, is to get through the doors of a restaurant or bar.\nBoth leaders had said they were putting data ahead of dates, but it was the prime minister's dates that the public notice, remember and plan on. Travel bookings soared on Monday and Tuesday.\nScotland's first minister is warning that dates are not much better than \"a finger in the wind\", and depend on a lot of data variables to reach each point. Scotland's travel and tourism industry isn't being given much to plan on.\nSo by the final week of April, the mainland and most islands may be allowed to ease off, but only to level three. \nThat should mean pubs and restaurants can reopen, but with tight constraints.\nWhen does it mean you can book a holiday in another part of Scotland? We don't know, but we do know the answer will vary around Scotland. Unlike England, it's returning to regions and council areas to determine where rules can be relaxed and where they can't.\nWhat about a foreign holiday? There's nothing in the new plan that even indicates an end to hotel isolation for inbound travellers.\nCan Scotland's events sector get to work with planning festivals? Not for \"a considerable period ahead\", according to the Scottish government framework, and it promises to work with sector representatives to get to their own route map.\nIt's only after running through the educational, health and social priorities for easing lockdown that the Scottish government's strategy reaches business support. Funding continues, in grant schemes funded through Holyrood and councils.\nIncome support schemes, including furlough, are expected to get another lease of life from Rishi Sunak in his Westminster budget next week. \nGrants for firms forced to close in Scotland are to be run four weeks past their reopening day, and some may be further tapered after that. \nBusiness bosses complain, however, the grants don't go far enough and furlough comes with employer costs. \nTo continue burning through cash will be a severe stretch for many firms, still looking into a cloudy and uncertainty future beyond April."

I dealt with that to the best of my ability and I think I made the right judgements overall.\"\nMs Sturgeon said the government \"did make a mistake in the application of its procedure\" for handling complaints, and said it would \"reflect on the lessons of that\".\nBut she insisted the new policy had been drawn up in response to \"the global MeToo movement\", not Mr Salmond.\nThis echoes evidence given to the committee by Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans - Scotland's top civil servant - who told MSPs that the government was not out to \"get Alex Salmond\".\nMs Sturgeon said she still had full confidence in Ms Evans, and that she expected her to remain in post for the duration of her current contract."

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nEverybody has to \"play their part\" to meet the dates for England's lockdown to be eased, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. It comes after Boris Johnson outlined his four-step strategy that could see restrictions lifted by 21 June - if strict conditions are met. Lockdown will start to end in England on 8 March, when schools reopen, and two people are allowed to meet outdoors. On 29 March, six people, or two households, will be able to meet outdoors - including in private gardens. Non-essential retail and outdoor hospitality are due to open on 12 April, with all restrictions due to end by 21 June. Meanwhile in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon will reveal her plan to end lockdown later today.\nUnder Mr Johnson's plan, international travel will not return until 17 May at the earliest - but that hasn't put people off booking. Tui reported their best day of bookings in over a month, with strong interest in Greece, Spain and Turkey for the summer. Thomas Cook said traffic to its website was up over 100% on Monday from 15:00 GMT onwards. EasyJet also reported a 337% surge in flight bookings and a 630% jump in holiday bookings. Mr Johnson said a global travel taskforce would put forward a report on how to return to international travel on 12 April.\nThe rate of unemployment in the UK rose to 5.1% in the three months to December, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that was 1.3 percentage points higher than for the same period in 2019, before the pandemic. There was better news on pay - allowing for inflation, regular pay in October to December was up 3.3% up on the previous year.\nPresident Joe Biden has addressed the nation as the US marks 500,000 deaths from Covid-19, the highest toll of any country in the world. \"As a nation, we can't accept such a cruel fate... we have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow,\" he said.

      "title": "Covid-19: PM promises review on issues of vaccine passports",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There are \"deep and complex issues\" with using vaccine passports or certificates to prove someone's Covid \"status\", Boris Johnson has said.\nAnnouncing a review of the proposal, he said using certificates to allow visits to venues such as pubs and theatres was a \"novelty for our country\".\nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove will lead the review.\nMr Johnson said he was \"very optimistic\" most Covid restrictions in England can be lifted on 21 June.\nVaccine passports have been discussed by countries, including Greece, and operators such as Saga Cruises, as a way to safely reopen international leisure travel.\nBut ministers have frequently appeared to dismiss introducing a similar scheme domestically within the UK for hospitality or leisure activities.\nIt comes as Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said - if all goes to plan - she expects to see a phased but significant reopening of the Scottish economy in the last week of April.\nA further 8,489 coronavirus cases were recorded across the UK on Tuesday and 548 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total by that measure to 121,305.\nMore than 17.9 million people across the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, according to latest government figures.\nSpeaking during a visit to a south London school, Mr Johnson said the UK had \"never thought in terms of having something that you have to show to go to a pub or a theatre\".\nHe said there were \"ethical issues\" about the role of government \"in mandating\u2026 or banning people from doing such a thing\".\nHe added: \"We can't be discriminatory against people who can't have the vaccine, there might be a medical reason, or some people may genuinely refuse to have one - I think that's a mistake.\"\nBut the prime minister said it was possible to consider the issue at the same time as the rollout of the vaccine.\nIt is understood the review will not just consider vaccination history alone, with the possibility of negative Covid tests being recorded to gain access to some events or services, if required by the organisers. \nOne option could see the NHS app used to record both, with an individual then able to show their status on the app if required.\nThe government previously said it would consider how to facilitate Covid certificates for people who needed to travel to other countries which demanded them.\nThe review's findings are hoped to be available before the final stage of England's lockdown easing on 21 June, the earliest date by which ministers hope most Covid measures can end.\nBBC political correspondent Jessica Parker said the review marked a change of position from ministers but that, with businesses already looking at ways they could keep workers and customers safe, the government was looking to get ahead of things.\n\"The conversation was just happening anyway. Businesses were looking at ways to make their workplaces safe, organisations were looking at ways to try to make their customers safe and the government risked not being part of that conversation but eventually being brought into it anyway,\" she said.\nA No 10 spokesman said an international consensus needed to be built on how to allow greater foreign travel, which the UK was seeking to achieve via the G7 and other multilateral discussions. \n\"It will be for different countries to determine their own regimes in relation to the quarantine and who they want to allow in, and we want to try and work together to get some sort of international framework,\" he said.\nGreek tourism minister Haris Theoharis told the BBC last week that early technical discussions were under way with UK officials about how a potential passport scheme might work.\nSaga Cruises announced last month it would require all travellers to prove they had received two vaccine doses before departure.\n\"You will be required to bring the vaccination document and/or evidence with you as proof at the time of boarding,\" its website said.\nHolidays in the UK or abroad are not currently permitted under coronavirus restrictions. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said a review of how to return to international travel while managing risk from imported cases and virus variants would report on 12 April.\nMeanwhile, holiday firms and airlines have reported a surge in bookings since plans for easing lockdown in England were unveiled on Monday.\nLabour shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds told the BBC a review of vaccine passports was \"sensible\" but said it should be \"conclusive\" and consider all the evidence available.\nChristopher Dye, professor of epidemiology at Oxford University, told the BBC that vaccine passports would \"certainly be helpful in releasing the lockdown\" but they should not \"make things worse for people of lesser means\".\nMr Johnson said his roadmap for easing lockdown measures, laid out on Monday, was \"a cautious but irreversible approach\".\nDue to the vaccine programme, the country could \"look at that 21 June date with some optimism\".\nMr Johnson said each phase of unlocking restrictions -  such as children going back to school -  would be \"adding to the budget of risk\". \nThis is why time was needed between measures to \"observe\" the impact, he added.\nEarlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he wanted measures to become a \"matter of personal responsibility and social norms\" that could see people choosing to wear masks on public transport.\nThe devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions.\nOutlining her own roadmap, Ms Sturgeon said she hoped to end stay at home restrictions from 5 April in Scotland.\nMeanwhile in Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he hopes the country's \"stay-at-home\" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time.\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster wants its executive to discuss the reopening date for schools following Mr Johnson's announcement in England."

      "title": "Covid: Why has Boris Johnson opted for caution on lockdown rules?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Imagine if, at the first coronavirus briefing in Downing Street last year, Boris Johnson had said that he would put limits on our lives and the economy for 15 months. \nImagine that he had, a week later, instead of saying that the tide could be turned in 12 weeks, said we should prepare for kids to be out of school, that most shops would be closed on and off for months, that families who don't live near each other might not be able to see each other either, that some of the most vulnerable would have to shield at home, from the disease, for all of that time. \nYou would hardly have believed it. He would hardly have believed it either.\nThe prime minister's trademark used to be optimism - accused often of bluffing over detail to hope for the political best. \nYet as Mr Johnson tries to steer the country towards the exit in the second year of this pandemic, that habit is not much in evidence. \nHe has accepted, at the insistence of the chief medical officer, there will be long gaps between the steps out of lockdown. \nAlso, despite the remarkable progress, and excited rhetoric around the vaccine, there was an important acknowledgement from Mr Johnson too, that it will never reach everyone. \nThe \"significant minority\" who will never take the vaccine will still therefore pose a risk. \nAnd while he has repeatedly promised the steps out of lockdown will be \"irreversible\", inside government of course there is an awareness that is just not the case. \nEveryone fervently hopes this is the last time but an aggressive and unforeseen variant of the disease could interrupt that plan.  \nSome massive upset with the vaccine rollout could knock things off course. \nEven the limited easing up will lead to an increase in cases, and if that is more dramatic than hoped, the brakes could of course go back on. \nDramatic changes in the public's behaviour could also make a difference in the wrong way. \nAnd the government also retains the right to bring back aggressive local lockdowns if infections surge in particular areas. \nBut Mr Johnson's strongest motivation for the go-slow is the determination that this national lockdown can, should, and will be the last. \nWith a belief too that much of the public will be perhaps not content, but willing, to wait that bit longer for a drink with friends if it means children can go back to school and stay there. \nHis calculation is that people, after all this time, will prefer certainty over haste. \nThat's why the prime minister won't be persuaded to go faster by some of his own restless backbenches. \nThat's why other parts of government, even those eager to pull back restrictions, worried about the costs of all this, concede to hurry would be wrong this time. \nAnd that's why Mr Johnson, right now at least, is playing the role of a leader for whom caution is number one. \nA mantle this long pandemic has lent him - a political persona that also, would have been almost impossible to imagine last year. \nP.s. A huge amount of information did emerge today about the road ahead for England, but there were also really big gaps. \nThere was no firm advice on when the millions of people who have been working at home will be expected to go back into the office. \nNo solid expectations of when foreign travel will come back, when the social distancing rules could be relaxed, or whether the government might really introduce some kind of vaccine certification after all (despite previous suggestions that they would not). \nAlongside the plans are several reviews that will shape much of what happens in the next few months. \nThe government, as well as Holyrood, Belfast and Cardiff, still has many big decisions to take.

      "title": "Daft Punk announce split after 28 years",
      "tags": "Music",
      "text": "Daft Punk, who were responsible for some of the most influential dance tracks of all time, have announced their retirement after nearly 30 years.\nThe duo broke the news in a typically-enigmatic video, titled Epilogue.\nIn the clip, musicians Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, dressed in their iconic robot costumes, bid each other farewell in the desert, before one of them self-destructed.\nThe band's longtime publicist confirmed the split to the BBC.\nFormed in Paris in 1993, the group brought the French underground house scene into the charts with hits like One More Time, Da Funk and Around The World.\nTheir debut album, Homework, is considered a landmark in dance music; while they scored a worldwide hit in 2013 with the retro-disco single Get Lucky, featuring Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers.\nThe song was taken from their most recent record, Random Access Memories, which won the Grammy for album of the year in 2014.\nSince then, the band have kept a relatively low profile - although they collaborated with R&B star The Weeknd on two tracks, Starboy and I Feel It Coming, in 2016.\nFamously publicity-shy, the musicians were seldom seen in public without their robot headgear, and used processed, computerised vocals on almost all of their biggest hits.\n\"We're not performers, we're not models - it would not be enjoyable for humanity to see our features,\" de Homem-Christo once told Rolling Stone magazine, \"but the robots are exciting to people.\"\nAs they called time on their career, dozens of artists recognised Daft Punk's impact on dance music. \n\"Eternally grateful,\" wrote Christine and the Queens on Twitter.  \"Thank you Daft Punk for everything! We will miss you!\" added Swedish DJ Alesso. \n\"Thankful to be a part of the journey,\" said The Weeknd on his Instagram Story.\nBangalter and de Homem-Christo met at school in Paris, and began making music together as teenagers alongside Laurent Brancowicz - later of the indie band Phoenix.\nOriginally called Darlin', the trio released some incredibly basic garage rock songs on a UK compilation album, Shimmies In Super 8, in 1993. \nA review in Melody Maker called the music \"a daft punky thrash\" - indirectly christening the band's second incarnation.\nPretty soon, they had abandoned rock for dance music. A subsequent Darlin' song called Untitled 18 sampled David Bowie's Starman and marked their first experimentation with robotic vocals.\nA year later, they passed a cassette of their music to Stuart MacMillan, co-founder of the Scottish techno label Soma, at a rave in Disneyland Paris. On it was the first official Daft Punk song - The New Wave, an uncompromising techno assault on the senses which Soma released in 1994.\nBut it was Da Funk's infectiously zany mix of G-funk and acid house that really put them on the map.\nOriginally pressed in a limited run of 2,000 12-inch records, it was virtually ignored until The Chemical Brothers started playing it in their DJ sets. By the end of 1995, it had sold 30,000 copies and as voted song of the year by French club magazine Soda.\nA record label bidding war ensued, with the band eventually signing to Virgin Records and releasing Homework - recorded in Bangalter's bedroom - in 1996. \nThere was something cartoonish about the band's early singles that compensated for the anonymity of the men behind them. It was an idea compounded by Michel Gondry's mesmerising video for Around The World, where every instrument is represented by a groups of dancers (skeletons represent the guitar line, mummies act out the drum pattern and synchronised swimmers are the synths).\nIt took three years for the band to record a follow-up, during which time Bangalter also scored a major hit - Music Sounds Better with You - with his side project Stardust.\nDiscovery, released in 2001, was almost wilfully anti-cool, steeped in references to 70s disco and 80s crooners. At one point it even samples Barry Manilow's Who's Been Sleeping in My Bed.\nBut the band chopped, spliced, filtered and filleted those sounds to create audacious new songs, with a sense of fun and showmanship that dance music often lacks. If you can listen to the ridiculous guitar arpeggios of Aerodynamic or the party-starting chants of Crescendolls without cracking a smile, they seemed to be saying, maybe it's you who's the robot.\nThe album's most enduring song, however, is Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.  \nBased entirely around Edwin Birdsong's Cola Bottle Baby, a forgotten 70s funk track, it adds a simple vocal line (\"Work it harder, make it better / Do it faster, makes us stronger\") that is twisted and manipulated in increasingly inventive ways until it's barely recognisable as anything but signal noise.\nKanye West later lifted the track and used it as the basis for his own song, Stronger. Daft Punk were unaware of the sample until they heard it on the radio in Los Angeles.\n\"The DJ had made an edit of our song at the beginning and then it turned into his song,\" de Homem-Christo told Billboard in 2007. \n\"Our song had a good sound, but when he put Kanye's record on, the sound was really fat. It sounds really big. It's not a collaboration in the studio, but the vibe of the music we do separately connected in what he did with the song.\"\nAnother four years passed before the release of their third and least essential album, Human After All, after which they wrote the soundtrack to Disney's sci-fi sequel Tron: Legacy.\nThey returned to form with 2013's Random Access Memories - a lush, opulent tribute to the music they grew up with, recorded entirely on live instruments, and featuring guest appearances from Chic's Nile Rodgers, Muppets composer Paul Williams and disco innovator Giorgio Moroder, who narrated his own life story over nine minutes of interlocking dance grooves.\nThe album, which cost more than a million dollars to make, was preceded by the hit single Get Lucky. Speaking to NPR, Bangalter said the song represented the record's theme of connecting the past, present and future of dance music.\n\"It was somehow maybe a child's dream to possibly one day be able to make music with one of the musicians we really love,\" he explained.\n\"So Get Lucky is really about this encounter between Nile [Rodgers] and also Pharrell Williams, [who] we've been friends with and which we've worked with in the past, but about really teaming up and getting outside of our home studio and really reaching out to other musicians and performers and making music and having fun in the studio making music together.\"\nThe album brought the duo to a whole new audience, but now it also appears to be a full stop. The end point in their disco odyssey.\nThe video announcing their split was based on an excerpt from their 2006 film Electroma. \nAs one of the robot bodies disintegrated, a caption appeared stating \"1993 - 2021\". The clip closed with one of the musicians walking into the sunset, accompanied by the song Touch, including the choral refrain: \"Hold on. If love is the answer you're home.\"\nThe band's publicist Kathryn Frazier offered no explanation for the break-up - but fans flooded social media with tributes.\nFrench media tracking service Visibrain said there were 27 tweets posted every second about the band on Monday afternoon.\nPharrell Williams was among them, simply posting the phrase: \"Forever legends\". \n\"Daft Punk left the game with a flawless legacy. I would say enviable but impossibly unattainable is more appropriate,\" said Mark Ronson.\nProducer Erol Alkan wrote, \"Respect to Thomas and Guy-Man. Farewell\"; while Dutch DJ Don Diablo thanked the duo \"for inspiring me to make music when I was a kid\".\n\"THE greatest to EVER do it,\" said UK dance act Disclosure. \"Words can't describe the inspiration & knowledge we gained from listening to the 2 robots over the years. Wishing them nothing but good energy & positivity for the future.\"\n\"As a French producer its hard to describe the huge impact Daft Punk had on my life, my music and career,\" added DJ/producer Habstrakt. \"Thank you for forever changing the landscape of music.\"\n\"Daft Punk's Discovery album was critical to my development.\" said Maurice Peebles, editor-in-chief of Complex magazine. \"[It] opened up an entire universe I didn't know existed. forever grateful.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "A million high-grade masks used in the NHS may not meet the right safety standards and have been withdrawn. \nThe Department of Health told the BBC there are 1.12 million of these masks either in use or in hospital stores and has told staff to stop using them.\nDistribution of some gloves has also been suspended because they may not meet technical requirements.\nThe Department of Health said safety of frontline staff was an absolute priority.\nIts warning concerns a specific brand of FFP3 mask, which are more sophisticated than surgical masks and are worn in intensive care or when certain procedures are carried out that can generate aerosols.  \nThese are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19.\nThe British Medical Association appealed last month for staff on general wards to be given this type of mask to guard against coronavirus infection.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care's (DHSC) alert last week warned that a certain type of FFP3 -  branded \"Fang Tian\" and marked as FT-045 - may not meet the required technical specifications.\nIt advised health and care providers to check to see if their stock included the product and to stop using them until further investigation.\nThe alert said the masks were provided by Polyco Healthline, but the manufacturer Suzhou Fangtian Industries told the BBC it had never supplied the firm. \nThe BBC has approached Polyco Healthline for comment but has not heard back. \nThe DHSC told BBC News the affected 1.12 million masks was a very small proportion of its overall stocks.\nThese masks make up approximately 4% of its overall stock, the department said, and about 1.7% of the masks used every day. \nA spokesman said there was a \"resilient supply\" of FFP3 masks to ensure staff had access to the PPE they needed.\nThe DHSC also issued an alert about \"nitri-hand\" non-sterile nitrile examination gloves - 27 million of these have been supplied by Full Support Group since June last year.\nThe packaging for the gloves is understood to say they had not been tested for resistance to virus.\nBut the supplier, Full Support Group, told BBC News they had in fact passed the test and the packaging should have been amended.\n\"We are confident that the gloves in question, having been checked and confirmed that they meet the requirements, will be released from quarantine as soon as the administrative process has been completed,\" a spokesman from the supplier said.\nHe added that Full Support had successfully supplied the NHS since 2002. \nThe DHSC said the batch of gloves represented a very small proportion of overall supply. \nBut Rob Harwood, BMA consultants committee chairman, said it was \"unacceptable if staff's safety is still being jeopardised by inadequate PPE\" a year into the pandemic.\n\"Healthcare staff working on the frontline do so facing the grave risk of contracting Covid, and deserve the best protection from this deadly virus,\" he said.\n\"Many will be incredibly concerned to learn that some masks designed to offer enhanced protection, as well as gloves, may not meet standards, potentially placing them at greater risk.\"\nHe said it was \"good\" to see immediate action but \"urgent clarification\" was needed to explain \"how they entered the supply chain\".\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said: \"Our priority is providing frontline staff with quality PPE that meets robust quality requirements, and we have delivered nearly eight billion items so far.\n\"We carry out extensive due diligence on all PPE items before release, and where an issue is identified we act quickly to isolate the relevant product and conduct the appropriate investigations.\"\nBBC News has been investigating the purchase of PPE for NHS staff since the beginning of the pandemic. \nIt has previously revealed how millions of face masks bought by the UK government could not be used in the NHS as intended. \nLast week the High Court ruled that Health Secretary Matt Hancock had acted unlawfully when his department did not reveal details of contracts it had agreed during the pandemic within 30 days of them being signed.  \nUpdate: The DHSC originally told the BBC 12 million face masks had been affected. It has since said this figure is incorrect, and the number is 1.12 million."

      "tags": "China,Uighurs,Canada",
      "text": "Canada's House of Commons has voted overwhelmingly to declare China's treatment of its Uighur minority population a genocide.\nThe motion - which passed 266 to 0 - was supported by all opposition parties and a handful of lawmakers from the governing Liberal Party.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau and most members of his cabinet abstained. \nThe motion makes Canada just the second country after the United States to recognise China's actions as genocide.\nLawmakers also voted to pass an amendment asking Canada to call on the International Olympic Committee to move the 2022 Winter Olympics from Beijing \"if the Chinese government continues this genocide\".\nChina responded late on Tuesday, saying it condemned and rejected Canada's motion, according to a Reuters report. It quoted foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin as saying that China had lodged \"stern representations\" with Canada. \nMr Trudeau has so far been hesitant to label China's actions against the Uighur minority in Xinjiang a genocide, calling the term \"extremely loaded\" and saying further examination was needed before a decision could be made. \nJust one member of his cabinet, Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau, appeared in parliament for the vote. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Garneau said he had abstained \"on behalf of the government of Canada\".  \nSpeaking ahead of the vote, opposition leader Erin O'Toole said the move was necessary to send a \"clear and unequivocal signal that we will stand up for human rights and the dignity of human rights, even if it means sacrificing some economic opportunity\".\nIn an open letter to Mr Trudeau earlier this month asking him to \"stand up to China\", Mr O'Toole noted the recent banning of BBC World News from China - a decision that followed a BBC report alleging systematic rape, sexual abuse and torture in China's \"re-education\" camps in Xinjiang. \nMonday's non-binding motion marks the latest escalation in Canada-China relations, which have soured over recent years. \nChina's ambassador to Canada Cong Peiwu had earlier told the Canadian Press that the motion was \"interfering in [China's] domestic affairs\".\n\"We firmly oppose that because it runs counter to facts,\" he said. \"There's nothing like genocide happening in Xinjiang at all.\"\nRights groups believe that China has detained up to a million Uighurs over the past few years in what the state defines as \"re-education camps\".\nBBC investigations suggest that Uighurs are being used as forced labour.\nCanada's symbolic motion does not lay out next steps, but says the Canadian government needs to follow the lead of its US neighbours.\nBoth the current and former US Secretaries of State, Anthony Blinken and Mike Pompeo, have declared that China's policies against Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in its western Xinjiang region constitute genocide."

      "text": "A new four-step plan to ease England's lockdown could see all legal limits on social contact lifted by 21 June, if strict conditions are met.\nShops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality could reopen on 12 April in England under plans set out by the PM.\nFrom 17 May, two households might be allowed to mix in homes, while the rule of six could apply in places like pubs.\nIt requires four tests on vaccines, infection rates and new coronavirus variants to be met at each stage.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs the plan aimed to be \"cautious but irreversible\" and at every stage decisions would be led by \"data not dates\".\nThere was \"no credible route to a zero-Covid Britain nor indeed a zero-Covid world\", he said.\nMr Johnson later told a Downing Street news conference the coming spring and summer would be \"seasons of hope, looking and feeling incomparably better for us all\".\nHe described the plan as a \"one-way road to freedom\" but said he could not guarantee it would be irreversible \"but the intention is that it should be\".\nIt comes as the first data on the UK's coronavirus vaccine rollout suggested it was having a \"spectacular\" impact on stopping serious illness.\nAs part of the first step of the plan for easing lockdown in England:\nSecondary school pupils can access tests and will be required to wear face coverings in classrooms and shared spaces like corridors.\nThere will be a gap of at least five weeks between each of the plan's subsequent steps to allow for the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed.\nThe second step from 12 April would see major parts of the economy permitted to reopen:\nBut wider social contact rules will continue to apply in all settings - meaning no indoor mixing between different households will be allowed.\nMr Johnson confirmed the end of hospitality curfews - and requirements to eat a substantial meal alongside alcohol.\nHe said a review of international leisure travel restrictions would be announced by 12 April at the earliest.\nFunerals continue with up to 30 people, and weddings with up to 15 guests.\nThe third step will come from 17 May - if the data allows - and will see the \"rule of six\" abolished for outdoor gatherings, replaced with a limit of 30 people:\nUp to 30 people will be able to attend weddings, receptions, funerals and wakes.\nMr Johnson said this step would also \"consider the potential role of Covid status certification\" - which could refer to so-called \"vaccine passports\" - in helping indoor venues to reopen safely.\nBefore the fourth step, ministers will carry out a review into social distancing and other \"long-term measures\" designed to reduce transmission, including the \"one metre plus\" rule and the wearing of face coverings.\nThey will also consider whether to lift the \"work from home\" guidance, which the government says people should continue to follow until the review has been completed.\nThe fourth step from 21 June will potentially see all legal limits on social contact removed, with the final closed sectors of the economy reopened - such as nightclubs.\nThe government hopes that - from this date - restrictions on weddings and funerals will also be abolished.\nMusic and events leaders called for more financial support for the sector, with the boss of one live music trade body saying his industry is \"at the back of the queue to re-open\" once restrictions are lifted.\nMPs will vote on the roadmap in late March.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the plan but said certainty was needed over the future of the government furlough scheme for both businesses and workers.\nProf Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, said he thought the roadmap struck the \"right balance\" - but warned reopening schools risks increasing the number of cases reported each day.\nSpeaking later at the Downing Street briefing, UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was \"very important\" to leave a gap of five weeks between the changes in the roadmap to avoid \"flying blind\".\nSir Patrick also said \"baseline\" measures - such as face coverings in certain situations, hand washing, and self-isolation - may be necessary next winter.\nThe vaccines are working well and infection levels have fallen to a fifth of what they were since the start of the year.\nSo why, many may ask, is there such caution?\nThe answer lies in the mountain of data published by the government as it unveiled its roadmap.\nAmong the documents was modelling done by Imperial College London.\nIt showed a rapid easing of restrictions could lead to surge in deaths over the summer and a total of 80,000 deaths by the middle of 2022.\nThere is much uncertainty about scenarios like this - for one thing it did not take into account any seasonal impact that the warmer weather could bring by reducing spread of the virus.\nThe gradual lifting could, by comparison, reduce that to around 30,000. That would bring it in line with the sort of deaths we could see during a bad flu winter.\nUK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty says that should be the context in which we judge Covid now.\nThe devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions but have largely moved in the same direction, though at different speeds, during the pandemic.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland would return to a tiered system of restrictions when lockdown measures are eased.\nIt means different parts of the country could be under different rules. Ms Sturgeon added that she would set out the likely phases for a gradual lifting of restrictions on Tuesday. \nIn Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he hopes the \"stay-at-home\" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. \nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster wants its executive to discuss the reopening date for schools following Mr Johnson's announcement in England.\nThe prime minister addressed the 1922 backbench committee of Conservative MPs tonight.\nHe faced criticism of what some saw as slow progress in removing restrictions.\nOne participant suggested he was talking \"gibberish\" when he compared his routemap to a motorway journey.\nAnother said the PM had been \"rattled\".\nWhat annoyed some MPs was an apparent lack of flexibility in the plan with restrictions not being lifted \"before\" certain dates.\nHe was urged to keep open the possibility of bringing these dates forward if data allowed but there was \"no backtracking\" on the five-week wait between steps.\nThe prime minister also said that \"a debate had to be had\" on domestic vaccine passport certificates.\nIt came as a further 10,641 coronavirus cases were reported on Monday, alongside another 178 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nMore than 17.7 million people across the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, according to latest government figures."
