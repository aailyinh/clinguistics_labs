      "title": "Covid in Scotland: Sturgeon to announce outcome of lockdown review",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon,Scotland Education",
      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon is to announce later whether Scotland's Covid-19 lockdown is to continue past the end of January.\nThe first minister said Tuesday's statement at Holyrood would concern the \"duration\" of restrictions rather than whether any new ones would be imposed.\nMinsters will also decide at a cabinet meeting whether schools will be allowed to re-open in full from 1 February.\nEducation Secretary John Swinney has suggested it would be a \"tall order\" for pupils to return to classrooms.\nMs Sturgeon said on Monday that she did not want to \"raise parents' expectations\", saying transmission of the virus \"is still higher than we would want it to be\".\nThe whole Scottish mainland and several islands have been in a strict lockdown since early January, with a \"stay at home\" message in force.\nThis was initially due to run until February, but this will be reviewed by ministers on Tuesday morning with a view to having the restrictions last longer.\nWhile Ms Sturgeon has warned that the government would consider further measures if necessary, she said \"it is the duration rather than the content of restrictions that we will be looking at\" on Tuesday.\nThe outcome of this review will then be announced to MSPs in a statement at Holyrood in the afternoon.\nThe review will also cover the situation in schools, with the majority learning remotely from home and only some children of key workers and vulnerable pupils being allowed into school buildings.\nOn Monday, the first minister said she did not want to \"raise expectations\" about classes returning to normal, but added that she was \"not going to make any assumptions\" ahead of the cabinet meeting.\nShe said: \"I am not going to raise parents' expectations, you can see from the numbers we are seeing some positive signs in the numbers that lockdown is starting to stabilise things and tip them into decline, but transmission is still higher than we would want it to be.\n\"We want to get schools back as quickly as we possibly can, it is not in the interests of kids to be out of school for any longer than is absolutely necessary, but community transmission has always been a key factor in these decisions.\"\nThis echoed comments from Mr Swinney, who had previously said it would be \"a tall order\" for schools to fully re-open with \"the virus still at a very high level in general within society\".\nI am expecting continuity rather than change from today's announcement on coronavirus restrictions. \nThe continuation of the current lockdown and presumably the extension of remote learning for most school pupils into the February break at least.\nBoth decisions are likely to be reviewed again next month. But it's not clear if the first minister will feel able to suggest a target date for restrictions to ease.\nCabinet will also be giving special attention to the serious Covid outbreak on Barra and considering if the level three restrictions that apply in the Western Isles remain appropriate.\nWhile there are signs the pace at which the current wave of coronavirus is spreading is starting to slow, evidence of much greater suppression will be required before the stay at home lockdown in place across mainland Scotland is lifted. \nThe review comes less than a week after restrictions in Scotland were tightened, with some click and collect services ordered to close and outdoor alcohol consumption banned.\nThe entire Scottish mainland has been in the top level of restrictions - level four - since Boxing Day, with level three measures in place in Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles and some islands in Argyll and Bute and the Highlands.\nScots are subject to a legal requirement not to leave home for anything other than essential purposes, such as shopping for essentials, exercise and caring responsibilities.\nThe number of new cases reported each day on average has begun to fall, but the number of people in hospital with the virus continues to rise and is now \"significantly\" above that seen in the first wave in 2020.\nMs Sturgeon said the \"position overall is very precarious, very concerning in terms of the level of transmission\", but said there were \"some early signs to be optimistic that measures are having an effect\".\nThe first minister will take questions from opposition leaders following her statement.\nThe Scottish Conservatives have voiced concerns that Covid-19 vaccines are not being rolled out quickly enough, saying the Scottish government are \"trailing their own targets\".\nStatistics released on Monday showed that Scotland has vaccinated 264,991 people so far - 6% of its adult population.\nThis is lower than the figure for England, where 8% of the adult population - 3,520,056 people - have been vaccinated, and Northern Ireland, which has the highest vaccination rate in the UK at 8.7%. \nWales has a similar figure to Scotland at 6%.\nEngland has also given a second dose of the vaccine to 427,386 people, compared to only 3,698 in Scotland.\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon has insisted that all parts of the UK are \"working to the same targets\" to vaccinate priority groups, and said her government is \"on track\" to hit them subject to supplies arriving.\nThis would see care home residents, healthcare staff and all over-80s get a first dose by the start of February, with over-70s and those deemed \"extremely vulnerable\" by mid-February and all over-65s by the beginning of March.\nBy that time the government aims to be vaccinating up to 400,000 people a week on average, with all priority groups getting a first jab by early May and the rest of the adult population in line thereafter."

      "text": "A man has described how he tried to help the youngest victim of the Manchester Arena attack as she lay badly injured after the explosion.\nPaul Reid, 46, was the first person to reach eight-year-old Saffie-Rose Roussos after the bomb was detonated.\nHe said she asked for her mum and said he tried to keep her awake by talking about the Ariana Grande gig.\nIt comes after a new report found Saffie could have survived if she had received better medical help.\nTwenty-two people were murdered and hundreds more injured when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb in the arena foyer as fans left the concert on 22 May 2017.\nMr Reid, who was selling posters at the concert, told the BBC he ran into the foyer seconds after the bomb went off. \n\"There was a big bang and I could see up on to the foyer, and there was smoke and you could hear things pinging off the wall,\" he said.\n\"I still had the posters in my hand. It was mad because it was like I wasn't there, like I was watching myself.\n\"People were just screaming and running in every direction you could think of.\"\nMr Reid said he tried to help two other people before he noticed Saffie lying on the floor. \n\"She was still conscious. I asked her her name and I thought she said Sophie,\" he said.\n\"She just got a little bit upset. She asked me for her mum and I said not to worry, we're going to find her in a minute. \n\"And I sat there trying to keep her calm. I had to talk to her about the concert, and did she enjoy it.\n\"All the time I was sat there, I just thought hundreds of people are just going to come running in here and help us. And, well, hardly anybody came in.\"\nThe public inquiry into the attack, which started in September, began to examine the emergency response to the atrocity on Monday.\nMr Reid said he began watching the inquiry but said some details given in the opening days did not marry up with his recollection of what happened, and he switched it off.\nHe told the BBC after a while another person came to help, but after cutting away some of Saffie's clothing they left and went to the aid of someone else.\n\"I gave her [Saffie] a sip of water, because in all this madness there's somebody handing water out,\" he said.\n\"So you can imagine in the foyer now, all this is going on and there's a man walking about with water.\"\nMr Reid said a police officer suggested moving Saffie out of the foyer, but with no stretchers to lift her they had to use a piece of plastic hoarding. \n\"The policeman came and said 'she's got to go, I'll take her in my car',\" he added.\n\"There was a plastic sheet under somebody's leg who was injured, I started pulling the sheet from under his leg. We put her on it and I started to carry her out, but the board was slippy.\"\nHe said they could not get the makeshift stretcher into the officer's car, so they flagged down an ambulance. \nMr Reid said he then returned to the foyer, where he went back to the man who he had taken the hoarding from. \n\"He had a gash in his stomach, and a paramedic was sitting there holding something against his stomach,\" he said.\n\"I held his hand. He had a Liverpool accent so I talked to him about football to take his mind off things, and my mind off things.\"\nMr Reid said he was still haunted by what happened that night. \n\"It's like yesterday. I can still smell the smoke in that foyer. Still hear the alarms when I go to sleep, when I close my eyes,\" he said.\n\"I'm first aid trained, but the most I'd done is put a plaster on. \n\"To step in that foyer, it was carnage. It was a war zone.\"\nSaffie's parents have said they would not have expected member of the public to have known how to treat her injuries.\nHer father Andrew Roussos told the BBC: \"There was a member of the public with her, I can't expect him to tourniquet her, splint her legs and so on. \n\"But the medically trained people that were with her, and were with her throughout and didn't apply basic first aid to give Saffie a chance.\"\nThe inquiry has previously heard it is important to acknowledge the enormous pressure which those who responded that night came under.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": " Britain's climate change leadership is being undercut by a government decision to allow a new coal mine in Cumbria, MPs have warned.\nThe UK is hosting a UN climate summit in November, where it will urge other nations to phase out fossil fuels.\nThe MPs say the government's decision to allow a new colliery at home will make it harder to secure a deal.\nThe Woodhouse mine was approved by Cumbria County Council because it will create jobs in an area of high unemployment.\nThe planning minister Robert Jenrick could have overruled it, but said the issue was best decided at a local level.\nThat verdict was derided by environmentalists, who pointed out that climate change from fossil fuel burning is a global problem.\nAlok Sharma, who is leading the COP26 climate summit and who co-ordinates UK policies on climate change, was asked by the Commons business select committee whether the mine approval was \"an embarrassment\". He replied: \"I take your point\".\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the committee there was a \"slight tension\" between approving the mine, near Whitehaven, and broader attempts to clean up the economy.\nBut he said ministers decided to allow the pit because it will produce coking coal for steel-making, which otherwise would have to be imported. \nHe said: \"There's a slight tension between the decision to open this mine and our avowed intention to take coal off the grid\u2026 there was a debate in the government about what we could do about this, but this was a local planning decision. \n\"If we don't have sources of coking coal in the UK we would be importing those anyway\".\nThis appears to run counter to advice from the Climate Change Committee which has said all coal - including coking coal - should be phased out by 2035. Doubts have been raised about investors in the mine being left with a \"stranded asset\" if the pit is forced to close on climate grounds.\nThe mine approval is even more poignant because the UK founded the 'Powering Past Coal Alliance\" - a global club to persuade nations to leave coal in the ground. \nA source close to the Alliance secretariat told BBC News that staff were enraged by the decision. They believed the decision had been made to help secure so-called \"Red Wall\" votes in areas which previously voted Labour .\nMohamed Adow, from a pressure group, Powershift Africa, told BBC News: \"It is quite bizarre that the UK government, in the year it hosts the biggest global climate talks since the signing of the Paris Agreement, has approved a new coal mine.\"\nThe young campaigner Greta Thunberg said the decision showed pledges to achieve net zero emissions targets by 2050 \"basically mean nothing\".\nDarren Jones, chair of the business committee, told BBC News it would be hard for the UK to persuade countries like Poland to abandon coal whilst building a mine.\nHe argued that the government should have found another way to bring jobs to Cumbria. He said: \"Carbon-intensive industries are looking to the government for leadership on the transition to a green future. \n\"Backing coal at home doesn't look in line with the recent Energy White Paper and certainly makes our efforts to secure international agreement on ambitious decarbonisation harder to achieve.\"\nThe Environmental Audit Committee Chairman, Philip Dunne, told BBC News: \"If the UK is to achieve its ambition to be an environmental world leader, the government must offer clear guidance on how we can take every industry to net-zero, and offer a pipeline of investable projects. \n\"The steel sector needs to develop alternatives to importing coking coal. This could also support the next generation of green jobs - which are urgently needed.\"\nThe cross-bench peer Baroness Worthington told BBC News: \"This decision is real laziness of thinking from the government. Just think of signal it sends to all those countries who want to cling on to coal. \n\"The government doesn't yet have a cohesive strategy that makes sense. It's crazy. Absolute madness.\"\nFollow Roger on Twitter."

      "tags": "Companies,Flexible working,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Employment,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland will follow England's example and lift its working from home guidance. \nPeople across the rest of the UK are still advised to work remotely wherever possible. \nFrom Monday 31 January, the government will no longer recommend home working wherever possible.\nInstead, employers are being asked to let workers return gradually. It wants workers to spend some time in the office and some time at home. \nA wholesale \"mass return\" to offices next week could risk pushing up infection levels, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on 19 January, Boris Johnson said that the government was no longer asking staff to work from home.\nHe said people \"should now speak to their employers about arrangements for returning to the office\". \nThe government had reintroduced its guidance to work remotely when it tightened Covid regulations on 8 December to help tackle the spread of Omicron. \nHowever, that guidance did also say that people should continue travelling to work if they needed \"to access equipment necessary for their role, or where their role must be completed in person\".  \nEmployers were also told to consider letting people come to work if they had a \"challenging home working environment\".\nIn Northern Ireland, ministers said that more people working from home would help to reduce the risk of infection both inside and outside the workplace. However, they didn't tell employers to impose home working, but instead asked them to support it \"where possible\".\nIn Wales, employers are also encouraged to let people work from home where possible. Guidance says staff should not be \"required or placed under pressure to return\" to the workplace unless there's a clear business need. Employers could be fined up to \u00a310,000 for failing to allow staff to work from home where it is \"reasonably practicable to do so\".\nFrom 28 January, the requirement to work from home moves from law to guidance. \nLatest figures suggest that 37% of working UK adults did at least some work from home in 2020, up from 27% the previous year.\nIn the last week of November 2021, seven in 10 travelled to work at least once. \nIn the same week, one in seven said they had been working at home and travelling to work.\nAlthough social distancing limits no longer apply across most UK workplaces businesses still have a legal duty to manage the risks to staff and customers. \nEmployers must follow official safety guidance and carry out Covid risk assessments for those staff who are in the office. \nSafety measures can include:\nFace-coverings remain mandatory for staff and customers in shops and on public transport across the UK, apart from England, where they will cease to be required in any public space on 27 January. \nRegular lateral flow testing remains widespread across the NHS and other parts of the public and private sector.\nNorthern Ireland, Wales and Scotland have already introduced Covid passport schemes which are partly designed to protect staff who work in hospitality and events. \nHowever, England will scrap its mandatory Covid certification scheme from Thursday 27 January, although venues will be able to keep checking customers' status on a voluntary basis if they wish. \nThere is more detailed advice for some industries - including construction, hospitality and manufacturing, plus specific advice for employers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIf employees feel unsafe, they can raise concerns with their local authority, Citizens Advice or the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). \nWorking from home is one of the most effective ways to reduce social exposure, according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). \nIt greatly limits face-to-face contact both with colleagues and on public transport.\nAs such, Sage says it has a \"strong impact\" against virus transmission and the R number, which represents a disease's ability to spread.\nMuch of the risk depends on how crowded it is and your distance from other people.\nWearing a mask helps, as does keeping windows open, and avoiding peak journey times where possible."

      "tags": "Brexit,Fishing industry,Dartmouth",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has pledged \u00a323m to help businesses affected by Brexit delays amid protests by fishing firms.\nDemonstrations took place outside government departments in central London by exporters who are warning their livelihoods are under threat.\nExports of fresh fish and seafood have been severely disrupted by new border controls since the UK's transition period ended earlier this month.\nThe PM said firms would be compensated for delays that were not their fault.\nIndustry associations have complained that extra paperwork has made it difficult to deliver fresh produce to mainland Europe before it goes off.\nThey have warned that if the situation continues, jobs could soon be at risk.\nPressed on what he would do in response, Mr Johnson said the government would step in to support firms which \"through no fault of their own have experienced bureaucratic delays, difficulties getting their goods through, where there is a genuine willing buyer on the other side of the channel\".\n\"There's a \u00a323m compensation fund we've set up and we'll make sure they get help,\" he said.\nDetails of the scheme are expected later this week.\nAfter a day of protests in central London, which saw 20 lorries drive up Whitehall, the Metropolitan Police said 14 people had been reported for Covid-related offences, but no arrests were made.\nMark Moore, manager of the Dartmouth Crab Company, said his business and others were protesting to \"raise awareness\" of the impact of new border checks.\nHe told BBC Radio 5 Live his company had faced delays of up to eight and a half hours when delivering produce into the European Union.\nHe added that the situation was \"especially difficult\" for the shellfish sector, where goods were at risk of going off before reaching customers. \n\"It's not about the increased documentation per se,\" he said. \n\"We have taken that on board, and we ourselves - and I know many others - have had no issues with producing the actual paperwork.\n\"It's the volume required and the timeframe in which to produce it, which doesn't lend itself to live shellfish and fish generally.\"\nJohn McManus, BBC News\nThere are 24 lorries in total, overwhelmingly from seafood exporters in Scotland. Businesses taking part say the Brexit trade deal has left their industry high and dry. \nAnd although one haulier from Aberdeenshire I spoke to was keen to stress that their coordinated protest was peaceful, it is clear that they all feel that direct action is now necessary to make the government sit up and take notice.  \nGood natured though their action was, it did for a time cause serious traffic congestion along Whitehall and Parliament Square. \nHowever, low levels of traffic perhaps caused by the Covid lockdown meant the roads around Whitehall didn't grind to a complete halt. \nAt stake, they believe, is an industry, but also thousands of livelihoods. Exporters say they are backed by fishermen who are struggling to land their catches. \nAnd although the rural Scottish communities which are sustained by fishing might seem like a long way from the streets of SW1, the hauliers certainly made their presence felt this morning. \nHaving left the EU's customs union and the single market, UK exports are subject to new customs and veterinary checks which have caused problems at the border. \nSome Scottish fishermen have been landing their catch in Denmark to avoid the \"bureaucratic system\" involved in exporting to Europe, according to Scotland's rural economy secretary.\nLast week, Boris Johnson told a committee of MPs that fishing firms impacted by disruption would be compensated for \"temporary frustrations\".\nBut the BBC was told that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) did not know about the promise of compensation before it was made by Mr Johnson. \nSpeaking to reporters, the prime minister said he understood the \"frustrations\" of the fishing industry, noting its plight had been \"exacerbated by the Covid pandemic\".\n\"Unfortunately, the demand in restaurants on the continent for UK fish has not been what it was before the pandemic, just because the restaurants have been closed for so long,\" he added. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused ministers of trying to \"blame fishing communities\" for problems \"rather than accepting it's their failure to prepare\".\n\"The government has known there would be a problem with fishing and particularly the sale of fish into the EU for years,\" he told reporters. \nBy Martyn Oates, BBC South West Political Editor \nMuch media attention has been focussed on Scotland as this export crisis has unfolded.\nBut exactly the same problem is rearing its head in the UK's other great fishing stronghold - at the other end of the UK in Devon and Cornwall.\nA virtual Who's Who of South West fishing leaders wrote to the environment secretary back in November warning that the new post-Brexit export requirements would have a \"seriously detrimental effect\" on the industry, claiming this \"could be the final straw for many businesses\".\nHere, too, many fish exports have now ground to a halt and others have encountered obstacles and long delays.\nAnd exporters have reacted angrily to the government's repeated insistence that the issues they've been experiencing over the last two weeks are just \"teething problems\"."

      "text": "Mental health targets have been missed thousands of times at Northern Ireland's emergency departments (ED) - with some people in crisis waiting more than eight hours for an assessment. \nHealth trusts aim to assess such patients at ED within two hours, but miss that target 20% of the time.\nHealth officials said access to mental health services is a key priority. \nBut they accepted availability of those services has been hit by extra pressures caused by the pandemic.\n\"Covid-19 has undoubtedly impacted on the availability of services and led to pressures across the HSC, including mental health,\" said NI's Director of Social Care and Children, Marie Roulston.\nThe two-hour waiting time was set by the Health and Social Care Board to try to ensure that those who were in need of an urgent mental health assessment did not have lengthy waits in emergency departments. \nWhile the number of people using emergency departments dropped in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, the percentage of those waiting more than two hours for mental health assessment remained largely the same. \nPeople were identified as needing a referral for a specialist mental health assessment at Northern Ireland emergency departments more than 42,000 times between January 2017 and September 2020. \nOn more than 8,000 of these occasions, the patients had to wait for more than two hours before being seen.  \nThe findings were obtained by BBC News NI through a series of Freedom of Information requests to health trusts. \nThe Belfast Trust had the highest percentage of those not seen within two hours, with more than a third of patients waiting longer than two hours for a mental health assessment.  \nMore than 70 of those patients waited for longer than eight hours, while some had to wait as long as 12 hours.  \nThe Belfast Trust said it aimed to see individuals presenting to ED \"within the target timescale, however, at times demand outstrips our capacity to meet this\".\nAidan McMeekin is 18 and lives in Belfast. \nHis mental health suffered after he was expelled from school. \nHe said: \"It got to the point where I was actually begging to my mum: 'I don't want to be here anymore, please just let me go.'\"\nSoon after, Aidan was taken to the emergency department of Belfast's Mater Hospital, where, he said, he waited for eight hours before receiving a mental health assessment.   \nAn investigation by BBC News NI has also found that mental health targets have been missed thousands of times at Northern Ireland's emergency departments (ED) - with people like Aidan waiting eight hours and over for for an assessment. \nAfter losing one of his close friends to suicide, Aidan's attitude changed. \n\"I saw first-hand how it has destroyed their families and I want to make sure that me or no-one I know goes down that route.\"  \nHe added: \"I could have been just a statistic. People say you're forever young, but you're also forever dead.\"  \nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this article, there are a  list of organisations that may be able to help at BBC Action Line. \nAidan has been working with Quakers NI to share his story and raise awareness of mental health issues among young people in Northern Ireland.  \nAlthough the Belfast and Western Trust had the highest percentage of patients waiting for at least two hours, both these trusts also had smaller number of patients attending ED for mental health assessments.\nIn recent years, new pilot community crisis intervention services have been rolled out in Londonderry and Belfast, which can be used by patients within these trust catchment areas.\nAll five trusts told BBC News NI that while they were working hard to meet targets, this was not always possible. \nA spokesperson for the South Eastern Trust said: \"This can be challenging at times due to the overall growth in demand for mental health assessments, including an increase in referrals from our emergency departments. \n\"In addition, the region's long-standing workforce pressures impact on our capacity to respond to referrals within target, although we are continuously working with commissioners to further develop our mental health early liaison provision.\" \nIn recent years, some emergency departments have appointed mental health liaison officials, while the department of health has also approved funding for a new perinatal mental health service.\nHealth officials say delays to ED mental health assessments can be caused by a number of factors, including:\nIn December 2020, Health Minister Robin Swann launched a public consultation on a 10-year Mental Health Strategy for Northern Ireland.  \nIt called for investment in a regional mental health crisis service to help reduce waiting times at emergency departments for mental health patients.  \nWhile Northern Ireland's suicide rate may be lower than previously thought after a review found some drug-related deaths, originally recorded as suicide, were accidental, the region's mental health champion said that behind the statistics were individuals \"in their darkest hours, facing devastating waits\".   \nSiobhan O'Neill said: \"Emergency departments can be chaotic and staff are doing their best, but it's far from the ideal environment for someone in a mental health crisis.\n\"There are some excellent specialist mental health crisis services that have been piloted in Derry and Belfast, but the reality is A&E is still going to be the point of access for many people in crisis.\"  \nShe added: \"When people face lengthy waits they can be made feel like a burden, so we need to find a longer-term solution to ensure those with suicidal thoughts are not waiting hours for help.\"  \nA regional review of mental health crisis services in Northern Ireland is due to conclude in April. It is expected to call for a regionally-consistent response to people suffering a mental health crisis. \nThe Health and Social Care Board said: \"We will continue to work on improving services in mental health to ensure that those who experience a mental health crisis will receive the help and support they need in the setting which is most conducive to recovery.\" \nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this article, there are a  list of organisations that may be able to help at BBC Action Line"

      "text": "A further 1,610 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began.\nIt means the total number of deaths by that measure is now above 90,000.\nA total of 4,266,577 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine, according to the latest government figures.\nAnother 33,355 positive Covid cases have been recorded - less than half the peak figure of 68,053 on 8 January.\nIt is the lowest number of daily cases seen since 27 December - before the start of England's third nationwide lockdown.\nDr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said: \"Whilst there are some early signs that show our sacrifices are working, we must continue to strictly abide by the measures in place.\"\nShe said reducing contact with others and staying at home will lead to \"a fall in the number of infections over time\".\nThe figures come as new estimates from the Office for National Statistics show about one in 10 people across the UK tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies in December - roughly double the October figure.\nThe rising number of deaths was to be expected, sadly, after the surge in cases during December.\nAnd it is likely that the coming weeks will see figures even higher than this.\nToday's numbers are, though, inflated by the fact that delays in registering deaths over the weekend tends to lead to higher figures being reported on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.\nOn average, the UK is recording more than 1,100 deaths a day.\nTo put that in context, at Christmas it was less than half of that.\nBut there are two rays of hope in the daily update.\nFirstly, the number of cases is below 40,000 for a third day in a row. Just two weeks ago we saw a few days above 60,000.\nThat means in the coming weeks we should start to see fewer people in hospital and eventually fewer deaths.\nThe number of vaccinations also continues to rise.\nIt seems unlikely the NHS will manage its target of two million doses a week just yet. \nBut each increase at least takes us one step closer to getting on top of the virus.\nMeanwhile, NHS England said 400 military personnel were now assisting in hospitals in London and the Midlands, as wards face \"unprecedented pressure\".\nOn Monday, Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said it would be \"some time\" before the vaccination programme begins to reduce pressures on hospitals.\nAnd in other developments, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he is self-isolating after being alerted by the UK's NHS Covid-19 app .that he had been in close contact with somebody who tested positive.  \nHe said self-isolation was \"perhaps the most important part of all the social distancing\" and urged others to do the same if contacted.\nThe previous highest number of daily deaths was last Wednesday, when 1,564 deaths were recorded.\nTuesday's figure brings the total number of deaths recorded during the pandemic in the UK to 91,470.\nThese government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive, but there are other ways of measuring the total number of deaths.\nAnother method is to count all deaths where coronavirus is mentioned on the death certificate. That figure has now officially reached 95,829, although that is only measured up to 8 January.\nThe UK has recorded the fifth-highest number of deaths globally, according to Johns Hopkins University - behind the US, Brazil, India and Mexico.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: \"British people are paying the price for the government's serial incompetence.\""

      "text": "Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has confirmed the government is looking at scrapping some EU labour laws now it is no longer bound by the bloc's rules.\nBut he promised there would be no dilution of workers' rights.\nMeasures under consideration include relaxing the working time directive which enshrines a 48-hour week.\nShadow business secretary Ed Miliband warned the government wanted to take a \"wrecking ball\" to hard-won rights.\nEarlier this week Mr Kwarteng said he wanted to \"protect and enhance\" labour law after the Financial Times reported that some rules could be weakened. \nThe minister later told business leaders the UK had an opportunity to reform regulation derived from EU law, but would not deliberately antagonise the EU - its biggest trading partner - immediately after the Brexit deal.\nConfirming the review on Tuesday, Mr Kwarteng told MPs there would be no \"bonfire of rights\".\n\"I think the view was that we wanted to look at the whole range of issues relating to our EU membership and examine what we wanted to keep, if you like,\" he said.\nBut he said \"the idea that we are trying to whittle down standards, that's not at all plausible or true\".\nAppearing before MPs, the business secretary said: \"I'm very struck as I look at EU economies how many EU countries - I think it's about 17 or 18 - have essentially opted out of the working time directive.\n\"So even by just following that we are way above the average European standard and I want to maintain that. I think we can be a high-wage, high-employment economy, a very successful economy, and that's what we should be aiming for.\"\nMr Miliband said that after denying the FT's report, Mr Kwarteng had now \"let the cat out of the bag\" in admitting the government was conducting a review. \nHe warned that opting out of the 48-hour week would harm workers in key sectors like the NHS, road haulage and airlines from working excessive hours.\n\"A government committed to maintaining existing protections would not be reviewing whether they should be unpicked. This exposes that the government's priorities for Britain are totally wrong.\"\nDrew Hendry, the SNP's business spokesman, echoed the criticism, accusing the government of planning an \"assault\" on workers' rights.\nMeanwhile the boss of the UK's biggest recruitment firm, Reed, told the BBC's Today programme that there was \"no wish\" among employers to see \"a so-called bonfire of workers' rights.\n\"They must be protected because fair treatment is the bedrock of good workplace relations,\" James Reed said.\nThe chairman of the firm said the government should instead focus on lower-paid workers and measures that could be taken to improve unemployment, which is set to rise further into mid-2021.\n\"I would suggest two things are looked at before any EU rules: The apprenticeship levy, which is clearly failing... and also National Insurance on jobs. It's a tax on jobs - how can that be improved? Especially to help the low-paid back into work.\"\nUnder the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, the UK has agreed to conditions that maintain fair competition, or a level playing field, between the two sides.  \nHowever, the EU's ambassador to the UK, Joao Vale de Almeida, said Brussels could retaliate if Boris Johnson's government went too far in with deregulation.\n\"It will be for us to judge the extent to which it violates this principle of 'level playing field' and if that is the case there are mechanisms in the treaty, in the agreement, that allow us to discuss and eventually to come to an understanding,\" he said on Tuesday.\n\"If no understanding there are retaliation measures that can be applied on both sides.\""

      "text": "The government is facing a rebellion over the Trade Bill, and opposition proposals to give British courts the right to decide if a country is committing genocide.\nRebel Tory MPs want to allow Parliament to debate ending trade deals with countries responsible for genocide.\nThe government says trade policy should not be set by the courts.\nBut some MPs think the proposal would be a good way of targeting China and its treatment of the Uighur people.\nOn Tuesday, America's top diplomat Mike Pompeo, in his last day in the role, said the US had determined that China's persecution of the Muslim group and other minorities in Xinjiang province represented genocide and crimes against humanity under international law. \nThe UK has repeatedly condemned the actions of the Chinese authorities but stopped short of describing them as genocide - saying only international courts should determine this. \nAnd ministers also argue that trade deals are matters for governments, not the courts, to decide upon.  \nThe MPs' amendment to the Trade Bill is a watered-down version of an earlier proposal from the House of Lords, which would force the government to withdraw from any free trade agreement with any country found guilty of genocide by the High Court of England and Wales. \nThe new proposal is signed by 10 Conservative MPs, one of whom described their amendment as \"tidier\" than the Lords version and designed to attract more support. \nSpeaking in the Commons, Sir Edward Leigh asked \"is there any way we can acknowledge that genocide is taking place in a discussion on a trade deal\".\nIn response, International Trade minister Greg Hands said ministers were prepared to have further discussions but not within the scope of the current legislation. \nHe told MPs the government was \"answerable to Parliament, not the courts\" and the Lords version would have led to an \"unacceptable erosion\" of its authority.\nThe UK, he added, had \"no plans\" to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement with China due to concerns about its human rights record, particularly its persecution of the Muslim Uighur community.\nNusrat Ghani urged ministers to consider the \"compromise\" proposal, which she said recognised the \"separation of powers\" between the executive, Parliament and the courts.\nThe Conservative ex-minister said the UK should \"never let economic concerns trump ethical ones by dealing with genocidal states\".\n\"Why would we want to use our newfound freedom to trade with states that commit and profit from genocide? Britain is better than that.\"\nSpeaking to Politics Live, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said it is currently \"impossible\" for international courts to rule on whether there has been genocide, as other countries can block hearings in the UN.\nHe argued it is therefore important to allow British courts to make the judgement. \nThe MP insisted he is not \"anti-China\" but said the Chinese government need to be \"reasonable and behave in a way that is acceptable\" if it wanted to be part of global trading organisations.\nShadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry said Labour would be supporting the new amendment arguing that the government \"does not consider human rights abuses enough before signing up to trade deals\".\nThis is an interesting story in its own right because of the issues involved but it's also a neat metaphor for Brexit. \nThe government has taken back control of trade policy from the EU but is already having to share it with the House of Lords, Tory MPs and potentially with the High Court. \nDuring the passage of the Trade Bill, the government also had to beef up the powers of the Trade and Agriculture Commission - an independent body of experts - in response to lobbying from farmers who were worried about the dilution of food standards. \nSoon trade disputes with other countries will partly be overseen by the new Trade Remedies Authority, another organisation that reports to ministers but is independent of them. \nAnd of course, everything has to be compatible with World Trade Organisation rules, anyway. \nThe government has control of trade. It's just not total. "

But, if it does, we're reasonably comfortable we've still got a chance because the Environment Agency have done tremendous work here along with Doncaster Council.\"\nHe said new defences had been built and their team of flood wardens had been expanded to 22 people.\nOn Yarlborough Terrace in Bentley, Doncaster, many residents were out of their homes for months after the 2019 floods.\nAnna Booth, 37, who was forced to live in a caravan on her drive, said residents were worried about it happening again.\n\"Being in the pandemic doesn't help either. Morale's a bit down but I think we'll all pull together again like last time,\" she said.\n\"It breaks your heart, it's really sad, but we can't stop the weather.\"\nThe Environment Agency issued more than 30 flood warnings, meaning flooding is expected and immediate action required, covering parts of Yorkshire, Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, Merseyside, Staffordshire and Northamptonshire as of 03:00 GMT on Wednesday.\nThere are also more than 150 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible, issued across northern England, the Midlands and the east.\nCatherine Wright, acting executive director for flood and coastal risk management at the Environment Agency, said: \"That rain is falling on very wet ground and so we are very concerned that it's a very volatile situation and we are expecting significant flooding to occur on the back of that weather.\"\nShe said the agency would be working with local authorities to help with evacuation efforts should a severe flood warning be issued, adding: \"If you do need to evacuate then that is allowed within the Covid rules.\"\nDiscussing the different levels of flood warnings, she said: \"If you receive a flood alert, please pack valuables like medicines and insurance documents in a bag ready to go. \n\"If you receive a flood warning, please move valuables and precious possessions upstairs and be ready to turn off gas, electricity and water.\n\"If you receive a severe flood warning, which means you will be evacuated, please listen out and take heed of the advice from the local emergency services.\"  \nBarry Greenwood, from the Upper Calder Valley Flood Prevention Group in West Yorkshire, has been \"sick\" with worry.\n\"I went round after the last [flood], people were there with their heads in their hands, thinking 'what am I going to do now?',\" he said.\nFlood sirens were sounded in Walsden on Tuesday evening after a flood warning was issued for the area.\nIn a tweet, Calderdale Council asked residents to put their flood plan into action and move valuables to a safe place.\n\"River levels across the Upper River Calder have risen and are now approaching levels where we expect properties to flood,\" it warned.\nEarlier it had said staff were on standby to respond overnight.\nA yellow rain alert is also in place for Wales, Northern Ireland, central and northern England and southern Scotland on Tuesday.\nThis yellow warning extends to the rest of England from Wednesday, with a yellow alert for snow and ice in north east Scotland.   \nHighways England advised drivers to take extra care on motorways and major A roads, while the RAC breakdown service said motorists should only drive if absolutely necessary."

      "text": "New legislation has been passed to protect Scottish shop workers from abuse from customers.\nThe Protection of Workers Bill will make it a new specific offence to assault, abuse or threaten staff.\nIncidents involving an age-restricted product, such as alcohol or cigarettes, could be treated more seriously.\nThe MSP behind the bill, Labour's Daniel Johnson, said attacks on retail workers had increased during the Covid pandemic.\nHe told Holyrood: \"Shop staff have been spat at for asking customers to socially distance, and stock has been smashed in retaliation for item limits being imposed.\n\"Violence, threats and abuse should not be just part of anyone's job.\"\nMr Johnson said that staff requesting age ID could be a \"trigger factor\" in many incidents of abuse.\nThe new legislation will also cover people working in bars, restaurants and hotels, and those delivering items bought online who may have to ask for proof of age.\nThe bill was supported by all parties at Holyrood, despite the government initially arguing that its provisions were already covered by existing criminal laws.\nThe Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service told MSPs that further legislation was not needed, noting that \"violence, threats and abuse against retail workers, or indeed any other person, are prosecuted every day in the courts in Scotland using offences which are commonly understood\".\nPolice Scotland meanwhile said there would be \"no significant change in how we go about our business\" as a result of it.\nCommunity safety minister Ash Denham said that while there was a \"wide range of existing criminal laws\" currently in place to protect staff, the new legislation could \"make the general public think more about their behaviour when they interact with retail workers\".\nThe Scottish Conservatives also backed the bill, although they argued that the presumption against short sentences in Scotland meant anyone convicted under the new law would ultimately not be jailed.\nPaul Gerrard, public affairs director for the Co-Op, told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime that the retailer had seen a 450% rise in violent incidents in the last few years.\n\"It is a huge problem,\" he said. \"We've seen an explosion in violence and abuse toward my colleagues.\n\"Now across 350 stores in Scotland we have someone attacked every day. And 10 colleagues are threatened or abused every day.\n\"Increasingly we have seen knives, syringes and axes all used against shopworkers.\"\nMr Gerrard added that previous incidents were centred on shoplifting or age-restricted sales, but staff were now facing more abuse around enforcing Covid shopping rules.\nThe new legislation was passed by 118 votes to 0 in the Scottish Parliament.\nThe Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) is now urging the UK government to introduce similar legislation to protect retail staff in England - something Labour MP Alex Norris is pursuing at Westminster.\nUsdaw general secretary Paddy Lillis said: \"It is a great result for our members in Scotland, who will now have the protection of the law that they deserve. \n\"So we are looking for MPs to support key workers across the retail sector and help turn around the UK government's opposition.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scotland Education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The new school term began in Scotland this week - but many pupils and teachers did not return to the classroom. \nInstead, laptops, tablets and exercise books were opened on kitchen tables across the country as home-schooling began again in earnest. \nDay one was marred by technical difficulties as thousands of users logged on to Microsoft Teams after holidays. \nBut did it get any better?  We asked some parents about their experience of home-schooling during the latest coronavirus lockdown. \nDuring the first lockdown Donna Bruce, from Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire, juggled a full-time job and working from home while looking after her two children, Kai, 10, and eight-year-old Quinn. \nShe didn't have enough devices for all three of them, and she had to occupy the children for seven hours a day while working at the same time. \nHer early Zoom meetings enjoyed guest appearances from half-naked children climbing kitchen cupboards to find snacks. \nThis time round, she feels schools and teachers were better prepared. \n\"Teachers had made videos talking to the children and reassuring them,\" she said. \n\"I feel there is less pressure this time on parents and children, but children still need supervised and their time still needs occupied to allow parents to work and that's when the issues come in.\"\n\"On day one, they finished all their assigned school work by 11:00 and I was working until 16:30,\" she added. \n\"I feel anxious and worry as the novelty wears off and my work gets busier, how I will cope.\n\"At the end of every day I question if I have done enough and try to remind myself it's not a race or a competition - if we all survive to tell this story in the future's history lesson then that's all that matters.\"\nKirsteen Roberts, from East Lothian, found the first lockdown stressful. \nHer son Finn is in S2, while daughters Layla and Summer are in P7 and P3 respectively. The primary school work was structured with teacher contact but the secondary work was \"patchy\". \nShe said the younger two were pretty motivated but the eldest was frustrated and didn't have enough to do. \n\"With school, plus keeping on top of Zooms for extra curricular activities, I felt a huge pressure,\" she said. \nKirsteen was disappointed to return to online learning.\n\"None of us were looking forward to it and I feared that no work would be posted on the first day,\" she said.  \n\"Thankfully I was proved wrong. The secondary school teachers have organised weekly class Google Meets this time around which is a big improvement. \n\"Everything went well technically and the first day went pretty smoothly - only two out of three of them ended up in tears after putting pressure on themselves. \n\"I feel we can get through it intact - as long as it really only is a few weeks this time. \n\"I think workwise the kids will get enough of what they need from the school without me having to find more on the BBC or websites like Twinkl, but it's still hard on them and they miss the classroom contact.\"\nResources to support learners, teachers and parents during lockdown.\nFiona Keiller, from Perth and Kinross, is a single parent to Ross who is in P6. \nShe said there were \"good days and bad days\" during the first stint of home learning. She did not feel her son was getting enough to do and she was also working full-time from home.\nThis time around she was told Ross would have two live sessions per week via Microsoft Teams.\n\"My son struggles to get on with the tasks without my assistance, so he insists on trying to rope me into helping him, which is difficult when I am in meetings and trying to do my own work,\" Fiona said. \n\"I felt worse after the first day, I had forgotten just how stressful it is. Hopefully we will find our groove by week two, but I worry whether Teams is going to cope with the amount of traffic on it.\"\nEmily Black is a keyworker from Aberdeenshire, with a daughter in S1 and a son in P1. \nThe first time schools were closed, her daughter tried to complete tasks while her little brother tried to play with her. \n\"My son's behaviour became concerning and my daughter cried every day,\" she said. \nThis time round, their rural internet has proved a problem. \n\"My daughter was up and at her laptop at 08:45. She is used to using Teams for homework but when it decided to play up, I thought she was going to launch her laptop out of the window,\" she said. \n\"My son really appreciated the welcome video message from his teacher so was a lot more engaged after his teacher had told him to do his jobs and then he could have fun. \n\"It went a lot better than I expected.

But I don't know if it will be the same in a couple of weeks.\"\nMark Cummings from East Dunbartonshire has two daughters, one in P2 and one in kindergarten. Both attend an independent fee-paying school.\nHe was disappointed by the timing of this government's decision - just after the festive break - but he said his daughter's school has been \"excellent\". \n\"They are well organised and clear in what they are trying to do,\" he said. \n\"Our daughters are getting a full curriculum each day (two live lessons with teacher and classmates and four pre-recorded topic lessons). It is not comparable to the experience they get at school but is a great effort nonetheless.\"\nBut he is concerned about the long-term effects of home-learning.  \n\"Online learning is not adequate and will lead to greater disparity in learning between different types of pupils who attend different types of schools,\" he said."

      "text": "Victims of female child sexual abusers face \"enormous stigma and shame\", according to police and charities.\nFigures from BBC Radio 4's File on 4 show there were over 10,400 reports of this type of abuse from 2015 to 2019 - equivalent to an average of 40 a week.\nExperts say there is still a \"lack of understanding\" about the extent of such abuse.\nThe UK government said it would not allow \"any safe space for sex offenders to operate - male or female\".\nBetween 2015 and 2019, the numbers of reported cases of female-perpetrated child sexual abuse to police in England and Wales rose from 1,249 to 2,297 - an increase of 84%. \nDr Andrea Darling, a criminology researcher at Durham University - who has looked at 40 cases of male and female teachers who sexually abused students - said the File on 4 figures represented the \"tip of the iceberg\".\nShe said that although all child sexual abuse was underreported, there was a particular \"lack of understanding\" of the extent of female-perpetrated abuse. \n\"That means that potentially abusive behaviour that may have been picked up if the perpetrator had been a male is explained away,\" she said.\n\"I've seen that consistently in my research.\"\nShe added it was \"fundamentally important\" to understand a lot more about this kind of child sexual abuse. \nNicola*, who is now in her mid 20s, was sexually, physically and emotionally abused by her mother from a young age.\nShe said the onset of puberty was a trigger for the escalation of sexual abuse.\n\"My appearance was quite a weapon for her, which would often lead into more severe stuff.  She would criticise my body, and make me take my clothes off.\"\nIn common with many child sexual abuse victims, Nicola describes deep feelings of shame and self-loathing. She has never had a relationship, or any consensual sexual contact.\n\"I think people will see me as very dirty; which is what I feel myself. \n\"I don't feel anyone will believe me - how does a mother or a woman do this?  I imagine that so strongly that it is a real inhibitor to talk about it. But women can rape.\"\nNicola's abuse only ended when she left home at 16.\nShe started going to counselling in 2018, after struggling to access the right treatment. \nKatherine Cox, services manager with male and non-binary victim support charity Survivors UK, said she believes the File on 4 figures did not reflect an increase in abuse, but an increase in people feeling able to report to the authorities.\nHowever, she added, far too many victims \"believe they won't be believed\".\n\"The prosecution rates are really low for any survivor,\" Ms Cox said.\n\"I think for a male survivor of female perpetrated abuse, the reality of getting a conviction is usually going to be extremely low.\"\nSurvivors UK have a waiting list of 10 months for its counselling services. \nOf the 45 UK forces File on 4 asked for figures, 36 were able to provide data. Northern Ireland and Scotland said collating this information would take too long. \nFile on 4's data shows the gender split between male and female victims is roughly half.\nDetective Superintendent Mark Lewis of South Wales Police, who oversees child sexual abuse cases for his force says although the number of cases of female abusers he has dealt with is small, there is \"a taboo element\" and the stigma victims face is \"quite enormous\".\n\"It's down to police to keep trying to give that reassurance to victims to report, regardless of their circumstances,\" he said.\nThe government said it would \"not allow there to be any safe space for sex offenders to operate - either online or offline, male or female - and will do all we can to help survivors of abuse\". \n\"To this end, we will soon publish a first of its kind strategy to tackle all forms of child sexual abuse, including that perpetrated by female offenders,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"We have also made significant increases to the national and local funding available to support victims of child sexual abuse.\" \nThe Northern Irish Department of Justice said it was \"committed to ensuring victims of sexual abuse have access to co-ordinated support,\" and were introducing \"court reforms to reduce delay and stress on victims and witnesses\".\nThe Scottish government said it has \"strengthened legislation and increased funding to make it easier for victims and survivors to speak out against abusers\", and work is being carried out to \"ensure better support for victims\".\n*Names have been changed to protect anonymity\nWomen who Abuse is on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday 19 January at 20:00 GMT and will be available on BBC Sounds here."

      "text": "The UK and US have failed to do a much hoped for \"mini-deal\" over trade in the last days of the Trump administration.\nThere were hopes the US would lift tariffs on imports of Scotch whisky and cashmere imposed last year as part of the Boeing-Airbus trade dispute. \nBut those duties will now stay in place while President-elect Biden awaits confirmation of his trade team.\nThe talks were revealed in a BBC interview with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in December.\nAt the time he said he was hopeful that he and his UK counterpart, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss, could \"get some kind of an agreement out\".\nBut the BBC understands that a broad offer from the US was rejected last week by the UK after concerns were expressed by the Business Department about the impact on Airbus' business in the UK.\nSince 2019, the EU and US have both imposed tariffs on each others' goods amid a long-running trade dispute between the planemakers Boeing and Airbus. \nEarlier last month the UK's Trade Department announced it would unilaterally break from the EU's position of levying tariffs on imports of Boeing aeroplanes, after the end of the Brexit transition period. \nIt was, said Ms Truss, an attempt to create goodwill to solve the 16-year old dispute. \nBut the UK aerospace industry was furious with what it saw as the government reneging on promises made in early 2020 to support Airbus in the dispute, even after Brexit.\nThese concerns were the main block to a deal, but the chaos in Washington DC over the past week also played a part.\nThe US was also looking for tariffs on its exports of bourbon to the UK - part of a separate trade dispute over steel - to be settled.\nA government source said: \"Ultimately we came close to resolving an intractable 16-year dispute, but didn't quite get there. Any deal must be balanced and work for the whole UK and all of UK industry.\"\nThey added: \"No one has fought harder on this than Liz, and she's going to continue pushing it with the Biden administration. She absolutely understands the pain of affected businesses and is determined to get these tariffs lifted and support jobs.\"\nThe source said the government had pursued a \"clear de-escalation strategy\" with the Trump administration over the dispute which meant it had avoided being hit with further US tariffs, unlike the EU. \nMs Truss still hopes to settle the dispute quickly and has committed to meet Katherine Tai, the new US Trade Representative, in Washington DC as soon as she assumes office, the source added. \nKaren Betts, head of the Scotch Whisky Association, said her industry was \"very frustrated\" a deal was not reached.\n\"There is deep disappointment across the Scotch whisky industry that distillers are still paying the price for an aerospace dispute that has nothing to do with us.\n\"The tariff on single malt Scotch whisky, now in place for 15 months, has caused us to lose over \u00a3450m in exports to the US, and our losses continue to mount.\"  "

We'll have another update for you on Wednesday morning.\nA further 1,610 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began. The total number of deaths by this measure is 91,470, but there are other ways of measuring the death toll. The latest figures come as new estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show about one in 10 people across the UK tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies in December - roughly double the October figure.\nScotland's Covid-19 lockdown has been extended until at least the middle of February, with most school pupils to continue learning from home at least until then. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said transmission of the virus appeared to be declining but was still too high to ease restrictions, which have been in place since Boxing Day. It comes as England's deputy chief medical officer said schools may reopen region by region after February half term.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock has said he is self-isolating after being alerted by the UK's NHS Covid-19 app. He urged others to do the same if \"pinged\" by the app and said self-isolation was \"perhaps the most important part of all the social distancing\". Mr Hancock, who is MP for West Suffolk, suffered \"mild symptoms\" when he contracted coronavirus in March 2020.\nA group of politicians drank alcohol on Welsh Parliament premises, days after a coronavirus rule banning pubs from serving drinks took effect. BBC Wales has been told Conservative Senedd leader Paul Davies, Darren Millar and Nick Ramsay were drinking together in early December, with Labour Senedd member Alun Davies also involved. Senedd authorities said they are investigating an \"incident\". Elsewhere, an internal investigation has began after railway workers allegedly held a surprise baby shower in a closed Patisserie Valerie bakery at London's Marylebone station during lockdown.\nHeadlines about footballers and Covid have been hard to miss lately - with questions about dressing room distancing, off-pitch partying and all those post-goal hugs.

      "text": "Scientists are a step closer to being able to reverse the damage caused by motor neurone disease (MND). \nUniversity of Edinburgh experts have found a problem with MND patients' nerve cells which could be repaired by repurposing drugs approved for other diseases.\nThe study has been welcomed by charities including the foundation set up by Scots rugby legend Doddie Weir. \nMy Name'5 Doddie foundation described it as \"a very exciting breakthrough\". \nMore than 1,500 people are diagnosed with the degenerative condition in the UK every year. \nThere is no known cure and more than half die within two years of diagnosis. \nThe research found that the damage to nerve cells caused by MND could be repaired by improving the energy levels in mitochondria - the power supply to the motor neurons. \nThey discovered in human stem cell models of MND, the axon - the long part of the motor neuron cell that connects to the muscle - was shorter than in healthy cells.\nAnd the movement of the mitochondria, which travel up and down the axons, was impaired\nThe scientists showed that this was caused by a defective energy supply from the mitochondria and that by boosting the mitochondria, the axon reverted back to normal. \nDr Arpan Mehta, who led the study at Euan MacDonald Centre for MND research said: \"The importance of the axon in motor nerve cells cannot be overstated.\n\"Our data provides hope that by restoring the cell's energy source we can protect the axons and their connection to muscle from degeneration.\n\"Work is already under way to identify existing licensed drugs that can boost the mitochondria and repair the motor neurons. This will then pave the way to test them in clinical trials.\"\nCraig Stockton, the chief executive of MND Scotland, said the \"exciting\" results of the research were another piece of the puzzle to finding an effective treatment for the degenerative condition. \n\"We look forward to seeing if these positive results can be replicated for patients,\" he said. \n\"Once researchers have identified a drug they believe could have the desired effect, this treatment could then be fast-tracked for human trials using the pioneering MND-SMART clinical trial platform - into which MND Scotland has invested \u00a31.5m.\n\"Researchers, clinicians, charities and supporters are all working hard to take us closer to finding a cure and by joining together we'll get to that day even sooner.\"\nThe researchers used stem cells taken from people with the C9orf72 gene mutation that causes both MND and frontotemporal dementia.\nThey used the stem cells to generate motor neuron cells in the lab.\nThe study also used human post-mortem spinal cord tissue from people with MND.\nAlthough the research focused on the people with the commonest genetic cause of MND, the researchers said they were hopeful the results would also apply to other forms of the disease.\nThe results of the study are now being used to look for existing drugs that boost mitochondrial function.\nThe study was funded by the Medical Research Council, Motor Neurone Disease Association, Euan MacDonald Centre for MND Research, My Name'5 Doddie Foundation, UK Dementia Research Institute and Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than four million people in the UK have received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to government figures.\nPeople in their 70s and the clinically extremely vulnerable in England are now among those being offered the vaccine.\nHowever, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said UK data showed more people were in hospital with Covid than ever - and urged people to follow lockdown rules.\nHe said: \"Do not blow it now. We are on the route out. We have to stick at it.\"\nSpeaking during a Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock said more than half of those over 80 and half of elderly care home residents had been vaccinated.\nHe said that in some parts of the country the \"vast majority\" of people in their 80s had had their first dose - and specifically congratulated Slough for having already vaccinated every single elderly care home resident. \nEarlier, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey had said people in her constituency in the Suffolk Coastal area had told her some over-80s, and even over-90s, had not been invited for a vaccination while younger people had been.\nWhen Mr Hancock was asked why some areas of the UK were reporting not having enough vaccines, he said \"supply is the rate-limiting factor\".\nHe said the government was now \"prioritising the supply\" to places that needed to vaccinate over-80s - but did not want to stop areas that had progressed well from pressing on with vaccinating their other priority groups.\nThe Covid vaccination programme continues to gather pace. More than four million people have now received their first dose, meaning half of those targeted to start with - the over 80s, care home residents and health and care staff have now been vaccinated.\nIn some areas the figures are close to nine in 10, which is why ministers in England have given the NHS the green light to start inviting those in their 70s in for vaccination.\nThe progress means the UK continues to be among the countries with the highest vaccination rates globally.\nChallenges remain though. The announcement last week that the supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab will be slower than anticipated in the coming weeks will have an impact.\nWhile the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now taking up a greater share of the UK's supply, the Pfizer-BioNTech is still a crucial part of the programme and will mean the pace of rollout will be slower than it would have been otherwise.\nMinisters are confident the mid February target to offer 15 million high-risk people a vaccine will not be affected - there is already enough vaccine in the country for them - but it again illustrates why there is such nervousness about supply chains.\nA further 599 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the latest government figures.  Figures are often lower on a Monday because of lags in reporting data over the weekend.\nAnother 37,535 positive cases were reported - down from a high of 68,053 reported on 8 January.\nIt comes as 10 further mass vaccination hubs opened across England, adding to seven already in place.\nSpeaking during a visit to a vaccination centre in Oxford, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was \"right\" to offer the jab to other priority groups from this week.\n\"I think actually the whole of the UK is going very well. And, overall, the pace of the rollout is very encouraging,\" he said.\nHe warned there would be no \"Open Sesame\" relaxation of Covid restrictions, adding that any easing was reliant on the vaccine rollout being a success and there being no further concerning variants of the virus.\nThe number of people who have received their first dose of the vaccine is now 4,062,501 - which is more than have tested positive (3,433,494) in the UK since the pandemic began.\nThe expansion of the vaccination programme means it now includes priority groups three and four - people in their 70s and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals.\nHowever, people in the top two groups - care home residents, those aged 80 and over, and front-line healthcare workers - should still be prioritised for vaccinations, the Department for Health and Social Care said.\nNadhim Zahawi, the minister responsible for the vaccine rollout, said that although vaccine supply remained \"lumpy\", he was \"confident\" the government would meet its target to vaccinate all 15 million people in the top four priority groups by 15 February.\nMeanwhile, Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said there was more pressure on the NHS than ever before.\nSpeaking alongside Mr Hancock in the briefing, he said around 15,000 people had been admitted to hospital since Christmas Eve, adding: \"That is well over 20 hospitals worth of patients.\"\nHe said it would be \"some time\" before the vaccination programme begins to reduce pressures on hospitals.\nIn Oxfordshire, hospitals have postponed routine operations because of a high number of coronavirus patients.\nAnd the BBC's Clive Myrie has been to the Royal London Hospital to report on staff struggling to cope.\nThe seven hubs already in use are in: Etihad Tennis Centre, Manchester; Epsom Downs Racecourse, Surrey; Robertson House, Stevenage; Centre for Life, Newcastle; Ashton Gate Stadium, Bristol; Millennium Point, Birmingham; ExCel, London.\nDr Rupert Pearse, a consultant in Intensive Care Medicine at a London hospital, said although it appeared that infection levels had peaked in the capital, cases were still rising elsewhere in England, including the North West and Yorkshire, adding there was \"still cause to be concerned\".\nHe told BBC Radio 4's World At One that hospital admissions tended to \"lag seven to 10 days behind the peak in infections\", with intensive care admissions coming 48 hours after that.\nHe said that hospitals that are very close to the maximum number of beds they can give to Covid patients were \"still very worried about what will happen in the coming days\".\nDr Sarah Burford, a GP in Wellington, Somerset, who has been helping lead the vaccine rollout in her region, said it was going \"terribly well\" but that \"a few\" patients had turned up out of the blue looking for a jab.\nShe told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme that her four vaccinators were each giving a jab every seven-and-a-half minutes.\nDr Burford added the over-80s and frontline healthcare workers were being invited for jabs, and her team's \"priority\" for this week and next would be vaccinating care home residents and staff.\nShe said that although most people were being patient, fielding calls or walk-in inquiries about when people could expect to be vaccinated was only delaying staff from administering jabs.\nMeanwhile, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has defended the speed of the vaccine rollout in Wales, insisting the nation is \"on track\" to vaccinate all top four priority groups by mid-February.\nHe told Today that Wales's supply of the Pfizer jab was not being used all at once as it has to last until a delivery in February.\nIn Wales, 151,737 people have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine, according to Public Health Wales, and  in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that 264,991 people have had a first dose of the jab, with 80% of care home residents having now been vaccinated.\nWhile the prime minster said the UK was making \"huge progress in our fight against the virus\", he also expressed concern about that progress being derailed by new - currently unknown - variants of the virus.\nAs such, he announced on Friday that, from this week, all travel corridors are to be closed.\nThat means that anyone arriving in the UK - with only a small number of exceptions - will have to quarantine. Under current rules, anyone flying into the country from overseas also has to show proof of a negative Covid test before setting off.\n Are you due to have a coronavirus vaccine?

For Labour, taking it away is a cut.\nMinisters would prefer we looked at the overall level of support they've provided for workers and businesses during the pandemic. The opposition say the \u00a320 a week boost is a powerful symbol of the state's willingness to help. \nEven the act of debating it today is disputed. Labour say they've got the right occasionally to set the agenda in Parliament. Boris Johnson said his MPs risk abuse from campaigners and protestors if they engage. \nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation has suggested about 16 million people will be directly affected if the \u00a320 is rolled back.\nIt says 500,000 more people will be driven into poverty, including 200,000 children, while a further 500,000 of those already in poverty will find themselves in even worse hardship. \nHowever, free market think tank the Institute for Economic Affairs has argued that \"across-the-board benefit increases are a wasteful use of taxpayers' money\" at a time when the government is borrowing \"a hair-raising amount of money\". \nUniversal credit is a single payment replacing old benefits such as housing benefit and child tax credits.\nYou can claim universal credit if you are on a low income or are out of work. \nThe standard allowance varies from around \u00a3340 to just under \u00a3600 a month, depending on your age or whether you are single. \nYou may be eligible to receive more money on top of the standard allowance if, for example, you have children or a health condition. \nSpeaking on behalf of the Northern Research Group, Conservative MP John Stevenson said the \u00a31,000 increase had been \"a real life-saver for people throughout this pandemic\".\n\"To end it now would be devastating for the 6 million individuals and families who are already struggling to stay afloat,\" he added.\nWhile the vote is not binding, and will not lead to a change in policy, it will increase pressure on the government to keep the increase or come up with an alternative.\nLabour said the Conservatives' decision to abstain created \"unnecessary uncertainty\" but minister Nadhim Zahawi described the vote as \"a political stunt\".\nThe government says it has strengthened the welfare system with an extra \u00a37bn of funding during the pandemic while families struggling with food and household bills can get help through the \u00a3170m Winter Grant Scheme. \nMinisters also point to extra support for housing costs, through an increase in local housing allowance for those on housing benefits and hardship payments worth \u00a3670m next year for those unable to pay their council tax bills."

      "text": "Medical staff are expected to \"face pressures unlike any other they have faced before\" as NI approaches its toughest week so far in the pandemic.\nThe British Medical Association has said while its doctors are \"coping\", many feel they are unable to give care to the \"standard they would want\".  \nThe peak in intensive care is predicted to happen next weekend.\nThe head of the BMA in NI, Dr Tom Black has been critical of the way this wave of the pandemic has been managed.  \nHe said: \"Staff will do their best in a very difficult situation, where many decisions in this pandemic were made too late.\"\nWhile it is expected the number of hospital admissions will peak sometime over the next eight to 10 days, the number requiring intensive care treatment is likely to continue increasing for at least another fortnight.\nDr Black said he was concerned for both patients and staff.\nHe said: \"It is likely that over the next few weeks doctors will be asked to work in a new location or provide support to areas that are already overstretched.\n\"Many have already had planned annual leave cancelled.\"\nThere were a further 19 virus-related deaths and 640 more Covid-19 cases reported in Northern Ireland on Monday. \nThe latest figures from the Department of Health bring the total number of deaths to 1,625, while 96,001 people have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic began.\nSome 65 patients are in ICU, down two from the last report, and 51 patients are being ventilated.\nSince the vaccine rollout began in NI, 146,733 people have been vaccinated, according to the Department of Health.\nOf that number, 125,717 were first doses and 21,016 were second jabs.\nA total of 31,393 people from the over-80 age group have been vaccinated.\nEarlier the BMA told BBC News NI that more than 90,000 doses the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine had arrived in Northern Ireland but the Department of Health has said it is anticipated separate deliveries will arrive by this weekend. \nDr Black said many staff members had reported feeling \"exhausted and demoralised\" and he warned that when it came to reviewing how the pandemic was handled \"this phase will stand out as one where we could have planned better\". \nHealth Minister Robin Swann said the next seven days is \"when we will see that real intense pressure coming on our inpatients and intensive care units\".\n\"Our worst case scenario has modelling up to 1,200 inpatients - and that's a serious pressure that comes on our system,\" he told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.\n\"We can go up into nearly 200 ICU capacity but that comes at a stretch, that comes with putting our staff under severe pressure in ICU units.\n\"It also comes by having to shift the ICU specialist nurse from a ratio of one-to-one to a ratio of one-to-two or even one-to-three in extreme pressures. \n\"That's not something we want to do,\" he added.\nThe past week saw hospitals across Northern Ireland coming together in order to cope with the strain.\nOn 10 January, the Southern Health Trust was on the cusp of declaring a major incident amid the mounting pressures across the health service.\nThat was avoided as many off-duty staff answered a call to come into work and the health trusts pulled together to provide a regional response to the crisis.\nPatients were diverted to those hospitals which could take them and where infrastructure could cope with supplying additional oxygen to the very ill.\nOver the weekend of 9/10 January the Southern Health Trust - the smallest of the health trusts - was dealing with the highest number of patients who required oxygen.\nIn the past week the Northern and Southern Health Trusts have seen the highest number of patients.\nThat reflects the high rate of community transmission in some areas those trusts cover.\nMeanwhile, no resolution has been reached between Stormont leaders and the Irish Government over the sharing of passenger data.\nLast week, First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill criticised Dublin for failing to share information on travellers arriving there during the pandemic.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said repeated efforts to access data on passenger locator forms filled out by people arriving in the Republic of Ireland had failed.\nMrs Foster and Ms O'Neill indicated on Thursday that they planned to raise the matter directly with Taoiseach (Irish prime minsiter) Miche\u00e1l Martin.\nMs O'Neill told the Northern Ireland Assembly on Monday that no resolution has been found yet.\nShe told MLAs the issue had been raised \"on every occasion we have had the opportunity\" and that it was \"regrettable\" that the issue had not been resolved. \nThe travel issue will be discussed at a meeting on Wednesday involving the first minister, the deputy first minister, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney and NI Secretary of State Brandon Lewis.\n\"I hope that perhaps Wednesday's meeting will allow some opportunity for there to be a way forward,\" the deputy first minister added.\nIt was announced on Sunday that all travellers who have returned from Portugal or transited through 16 South American countries in the past 14 days will have to - along with their household - self-isolate for 10 days upon return to Northern Ireland. \nThis includes travellers who entered these countries en route to another destination. All travellers returning home from South America are advised to be tested, whether or not they have symptoms. \nFrom Thursday, all international travellers will be required to present a negative Covid-19 test result before arriving in Northern Ireland.\nThis rule comes into effect in England, Scotland and Wales on Monday.\nOn Monday, the Department of Health in the Republic of Ireland reported eight more coronavirus-related deaths.\nIt brings its death toll to 2,616.\nThe department said 2,121 new cases of the virus had been reported, with a cumulative total of 174,843 infections.\nIt said that as of 14:00 local time on Monday, 1,975 Covid-19 patients are in hospital, of which 200 are in ICU (intensive care units).\nIrish Chief Medical Officer, Dr Tony Holohan, said: \"This third wave of the pandemic has seen higher level of hospitalisations across all age groups. \n\"There are now more sick people in hospital than any time in the course of this pandemic\"."

      "tags": "Swansea Bay University Health Board,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic,Vaughan Gething",
      "text": "Wales' health minister has insisted there is an \"increasing urgency and an increasing pace of delivery\" of vaccinations in the country.\nVaughan Gething told BBC 5 live the first minister had \"clarified\" remarks made on Monday that there was no point rushing to use all available vaccines.\nFormer Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb had said Mark Drakeford's comments were \"astonishing\".\nMr Gething said on Tuesday the vaccine was not being withheld.\nHe said the challenge was \"having enough infrastructure to deliver the Pfizer jab without wasting it\".\n\"Less than 1% of that vaccine is not being delivered, that's a very, very high level of efficiency,\" Mr Gething said.\n\"So we're able to roll out the vaccine in a way that we can deliver more and more of it. This week, we'll deliver even more of our Pfizer vaccine than last week.\"\nHe told BBC Radio Wales \"big progress\" was being made in delivering the vaccine and the NHS \"won't let people down\". \nOn Tuesday, Public Health Wales said 161,932 people had received their first vaccine, up 10,195 from the previous day's figures.\nThis is around 5.1% of the Welsh population, roughly the same rate for first doses as the vaccinations in Scotland.\nBoth are still behind England (6.5%) and Northern Ireland (7%)\nMr Gething said he could understand why \"an unsettling effect\" may have resulted from the way Mr Drakeford's interview \"was presented\". \n\"We are going as fast as possible,\" he said. \nSome swabs used in sampling for Covid-19 have been taken out of circulation after concerns they may have led to false positive test results.\nNHS Wales Shared Services Partnership is investigating its supply chain to establish how many of the swabs have been distributed and how many are still in stores, the Welsh Government said.\nIn a statement issued on Tuesday evening, Mr Gething said the swabs were used to sample for Covid-19 in hospital settings, at health board-run community testing units and some mobile testing units. \n\"As soon as this problem was discovered, all microbiology labs and testing centres in Wales were notified so that the affected swabs could be taken out of circulation,\" he said.\nMr Gething said the issue was identified on Friday by Public Health Wales (PHW) laboratory staff.\n\"The issue detected may have affected the accuracy of a small proportion of test results leading to false positives,\" he said. \n\"However, based on what we currently know, Public Health Wales is confident that this does not affect the overall epidemiological picture.\"\nHe said NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership was working with PHW, health boards, the manufacturer of the swabs COPAN and the UK supplier/distributor Thermo Fisher Scientific to \"identify and isolate the swabs potentially affected to prevent their ongoing use\".\nHe said the swabs have been isolated as a \"precaution while further investigations are undertaken\".\n\"More and more people are being protected - we are at the point where by the end of this week seven in 10 care home residents and staff should be protected, seven in 10 over-80s in Wales should be protected with their first shot.\n\"We're making really big progress with protecting our staff with their first vaccine. We're doing a really good job at increasing the pace. This is a race against the virus and to recover as much as possible of normal life.\" \nThe NHS \"won't let people down\", he said.\nMr Gething told the Senedd on Tuesday afternoon that more than \"60,000 Pfizer jabs have been released this week to NHS Wales to make sure they're put into people's arms\".\nConservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies was \"sadly\" not reassured by the health minister. \nHe said Mr Gething was trying to clear up the \"mess\" made by the first minister. \n\"In some respects the first minister didn't make a mess,\" he said. \n\"He spoke honestly about what Welsh Government policy is at the moment.\"\nMr Davies said he did not accept Mr Gething's defence that things were being done as quickly as they could.\nWith \"whole swathes of the economy shut down\", the vaccine was \"no good in the bottle\", he said.  \n\"It surely is a sprint and it is a sprint to get this vaccine out as quickly as possible to offer people protection against the virus,\" Mr Davies added.\nHe said \"we all want to see success\".\nPlaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said confidence in the system was \"very important\".\n\"We have this very confusing couple of days where the first minister says categorically they are holding the vaccine back and then, in a few hours, no, we are not holding the vaccine back. \n\"That kind of lack of clarity breeds confusion.\" \nVaccine needed to be delivered \"as quickly as possible,\" he added.\nGiven the criticism that the vaccination effort in Wales has been slow off the blocks, it would be a disaster if the Welsh Government ended up missing its official milestone of vaccinating the top four priority groups - including the over 70s - by about Valentine's Day in mid-February.\nBut if the effort continues at the speed it is now, that target won't be reached until mid-March.\nWe have estimated that to reach that target, way more than 20,000 first doses need to be given a day - almost double the current rate.\nIt would be even more than that if the Welsh Government wants to build in some wriggle room to accommodate any potential disruption in supply. \nBut the health minister insists Wales is on track to meet that commitment and the programme will quickly speed up.\nIn an effort to demonstrate what's achievable, Vaughan Gething said he was confident that  70% of over-80s and 70% of care home residents and staff will have been given their first jab by the end of the weekend. \nDuring a period of intense scrutiny by the public and his political rivals, this is a pledge that simply has to be delivered. \nDaniel Altman, a professor of immunology at Imperial College, London, said the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was \"unique\" because it had to be stored at -70C.\n\"These things are challenging but they're not insurmountable,\" he said.\n\"I watch what's happening in Wales with great interest to see if the numbers really can be caught up. That's the way to beat this and get transmission down.\"\nBronwen Rashad, of the Wye Valley, Monmouthshire, said her 78 and 81-year-old parents had not yet received vaccine appointments.\n\"The Welsh Government have done brilliantly with everything else, I don't why with the vaccine it has gone wrong,\" she said.\nShe said the situation was causing \"a lot of anxiety.\"\n\"My dad is really quite stressed about it,\" she said. \n\"Friends who have parents of a similar age in England have got their vaccine.\"\nDr Rebecca Towner, a GP at Whitchurch Road Surgery in Cardiff, said staff were \"really excited to be able to deliver\" the vaccine, with the first clinic held last Friday at the nearby All Nations Church.\n\"We managed to do the over 90s, which went really well,\" she said.\n\"We have only got a limited number of vaccines initially. We are hoping the supply will increase.\"\nShe said some patients were \"really anxious to get their vaccine as soon as possible\". \n\"We are having to be fair across the whole of Cardiff. There are 10 huge practices over the north of Cardiff that are part of the cluster we are in. \n\"We are trying to make sure there isn't any sort of postcode lottery, and that no demographic group is being disadvantaged in any way.\" \nDr Keith Reid, executive director of public health at Swansea Bay University Health Board, said the rate of vaccinations was increasing in the area.\n\"The rate-limiting step at the moment is the flow of vaccine,\" he said.\n\"We are working with pharmaceutical colleagues in Welsh Government to understand how vaccine will be coming down the line towards us so that we can prioritise our clinics against that, and make sure we have people coming in when we have vaccine.\""

      "tags": "Brexit,Fishing industry,Dartmouth",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has pledged \u00a323m to help businesses affected by Brexit delays amid protests by fishing firms.\nDemonstrations took place outside government departments in central London by exporters who are warning their livelihoods are under threat.\nExports of fresh fish and seafood have been severely disrupted by new border controls since the UK's transition period ended earlier this month.\nThe PM said firms would be compensated for delays that were not their fault.\nIndustry associations have complained that extra paperwork has made it difficult to deliver fresh produce to mainland Europe before it goes off.\nThey have warned that if the situation continues, jobs could soon be at risk.\nPressed on what he would do in response, Mr Johnson said the government would step in to support firms which \"through no fault of their own have experienced bureaucratic delays, difficulties getting their goods through, where there is a genuine willing buyer on the other side of the channel\".\n\"There's a \u00a323m compensation fund we've set up and we'll make sure they get help,\" he said.\nDetails of the scheme are expected later this week.\nAfter a day of protests in central London, which saw 20 lorries drive up Whitehall, the Metropolitan Police said 14 people had been reported for Covid-related offences, but no arrests were made.\nMark Moore, manager of the Dartmouth Crab Company, said his business and others were protesting to \"raise awareness\" of the impact of new border checks.\nHe told BBC Radio 5 Live his company had faced delays of up to eight and a half hours when delivering produce into the European Union.\nHe added that the situation was \"especially difficult\" for the shellfish sector, where goods were at risk of going off before reaching customers. \n\"It's not about the increased documentation per se,\" he said. \n\"We have taken that on board, and we ourselves - and I know many others - have had no issues with producing the actual paperwork.\n\"It's the volume required and the timeframe in which to produce it, which doesn't lend itself to live shellfish and fish generally.\"\nJohn McManus, BBC News\nThere are 24 lorries in total, overwhelmingly from seafood exporters in Scotland. Businesses taking part say the Brexit trade deal has left their industry high and dry. \nAnd although one haulier from Aberdeenshire I spoke to was keen to stress that their coordinated protest was peaceful, it is clear that they all feel that direct action is now necessary to make the government sit up and take notice.  \nGood natured though their action was, it did for a time cause serious traffic congestion along Whitehall and Parliament Square. \nHowever, low levels of traffic perhaps caused by the Covid lockdown meant the roads around Whitehall didn't grind to a complete halt. \nAt stake, they believe, is an industry, but also thousands of livelihoods. Exporters say they are backed by fishermen who are struggling to land their catches. \nAnd although the rural Scottish communities which are sustained by fishing might seem like a long way from the streets of SW1, the hauliers certainly made their presence felt this morning. \nHaving left the EU's customs union and the single market, UK exports are subject to new customs and veterinary checks which have caused problems at the border. \nSome Scottish fishermen have been landing their catch in Denmark to avoid the \"bureaucratic system\" involved in exporting to Europe, according to Scotland's rural economy secretary.\nLast week, Boris Johnson told a committee of MPs that fishing firms impacted by disruption would be compensated for \"temporary frustrations\".\nBut the BBC was told that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) did not know about the promise of compensation before it was made by Mr Johnson. \nSpeaking to reporters, the prime minister said he understood the \"frustrations\" of the fishing industry, noting its plight had been \"exacerbated by the Covid pandemic\".\n\"Unfortunately, the demand in restaurants on the continent for UK fish has not been what it was before the pandemic, just because the restaurants have been closed for so long,\" he added. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused ministers of trying to \"blame fishing communities\" for problems \"rather than accepting it's their failure to prepare\".\n\"The government has known there would be a problem with fishing and particularly the sale of fish into the EU for years,\" he told reporters. \nBy Martyn Oates, BBC South West Political Editor \nMuch media attention has been focussed on Scotland as this export crisis has unfolded.\nBut exactly the same problem is rearing its head in the UK's other great fishing stronghold - at the other end of the UK in Devon and Cornwall.\nA virtual Who's Who of South West fishing leaders wrote to the environment secretary back in November warning that the new post-Brexit export requirements would have a \"seriously detrimental effect\" on the industry, claiming this \"could be the final straw for many businesses\".\nHere, too, many fish exports have now ground to a halt and others have encountered obstacles and long delays.\nAnd exporters have reacted angrily to the government's repeated insistence that the issues they've been experiencing over the last two weeks are just \"teething problems\"."

The British Cuban dual national was unable to fly home to the UK when Cuba closed its borders in March.\nThe family say she had several previous flights cancelled before finally being able to leave this weekend. She hasn't been able to see her four children or her husband Trevor in 11 months.\nThe government are understood to be speaking to Air Europa to try to get Mrs Stone home. Carriers have been told that they should permit stranded passengers to board and will not be fined for doing so.\nWhile Mrs Stone has been caught out by the new restrictions for incoming travellers, the first day of the new regulations appeared to go smoothly.\nMrs Stone left Jose Marti International Airport in Havana, Cuba, on Sunday night to fly back to the UK via Madrid. \nShe took a Covid test on Thursday to be guaranteed a result by Saturday. It was negative and Mrs Stone was able to board the plane from Cuba. \nHowever, on arrival at Madrid-Barajas Airport, Mrs Stone says she was stopped from boarding the next leg of her journey to London Gatwick by Air Europa staff, because her test had been taken more than 72 hours before the final flight. \n\"She's crying her eyes out,\" says Trevor Stone, her husband. \"I feel absolutely helpless. She doesn't have any Euros as she wasn't meant to stay in Spain.

Morale's a bit down but I think we'll all pull together again like last time,\" she said.\n\"It breaks your heart, it's really sad, but we can't stop the weather.\"\nThe Environment Agency issued more than 30 flood warnings, meaning flooding is expected and immediate action required, covering parts of Yorkshire, Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, Merseyside, Staffordshire and Northamptonshire as of 03:00 GMT on Wednesday.\nThere are also more than 150 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible, issued across northern England, the Midlands and the east.\nCatherine Wright, acting executive director for flood and coastal risk management at the Environment Agency, said: \"That rain is falling on very wet ground and so we are very concerned that it's a very volatile situation and we are expecting significant flooding to occur on the back of that weather.\"\nShe said the agency would be working with local authorities to help with evacuation efforts should a severe flood warning be issued, adding: \"If you do need to evacuate then that is allowed within the Covid rules.\"\nDiscussing the different levels of flood warnings, she said: \"If you receive a flood alert, please pack valuables like medicines and insurance documents in a bag ready to go. \n\"If you receive a flood warning, please move valuables and precious possessions upstairs and be ready to turn off gas, electricity and water.\n\"If you receive a severe flood warning, which means you will be evacuated, please listen out and take heed of the advice from the local emergency services.\"  \nBarry Greenwood, from the Upper Calder Valley Flood Prevention Group in West Yorkshire, has been \"sick\" with worry.\n\"I went round after the last [flood], people were there with their heads in their hands, thinking 'what am I going to do now?',\" he said.\nFlood sirens were sounded in Walsden on Tuesday evening after a flood warning was issued for the area.\nIn a tweet, Calderdale Council asked residents to put their flood plan into action and move valuables to a safe place.\n\"River levels across the Upper River Calder have risen and are now approaching levels where we expect properties to flood,\" it warned.\nEarlier it had said staff were on standby to respond overnight.\nA yellow rain alert is also in place for Wales, Northern Ireland, central and northern England and southern Scotland on Tuesday.\nThis yellow warning extends to the rest of England from Wednesday, with a yellow alert for snow and ice in north east Scotland.   \nHighways England advised drivers to take extra care on motorways and major A roads, while the RAC breakdown service said motorists should only drive if absolutely necessary."

The chosen location for her restaurant was also not considered promising enough. \nDishes on her seven-dish gourmet menu at her eatery (currently closed because of the coronavirus pandemic) include combinations of ingredients such as fir tree, boletus mushroom and sake, or celery, tonka and amber ale."

This is a strategic direction that we need to take to have a branch network fit for the future.\"\nThis would include changing some branches to concentrate on cash access, as well as the use of \"pop-up\" branches in some areas by the end of the year.

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The world faces a \"catastrophic moral failure\" because of unequal Covid vaccine policies, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was not fair for younger, healthy people in richer nations to get injections before vulnerable people in poorer states.\nHe said over 39 million vaccine doses had been given in 49 richer states - but one poor nation had only 25 doses. \nMeanwhile, both the WHO and China were criticised for their Covid response.\nAn independent panel commissioned by the WHO said the UN public health body should have declared an international emergency earlier, and also rapped China for not taking public health measures sooner.\nSo far, China, India, Russia, the UK and the US have all developed Covid vaccines, with others being made by multinational teams - like the American-German Pfizer vaccine.\nAlmost all of these nations have prioritised distribution to their own populations.\nSpeaking at a WHO executive board session on Monday, Dr Tedros said, \"I need to be blunt: the world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure - and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world's poorest countries.\"\nDr Tedros said a \"me-first\" approach would be self-defeating because it would push up prices and encourage hoarding. \n\"Ultimately, these actions will only prolong the pandemic, the restrictions needed to contain it, and human and economic suffering,\" he added.\nAnd the WHO head called for a full commitment to the global vaccine-sharing scheme Covax, which is due to start rolling out next month. \n\"My challenge to all member states is to ensure that by the time World Health Day arrives on 7 April, Covid-19 vaccines are being administered in every country, as a symbol of hope for overcoming both the pandemic and the inequalities that lie at the root of so many global health challenges,\" Dr Tedros said.\nSo far, more than 180 countries have signed up to the Covax initiative, which is supported by the WHO and a group of international vaccine advocacy groups. Its aim is to unite countries into one bloc so they have more power to negotiate with drug companies.\nNinety-two countries - all of them low or middle-income - will have their vaccines paid for by a fund sponsored by donors. \n\"We have secured two billion doses from five producers, with options of more than one billion more doses, and we aim to start deliveries in February,\" Dr Tedros said.\nReacting to Dr Tedros' warning, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"The UK is the world's biggest supporter, financial supporter, of the global programme to ensure access to vaccines in all countries in the world.\"\nMr Hancock said the UK had \"put the most financial support in these international efforts to ensure everybody has access to vaccines\".\nThe UK government has provided \u00a3548m ($734m) to the Covax programme.\nMore than four million people in the UK have received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to government figures.\nPeople in their 70s and the clinically extremely vulnerable in England are now among those being offered the jab.\nLast month, the People's Vaccine Alliance coalition of campaigning bodies said that rich countries were hoarding doses of Covid vaccines and people living in poor countries were set to miss out.\nIt said that nearly 70 lower-income countries would only be able to vaccinate one in 10 people.\nCanada, in particular, came in for criticism, with the coalition saying the North American nation had ordered enough vaccine doses to protect each Canadian five times.\nIn December, Karina Gould, Canada's minister of international development, denied allegations the country was hoarding vaccines, saying any discussion of a surplus was \"hypothetical\" as the doses had not been delivered. \nShe said Canada was providing C$485 million ($380 million; \u00a3280 million) to help developing countries cope with Covid-19.\nIn their interim report, the panel of independent experts said both China and the WHO should have acted faster during the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak.\nThe document said that Beijing should have acted more forcefully to localise the initial outbreak in the city of Wuhan first detected in late 2019.\nThe experts also criticised the WHO for only declaring a global emergency on 30 January 2020.\n \"The global pandemic alert system is not fit for purpose,\" the report said. \"The World Health Organization has been underpowered to do the job.\"\nThe panel of experts was led by former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark and former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf."

      "text": "Schools in England may reopen region by region after half term, the government's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries has said.\nSpeaking to the Commons education committee, Dr Harries suggested there would be different rates of infection across the country when lockdown ends.\nThis would mean a \"differential application\" of restrictive measures would be required, she said.\nSchools were closed at the start of January to stem the spread of Covid-19.\nAlthough schools remain open to vulnerable children and those of keyworkers, all others are due to learn remotely from home until after the February half term holiday.\nBut the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, has suggested they may not return fully then.\nA Department for Education spokesperson said the department was continuing to keep plans for the return to school under review and that it would inform schools, parents and pupils of the plans ahead of February half term.\nCommittee chairman Robert Halfon said he suspected schools would be closed for quite \"a few weeks yet\", but there has been no formal confirmation of this.\nMedical and science advisers were warning the government before Christmas that the NHS would not be able to manage the number of Covid-19 cases if schools remained open. \nThe new, more transmissible variant of the virus had been increasing exponentially in London and the south-east before Christmas. \nBut in some parts of the north  and north-east saw rates of increase were reducing.\nDr Harries said: \"It is highly likely that when we come out of this national lockdown we will not have consistent patterns of infection in our communities across the country.\n\"And therefore, as we had prior to the national lockdown, it may well be possible that we need to have some differential application.\"\nBut Dr Harries said schools would be at the top of the priority to ensure that the balance of education and wellbeing were \"right at the forefront\" of consideration.\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"Although the government intends that schools will fully reopen after the February half-term holiday, it is clearly in the balance when this happens and whether there will be any sort of regional approach. \n\"We expect that it will depend on coronavirus infection rates and the pressure on the NHS, and that the government will make a call on this issue nearer the time. \n\"What is important is that when schools fully reopen, everything possible is done to keep them open and to keep disruption to a minimum. \n\"This is why we are calling for education staff to be prioritised for vaccinations as soon as possible, and for schools to be given more support in the use of rapid turnaround mass testing.\"\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said if the government was planning to stagger opening of schools by region, it needed to \"provide clarity sooner rather than later\".\n\"This will give vital time to prepare for a smoother reopening of schools and business,\" he said.\nOn calls for vaccination of teachers, Dr Harries suggested the safe re-opening of schools did not depend on this.\nBut members of the committee suggested education would be less disrupted by teachers needing to go home and isolate when infected.\nThe vaccination programme had been worked out in order of vulnerability to the disease, she stressed.\nAnd Dr Harries added that although pupils could and did transmit the virus, she did not have evidence of them being \"a significant driver\" of \"large-scale community infections\"."

We'll have another update for you this evening.\n\"Justice delayed is justice denied\" is a common expression in the legal system. And because of Covid-19, many crime victims are being denied justice - as a backlog of court cases means alleged perpetrators are not being put on trial promptly. Jury trials stopped during the first period of the pandemic. Although they have resumed - with social distancing - many crimes committed last year will not reach trial until next year. The number of outstanding crown court cases in England and Wales has grown from 40,000 in March to 54,000 now. In one example, a domestic violence case from summer 2019 was expected to reach trial in spring 2020. It won't now be heard until spring 2022. \"I am so desperate to move on... I feel utterly powerless,\" said the victim.\nUS President-elect Joe Biden's spokeswoman says the US will maintain travel bans on the UK, much of the EU and Brazil - despite an order from President Donald Trump to lift them. The White House decreed on Monday that the entry ban would end on 26 January - six days after Mr Biden takes office. But Mr Biden's spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said on Twitter that now was not the time to ease travel measures. Read about the UK's travel restrictions here.\nCampaigners are bringing a judicial review for indirect sexual discrimination on Thursday. They say the self-employed income support scheme - which averages profits between 2016 and 2019 - is unfair to around 75,000 women who've taken maternity leave. Watch more below.\nJane works as an administrator for a private healthcare firm in Oxfordshire - a job she is expected to do from the office, even in lockdown. However, since she caught Covid at work before Christmas, she has chosen to work from home because she feels safer - something that is causing problems with her boss. \"The office is so small and it is impossible to socially distance,\" she tells the BBC.

Thousands of people are critically ill in hospital, and as many as 5% of Londoners are thought to have the virus in some parts of the city. As coronavirus continues to circulate silently around the capital, staff at the London Ambulance Service (LAS) are under immense pressure.\nThe service is currently taking up to 8,500 calls a day, compared with a pre-Covid figure of 5,000 to 6,000, according to its chief executive Garrett Emmerson. \nLizzie Cooke is one of the workers at LAS's south London headquarters who are dealing with strangers at what is a distressing time. \nCalmly, the 30-year-old answers the phone and usually asks first if the patient is breathing.\n\"In the first wave we were getting a lot of calls of [people seeking] reassurance,\" Lizzie says. \"But now there are more and more who have symptoms, and family members are really frightened.\"\nIt is a fear that Lizzie knows all too well, having been hospitalised with Covid-19 in March. She spent a week receiving treatment for the virus.\n\"I was at work taking calls and struggling to concentrate,\" the call-handling supervisor says. \"At times I would just have my head on the desk in between calls.\n\"I started to develop chest pains five days later so my parents took me to Royal County Hospital, in Hampshire, and an X-ray showed a lot of fluid in my lungs. It was quite horrible.\n\"Luckily, I wasn't on a ventilator but I had the oxygen hood, and the nurses were so rushed off their feet. I didn't have my phone with me or know my parents' numbers off by heart so for that week I was quite alone and isolated. \n\"It was just a mixture of the unknown and not knowing when it was going to stop that was so daunting.\"\nLizzie's personal battle with coronavirus has helped her to empathise with people who call up with breathing problems.\nIt's something she says she's having to do more and more.\n\"Just before Christmas we were getting a lot of respiratory and cardiac arrest calls,\" she says. \"You could just hear colleagues counting to four [for chest compressions] and it was echoing around the room. It has been tough.\n\"We are getting calls from family members who are really frightened. I covered the London Bridge terror attacks and Grenfell but this is a different scale.\n\"I did get one call for toothache, but that's part of the job.\"\nLizzie, who lives in Hampshire, says that because the coverage of coronavirus is everywhere, it is \"difficult to escape\". \nWhen she's not at work she binge-watches Line of Duty on Netflix, but she says winding down isn't easy.\nLizzie sometimes thinks about the people who aren't following the rules aimed at helping stop the spread of the virus, and those who deny Covid-19 even exists.\n\"It's a kick in the teeth,\" she says. \"It is frustrating on the way to work when you see people not wearing masks or even posting stuff on social media not believing the virus is real. \n\"I just don't know where the disconnect is coming from; there are many people in hospital, many people dying, and I don't know what more needs to be said to make them realise how dangerous the illness is.\"\nSitting a few metres away from Lizzie is 24-year-old Louise Essam, who has been in the job for two years.\n\"Every call we take at the moment is coronavirus,\" she says. \"My record was 108 calls in a day back in March during the first wave.\n\"But easily in the last few weeks I've been taking around 100 a day at times,\" Louise adds.\n\"Sometimes I'll come in for a shift and can just hear colleagues counting one, two, three, four, for the compressions, and you just know what kind of shift it is going to be.\n\"It has been tough and quite frustrating, really. We are trying to help people. We are under so much pressure as there are high waiting times, but we are just doing the best we can.\"\nHelp is at hand though from the LAS workers' fellow emergency services personnel.\nSeventy-five Met Police officers are currently being trained at Wembley Stadium to drive ambulances.\nThey will start work as drivers from 20 January, joining the 200 firefighters who are already helping LAS.\n\"It came as a huge relief when they announced it,\" says 37-year-old paramedic Ben West.\nAs is the case with many frontline workers, Ben says he is concerned about the dangers of exposure to coronavirus.\nHe has lost four colleagues to Covid-19, including Ian Reynolds, a paramedic based in Croydon, and Melonie Mitchell, a member of the NHS 111 team. They both died during the first wave in April.\n\"I wouldn't be a normal person if I said I wasn't scared,\" he says.\n\"I am scared and I do worry but we take every day as it comes, take our precautions and we just see where we go with that. \n\"We know the virus is out there in the community and we are not immune.\""

      "tags": "Uighurs",
      "text": "The government has narrowly seen off a rebellion by 33 Tory MPs, who want to outlaw trade deals with countries judged to be committing genocide.\nMPs voted by 319 to 308 to remove an amendment to the Trade Bill which would have forced ministers to withdraw from deals with nations the UK High Court ruled guilty of mass killings.\nIt comes amid condemnation of China's treatment of the Uighur people. \nThe rebels believe they have enough support to secure another vote soon.\nAmong those to defy the government were ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, former cabinet ministers David Davis and Damian Green and Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. \nThe rebellion is one of the largest on an issue not related to the Covid-19 pandemic during Boris Johnson's time as prime minister. \nThe government has a Commons majority of 80 but this was whittled down to just 11 as prominent ex-ministers such as Tobias Ellwood, Caroline Nokes and Nusrat Ghani, as well as a number of MPs first elected last year, sided with the opposition.\nMPs have been debating proposals, tabled by cross-bench peer Lord Alton, to give British courts the right to decide if a country is committing genocide, a decision currently left to the jurisdiction of international courts.  \nThe proposals, also backed by Labour, would mean that ministers would have to revoke post-Brexit trade deals with countries that were ruled to be carrying out systematic mass killings. \nThe issue is expected to resurface when the Trade Bill returns to the House of Lords.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Conservative rebels, led by former leader Iain Duncan Smith, were unable to force a vote on a separate amendment they had proposed.\nEvery speaker in today's debate - from the front and back benches - said genocide was abhorrent. The worst of crimes. There was united criticism of China's brutal treatment of the Uighurs too. \nBut the question Parliament has been wrestling with is whether the High Court should have the right to decide if a country is committing genocide. And if they did judge a country has been carrying out mass killings, should the High Court be able to compel the government to revoke any trade treaty it has with that country? \nMinisters insist it should be the job of elected governments, not judges, to determine trade policy. But opposition parties and a large cohort of Tory backbenchers argue it's essential the High Court can rule on genocide and ensure the UK's new trade-making freedom has an obligation to uphold human rights too. \nThis also is an argument about where power lies after Brexit and what role Parliament should have in shaping trade policy after decades in the EU.\nBut BBC Newsnight political editor Nick Watt said that by securing large, but not overwhelming, support for Lord Alton's amendment in the Commons, the rebels hope the government will accept Mr Duncan Smith's own amendment - which would give the Commons the right to debate whether trade deals can be halted if genocide is proven. \nThe debate came as the US government formally declared that China was committing genocide in its repression of Uighur muslims in Xinjiang.\nThe UK government has been critical of China's treatment of the Uighurs and last week announced measures to cut UK business links with forced labour camps in the region. \nBut some MPs suspect the government is pulling its punches to avoid antagonising Beijing. \nMr Duncan Smith said the debate was \"all about simply shining a light of hope to all those out there who have failed to get their day in court and failed to be treated properly\".\n\"If this country doesn't stand up for that then I want to know what would it ever stand up for again?,\" he added. \nBut Trade Minister Greg Hands said it was unprecedented and unacceptable to give the courts powers to revoke trade deals agreed by elected governments. \nAnd he argued that no one would benefit from the proposal because the UK currently had no free trade deal with China."

      "tags": "Daily Mail and General Trust,Thomas Markle,Meghan, Duchess of Sussex,The Royal Family and the media,UK newspapers,Privacy",
      "text": "The publication of a letter from the Duchess of Sussex to her father was a \"triple-barrelled invasion\" of her privacy, the High Court has been told.\nMeghan is suing the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online over articles that reproduced parts of the private handwritten letter.\nShe claims her privacy and copyright were breached by the newspaper group.\nHer lawyers are asking for summary judgement - a dismissal of Associated Newspapers' defence instead of a trial.\nMeghan's lawyers argue Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) has \"no prospect\" of defending the privacy and copyright claims being brought against them.\nThey claim the publication of extracts from the private, handwritten letter to Thomas Markle was \"self-evidently... highly intrusive\".   \nMeghan, 39, sent the letter to her father in August 2018, following her marriage to Prince Harry in May that year, which Mr Markle did not attend. The couple are now living in the US with their son Archie. \nThe five articles, published in February 2019, were a \"triple-barrelled invasion\" of the duchess's privacy, correspondence and family, the lawyers claim. \nMr Markle said in a witness statement provided to the remote hearing, which started on Tuesday, that he wanted the letter published to \"set the record straight\" about his relationship with his daughter - but one of Meghan's lawyers described this claim as \"ridiculous\". \nMeghan is seeking damages from the newspaper group for alleged misuse of private information, copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act over the articles.\nHer lawyers told the court the letter was written in sorrow rather than anger and was an attempt to get her father to stop talking to the press. \nBut the newspaper group said in its response to the court that Meghan had written the letter \"with a view to it being disclosed publicly at some future point\" in order to \"defend her against charges of being an uncaring or unloving daughter\".\nIn written submissions, the newspaper group's barrister Antony White said \"she must, at the very least, have appreciated that her father might choose to disclose it\" and pointed out that the Kensington Palace communications team had been shown the letter before it was sent.\n\"No truly private letter from daughter to father would require any input from the Kensington Palace communications team,\" said Mr White.\nBut Meghan's lawyers also pointed out the articles themselves had emphasised the private nature of the correspondence - and dismissed any argument that it was in the public interest for the newspaper to reproduce the letter, saying the public interest was at the \"very end of the bottom end of the scale\".\nJustin Rushbrooke, representing the duchess, described the handwritten letter as \"a heartfelt plea from an anguished daughter to her father\".\nHe said the \"contents and character of the letter were intrinsically private, personal and sensitive in nature\" and that Meghan \"had a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of the contents of the letter\".\nThe effect of publishing the letter was \"self-evidently likely to be devastating for the claimant\", said Mr Rushbrooke.\nThe barrister argued that, even if ANL was justified in publishing parts of the letter, \"on any view the defendant published far more by way of extracts from the letter than could have been justified in the public interest\". \nMr White said that the newspaper group would argue that Meghan's status as a member of the royal family was relevant to the case. \nIn response to that point, Mr Rushbrooke said: \"Yes, she is in some senses a public figure, but that does not reduce her expectation of privacy in relation to information of this kind.\"\nIn Thomas Markle's evidence, he said the letter \"signalled the end\" of his relationship with his daughter, and instead of a reconciliation attempt, the letter was a \"criticism\" of him. \nHe said that he had to \"defend himself\" against an article in People magazine. It carried an interview with a \"long-time friend\" of his daughter, who suggested Meghan sent the letter to repair her relationship with her father - something he claimed was false. \nThe People article, he claimed, made him appear \"dishonest, exploitative, publicity-seeking, uncaring and cold-hearted\".\nHe said he had \"never intended to talk publicly about Meg's letter\" until he read the People magazine piece which, he claimed, suggested he was \"to blame for the end of the relationship\".\nThe full trial of the duchess's claim had been due to be heard at the High Court this month, but last year the case was adjourned until autumn 2021.\nThis interim remote hearing - to consider the request for summary judgement - is due to last two days. Mr Justice Warby, who is hearing the case, is expected to reserve his judgement to a later date."

      "tags": "Sheku Bayoh death inquiry,Kirkcaldy",
      "text": "Two police officers involved in the death of a black man they were restraining may have provided false statements, the BBC can reveal.\nThey said Sheku Bayoh carried out a stamping attack on a female PC before he was brought to the ground and restrained by up to six officers. \nBut now an eyewitness has spoken publicly for the first time about the 2015 incident.\nHe told a Panorama investigation that the stamping attack \"never happened\".  \nThe Scottish Police Federation said its officers had cooperated truthfully with investigators.\nMr Bayoh, a 31-year-old father of two, died in the incident in the Fife town of Kirkcaldy in 2015.\nA public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his death has recently got under way. One of its tasks is to examine whether his race was a factor. \nOn the night of 2 May 2015, Sheku Bayoh had taken drugs, which friends said dramatically altered his behaviour. \nPolice were called early the following morning after he was spotted behaving erratically with a knife in the streets of his home town. \nAccording to police statements, by the time the officers arrived at the scene Mr Bayoh no longer had the knife but he failed to obey instructions to get down on the ground. \nEach of the officers used force on Mr Bayoh within seconds of encountering him, including CS Spray and batons.\nHe then punched PC Nicole Short, who went to the ground. \nTwo officers, PCs Craig Walker and Ashley Tomlinson, would later tell investigators that Mr Bayoh then carried out a violent stamping attack on PC Short while she lay on the ground, a claim reported widely in the media. \nPC Walker told investigators: \"I had a clear view of him\u2026 he had his arms raised up at right angles to his body and brought his right foot down in a full-force stamp on to her lower back.\"\nPC Tomlinson said: \"I thought he had killed her. He stomped on her back again.\"\nNow, evidence obtained by Panorama suggests these accounts may be false. \nMr Bayoh was restrained on the ground for five minutes before falling unconscious. He was pronounced dead at hospital a short time later.\nA post-mortem examination report revealed 23 separate injuries to Mr Bayoh's body, including a broken rib and gashes to his head. The cause of death was recorded as \"sudden death in a man intoxicated [with drugs] whilst under restraint\".  \nIn 2018, the Crown Office in Scotland decided there would be no prosecutions against any officers involved. \nKevin Nelson was in a nearby house and saw events unfold over a garden hedge.\nHe gave his account to investigators from Pirc (Police Investigations and Review Commissioner), which investigates deaths in custody, two days after the incident. \nSpeaking publicly for the first time, Mr Nelson told Panorama he saw Mr Bayoh attempt to walk away from the officers, ignoring their commands, before being sprayed with CS spray. He said Mr Bayoh retaliated and punched PC Short. \nAsked if there had been any further contact with PC Short, he said, \"No. He was running off\u2026 after the punch, there was no more attack on her at all.\"\nMr Nelson said Mr Bayoh ran off from where PC Short went down and was quickly intercepted by the other officers.  \nAsked about PC Walker's claim that Mr Bayoh had \"his arms raised up\u2026 and brought his right foot down in a full force stamp\", Mr Nelson said: \"That never happened. I didn't see him stamping at all or, other than the punch, any raised arms.\n\"After the punch, that was it. There was no more attack on her at all. That's not right.\"\nThe officers provided their accounts to investigators 32 days after Mr Bayoh's death. \nMr Nelson said no-one from Pirc returned to ask about the discrepancy between their account and his.\nThe eyewitness said he decided to speak out because it was unfair on Mr Bayoh's family that the officers had \"made the incident worse than it actually was to justify what had happened and\u2026 that's not right\".\nMr Nelson's account is supported by CCTV footage of the incident, obtained by the BBC. \nIt is poor quality but appears to show that once PC Short is knocked down by Mr Bayoh, the action moves away from her, and he is brought down within five seconds.\nPC Short did not mention in her statement she had been stamped on. Now retired, she later said she was unsure if she was conscious, and only learned about the alleged stamping attack when her colleagues told her about it afterwards. \nIn the CCTV, PC Short appears to get to her feet a few seconds after Mr Bayoh is brought down. \nMike Franklin, former commissioner for the body which investigated police complaints in England and Wales, looked at Panorama's evidence. \nHe said: \"I think there's nothing more serious than a police officer who gives false information in an investigation where somebody has died. So without accusing them of lying, I simply say that there's a big conflict.\n\"Two officers who were there say that it did happen. The person to whom it happened didn't mention it. And an eyewitness says it didn't happen.\n\"I would've been reluctant to sign off the investigation as complete, without resolving those\u2026 conflicts of evidence.\"\nMr Bayoh's sister, Kadi Johnson, told Panorama the new allegations had made her \"really angry\". \nShe said the way her brother was \"painted\" by the accounts given after his death was not who he was.\nA spokesman for the Scottish Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, said serving officers were unable to comment on matters \"to which they may be called upon to give sworn evidence\" but that they had \"co-operated fully and truthfully with the investigations that have taken place\".\nIt added it had seen \"compelling material that Mr Bayoh did violently stamp on the back of a policewoman as she lay unconscious\".\nThe BBC asked for this material to be produced but was told the inquiry was the \"proper forum\" for such matters. \nThe Crown Office, which directed the Pirc Inquiry, told Panorama it had examined \"eye-witness accounts of police and civilian witnesses\" and instructed \"appropriate investigation\".\nIt said after careful consideration it was decided there should be no prosecutions but reserved the right to prosecute should evidence become available.\nPirc told Panorama its investigation was \"detailed and extensive\" but could not comment further because of the public inquiry. \nPolice Scotland Chief Constable Iain Livingstone expressed his condolences to the Bayoh family and said the force would \"participate fully\" in the inquiry.\nPanorama's \"I Can't Breathe: Black and Dead in Custody\" also investigates the case of Kevin Clarke, 35, who died in 2018 after being restrained in London by up to nine officers. \nAn inquest into his death resulted in a damning verdict on the police and ambulance services. \nMr Clarke's sister Tellecia told the programme that if the officers \"hadn't used excessive force he would still be here today\u2026 treat him like a human being, and not just see him as a big scary black man\".\nMetropolitan Police Commander Bas Javid apologised to Mr Clarke's family and accepted the restraint had not been appropriate. \nPanorama: I Can't breathe: Black and Dead in Custody on BBC One on Monday 18 January at 19:35."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "About one in 10 people across the UK tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies in December, roughly double the October figure, data has shown.\nEstimates from the Office for National Statistics suggest between 8% of people in Northern Ireland and 12% of people in England showed signs of past Covid infection. \nIn October, antibody positivity ranged from 2% to 7% around the UK.\nAnd 6,586 Covid deaths were registered in the UK in the week to 8 January.\nThat brings the total registered so far close to 96,000.\nNearly a quarter of deaths were people living in care homes - a disproportionate impact on a group of people which accounts for less than 1% of the population.\nBack in July, though, care home residents accounted for 40% of deaths. \nThe ONS regularly tests a representative sample of the population, both for current infection and for antibodies indicating a past infection.\nPeople taking part in the survey are tested whether or not they have had symptoms.\nThis is used to estimate how common both the virus and antibodies are in the population as a whole.  \nAntibodies are proteins in the blood which fight off specific infections.\nThey are developed if somebody catches an infection and their body fights it off, or if they have been vaccinated.  \nYorkshire and the Humber topped the chart with 17% of people having positive antibodies, followed by London.\nProf Lawrence Young, a virologist at Warwick Medical School, said: \"This study shows that infection with the Sars-Cov-2 virus is much more widespread in the UK than previously realised, with around 1 in 10 people estimated to have been infected by December 2020. \n\"The implications are that infection rates increased significantly between November and December.\"\nBut Scotland had a considerably smaller growth in antibodies than the rest of the UK, rising from 7% to 9% of the population. \nIn December:\nThe fact that more people show signs of having at least some protection against Covid-19 is consistent with the dramatic rise in infections during that period. \nBut we know that antibodies from natural infection can fade.\nIn England, the ONS said, positive antibody tests equated to 5.4 million people aged over 16 having signs of past infection. \nThat does not tell you the total number of people infected, however, but acts as a snapshot in time.\nIn London, about 16% of people had antibodies in December, up from 11% in October. But at the last peak in May, an estimated 15% of the population had antibodies. This proportion fell, as detectable antibodies recede with time. \nExactly what this means for someone's likelihood to become infected again, however, is not fully known. \nIt also remains to be seen how long vaccines will protect people for, before they need a booster jab. \nBut Public Health England data suggests natural immunity provides at least five months' protection on average, and vaccines often give better protection than natural immunity.\nMore than 4 million people in the UK have been given their first dose of the vaccine. \nProf Janet Lord, director of the Institute of Inflammation and Ageing at the University of Birmingham, urged caution among those who have already been vaccinated.\nAsked whether people who have received the jab can hug their children, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I would certainly advise not to do that at the moment because, as you probably know, with the vaccines they take several weeks before they are maximally effective.\n\"It's really important that people stay on their guard even if they've had that first vaccination.\" "

      "tags": "Medical research,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "Coronavirus is a completely new infection in people. \nNobody had immunity at the start of the pandemic - and knowing more about immunity is crucial for understanding what happens next.\nOur immune system is the body's defence against infection and it comes in two parts.\nThe first is always ready to go and leaps into action as soon as any foreign invader is detected in the body. It is known as the innate immune response and includes the release of chemicals that cause inflammation and white blood cells that can destroy infected cells. \nBut this system is not specific to coronavirus. It will not learn and it will not give you immunity to the coronavirus. \nInstead you need the adaptive immune response. This includes cells that produce targeted antibodies that can stick to the virus in order to stop it - and T cells that can attack just the cells infected with the virus, called the cellular response. \nThis takes time - studies suggest it takes about 10 days to start making antibodies that can target the coronavirus and the sickest patients develop the strongest immune response. \nIf the adaptive immune response is powerful enough, it could leave a lasting memory of the infection that will give protection in the future. \nIt's not known if people who have only mild symptoms, or none at all, will develop a sufficient adaptive immune response.\nUnderstanding of the role of T-cells is still developing, but a recent study found people testing negative for coronavirus antibodies may still have some immunity.\nFor every person testing positive for antibodies, it was found two had T-cells which identify and destroy infected cells.\n\"They look rather durable and are being made in almost all exposed people,\" said Prof Danny Altmann from Imperial College London.\nThe immune system's memory is rather like our own - it remembers some infections clearly, but has a habit of forgetting others. \nMeasles is highly memorable - one bout should give lifelong immunity (as the weakened version in the MMR vaccine does). However, there are many others that are pretty forgettable. Children can get RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) multiple times in the same winter.\nThe new coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, has not been around long enough to know how long immunity lasts.\nBut a recent study led by Public Health England (PHE) shows most people who have had the virus are protected from catching it again for at least five months (the duration of the analysis so far). \nSome are reinfected, however, and, even if asymptomatic, can then harbour high levels of the virus in their noses and mouths, which can be passed on to others. \nPHE will continue to monitor the people in this study, who are all healthcare workers, to see how long immunity lasts. \nOther clues may come from studies involving other coronaviruses. \nFour produce the symptoms of the common cold and immunity is short-lived. Studies showed some patients could be re-infected within a year.\nResearch at King's College London also suggested levels of antibodies that kill coronavirus waned over the three month study.\nBut even if antibodies disappear, then the cells that manufacture them, called B cells, may still be around. B cells for Spanish Flu have been found in people 90 years after that pandemic.\nIf the same is true with Covid, then a second infection would be milder than the first. \nIt is also not understood what happens to T cells in the long term. But T cells against the original Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) have been found 17 years later.\nMaybe.\nThe jury is still out on the field of \"cross-reactivity\" but there may be some infections that look similar enough to the virus that causes Covid that people may gain some protection.\nLaboratory tests show the T cells some people made to fight Sars or common cold coronaviruses can also react against the new coronavirus. \nHow common this is and how much protection it gives is still unknown.\nThere were early reports of people appearing to have multiple coronavirus infections in a short space of time. \nBut the scientific consensus is that testing was the issue, with patients being incorrectly told they were free of the virus. \nPHE's ongoing study on immunity in healthcare workers found 44 potential re-infections in a group of 6,614 people who had previously had the virus. \nResearchers conclude reinfection is uncommon but still possible and say people must continue to follow current guidance, whether they have had antibodies or not. \nScientists from Hong Kong recently reported on the case of a young, healthy man who recovered from a bout of Covid-19 only to be re-infected more than four months later. Using genome sequencing of the virus, they could prove he caught it twice because the virus strains were different.\nExperts say re-infection isn't surprising, but it's likely to be rare, and larger studies are needed to understand why this might happen.\nThis is not guaranteed and that is why the World Health Organization is nervous about countries using immunity passports as a way out of lockdown.\nThe idea is if you pass the antibody test then you are safe to go back to work. This would be particularly valuable for staff in care homes or hospitals who come into contact with those at risk of developing severe symptoms. \nBut while you will find some antibodies in nearly every patient, not all are equal. Neutralising antibodies are the ones that stick to the coronavirus and are able to stop it infecting other cells. A study of 175 recovered patients in China showed 30% had very low levels of these neutralising antibodies. \nThat is why the World Health Organization says \"that cellular immunity [the other part of the adaptive response] may also be critical for recovery\".\nAnother issue is that just because you might be protected by your antibodies, it doesn't mean you cannot still harbour the virus and pass it onto others. \nEveryone's immune system is unique - some may mount more successful defensive responses than others.\nAnd people must continue to follow the current guidance as some may become reinfected and pass the virus on to others, PHE says.\nPeople who have already had Covid-19 should still have a vaccine when offered one, officials say. \nDr Julian Tang, at the University of Leicester, says:\"Having the vaccine after recovering from Covid-19 is not an issue... and will likely boost the natural immunity.\n\"We also see this with the seasonal flu vaccine.\"\nPHE scientists will also monitor the immunity of the participants in its Siren study who go on to have vaccines. \nIt matters for obvious personal health reasons and whether you will get Covid-19 multiple times and how often.\nImmunity will also affect how deadly the virus is. If people retain some, even imperfect, protection then it will make the disease less dangerous.\nUnderstanding immunity better could help ease lockdown if it is clear who is not at risk of catching or spreading the virus.\nIf it is very difficult to produce long-term immunity, then it could make a vaccine harder to develop. Or it may change how the vaccine needs to be used - will it be a once a lifetime or once a year like the flu shot.\nAnd the duration of immunity, whether by infection or immunisation, will tell us how likely we are to be able to stop the virus spreading. \nThese are all big questions we still lack answers to.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Swansea Bay University Health Board,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic,Vaughan Gething",
      "text": "Wales' health minister has insisted there is an \"increasing urgency and an increasing pace of delivery\" of vaccinations in the country.\nVaughan Gething told BBC 5 live the first minister had \"clarified\" remarks made on Monday that there was no point rushing to use all available vaccines.\nFormer Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb had said Mark Drakeford's comments were \"astonishing\".\nMr Gething said on Tuesday the vaccine was not being withheld.\nHe said the challenge was \"having enough infrastructure to deliver the Pfizer jab without wasting it\".\n\"Less than 1% of that vaccine is not being delivered, that's a very, very high level of efficiency,\" Mr Gething said.\n\"So we're able to roll out the vaccine in a way that we can deliver more and more of it. This week, we'll deliver even more of our Pfizer vaccine than last week.\"\nHe told BBC Radio Wales \"big progress\" was being made in delivering the vaccine and the NHS \"won't let people down\". \nOn Tuesday, Public Health Wales said 161,932 people had received their first vaccine, up 10,195 from the previous day's figures.\nThis is around 5.1% of the Welsh population, roughly the same rate for first doses as the vaccinations in Scotland.\nBoth are still behind England (6.5%) and Northern Ireland (7%)\nMr Gething said he could understand why \"an unsettling effect\" may have resulted from the way Mr Drakeford's interview \"was presented\". \n\"We are going as fast as possible,\" he said. \nSome swabs used in sampling for Covid-19 have been taken out of circulation after concerns they may have led to false positive test results.\nNHS Wales Shared Services Partnership is investigating its supply chain to establish how many of the swabs have been distributed and how many are still in stores, the Welsh Government said.\nIn a statement issued on Tuesday evening, Mr Gething said the swabs were used to sample for Covid-19 in hospital settings, at health board-run community testing units and some mobile testing units. \n\"As soon as this problem was discovered, all microbiology labs and testing centres in Wales were notified so that the affected swabs could be taken out of circulation,\" he said.\nMr Gething said the issue was identified on Friday by Public Health Wales (PHW) laboratory staff.\n\"The issue detected may have affected the accuracy of a small proportion of test results leading to false positives,\" he said. \n\"However, based on what we currently know, Public Health Wales is confident that this does not affect the overall epidemiological picture.\"\nHe said NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership was working with PHW, health boards, the manufacturer of the swabs COPAN and the UK supplier/distributor Thermo Fisher Scientific to \"identify and isolate the swabs potentially affected to prevent their ongoing use\".\nHe said the swabs have been isolated as a \"precaution while further investigations are undertaken\".\n\"More and more people are being protected - we are at the point where by the end of this week seven in 10 care home residents and staff should be protected, seven in 10 over-80s in Wales should be protected with their first shot.\n\"We're making really big progress with protecting our staff with their first vaccine. We're doing a really good job at increasing the pace. This is a race against the virus and to recover as much as possible of normal life.\" \nThe NHS \"won't let people down\", he said.\nMr Gething told the Senedd on Tuesday afternoon that more than \"60,000 Pfizer jabs have been released this week to NHS Wales to make sure they're put into people's arms\".\nConservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies was \"sadly\" not reassured by the health minister. \nHe said Mr Gething was trying to clear up the \"mess\" made by the first minister. \n\"In some respects the first minister didn't make a mess,\" he said. \n\"He spoke honestly about what Welsh Government policy is at the moment.\"\nMr Davies said he did not accept Mr Gething's defence that things were being done as quickly as they could.\nWith \"whole swathes of the economy shut down\", the vaccine was \"no good in the bottle\", he said.  \n\"It surely is a sprint and it is a sprint to get this vaccine out as quickly as possible to offer people protection against the virus,\" Mr Davies added.\nHe said \"we all want to see success\".\nPlaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said confidence in the system was \"very important\".\n\"We have this very confusing couple of days where the first minister says categorically they are holding the vaccine back and then, in a few hours, no, we are not holding the vaccine back. \n\"That kind of lack of clarity breeds confusion.\" \nVaccine needed to be delivered \"as quickly as possible,\" he added.\nGiven the criticism that the vaccination effort in Wales has been slow off the blocks, it would be a disaster if the Welsh Government ended up missing its official milestone of vaccinating the top four priority groups - including the over 70s - by about Valentine's Day in mid-February.\nBut if the effort continues at the speed it is now, that target won't be reached until mid-March.\nWe have estimated that to reach that target, way more than 20,000 first doses need to be given a day - almost double the current rate.\nIt would be even more than that if the Welsh Government wants to build in some wriggle room to accommodate any potential disruption in supply. \nBut the health minister insists Wales is on track to meet that commitment and the programme will quickly speed up.\nIn an effort to demonstrate what's achievable, Vaughan Gething said he was confident that  70% of over-80s and 70% of care home residents and staff will have been given their first jab by the end of the weekend. \nDuring a period of intense scrutiny by the public and his political rivals, this is a pledge that simply has to be delivered. \nDaniel Altman, a professor of immunology at Imperial College, London, said the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was \"unique\" because it had to be stored at -70C.\n\"These things are challenging but they're not insurmountable,\" he said.\n\"I watch what's happening in Wales with great interest to see if the numbers really can be caught up. That's the way to beat this and get transmission down.\"\nBronwen Rashad, of the Wye Valley, Monmouthshire, said her 78 and 81-year-old parents had not yet received vaccine appointments.\n\"The Welsh Government have done brilliantly with everything else, I don't why with the vaccine it has gone wrong,\" she said.\nShe said the situation was causing \"a lot of anxiety.\"\n\"My dad is really quite stressed about it,\" she said. \n\"Friends who have parents of a similar age in England have got their vaccine.\"\nDr Rebecca Towner, a GP at Whitchurch Road Surgery in Cardiff, said staff were \"really excited to be able to deliver\" the vaccine, with the first clinic held last Friday at the nearby All Nations Church.\n\"We managed to do the over 90s, which went really well,\" she said.\n\"We have only got a limited number of vaccines initially. We are hoping the supply will increase.\"\nShe said some patients were \"really anxious to get their vaccine as soon as possible\". \n\"We are having to be fair across the whole of Cardiff. There are 10 huge practices over the north of Cardiff that are part of the cluster we are in. \n\"We are trying to make sure there isn't any sort of postcode lottery, and that no demographic group is being disadvantaged in any way.\" \nDr Keith Reid, executive director of public health at Swansea Bay University Health Board, said the rate of vaccinations was increasing in the area.\n\"The rate-limiting step at the moment is the flow of vaccine,\" he said.\n\"We are working with pharmaceutical colleagues in Welsh Government to understand how vaccine will be coming down the line towards us so that we can prioritise our clinics against that, and make sure we have people coming in when we have vaccine.\""

      "tags": "Ministry of Justice,Criminal justice system",
      "text": "When Louise Westra and her partner decided to adopt a child in November 2018, they were aware of the long process that was ahead of them, but they were not to know that the coronavirus pandemic would hold them back from completing the adoption of their son. \nOn 27 March, their petition was due in court. As lockdown had taken effect, telephone conferencing would be used instead of going to court.\nHowever, after the phone call, Ms Westra received an email from her solicitor explaining that the papers had not been served to the biological parents of the child. This continued every month after lockdown, as it wasn't possible for the papers to be physically served.\n\"It's farcical because one of them is the biological father who lives with the biological mother who has had her petition but the biological father hasn't and they live in the same premises,\" Ms Westra says.\nServing papers has to be completed by post via Royal Mail or in some cases lawyers would instruct a process server to physically take the papers and hand them to the person.\n\"It sounds very archaic but if [the person] won't take them by hand, the processor can drop the papers near them and tell them what the document contains and that's technically counted as full service,\" says Rebecca Ranson, a solicitor for Maguire Family Law.\nUnless a judge approves it, emailing or any other forms of digital communication are not considered valid - even though the majority of people in the UK have access to email and the internet. It is this kind of process, in need of a digital upgrade, that is frustrating for Ms Westra.\nMs Westra's case is one of many that have been delayed. The number of outstanding Crown court cases was 43,676 on 26 July, and the entire backlog across magistrates' and Crown courts is more than 560,000. The Commons Justice Committee has announced an inquiry into how these delays could be addressed. \nThe reality, however, is that there was already a huge backlog back in December, and Covid-19 has just exacerbated an existing problem. Cases like Ms Westra's have been affected by the pandemic, but many lawyers believe that the legal system could have been better prepared through technology investment over the years. \n\"We've got people being held for longer than they otherwise would be, and for every person in custody waiting for trial or waiting on bail for trial, there are witnesses, and complainants and their families awaiting a resolution. Whether it's the lack of technology links in prison, using Skype and improvising or not having enough Nightingale courts - it all boils down to a lack of investment,\" says Joanna Hardy, a London-based barrister.\nMore Technology of Business\nIn 2016 HM Courts & Tribunals Service began a \u00a31bn court reform programme. This included a video-conferencing tool called the Cloud Video Platform (CVP), which allows for a dedicated private conference area, so criminal lawyers can speak to their clients without visiting prison.\nA programme for testing and adopting video technology was planned out until 2022, but in the pandemic, the government had to get CVP up and running in 10 weeks. This has since been extended to civil courts. But this implementation has been challenging, as there are only a restricted number of physical video links allowed.\n\"As we weren't ready for this huge technological revolution no-one had manned the tech rooms or built enough rooms on the other end in the prison. We can have as many laptops as we like, as much software as we like but if we can't put a prisoner into a room with a screen, the other end is pointless,\" Ms Hardy says.\nAccording to Ms Hardy, the waiting times to get these slots have been \"completely unacceptable\", and it has meant that sometimes hearings had to go ahead without the defendant present.\n\"It's like human beings failing where technology could have bridged the gap,\" she says. \nA Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that it had offered more than 400 CVP meeting rooms since the outbreak of coronavirus, but added that it is taking steps to increase the available capacity of video conferencing at some locations by extending operating hours. The spokesperson said that the MoJ is also undertaking urgent action to increase the physical number of video link outlets at critical sites. \nAt the moment, criminal trials are going ahead using social distancing - meaning sometimes a second courtroom is linked by technology, but this is creating further backlogs, as it means one case is occupying the same space as two.\nJustice, the all-party law reform and human rights organisation, has trialled a virtual jury trial with a mock case, and suggested it should be considered as a possible option, but this hasn't been taken on by the courts. \nThe issue with virtual jury trials is whether or not they could affect the outcome of a trial. Some lawyers feel like juries should see a witness, feel an exhibit and dispense justice to a fellow human being in the confines of a court room. \n\"You can lose the impact of cross examination. When you're challenging their evidence in person it's easier to get them to trip up if they're not being honest, whereas if they're on video it might be easier for them to cover it up,\" says Jodie Hill, solicitor and managing director of Thrive Law, an employment law specialist.\nFor smaller hearings, online alternatives could be here for the long term, as it means lawyers don't have to travel all over the UK unnecessarily. This doesn't mean that every hearing that can be done remotely, should be done remotely.\n\"We don't want overkill. We think some cases still need to be in the room, particularly if you're dealing with vulnerable people or sensitive cases. It has to be a balancing act of harnessing the benefits of technology and thinking about the specific case,\" says Ms Hardy."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "Scotland's Covid-19 lockdown has been extended until at least the middle of February, with most school pupils to continue learning from home.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs that transmission of the virus appeared to be declining but was still too high to ease restrictions.\nBut she hopes schools will be able to at least begin a phased return to the classroom in the middle of next month. \nThe level four restrictions have been in place since Boxing Day. \nMeanwhile the islands of Barra and Vatersay are being moved into the top level of restrictions due to a \"significant outbreak\" there.\nThe current restrictions, which have closed non-essential shops and seen a \"stay at home\" message put down in law, had been due to expire at the end of this month. \nBut Scottish government ministers agreed they should be extended after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning.\nMs Sturgeon told MSPs that lockdown was \"beginning to have an impact\" on the number of new infections, but said Scotland remained in a \"very precarious position\".\nShe added: \"We need to be realistic that any improvement we are seeing is down, at this stage, to the fact that we are staying at home and reducing our interactions.\n\"Any relaxation of lockdown while case numbers, even though they might be declining, nevertheless remain very high, could quickly send the situation into reverse.\"\nThe announcement came as 1,165 new cases of Covid-19 were registered in Scotland, representing 11.1% of tests carried out.\nA total of 1,989 people are in hospital with the virus while a further 71 deaths of people who recently tested positive have been logged.\nMs Sturgeon said there was \"real and severe\" pressure on health services, with around 30% more patients in hospital than at the peak of the first wave in April 2020, and that this was \"almost certain to rise for a further period yet\".\nSchool buildings and nurseries have been closed to most pupils since the start of term, with all but the children of some key workers and vulnerable pupils learning from home.\nNot only will schools remain closed to most pupils until at least mid-February, they are unlikely to return to normal at that point.\nThe first minister has indicated that her aim is to begin a phased return, if coronavirus allows. So what might that mean?\nThe groups that will get back into class first are likely to include secondary school exam year pupils, the youngest primary school children and those in P7 getting ready to move to high school.\nFor others, online learning is likely to last a bit longer.\nBoth the return to school and the continuation of the wider lockdown will be reviewed again in a fortnight on 2 Feb. \nBy that week, first doses of vaccine should have been offered to all over 80s in Scotland as well as frontline NHS and social care staff and care home residents.\nWith only 15-20% of the over 80s reached so far, opposition parties think the programme is slipping behind schedule, which the first minister denies.\nMs Sturgeon said she knew how \"challenging and stressful\" home schooling was for families, but said community transmission was \"too high\" to allow a safe return to classrooms.\nShe said: \"If it is at all possible, as I very much hope it will be, to begin even a phased return to in-school learning in mid-February, we will.\n\"But I also have to be straight with families and say that it is simply too early to be sure about whether and to what extent this will be possible.\"\nStatistics released on Monday showed that Scotland had vaccinated 6% of its adult population so far - the same percentage as Wales, but lower than the 8% that have been vaccinated in England and 8.7% in Northern Ireland. \nEngland has also given a second dose of the vaccine to 427,386 people, compared to only 3,698 in Scotland.\nMs Sturgeon said approximately 100,000 people were being vaccinated per week in Scotland, and that health teams were \"on track\" to expand this to 400,000 per week by the end of February.\nMore than 90% of care home residents have now been given a first dose, along with 70% of care home staff and 70% of all frontline health and care workers.\nThe first minister said the focus on care homes - where it is \"time consuming and labour intensive\" to give out jabs -  was \"why overall figures are at this stage lower than in England\", where more over-80s have received the vaccine.\nShe said the \"pace of progress in the over-80s group is also now picking up\", and that the government remained on track to hit its target of completing everyone on the priority list by early May.\nScottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said the Scottish government were \"lagging behind their own targets\" on vaccination, saying the focus on care homes \"doesn't explain how slowly the vaccine is reaching GP surgeries and the public\".\nShe read out a series of letters from elderly people who had not been contacted about getting a jab, saying they were \"anxious they don't get left behind\".\nMs Sturgeon said she would not apologise for \"prioritising the most vulnerable first\", saying all four UK nations were \"working to the same targets\".\nScottish Labour's interim leader Jackie Baillie asked if Ms Sturgeon was confident the government could hit its \"critical\" targets, saying GPs were still complaining about \"patchy\" distribution of vaccines.\nThe first minister replied that her government would hit its goals, saying it was \"always the intention\" to increase the pace of vaccination as infrastructure and supplies became available.\nThis would see care home residents, healthcare staff and all over-80s get a first dose by the start of February, with over-70s and those deemed \"extremely vulnerable\" by mid-February and all over-65s by the beginning of March."

and that's a serious pressure that comes on our system,\" he told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.\n\"We can go up into nearly 200 ICU capacity but that comes at a stretch, that comes with putting our staff under severe pressure in ICU units.\n\"It also comes by having to shift the ICU specialist nurse from a ratio of one-to-one to a ratio of one-to-two or even one-to-three in extreme pressures. \n\"That's not something we want to do,\" he added.\nThe past week saw hospitals across Northern Ireland coming together in order to cope with the strain.\nOn 10 January, the Southern Health Trust was on the cusp of declaring a major incident amid the mounting pressures across the health service.\nThat was avoided as many off-duty staff answered a call to come into work and the health trusts pulled together to provide a regional response to the crisis.\nPatients were diverted to those hospitals which could take them and where infrastructure could cope with supplying additional oxygen to the very ill.\nOver the weekend of 9/10 January the Southern Health Trust - the smallest of the health trusts - was dealing with the highest number of patients who required oxygen.\nIn the past week the Northern and Southern Health Trusts have seen the highest number of patients.\nThat reflects the high rate of community transmission in some areas those trusts cover.\nMeanwhile, no resolution has been reached between Stormont leaders and the Irish Government over the sharing of passenger data.\nLast week, First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill criticised Dublin for failing to share information on travellers arriving there during the pandemic.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said repeated efforts to access data on passenger locator forms filled out by people arriving in the Republic of Ireland had failed.\nMrs Foster and Ms O'Neill indicated on Thursday that they planned to raise the matter directly with Taoiseach (Irish prime minsiter) Miche\u00e1l Martin.\nMs O'Neill told the Northern Ireland Assembly on Monday that no resolution has been found yet.\nShe told MLAs the issue had been raised \"on every occasion we have had the opportunity\" and that it was \"regrettable\" that the issue had not been resolved. \nThe travel issue will be discussed at a meeting on Wednesday involving the first minister, the deputy first minister, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney and NI Secretary of State Brandon Lewis.\n\"I hope that perhaps Wednesday's meeting will allow some opportunity for there to be a way forward,\" the deputy first minister added.\nIt was announced on Sunday that all travellers who have returned from Portugal or transited through 16 South American countries in the past 14 days will have to - along with their household - self-isolate for 10 days upon return to Northern Ireland. \nThis includes travellers who entered these countries en route to another destination. All travellers returning home from South America are advised to be tested, whether or not they have symptoms. \nFrom Thursday, all international travellers will be required to present a negative Covid-19 test result before arriving in Northern Ireland.\nThis rule comes into effect in England, Scotland and Wales on Monday.\nOn Monday, the Department of Health in the Republic of Ireland reported eight more coronavirus-related deaths.\nIt brings its death toll to 2,616.\nThe department said 2,121 new cases of the virus had been reported, with a cumulative total of 174,843 infections.\nIt said that as of 14:00 local time on Monday, 1,975 Covid-19 patients are in hospital, of which 200 are in ICU (intensive care units).\nIrish Chief Medical Officer, Dr Tony Holohan, said: \"This third wave of the pandemic has seen higher level of hospitalisations across all age groups. \n\"There are now more sick people in hospital than any time in the course of this pandemic\"."

The government needs to urgently legislate to protect the viability of cash - as it promised to do so last year. Time is running out.\"\nWhich? said the lack of cash access was a problem for those who relied on notes and coins - such as people with certain health conditions or without computer access.\nJenny Ross, Which? Money editor, said: \"We have repeatedly warned about the consequences that coronavirus will have on what was an already fragile cash system, but nowhere near enough action has been taken by the government or the regulator to understand the scale of this issue.\"\nThe Treasury has proposed giving the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, control of overseeing future access to cash and has thrown its weight behind the idea of cashback in shops, without the requirement to buy anything.\nDavid Fagleman, director at financial consultancy Enryo, said: \"Our own research shows that despite a decline in use for day-to-day purchases, nearly three-quarters of people think the move to a cashless society is happening too fast and risks leaving some people, particularly the vulnerable, behind.\""

These cases are being pushed back continuously.  \n\"Lack of investment is at the heart of it and government needs to understand that you don't create a proper justice system without proper investment.  \n\"What we are seeing here are the fruits of a lack of interest.\"\nThat apparent \"lack of interest\" is reflected in the state of some court buildings. Outside Inner London I saw a dead pigeon decaying on netting, vast weeds growing up the side of the building and old pipes leaking water.  \nMeanwhile, a court official told me that some court centres are now listing trials for 2023. \nThe delays are caused by a range of factors.  \nLawyers point to huge cuts to the police, CPS and other agencies such as probation. \nThere are a range of things malfunctioning within the system. They include long initial delays caused by police \"releasing suspects under investigation\" - sometimes for years - before a charging decision is made.  \nSystemic problems continue with the CPS serving evidence late on the defence, meaning lawyers cannot advise their clients in a timely manner.  \nAnd perhaps most significantly - the decisions by government to cut thousands of crown court sitting days. That has meant that courts have been mothballed while trials stack up in a growing backlog. \nNone of these problems are caused by the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown, but they are of course exacerbated by it. Pre-lockdown the crown court backlog in England and Wales stood at some 37,000. \nIt is now over 46,000.\n\"Adam\" - not his real name - was accused of rape in March 2018. He denies the charge. His trial has been put back twice, once because of the pandemic. \nHe is now on a \"warned\" list for November, while his chosen career in one of the public services is on hold. \n\"I have suffered really bad with my mental health through it,\" he says. \"I've had to up my dosage of anti-depressants. It's affected my potential career.  \n\"The hard work I have done at university and everything to get me there it's all basically going out of the window now. I haven't got any trust or hope that it will be anywhere near the end of this year. \n\"I think it will be more like April next year.\"\nThe next case I saw involved two young men charged with possession of drugs with intent to supply.  The alleged offence took place in December 2017.  \nNo one in court could explain the delay.\nIt was followed by a case in which the judge needed a pre-sentence report from the probation service in order to sentence the defendant. Despite repeated requests, no one was available.  \nIn order to achieve a conclusion of the case, the judge had to devise a sentence which did not require a report.  It was not ideal, but it showed professionals trying to do their best in the face of a lack of resources.\nEmma Fenn, a barrister specialising in criminal work, paints a bleak picture. \n\"Defendants are suspended from their jobs with trial dates one to two years away. Some are losing university places with dates from the alleged offence to trial of four years. \n\"And some who are awaiting trial for 18-24 months on bail, can be on electronic tagged curfew from 7-7 every day, for up to two years.\"\nTo help deal with the situation, the government has announced that the period of time an accused person can be held before a trial - known as the Custody Time Limit (CTL) - will be increased from six to eight months. \nBut the government admitted - in response to a Freedom of Information request from the group Fair Trials - that it did not know how many people had been held in prison beyond the time limit since lockdown.  \nLawyers fear some accused will spend more time in custody awaiting trial than the sentence they would eventually receive if they pleaded guilty - and that some might falsely plead guilty simply to bring an end to their case.\nLife is bleak for those in custody awaiting trial, says Ms Fenn, \n\"There are often no visits from family or in-person visits from lawyers. Defendants can be locked up for 23.5 hours a day, education classes and courses are suspended, jobs within the prison restricted, and there are reports of showers being limited to 1-2 a week.\"\nCovid has also removed a \"huge amount of mental health, drug and alcohol agency support\", she says.\nA Ministry of Justice spokesperson said justice had been kept moving \"despite the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic\" and overall, cases are falling.\nHowever, they acknowledged that \"more needs to be done\". \nThe government has launched an \u00a380 million Criminal Courts Recovery plan which includes:\nHowever, only three of the new Nightingale Courts are dealing with crime. \nI visited one, Prospero House, a short walk from Inner London. It is a state of the art commercial building with three large courtrooms allowing ample room for social distancing.  Every desk has hand sanitiser and protective gloves. \nBut Mr Mulholland says: \"We need 60 criminal Nightingale Court buildings. At the moment we have just three.\"\nThe CBA says there are around 460 crown courtrooms in England and Wales. Currently around 100 are able to hear trials, though not all are hosting them.  \nThe government says its plan will bring on stream another 250 of the existing rooms to hear jury trials by the end of October. The CBA believes that simply will not cut into the backlog. \nLawyers believe that the Treasury has long seen justice as a poor relation to health and education in terms of public spending.  \n\"Investing in the criminal justice system is investing in the wealth and prosperity of the country,\" says Mr Mulholland.\n\"It is an empty and insulting promise for any minister to declare a war on crime if a government can't fund a system that keeps us safe - and ensures crimes are swiftly investigated and cases come to court on time.\""

      "tags": "Self-isolation,Coronavirus pandemic,Australia",
      "text": "Two more Australian Open tennis players have tested positive for Covid-19 after arriving in Melbourne, state health officials said on Tuesday.\nIt comes after a player was believed to have tested positive on Sunday, amid growing controversy over the event.\nOne more \"non-playing participant\" also has Covid, bringing the overall total linked to the Open to seven, including a flight attendant.\nSome 1,200 people have flown in for the tournament, which begins on 8 February.\nVictorian Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said in a statement that the latest three positive tests of two players and a non-participant were of a woman in her 20s and two men in their 30s, all of whom were in hotel quarantine.\nBut there was confusion when Tennis Australia disputed the latest announcement. Chief executive Craig Tiley said no players had tested positive at all - only those in their entourages. He said no players were in the medi-hotel, to which people are transferred if they test positive while in hotel quarantine.\nRows over quarantine rules have cast a shadow over the upcoming event.\nSome players have expressed frustration about being confined to hotel rooms full-time while other rivals are not. \nAnd some residents in Melbourne - a city which endured one of the world's longest lockdowns last year - have their own concerns about the potential Covid risk posed by the tournament. \nPositive cases on three flights have forced 72 players into full quarantine, meaning they have to isolate full-time in their hotel rooms for 14 days instead of being allowed outside to train like other participants.\nMr Tiley insisted players had been made aware of the quarantine possibilities beforehand and said that some may have not taken it seriously and \"brushed it off\".\nBut he acknowledged it was \"not an even playing field\" for those stuck in their hotel rooms, given their competitors have access to five hours of court practice a day.\nThe majority of some 500 players attending the Open have accepted the conditions, organisers say.\nLabor MP Bill Shorten told players to \"get a grip\", adding: \"People have died. People lost their jobs... and you got these pampered sooks who are having a cry over their conditions.\"\nWorld number one Novak Djokovic lobbied authorities to relax quarantine rules for players - including making the periods shorter.\nThe suggestions earned him criticism from Australian player Nick Kyrgios, who tweeted: \"Djokovic is a tool.\"\nLast year Djokovic organised an exhibition event in which he and others contracted the virus, drawing the disdain of Kyrgios at the time.\nKyrgios also criticised the girlfriend of fellow Australian player Bernard Tomic after she featured in a news clip complaining about hotel food and having to wash her hair by herself.\nVanessa Sierra has since said her comments were taken out of context and that she had received death threats, after her \"I don't wash my own hair\" quote was mocked online.\nWhile most players are being quarantined in Melbourne, Djokovic is part of a smaller group of big-name stars including Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka who are stationed in Adelaide for an exhibition match.\nTwo-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka issued a plea to fellow players to show \"co-operation, understanding and empathy for the local community that has been going through a lot of very demanding restrictions\".\nBut Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut said that quarantine felt like prison.\n\"These people have no idea about tennis, about practice courts, about anything. It's a complete disaster... The control of everything is not Tennis Australia, it's the people from the government... I can't imagine staying two weeks like this.\"\nHe later apologised for his words, which he said were taken out of context, adding that Australia's efforts to combat Covid were \"admirable\"."

      "text": "When Amelia Strike, 21, was logged out of her Depop social shopping app account in October, nothing seemed out of the ordinary.\n\"I thought I had just forgotten my password when I couldn't get back in, but a couple of days passed and I realised something wasn't right,\" says the Birmingham-based law student. \nShe then received a message from a stranger on Instagram, alerting her to the fact that her account had been taken over by a scammer advertising Apple AirPod headphones for \u00a350.\nShe immediately used her brother's Depop account to comment on the offending post and contact the app. It was removed by the firm in a few hours and her password was reset.\nBut when Ms Strike logged back in, she was shocked by what she found.\n\"I felt sick - I scrolled and scrolled through hundreds of messages people had sent the scammer,\" she says.\nThe fraudster had been instructing shoppers to pay them directly through PayPal's \"Friends and Family\" option, which sidesteps Depop's fees and doesn't offer any protection for buyers.\nMs Strike counted at least three Depop users who made unauthorised payments of \u00a350 to the scammer.\nIn Ms Strike's situation, to get users to trust scam listing, the hacker had also uploaded a photo of her name on a post-it note next to the headphones that were supposedly for sale.\nThis is a common tactic used by people selling second-hand items online, to prove that the photos were not stolen from another listing.\n\"I just felt so violated,\" she says. \nShe is not alone - 14 other users have told BBC News that their Depop accounts have been hacked in recent months. In all cases, the fraudsters demanded to be paid directly, rather than through the app.\nBlending the look and social elements of Instagram with the buy-and-sell format of eBay, 90% of Depop's users are aged 26 or under.\nEmily Goold, 21, a journalism student in Tewkesbury, was scared when her account was hacked and a fraudster posted a listing for a \u00a3350 jacket. \nDepop took the listing down within 12 hours and reset her password, but Ms Goold says such incidents are becoming commonplace.\n\"You always know somebody who's had a Depop horror story. It's such a widespread problem now.\" \nScammers have continued to plague many online services through the pandemic.  \nOne \"have a go\" method called \"credential stuffing\" involves using automated tools to repeatedly log into accounts, entering usernames and password information previously exposed from data breaches of other popular online services.\nIf a user doesn't use the same password on multiple services or has changed their passwords after being exposed in a data breach, this won't work. \nAccording to Liv Rowley, a threat intelligence analyst at cyber-security firm Blueliv, cyber criminals are now targeting Depop accounts on an \"industrial scale\" using this method, capitalising on the fact that people often use similar passwords.\nDepop told the BBC that the safety and security of its community is its \"number one priority\", and that the service has never had a data breach or had its infrastructure compromised. \nThe firm confirmed that credential stuffing is a big part of the problem. \n\"Weak passwords and the use of the same password across multiple accounts is the greatest source of account takeover, which is why we have initiated a campaign in the second half of 2020 to force some users to strengthen their passwords and to remind others of the importance of strong and unique passwords,\" says Depop's chief operating officer Dominic Rose.\nDepop has started resetting passwords for some 12 million users that have not changed them in over a year and told the BBC it had sent reminders to a similar number to make sure their log-in details are unique.\n\"We will continue to remind our community about the importance of account security and updating their passwords.\"\nThe firm, founded in 2011, told the BBC that although the number of its users increased nearly two-fold to 26 million last year, it had seen a 50% decrease in account \"takeovers\" since its campaign began.\nBut Blueliv found that login details for several thousand hacked Depop accounts are being advertised for as little as $1.05 (77p) each on the dark web - a part of the internet that is only accessible using specialised tools.\nWhile a Vice investigation first highlighted the problem in May, there is now evidence that account logins are being sold across multiple dark web \"marketplaces\".\nThe information for sale includes usernames and passwords, with extra charged for details such as follower count, the number of sales completed by a user and their ratings by other shoppers.\n\"The accounts are being compromised and that definitely is concerning,\" Ms Rowley says. \"While it's not a Depop-specific problem, I think [credential stuffing] is one we're going to see expand in the next five years.\"\nOne Depop user told the BBC they would feel \"much more comfortable\" if the app introduced two-factor authentication, where users enter a one-time code sent to them via email or text, for example, after attempting to sign in.\nDepop confirmed that it intends to implement multi-factor authentication in 2021.\nBut Aman Johal, director at law firm Your Lawyers, which specialises in consumer action claims, says the platform needs to act urgently, \"particularly given its relatively young user base, where the duty of care is greater\".\n\"The fact that this has been going on for months...is unacceptable. Given the volume of compromised accounts for sale, the horse has already bolted,\" he added.\nFor some users, trust in the company has been dented.\n\"I feel like their security measures need to be amped up because it's just not good enough,\" says Ms Strike, who has been a Depop user since 2015.\n\"I've used [Depop] for a long time but I'm reluctant to continue because it just doesn't feel safe anymore.\""

      "text": "Theresa May has accused her successor Boris Johnson of \"abandoning\" the UK's moral leadership on the world stage.\nThe ex-prime minister said Mr Johnson's decision to cut the overseas aid budget below 0.7% of national income had reduced the UK's global \"credibility\".\nShe wrote in the Daily Mail the UK had to \"live up to its values\" and would be judged by its actions not its rhetoric.\nMr Johnson said the UK was \"embarking on a quite phenomenal year\" of global leadership.\nQuestioned about Mrs May's comments by the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: \"I think it's very important the prime minister of the UK has the best possible relationship with the president of the United States.\n\"That's part of the job description.\"\nHe cited the UK's hosting of a global vaccine summit, the upcoming COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, as well as the G7 summit of leading industrial nations, in Cornwall, and his pledge to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 as examples of the UK's global leadership. \nMr Blackford called on the PM to reverse \"his cruel policy of cutting international aid for the world's poorest\".\nLater on Wednesday, Joe Biden will be inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States, succeeding Donald Trump.\nIn advance of the event, Mr Johnson  said he looked forward to working \"hand-in-hand\" with the new administration and that post-Covid challenges could only be tackled by \"international co-operation\".\nBut, in an article in the Daily Mail, Mrs May suggested Mr Johnson had squandered international goodwill by choosing not to meet the longstanding UN target of spending 0.7% of income on international development.\nThe government says it cannot meet the figure - enshrined in UK law - this year because of the strain placed on the public finances by the pandemic.\nTheresa May has made these criticisms - on overseas aid and the threat by the government to override international law - before.\nQuite often she gets a dig in when she stands up in the House of Commons.\nBut packaging it all up in this way, on this day, is, in the words of one of her close former advisers, \"quite punchy\".\nThe government would rather focus on the relationship it is going to forge with the new US president.  \nMinisters feel they have quite a lot in common with Joe Biden when it comes to working together on the world stage, fighting climate change and co-operating on global security.\nMrs May also criticised Mr Johnson's support for legislation which could have allowed the UK to go back on parts of its Withdrawal Agreement with the EU, had it been passed.\nControversial clauses were ultimately removed from the Internal Market Bill in December, after the UK and EU reached an agreement.\nBut Mr Johnson's threat to break international law was criticised in Europe and the US - where Mr Biden warned it could imperil peace in Northern Ireland.\nMrs May said the UK was \"well placed to play a decisive role in shaping this more co-operative world but to lead we must live up to our values\".\n\"Other countries listen to what we say not simply because of who we are, but because of what we do. The world does not owe us a prominent place on its stage,\" she added.\n\"Whatever the rhetoric we deploy, it is our actions which count. So, we should do nothing which signals a retreat from our global commitments.\"\nMrs May, who had a sometimes strained relationship with Mr Trump, said Mr Biden's election presented the UK with a \"golden opportunity\" for Western democracies to reverse the trend towards \"absolutism\" - and a \"few strongmen facing off against each other\" - in global affairs.\nThe UK holds the presidency of the G7 this year and hosts the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.\nMr Johnson said he looked forward to welcoming Mr Biden to the UK at least twice in 2021.\n\"In our fight against Covid and across climate change, defence, security, and in promoting and defending democracy, our goals are the same and our nations will work hand-in-hand to achieve them,\" he added."

Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "The Capitol complex in Washington DC was briefly locked down after a security alert, two days before Joe Biden is inaugurated as US president.\nPolice say they acted out of an abundance of caution after witnesses reported smoke rising nearby. The fire was several blocks away.\nIt came amid preparations for a rehearsal for Mr Biden's inauguration. \nFive people died after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, which is home to the US Congress, on 6 January.\nThousands of National Guard reserve soldiers have been deployed at the Capitol and around central Washington DC. \nThere was no threat to the public, officials said after Monday's lockdown. Congress is currently in recess. \nSecurity is tight after the rioters overran the Capitol earlier this month.\nThe National Mall - the landscaped park around the complex - has been closed, along with many major roads. Fences have been put up around the White House. \nThe inauguration rehearsal scheduled for Monday has already been postponed once on security grounds. \nAll 50 US states and the District of Columbia (DC) are on alert for possible violent protests.\nThe FBI has warned of possible armed marches by pro-Trump supporters across state capitols.\nOnce he is sworn in, Mr Biden will issue executive orders to reverse President Trump's travel bans and re-join the Paris climate accord.\nThe president-elect is also expected to focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border, and to issue mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing.\nMr Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris will take the oath of office in front of the Capitol building, overlooking the National Mall. \nNormally a crowd of hundreds of thousands would be there to witness a significant moment in American national life. \nHowever, between the coronavirus pandemic and security concerns, the size of the crowd is being severely restricted this year. \nOnce sworn in, Mr Biden will give an inaugural address, setting the agenda for his term in office. \nThe ceremonies include a poetry reading, the Pledge of Allegiance and a benediction. Lady Gaga will sing the national anthem, and there will be a musical performance by Jennifer Lopez. \nOne prominent figure will be conspicuous by his absence: Mr Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration. \nOn Monday, outgoing First Lady Melania Trump released a farewell message asking Americans to \"lead by example\" in caring for others. \nNormally the first lady hands over to her successor by inviting her for a walk-through of the private quarters in the White House. \nHowever, Mrs Trump is set to defy tradition, snubbing the president-elect's wife, Jill Biden, CNN reports. \nTom Hanks will host an event on prime-time TV on the night of the 20th, with performances by Justin Timberlake and Bon Jovi. \nMr Biden's inauguration planning team has designated the day before the swearing-in as a nationwide memorial to lives lost through Covid-19.

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "tags": "Russia,Alexei Navalny",
      "text": "Russia's leading opposition figure has been arrested and detained for 30 days, after returning to Moscow for the first time since he was poisoned last year.\nAlexei Navalny said a court ruling held inside a police station was a mockery and called for street protests.\nDozens of his supporters gathered outside the Moscow police station where he was being held and shouted \"disgrace\" and \"Putin resign\".\nMr Navalny was held soon after his flight from Germany arrived on Sunday.\nRussian prosecutors say he violated the parole terms of a suspended sentence for embezzlement. He says the charges are politically motivated.\nLast August, Mr Navalny, 44, was almost killed in a nerve agent attack, which he blamed personally on Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nThe Kremlin denies involvement. The opposition politician's allegations have, however, been backed up by reports from investigative journalists.\nOn Sunday, big crowds gathered at Moscow's Vnukovo airport to greet Mr Navalny's flight from Berlin - but in a last-minute decision the authorities re-routed the plane to another airport in the capital.\nA makeshift courtroom was organised on Monday at a police station in Khimki, on the outskirts of Moscow, where Mr Navalny had spent the night.\nThe judge ordered Mr Navalny's detention until 15 February for violating his parole. He will have another hearing on 29 January to determine whether his suspended sentence of three-and-a-half years should be replaced with a jail term. \nMr Navalny said his treatment was beyond a \"mockery of justice\" and described the hearing as \"lawlessness of the highest grade\".\n\"Don't be afraid. Take to the streets, not for me, but for yourselves, for your future,\" he said in a video address (in Russian) from the police station.\nA crowd of about 200 Navalny supporters gathered outside the police station in freezing weather, demanding his immediate release.\nMr Navalny was later seen led away by police to one of Moscow's prisons.\nHis lawyer, Vadim Kobzev, said they would appeal against the \"illegal\" court decision, according to Russia's Interfax news agency.\nMeanwhile, more than 70 Navalny supporters and journalists were detained across Russia on Monday, according to the Monitoring group OVD-Info.\nThe US and European Union led calls for Mr Navalny to be freed, but stopped short of threatening any punitive action.\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Russian authorities were trying to silence their critics, while incoming national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the Kremlin's \"attacks on Mr Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard\".\nFrance, Italy, Germany and the president of the European Commission were also among those calling for his release. \nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described Mr Navalny's arrest as \"appalling\".\n\"Rather than persecuting Mr Navalny, Russia should explain how a chemical weapon came to be used on Russian soil,\" he said. \nAs Mr Navalny gradually recovered after emergency medical treatment in Germany, he said he intended to return to Russia. \nOn Sunday, he made good on that pledge, boarding a flight despite warnings he would face arrest on landing. \nThe plane was packed with journalists, including from the BBC. Shortly before landing, the pilot announced that for \"technical reasons\", the plane was being diverted from Vnukovo airport, where thousands of Navalny supporters had gathered, to Sheremetyevo airport, causing a stir among the passengers.\nA number of people were detained by riot police.\nLiza Shuvalova, BBC News\nThere had always been a feeling Flight DP936 from Berlin to Moscow with Alexei Navalny on board would not go according to plan.\nSo when the captain announced that the plane would be diverted to a different airport, Mr Navalny shouted his apology to everyone on board, many of whom were journalists.\nAfter a ride in a bus from the plane to the airport, he told us he was not afraid and was very happy to return home. \nAs he approached passport control with his wife Yulia, he said to the border control officer with a smile: \"You must have been waiting for me for a long time!\" And it was probably true. \nA few moments later, he was asked by policemen to accompany them or they would have to use \"force\". Mr Navalny wanted his lawyer Olga Mikhailova - who was on the same flight - to go with him. But at that point, she had already crossed the border and was not allowed back airside as Mr Navalny was led away.\nRussia's prison service said the opposition leader \"had been wanted since 29 December 2020 for repeated violations of the probation period\" related to his suspended sentence for embezzlement.\nSeparately, Russian prosecutors have launched a new criminal case against Mr Navalny on fraud charges related to transfers of money to various charities, including his Anti-Corruption Foundation.\nMr Navalny accuses Mr Putin of targeting him with spurious cases.\nMr Navalny collapsed on a plane flying from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow. The flight was diverted to the city of Omsk, where he was admitted to hospital. He was airlifted to Germany in an induced coma.\nEuropean experts later said he had been poisoned with the extremely toxic chemical weapon Novichok, developed by Soviet scientists in the Cold War.\nLast month, investigative reporters named three agents of Russia's FSB security service who had travelled to Tomsk at the time Mr Navalny was there, and said the specialist unit had tailed him for years.\nMr Navalny later said he had duped an FSB agent into revealing details of the operation against him in a phone conversation, which he recorded and posted online. The FSB said the recording was \"fake\".\nPresident Putin has dismissed investigations by the Bellingcat website and other groups that have blamed Russian intelligence agents for the attack as \"a trick\". He has alleged his rival is backed by US intelligence services."

      "text": "A 500-year-old painting has been discovered in a flat in Italy and returned to a museum - where staff were unaware it had even been stolen. \nThe copy of Salvator Mundi, which is believed to have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci, was found in a bedroom cupboard in Naples on Saturday.\nThis copy is thought to have been painted by one of da Vinci's students.\nThe 36-year-old owner of the flat was arrested on suspicion of receiving stolen goods, police said.\n\"The painting was found on Saturday thanks to a brilliant and diligent police operation,\" Naples prosecutor Giovanni Melillo told the AFP news agency.\nThe artwork is usually part of the Doma Museum collection at the San Domenico Maggiore church in the city.\nBut Mr Melillo said officials were not aware it had been stolen because \"the room where the painting is kept has not been open for three months\" due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nIt is not known when the artwork was taken as no one had reported it missing, but the museum said it was in its possession as recently as last January.\nPolice are now investigating the circumstances of the theft, but there was no sign of a break-in at the museum. \n\"It is plausible that it was a commissioned theft by an organisation working in the international art trade,\" Mr Melillo said.\nIt is not known who painted the artwork, but some experts believe Leonardo's student Giacomo Alibrandi may have done so in the early 1500s. \nIt shows Christ with one hand raised, with the other holding a glass sphere.\nAnd to add to the mystery - whether or not the original painting is an authentic Leonardo da Vinci is disputed. Leonardo died in 1519 and there are fewer than 20 of his paintings in existence.\nThe original Salvator Mundi has had major cosmetic surgery - its walnut panel base has been described as \"worm-tunnelled\" and at some point it seems to have been split in half. Efforts to restore it have also resulted in abrasions.\nThis did not detract buyers, however, and the painting became the most expensive ever sold when it was auctioned for a record $450m (\u00a3341m) in 2017.\nThe unidentified buyer was involved in a bidding contest, via telephone, that lasted nearly 20 minutes."

The government needs to urgently legislate to protect the viability of cash - as it promised to do so last year. Time is running out.\"\nWhich? said the lack of cash access was a problem for those who relied on notes and coins - such as people with certain health conditions or without computer access.\nJenny Ross, Which? Money editor, said: \"We have repeatedly warned about the consequences that coronavirus will have on what was an already fragile cash system, but nowhere near enough action has been taken by the government or the regulator to understand the scale of this issue.\"\nThe Treasury has proposed giving the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, control of overseeing future access to cash and has thrown its weight behind the idea of cashback in shops, without the requirement to buy anything.\nDavid Fagleman, director at financial consultancy Enryo, said: \"Our own research shows that despite a decline in use for day-to-day purchases, nearly three-quarters of people think the move to a cashless society is happening too fast and risks leaving some people, particularly the vulnerable, behind.\""

      "text": "US President-elect Joe Biden is to undo one of Donald Trump's last actions in office by blocking his decree lifting Covid travel bans on visitors from much of Europe and Brazil. \nMr Biden's spokeswoman said now was not the time to be easing travel measures.\nJoe Biden will take office at 12:00 (17:00 GMT) on Wednesday. However, much of the spotlight is on Mr Trump's final moves, including presidential pardons.\nSecurity is intense in Washington DC ahead of the inauguration ceremony. \nThousands of National Guard reserve soldiers have been deployed in the wake of the storming of the Capitol building by a pro-Trump mob on 6 January that left five people dead.\nThe FBI had earlier warned of possible protests across the nation by right-wing extremists emboldened by the invasion.\nThe US imposed travel restrictions on Europe last March and the Brazilian entry ban was put in place in May, but the White House decreed on Monday that the entry ban would end on 26 January, six days after Mr Biden takes office.\nJust minutes later, Mr Biden's spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said on Twitter: \"On the advice of our medical team, the administration does not intend to lift these restrictions on 1/26. In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of Covid-19.\"\nShe said that with \"more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel\".\nBarred from Twitter following the Capitol riots, the president has been uncharacteristically quiet and there have been few details of what he might do on Tuesday.\nA statement from the White House press office read simply: \"President Trump will work from early in the morning until late in the evening. He will make many calls and have many meetings.\"\nThere has been no invitation to Joe Biden for the traditional pre-inauguration meeting at the White House. \nMr Trump still contests the election he fought with Mr Biden, although he has pledged a transition of power.\nThe main focus will be on presidential pardons, with US media suggesting a list of some 100 people is being considered.\nThe New York Times said some could be of criminals whose cases have been championed by justice activists.\nMore controversial names include Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Mr Trump's former adviser Stephen Bannon.\nRapper Lil Wayne, a prominent Trump supporter, is also reported to be on the list. \nHe pleaded guilty to possession of a gold-plated handgun, which was loaded when his chartered private jet landed in Miami in December 2019. \nFriends of Joe Exotic, the star of the Netflix documentary Tiger King who is serving a 22-year sentence for his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot and animal abuse, are also hopeful he could be pardoned.\nThen, of course, there is Donald Trump. Could the president pardon himself? It is unclear either whether he plans to do so or even if it is legally possible.\nThe ceremony will be unlike any other. The number of spectators will be greatly reduced, some 25,000 National Guard soldiers are being deployed and Donald Trump will snub his successor by not attending - something that has not happened for more than 150 years.\nOn Monday, the Capitol complex was briefly locked down after a security alert. \nSome 200,000 flags, bathed in light, have been planted on the National Mall to represent the crowds who cannot attend and reflect on those who have lost their lives to Covid.\nThe inauguration ceremony will feature performances by Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez. \nMr Trump will head to Florida early on Wednesday, using up his presidential travel privileges by taking Marine One to Joint Base Andrews and then boarding Air Force One.\nBloomberg said Mr Trump was planning a military send-off for himself at Andrews.\nOn Tuesday he is scheduled to deliver an evening address on Covid from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC.\nHe is set to immediately reverse a number of Trump policies, scrapping the ban on travellers from some mainly Muslim countries and rejoining the Paris climate accord. \nHe will also focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border and issuing mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing.\nMr Biden will also cancel the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline on his first day in office, US media report.\nThe pipeline is projected to carry oil nearly 1,200 miles (1,900km) from the Canadian province of Alberta down to Nebraska, to join an existing pipeline. Environmentalists and Native American groups have fought the project for more than a decade.\nConfirmation hearings for Mr Biden's appointees begin later on Tuesday."

It's a bit sad because I wanted to be one of them people that hangs out with their friends.\" \nWhile enjoying extra time with her parents, Chloe misses the young carers groups she attended each week before the pandemic. Now all her interaction with other young carers happens entirely online. \n\"It was hanging out with people who know what you're going through,\" she said.\n\"So you have a place where you can relax and not have to worry about people asking a bunch of questions. It was where you could just be normal and not have to worry.\"\nAlso relying on online support is nine-year-old Kieran, who is a young carer for his 11-year-old sister Tegan. \nTegan has Joubert's syndrome, a rare condition which means she can struggle with communication and mobility. \nWhile she is becoming more independent as she gets older, Kieran is sometimes more of an older brother than a younger brother and helps with things like getting dressed and ready for the day. \nHe said the past 10 months have made him feel lonely. \n\"I am missing going to school because I stress a lot at home and I miss seeing my friends.\" \nAs well as going to school, Kieran said meeting other young carers through organised trips and activities helped him build his confidence and make new friends. That was until lockdown.\nSimon Hatch, director of Carers Trust Wales said lockdown and extra responsibilities were \"adding real pressure\" to young carers.\n\"They are giving us information about feeling frustrated, more isolated and lonely, particularly [at] not being able to engage with the services,\" he said.\n\"For many young carers, schools and being able to be at school with their friends is one of the only forms of respite they get, so you can imagine how much more difficult things are now.\"\nThe Welsh Government thanked young carers for the \"remarkable support\" they are providing during the pandemic.\n\"We are working with Carers Trust Wales to understand further the pressures young carers are facing and ensure they get support they need,\" added a spokesperson.\n\"We have also provided additional funding for mental health services and to support carers during this incredibly difficult time.\"\nYou can see more on this story on Wales Live on BBC One Wales on Tuesday 19 January at 22:35."

      "tags": "UK trade tariffs,Xinjiang,Human rights,Dominic Raab,China,Global trade,Uighurs,Brexit,Trade",
      "text": "The UK is forging its post-Brexit path as a \"confident, independent nation - and an energetic force for good\", according to the government.\nIt's free to set trade on its own terms, pursue opportunities and higher living standards. But can it square profit with principle?\nIs turning a blind eye to human rights violations worth it to have a trade deal that knocks a couple of quid off the price of an imported shirt?\nThat New Year's resolution is already being tested, as China falls increasingly out of favour. \nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab has referred to conditions, under which over a million Uighur Muslims are being held in camps and forced into work, as \"at the worst... torture and inhumane and degrading treatments\". \nHe warned that British companies will face fines, if they can't show that their supply chains are free from forced labour. \nIn December, a BBC investigation revealed thousands of Uighurs and other minorities have been compelled to toil in the cotton fields of Xinjiang. The region accounts for a fifth of the world's crop - it's not always easy to tell where your t-shirt hails from. \nThe UK and Canada have led the charge here, but one wonders how much further can it go.  \nMr Raab told the BBC that the UK should not be engaging in free trade negotiations with countries whose record was \"well below the level of genocide\".\nThere are several issues with this: first, working out who gets to decree human rights abuses.\nAmendments to the Trade Bill currently going through Parliament would oblige the government to assess the human rights records of potential partners.\nOne amendment proposes allowing the High Court to declare a genocide in other countries, and forcing the immediate cancellation of trade deals with said nations.\nMr Raab, however, says the decision to declare a genocide can't, and shouldn't be, delegated to the courts. Rather, it's for MPs to hold the government to account over trade deals.\nBut Labour MPs, who have written to their Conservative counterparts urging them to support the amendments, say they've already been denied powers of scrutiny. \nThey highlight trade deals rolled over with Egypt, Cameroon and Turkey, with whom the UK previously enjoyed similar deals the EU had struck. \nThese three countries, they argue, have questionable records on human rights. \nAnd then there's China. The UK is not planning a deal with Beijing and has indicated it won't do a deal with countries that don't share its democratic values. \nBut both nations have their eye on joining the wider Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. \nWith imports and exports worth almost \u00a380bn in 2019, China already scores as one of the UK's largest trading partners, and it's not just about frocks and financial services crossing borders. \nSince Xi Jinping and David Cameron famously sipped a pint in a Buckinghamshire pub in 2015, Chinese investment in the UK has exploded, backing everything from football clubs to restaurant chains. \nNow China's appeal has soured, but it may not be easy to back away from encouraging investment, or a trade deal which touts lower import prices and greater opportunities for exporters, when the UK economy is already reeling.\nTake textiles - a free trade deal would do away with a 12% tariff on clothes hailing from China. Ultimately, trade deals build on an existing - in this case very lucrative - relationship. \nCritics argue it's not enough to refrain from boosting ties with nations with chequered records - they should be lessened. \nBut it's even harder to snub countries that are already providing jobs for thousands, or items from the frivolous, such as smartphones, to the vital, like billions of PPE items. \nSome say the UK has its own issues elsewhere. It resumed the sales of arms to Saudi Arabia last year, after the government said the method for licensing had been reformulated to ensure they wouldn't be used in Yemen. Human rights groups are less sure.\nBalancing its quest to be a responsible citizen, together with exploring fresh fortunes, is just one dilemma the UK faces, as it shapes its new identity on the global stage."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A further 1,610 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began.\nIt means the total number of deaths by that measure is now above 90,000.\nA total of 4,266,577 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine, according to the latest government figures.\nAnother 33,355 positive Covid cases have been recorded - less than half the peak figure of 68,053 on 8 January.\nIt is the lowest number of daily cases seen since 27 December - before the start of England's third nationwide lockdown.\nDr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said: \"Whilst there are some early signs that show our sacrifices are working, we must continue to strictly abide by the measures in place.\"\nShe said reducing contact with others and staying at home will lead to \"a fall in the number of infections over time\".\nThe figures come as new estimates from the Office for National Statistics show about one in 10 people across the UK tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies in December - roughly double the October figure.\nThe rising number of deaths was to be expected, sadly, after the surge in cases during December.\nAnd it is likely that the coming weeks will see figures even higher than this.\nToday's numbers are, though, inflated by the fact that delays in registering deaths over the weekend tends to lead to higher figures being reported on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.\nOn average, the UK is recording more than 1,100 deaths a day.\nTo put that in context, at Christmas it was less than half of that.\nBut there are two rays of hope in the daily update.\nFirstly, the number of cases is below 40,000 for a third day in a row. Just two weeks ago we saw a few days above 60,000.\nThat means in the coming weeks we should start to see fewer people in hospital and eventually fewer deaths.\nThe number of vaccinations also continues to rise.\nIt seems unlikely the NHS will manage its target of two million doses a week just yet. \nBut each increase at least takes us one step closer to getting on top of the virus.\nMeanwhile, NHS England said 400 military personnel were now assisting in hospitals in London and the Midlands, as wards face \"unprecedented pressure\".\nOn Monday, Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said it would be \"some time\" before the vaccination programme begins to reduce pressures on hospitals.\nAnd in other developments, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he is self-isolating after being alerted by the UK's NHS Covid-19 app .that he had been in close contact with somebody who tested positive.  \nHe said self-isolation was \"perhaps the most important part of all the social distancing\" and urged others to do the same if contacted.\nThe previous highest number of daily deaths was last Wednesday, when 1,564 deaths were recorded.\nTuesday's figure brings the total number of deaths recorded during the pandemic in the UK to 91,470.\nThese government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive, but there are other ways of measuring the total number of deaths.\nAnother method is to count all deaths where coronavirus is mentioned on the death certificate. That figure has now officially reached 95,829, although that is only measured up to 8 January.\nThe UK has recorded the fifth-highest number of deaths globally, according to Johns Hopkins University - behind the US, Brazil, India and Mexico.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: \"British people are paying the price for the government's serial incompetence.\""

It was over,\" she wrote. \n\"Sadly, for many this isn't the case. For the next few years, I attended screenings every six months to ensure the abnormal cells didn't return.\n\"My last screening was in April 2018. Thankfully again all was fine but the anxiety and fear that surrounded me as I awaited those results has stayed with me even now.\"\nShe went on to give birth to her son Sullivan in March 2019."

      "text": "Levels of stress, depression and anxiety among parents and carers have increased with the pressures of the lockdowns, suggests research from the University of Oxford.\nIssues include difficulty relaxing, feeling hopeless and being irritable.\nMany parents, especially those of secondary-age pupils, say they are worried about their children's futures.\nThe government has said it is aware how challenging it is for parents to support children with home learning.\nThe research, based on responses from 6,246 parents and carers between mid-March and the end of December 2020, found problems including: \nOn an established scale of depression, anxiety and stress, parents' depression scores increased from April through to June from an average of 9.03 to 9.71, says the study funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.\nWhile these average scores decreased over the summer, when Covid-19 restrictions were eased, to a low of 8.23 in September, they rose again over the course of the autumn term to a high of 10.1 points in December.\nParents' stress scores were at their lowest in August and September at 11.4 points, but increased to a high of 13.2 in December, following the pre-Christmas lockdown.\nThe researchers said higher levels of stress were detected particularly in low-income families, as well as single-parent households and those with children with special educational needs.\nWhile average anxiety scores were relatively stable throughout the whole period - ranging from a 4.71 points in April to 4.24 in July - they hit a high of 5 points in December.\nThe study also found just over a third (36%) of parents with young children (10 years or younger) said they were \"substantially worried\" about their children's behaviour, in contrast to just over a quarter (28%) of parents who had older children only (11 years or older).\nHowever, nearly half (45%) of those with secondary-age children were worried about their children's education and future, compared to 32% of those with young children.\nLeticea, a parent who took part in the study, said: \"I think that UK leaders should have access to this data to see what is going on with the mental health of families and how they are being affected by Covid-19 with increased levels of stress, depression and anxiety - we need something to look forward to. \n\"I am also worried that the next three months will show a sharper increase in anxiety and stress where parents are having to do more teaching at home. \n\"Children are more worried as their teachers are becoming ill - the 'new variant' sounds more scary, my daughter keeps commenting on an increasing worry of catching Covid-19 which she didn't do so much before.\"\nAnother parent, Madiha, said: ''Current times are hard enough as they are. \n\"As a working parent, the most important thing for me is to ensure my family's wellbeing, their safety, and their continued development. \n\"Prolonged screen time, disruption to daily routine, frequent arguments, lack of exercise, and stress of exams have all been contributing factors to our mental health and wellbeing. \nMadiha said she hoped the study would play a part in informing policy and developing interventions to help families.\nCathy Creswell, professor of clinical developmental psychology at Oxford University and co-leader of the study, said the findings showed parents were particularly vulnerable to distress during the first lockdown. \n\"Our data highlight the particular strains felt by parents during lockdown when many feel that they have been spread too thin by the demands of meeting their children's needs during the pandemic, along with home-schooling and work commitments.\"\nJohn Jolly, head of the charity Parentkind, said the research highlighted \"the additional stress and pressure that partial school closures place on parents\". \n\"Given the disruption to family life, it is vital that policymakers consult and listen to the concerns of parents on issues that directly impact them and their children's futures. \n\"This includes the safety and reopening of schools, the fair allocation of grades in the absence of exams, and remote learning provision.\"\nThe Oxford researchers are tracking children's and parents' mental health throughout the current crisis, to help them identify what protects young people from deteriorating mental health and how this may vary according to child and family characteristics."

      "tags": "China,Mike Pompeo,Uighurs,United States",
      "text": "China has committed genocide in its repression of the Uighurs and other mainly Muslim peoples, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday. \nPresident-elect Joe Biden's choice for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said he agrees with the finding.\nRights groups believe that China detained up to a million Uighurs over the past few years in what the state defines as \"re-education camps\". \nBBC investigations suggest that Uighurs are being used as forced labour.\nTensions with China have been a defining feature of Donald Trump's term, from trade policies to the coronavirus pandemic. \n\"I believe this genocide is ongoing, and that we are witnessing the systematic attempt to destroy Uighurs by the Chinese party-state,\" Mr Pompeo said in a statement on Monday, his last day in office as part of Donald Trump's administration.\nChina reacted angrily, dismissing the statement as \"outrageous lies\". \n\"We see this so-called determination as a piece of waste paper,\" said foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying. \"We hope the new US administration can have their own reasonable and cool-minded judgment of Xinjiang issues.\"\nWhile the Pompeo statement puts pressure on China, it does not automatically introduce any fresh penalties.\nMr Blinken was asked at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday if he agreed with Mr Pompeo's announcement, to which he answered: \"That would be my judgment as well.\"\nHe added: \"On the Uighurs I think we're very much in agreement. And the forcing of men, women and children into concentration camps, trying to, in effect, re-educate them to be adherents to the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party, all of that speaks to an effort to commit genocide.\"\nMr Biden's team made a similar argument last August, saying the Uighurs had suffered \"unspeakable oppression... at the hands of China's authoritarian government\". \nAnalysis by the BBC Chinese service\nOn its very last day, the Trump administration has delivered its final \"gift\" to China, in the form of a parting shot.  \nThis is by far the strongest condemnation by any country regarding China's actions in its north-western region of Xinjiang. The EU, the UK and Australia, which have repeatedly criticised the human rights situation in Xinjiang, may consider following suit. \nIt could lead to unprecedented international pressure facing China, but would that change Beijing's behaviour? Today's Beijing is emboldened by the consolidation of political power, positive economic growth amid a pandemic, and to some degree, political chaos in Washington. A Chinese state media representative quickly hit back that the US has \"committed genocide\" of Americans with its botched handling of the pandemic.\nFor many countries including the US, economic ties with China have become too substantial to be entirely cut off. Between human rights and economic interests, the balancing act towards China is getting increasingly difficult. \nAlthough the Biden team had referred to the suppression against Uighurs as \"genocide\", Xinjiang may not have been one of its priority issues. But the new administration will now be compelled to announce a concrete policy position on Xinjiang. It's clear that the tit-for-tat between Beijing and Washington will not finish with Mr Trump's term in the White House.\nChina says it is fighting \"three evil forces\" of separatism, terrorism, and extremism in the far western region of Xinjiang, where most of the 11 million Uighurs live. It says its \"training measures\" in Xinjiang are necessary to combat these.\nXinjiang has seen a large influx of settlers from China's ethnic Han majority. Anti-Han and separatist sentiment rose in the territory from the 1990s, flaring into violence on occasion, but in recent years a massive security crackdown has crushed dissent.\nXinjiang is now covered by a pervasive network of surveillance, including police, checkpoints, and cameras that scan everything from number plates to individual faces. The Chinese government says the measures are necessary to combat separatist violence in the region, but it is accused of exaggerating the threat in order to justify repression of the Uighurs.\nCampaigners say China is trying to eradicate the Uighur culture, by forcing Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol. \nLast week, Mr Trump's administration banned the import of cotton and tomato products from the Xinjiang region of China, where the majority of Uighurs live. \nXinjiang accounts for nearly a fifth of world cotton production, the US estimates. \nChina has been widely accused of using detention camps in Xinjiang for forced labour, particularly in the cotton industry. \nAn investigation by the BBC in 2019 suggested that children in Xinjiang were being systematically separated from their families in an effort to isolate them from their Muslim communities.\nRecent research says China has forced Uighur women to be sterilised or fitted with contraceptive devices in an apparent attempt to limit the size of the Uighur population. \nChina denies this and has accused the media of \"cooking up false information on Xinjiang-related issues\"."

      "text": "The NHS is being supplied with as many Covid-19 vaccines as it can cope with, according to a leading doctor.\nDr Gill Richardson, chair of Wales' vaccination board, said health boards were receiving doses they asked for.\nOn Friday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the supply of the Pfizer vaccine was being \"spaced out\" as it had to last until a delivery in February.\nBut opposition parties questioned why supplies were being \"spread out\".\nPaul Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said it was \"important now to get those vaccines out to people\".\nPlaid's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth added it made \"little sense\" to spread out the vaccines, when \"time is of the essence\". \nBut a Welsh Government minister defended the rollout and said the vaccine infrastructure is \"growing\".\n\"We're moving from a situation where we were using 50% of the stock for first vaccine to a situation where we are now using 100%,\" Counsel General Jeremy Miles told the BBC's Politics Wales show.\n\"In order to deliver that, the infrastructure for vaccinating needs to be increased and that infrastructure is being brought forward.\"\nThe Tories have called on the Welsh Government to appoint a vaccination minister like Prime Minister Boris Johnson has done in England.\n\"It would make a huge difference because this minister would be able to focus on the vaccination programme and nothing else,\" said Mr Davies.\nWales was expected to receive 100,000 doses of the second vaccine - the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab - this week but about a quarter are delayed after failing the regulator's tests.\nDr Richardson said deliveries of the vaccines have arrived in \"pulses\" and a big consignment of the Pfizer vaccine - around 170,000 doses - arrived in late December.\nHalf the vaccine was initially held back for booster jabs, but they are now being given to people as a first jab in a bid to get as many people vaccinated - and given some protection - as possible.\nDr Richardson said they were only giving health boards what they could cope with as, after coming out of deep-freeze storage, the Pfizer jab has to be used within five days.\n\"We are very conscious that we need to get this out there,\" she told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement.\n\"I know that my colleagues are desperate to immunise our vulnerable people.\n\"We are now able and have been pushing all the vaccine that our health boards can cope with out to them.\"\nThere has been criticism that the rollout of the vaccine has been slower in Wales than in other parts of the UK.\nWales has received about 250,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 50,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine so far.\nThe Welsh Government said it had been assured it would get more Pfizer vaccines by February, despite shipments of it being temporarily slowed because of changes to the company's manufacturing processes.\nDr Richardson said: \"We are going to have a famine, if you like, of Pfizer deliveries at the end of the month.\n\"That hasn't stopped us pushing out as much vaccine as we can to the health boards.\n\"But their clinics will run out of the Pfizer vaccine if more does not come.\"\nThe Welsh Government said one Oxford-AstraZeneca batch out of four had been delayed, affecting 26,000 doses due to be sent to Wales' seven health boards.\nBetsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, which manages the health service in north Wales, said it had advised GPs \"may wish to delay appointments early next week\" with the planned supply reduced.\nBBC Wales has contacted the other health boards in Wales to ask if vaccination appointments have been affected, but they have not given details.\nDr Richardson said while it was \"a huge issue for this week, it won't be an issue overall for the programme, we are hoping, because we have been reassured by the UK government that supplies (of the Oxford vaccine) are on their way\".\nAny GPs affected will be prioritised for the next batch of vaccine, she said.\nAsked if he could guarantee supplies to Wales, Welsh Secretary Simon Hart told the programme: \"Yes, I think I can.\"\nHe added: \"There will be the odd occasion when a consignment is rejected or delayed.

      "text": "Only 155 out of more than 23,000 university professors in the UK are black, according to official figures.\nIt remains below 1%, the same as for the past five years, and is an increase of only 50 posts despite the number of professorships rising by more than 3,000 in that time.\nAt this senior academic level, women hold 28% of professorships, up from 23% five years ago.\n\"The pace of change is glacial,\" said lecturers' union leader Jo Grady.\n\"Universities must do more to ensure a more representative mix of staff at a senior level and stop this terrible waste of talent,\" said Dr Grady, general secretary of the UCU university union.\nThe figures on black professors were \"disappointing\" and \"inexplicable\", said Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust race equality think tank, \"given the symbolic importance of education as the foundation of our values.\" \n\"Around a quarter of British postgraduates are from ethnic minorities, there is clearly no shortage of qualified black and minority academics seeking elevation to senior teaching and research roles in our universities,\" said Dr Begum.\nShe called on vice chancellors to take action over a problem they can \"literally discern with their own eyes every single day they are on campus\".  \nThe annual figures, published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency, provide a breakdown of the UK's academic workforce - and show while there has been a focus on widening access for students, there are still few black academic staff.\nAt the level of professor, the number of black professors rose from 105 to 155 between 2014-15 to 2019-20.\nBut new higher education providers included in the figures meant an additional 3,200 staff at professor grade, with the proportion of black professors only increasing marginally from 0.5% to 0.7% over five years.\nThis compared to 7% of professors who are Asian and 89% white in the figures for 2019-20.\nKehinde Andrews, professor of black studies at Birmingham City University, said that rather than universities being \"progressive dreamlands\", the \"make-up of professors is the perfect reflection of the narrow Eurocentric views still produced by universities\".\n\"I have seen very few genuine attempts to address the issues of racism at any level across the sector,\" said Prof Andrews.\nAmong all academic staff, 2% are black, 10% are Asian, 75% are white,  with the remainder under categories of \"mixed\", \"other or not known\".\nThere is still a significant gender gap in professorships, among a group that is also heavily skewed to older age groups, with most in their fifties, sixties and above.\nFive years ago, more than 4,500 professors were women, which has risen to 6,300 - from 23% to 28% of these senior posts.\nThis is despite women representing 46% of all academic staff.\nBaroness Amos, who was the UK's first black female university head, has previously warned of \"deep-seated prejudices and stereotypes which need to be overcome\" in the recruitment of senior staff in higher education.\nUniversities UK said \"the evidence is clear that black and minority ethnic staff continue to be under-represented\" at these senior academic levels. \n\"More needs to be done to address this inequality which exists within higher education, which mirrors inequalities evident in wider UK society and which will require an unequivocal commitment to change,\" said the universities' organisation."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Poverty,Jack Monroe,Universal Credit",
      "text": "MPs have urged Boris Johnson to extend benefit increases worth \u00a320 a week. \nA non-binding Labour motion calling for the universal credit top-up to be kept in place beyond 31 March passed by 278 votes to none after a Commons debate.\nSix Tory MPs defied party orders to abstain and voted with Labour, adding to the pressure on the PM on the issue.\nThe prime minister said the government had provided \u00a3280bn worth of support during the pandemic but all measures would be kept under \"constant review\".\nThe motion, which will not automatically lead to a change in policy, was put forward by Labour as a way to put additional pressure on the government to continue the increase, worth \u00a31,000 a year. \nFormer Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb was among six Conservative MPs to rebel, along with Peter Aldous, Robert Halfon, Jason McCartney, Anne Marie Morris and Matthew Offord.\nAhead of the vote, Mr Crabb told the BBC that although there were \"difficult pressures on the chancellor\" extending the increase for 12 months was \"the right thing to do\". \nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there were dozens of Conservative MPs who were \"deeply uneasy\" about ending the \u00a320 weekly increase to universal credit. \nShe added that it was also understood the cabinet minister with responsibility for benefits, Therese Coffey, was arguing that the uplift should not be dropped in April. \nCharities and anti-poverty campaigners are pleading with the government to keep the support in place, describing it as a lifeline for more than 5.5 million families who receive the standard universal credit allowance.\nFood poverty campaigner and chef Jack Monroe told the BBC that the \u00a320 increase \"has been a lifeline\" for millions of people who have needed to top up their income or rely on universal credit payments in order to get by.\nSir Keir said the increase was a vital safety net for those who had lost their jobs, seen their working hours slashed or who were not eligible for the government's wage subsidy furlough scheme.\n\"If we don't give a helping hand to families through this pandemic, then we are going to slow our economic recovery as we come out it.\n\"We urge Boris Johnson to change course and give families certainty today that their incomes will be protected.\"\nAnalysis by chief political correspondent Adam Fleming\nSix billion pounds of the benefits bill - the difference between poverty or not for 1.2 million families, according to a think tank. \nThe \u00a31,040 a year increase to universal credit is a very emotive issue. \nThere's even a battle over what to call it. \nTo the government, its introduction was a one-off boost to cope with a crisis. For Labour, taking it away is a cut.\nMinisters would prefer we looked at the overall level of support they've provided for workers and businesses during the pandemic. The opposition say the \u00a320 a week boost is a powerful symbol of the state's willingness to help. \nEven the act of debating it today is disputed. Labour say they've got the right occasionally to set the agenda in Parliament. Boris Johnson said his MPs risk abuse from campaigners and protestors if they engage. \nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation has suggested about 16 million people will be directly affected if the \u00a320 is rolled back.\nIt says 500,000 more people will be driven into poverty, including 200,000 children, while a further 500,000 of those already in poverty will find themselves in even worse hardship. \nHowever, free market think tank the Institute for Economic Affairs has argued that \"across-the-board benefit increases are a wasteful use of taxpayers' money\" at a time when the government is borrowing \"a hair-raising amount of money\". \nUniversal credit is a single payment replacing old benefits such as housing benefit and child tax credits.\nYou can claim universal credit if you are on a low income or are out of work. \nThe standard allowance varies from around \u00a3340 to just under \u00a3600 a month, depending on your age or whether you are single. \nYou may be eligible to receive more money on top of the standard allowance if, for example, you have children or a health condition. \nSpeaking on behalf of the Northern Research Group, Conservative MP John Stevenson said the \u00a31,000 increase had been \"a real life-saver for people throughout this pandemic\".\n\"To end it now would be devastating for the 6 million individuals and families who are already struggling to stay afloat,\" he added.\nWhile the vote is not binding, and will not lead to a change in policy, it will increase pressure on the government to keep the increase or come up with an alternative.\nLabour said the Conservatives' decision to abstain created \"unnecessary uncertainty\" but minister Nadhim Zahawi described the vote as \"a political stunt\".\nThe government says it has strengthened the welfare system with an extra \u00a37bn of funding during the pandemic while families struggling with food and household bills can get help through the \u00a3170m Winter Grant Scheme. \nMinisters also point to extra support for housing costs, through an increase in local housing allowance for those on housing benefits and hardship payments worth \u00a3670m next year for those unable to pay their council tax bills."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "text": "Opposition parties have voiced concerns about vaccine supplies after \"frustrated\" GPs said they were still waiting for deliveries.\nAt Holyrood on Tuesday, the first minister was pressed on why the rollout was going \"so slowly\" and on whether there was a problem with distribution.\nDr Andrew Buist, of BMA Scotland, told the BBC that patients were getting anxious and practices could not plan.\nNicola Sturgeon said there were ongoing challenges but targets would be met.\nDr Buist claimed that as of Monday, the Scottish government had taken receipt of more than 700,000 vaccines - but only used 264,991.\nHe said: \"The work force is there and that's why it's so incredibly frustrating when the patients want the vaccine, we're very keen to give it to our patients but we just don't have the vaccine in our fridge.\"\nDr Buist spoke also about \"inconsistencies\" across the GP network, saying some practices had supplies but others had none.\nThe government said it was listening to Dr Buist's concerns and every GP in Scotland would receive, in writing, more detail about the \"mechanism of supply, ordering and delivery, with suggested solutions\". \nOpposition party members questioned Ms Sturgeon about the vaccination programme after she had delivered a statement to parliament saying lockdown would continue until \"at least\" mid-February.\nScottish Conservatives MSP Ruth Davidson said anxious constituents feared being \"left behind\" and called for an explanation on why over 400,000 vaccines had \"yet to reach patients\".\nThe first minister said the January target of delivering 100,000 vaccines per week had been \"exceeded\". \nShe also reiterated that she had not been able to discuss supply figures because the UK government had \"thrown a hissy fit\" after plans were published then removed from the Scottish government website.\nMs Sturgeon told the chamber: \"They don't want us to be open about supply for reasons of commercial confidentiality and while I don't necessarily agree with the reasoning behind that, we have agreed with their request.\n\"We vaccinate as quickly as we possibly can and that will continue to be the case as we go through the different groups in our vaccination programme.\"\nMs Sturgeon said the following targets would be met:\nInterim Scottish Labour leader Jackie Baillie also asked when the 400,000 remaining vaccines would be distributed to GPs, reiterating that supply had been \"patchy\".\nMs Sturgeon replied that as per earlier JCVI advice, the Scottish government had been holding back 50% of doses in order to complete the second round of vaccinations within three weeks.\nThe UK's vaccination strategy changed in recent weeks, leaving a 12-week gap between doses.\nMs Sturgeon added: \"They are now flowing through the system now advice has changed.\"\nScottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said he had heard from GPs in his own constituency of Fife who had been forced to cancel vaccine appointments because they had run out of injections.\nHe pressed the first minister on whether there was a problem with Scotland's distribution system.\nAll governments have \"big challenges\" in terms of vaccine allocation because of supply flow, responded Ms Sturgeon.\nShe added: \"I don't underestimate ongoing challenges but I don't think it would be right to say the programme is not progressing well.\"\nOn Monday Ms Sturgeon said vaccinating over-80s in the community was now picking up pace, with the target being to have them all given the first dose by 5 February.\nHowever, Dr Buist questioned whether Scotland would receive enough supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine to meet the target of offering vaccines to all over 70s and 80s by the middle of February.\nInstead, he proposed that GPs should be allowed to use the Pfizer vaccine - which has to be stored in industrial freezers and has limits on the number of times it can be transported.\nHe said: \"Once it's defrosted it can be used over five days. They do come in boxes of 975 doses and I am also aware that GPs in NHS Highland have already been using it. \n\"It is quite possible to use Pfizer in practice. Of course we absolutely want to minimise any wastage but with good planning we can do that.\"\nNational clinical director Prof Jason Leitch told the BBC there was no \"medical or clinical\" reason GPs could not use the Pfizer jab, but it would be \"much harder logistically\".\n\"The potential would be that we would waste a lot - because they don't have industrial freezers with which to store it,\" he said. \n\"Once it is defrosted you have to use it fast. And you can't transport it long distances - you can only transport it two six hours journeys. We don't want to send them 195 vials and they use four.\"\nA Scottish government spokesman said the country's chief pharmaceutical officer had contacted Dr Buist to discuss with him the ongoing concerns. In addition all GPs would be receiving a letter explaining in more detail \"the mechanism of supply, ordering and delivery, with suggested solutions at local board level that can also assist them\".\nThe spokesman added: \"GPs have a significant role to play in delivering the vaccine - and we thank them for their hard work.\n\"We are in regular contact with boards to ensure GPs have the most up to date information on when supply is available and what our expectations are for them, providing as much detail as we can while rightly allowing our teams to focus on the task of delivering the biggest vaccination programme ever seen in Scotland.\n\"We too want to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible and are continually working hard to see if distribution can be made faster in any respect.\""

It's the best way of doing it because we know what suits our patients.\"\nDr O'Hagan said she had not heard reports of some practices holding back vaccines until they received bigger amounts to allow for a larger number of vaccinations to be done.\nShe said rolling out the programme was a logistical challenge which fell on top of an already heavy workload but the jab would be given out in a \"safe and timely\" fashion.\nSinn F\u00e9in MP \u00d3rfhlaith Begley said doctors in her West Tyrone constituency were working above and beyond to administer the vaccine to as many people as possible.\n\"But unfortunately I am hearing that some GPs cannot access supplies of the vaccine,\" she said.\n\"There does appear to be, and it is a consistent message from GPs in my own constituency, a feeling the distribution of the vaccine has been unequal to date.\"\nMeanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann has welcomed a further delivery of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine into Northern Ireland on Tuesday morning.\nIn a tweet, Robin Swann said: \"We now have the supply to complete all our over 80s and when that group is finished, there will be enough to start into the over 75 programme.\"\nPatricia Donnelly, the head of NI's vaccination programme said there had been 154,436 doses of the vaccine administered here, with 132,857 of those being first doses.\nOn Tuesday, she said three quarters of care home residents had already received both doses.\n\"With the arrival of additional vaccine today, which have been issued this afternoon and tomorrow to GPs, there will be enough to complete the over 80 population and to commence in the over 70 population,\" she added.\nA further 24 virus-related deaths and 713 more Covid-19 cases were reported in Northern Ireland on Tuesday.\nIt brings the total number of deaths recorded by the Department of Health to 1,649.\nThere are currently 842 people in hospital with the virus, 70 people in intensive care units (ICU) and 57 being ventilated.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, a further 93 Covid-19 related deaths were reported on Tuesday, bringing the country's death toll to 2,708.\nA further 2,001 positive cases were also recorded in the latest figures from the Republic's Department of Health.\nNorthern Ireland's rate of Covid-19 infection is now below one and has been at that level for a couple of weeks, according to the chief medical officer.\nHowever, Dr Michael McBride warned the reproduction (R) number for hospital transmission remains above one.\nDr McBride said new variants of the virus had made the job of curtailing the spread even more difficult, and warned he did not foresee any relaxation of restrictions any time soon.\n\"We need to ensure that we have as many people who remain at risk of severe disease vaccinated and prioritised with the first dose as possible before we consider significant relaxations in the current restrictions,\" he said. \nMeanwhile concerns have been raised that \"social media myths\" are encouraging some care home staff to reject the Covid vaccine.\nPauline Shepherd, from the Independent Health and Care Providers, said young women were especially vulnerable to misinformation about the vaccine and fertility.\nLast week, the Department of Health said there had been an uptake level of about 80% among care home staff.\n\"We are very keen obviously that everyone takes the vaccine, that is really the only way that we are going to get through this,\" she told BBC Radio Foyle.\n\"Obviously there are myths going around on social media about the vaccine and some are opting not to take it. \n\"Particularly younger females seem to have the view through social media that it may impact fertility\".\nThere are currently 139 confirmed Covid-19 outbreaks in NI's 483 care homes.\nThe Public Health Agency (PHA) and Department of Health were now exploring how \"to dispel the myths\", Ms Shepherd added.\nDr Mukesh Chugh, a consultant anaesthetist at Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry, said there had been a \"reluctance\" among black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people to take Covid-19 vaccines.\nDr Chugh says this is because of \"anti-vaccine messages\" posted across various social media platforms and messenger apps \"targeted at certain ethnic and religious groups\". \n\"I encourage them not to believe the messages they are getting on WhatsApp - these are not scientific messages,\" he said.\n\"Believe the scientific research.\"\nOn Tuesday, Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said a number of groups of key workers should be given priority access to vaccinations.\nPrioritisation was decided by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises UK health departments on immunisation.\nAsked if he supported prioritisation for food workers in meat plants, Mr Poots told the assembly he did and had raised it with the executive.\n\"It's been identified as an essential service - those people working in them are there in cold, wet conditions where we have had a number of outbreaks,\" he said.\n\"We should seek to introduce those people somewhat earlier than is currently the case - I will continue to endeavour to press that case.\"\nHe said other groups of workers who should be prioritised included \"teachers and police officers\"."

I've had no help since the pandemic started, financially, from the government.\n\"They ask you to self-isolate to protect others and then you get no financial support so you have got to make a choice of shall I go out and put people at risk because I need to pay my bills or should I struggle financially and stay home?\n\"My choice is listen to the app, stay at home, self- isolate.\"\nBut Mr Miller thinks without the financial support, others are not making the same choice\n\"I have a lot of friends in the taxi trade who wouldn't download the app because of that.\n\"I know people will not adhere to it, I know that for a fact because I've spoken to them. \n\"They can't do it financially.\"\nA mother-of-two from Carmarthenshire, who didn't want to be named, told BBC Wales Live she lied to her doctor to get a sicknote after missing out on the \u00a3500 grant.\nShe had to stay home to look after her son who had been told to isolate, meaning she would lose nearly \u00a3500 in wages.\nShe wasn't eligible for the grant as she is not on benefits, and she would have had to take unpaid leave if she did not have a doctor's note.\n\"It's horrible. I still feel really guilty about it now, but needs must.\n\"When you have to feed your children you do what you have to do.\"\nThe Welsh Government has told Wales Live more than 5,000 payments have been made since the scheme's launch.\nDuring that period around 300,000 positive cases and close contacts were identified by the Test, Trace, Protect system. \nThe charity Resolution Foundation said the figures and its own research showed the payment was \"not reaching enough people\".\nIt has called for a bigger scheme that would operate in a similar way to the job retention furlough programme.\nMaja Gustafsson, from the foundation, said: \"Not supporting the people who fall ill or risk spreading the virus further is going to be devastating for everyone.\n\"Investing in people so that they can do the right thing will be money well spent.\" \nA Welsh Government spokesman said: \"Unfortunately, making the necessary changes to enable people to apply for self-isolation payments after being told by the app to self-isolate could take a little while to deliver for Welsh app users. \n\"We are urgently working with local authorities to identify what other alternatives, including manual solutions, can be put in place as soon as possible, to ensure people told to self-isolate via the app are able to apply for the \u00a3500 self-isolation payment if they are eligible.\""

But it's not clear if the first minister will feel able to suggest a target date for restrictions to ease.\nCabinet will also be giving special attention to the serious Covid outbreak on Barra and considering if the level three restrictions that apply in the Western Isles remain appropriate.\nWhile there are signs the pace at which the current wave of coronavirus is spreading is starting to slow, evidence of much greater suppression will be required before the stay at home lockdown in place across mainland Scotland is lifted. \nThe review comes less than a week after restrictions in Scotland were tightened, with some click and collect services ordered to close and outdoor alcohol consumption banned.\nThe entire Scottish mainland has been in the top level of restrictions - level four - since Boxing Day, with level three measures in place in Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles and some islands in Argyll and Bute and the Highlands.\nScots are subject to a legal requirement not to leave home for anything other than essential purposes, such as shopping for essentials, exercise and caring responsibilities.\nThe number of new cases reported each day on average has begun to fall, but the number of people in hospital with the virus continues to rise and is now \"significantly\" above that seen in the first wave in 2020.\nMs Sturgeon said the \"position overall is very precarious, very concerning in terms of the level of transmission\", but said there were \"some early signs to be optimistic that measures are having an effect\".\nThe first minister will take questions from opposition leaders following her statement.\nThe Scottish Conservatives have voiced concerns that Covid-19 vaccines are not being rolled out quickly enough, saying the Scottish government are \"trailing their own targets\".\nStatistics released on Monday showed that Scotland has vaccinated 264,991 people so far - 6% of its adult population.\nThis is lower than the figure for England, where 8% of the adult population - 3,520,056 people - have been vaccinated, and Northern Ireland, which has the highest vaccination rate in the UK at 8.7%. \nWales has a similar figure to Scotland at 6%.\nEngland has also given a second dose of the vaccine to 427,386 people, compared to only 3,698 in Scotland.\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon has insisted that all parts of the UK are \"working to the same targets\" to vaccinate priority groups, and said her government is \"on track\" to hit them subject to supplies arriving.\nThis would see care home residents, healthcare staff and all over-80s get a first dose by the start of February, with over-70s and those deemed \"extremely vulnerable\" by mid-February and all over-65s by the beginning of March.\nBy that time the government aims to be vaccinating up to 400,000 people a week on average, with all priority groups getting a first jab by early May and the rest of the adult population in line thereafter."

      "tags": "Money,Personal finance,Universal Credit,Housing Benefit,Benefits,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Universal credit will rise for some people under plans announced by the chancellor in his Budget.\nRishi Sunak has reduced the \"taper rate\" - this affects the amount of money lost by working claimants if they earn more money.\nUniversal credit is a single benefit payment for working-age people, which was introduced to replace a range of different benefits for unemployed and low-paid people, and make the system simpler. \nIt's claimed by more than 5.8 million people in England, Scotland and Wales, both in and out of work - 40% of universal credit claimants are workers.\nClaimants received an extra \u00a320 per week during the pandemic, but this ended at the beginning of this month.\nMost universal credit claimants lose some of their benefits if they earn more money.\nThe rate at which they lose the benefits is known as the taper rate.\nAt the moment the taper rate is 63%, which means that if you earn an extra pound you lose 63p in benefits.\nWorkers with responsibility for children or disabilities that limit their ability to work are allowed to earn a certain amount before they start losing their universal credit, which is called a work allowance. \nThe work allowance means such people can earn up to \u00a3515 a month without losing benefits. Claimants who receive help with housing costs have a lower work allowance. \nThe chancellor has announced that in the coming weeks the taper rate will be reduced to 55p, which would mean that workers would take home 8p more of an extra pound earned.\nAlso, the work allowances for eligible claimants will go up by \u00a3500 a year.\nFor some workers that will make up for the loss of the \u00a320 a week uplift to universal credit.\nEmployees claiming universal credit who earn enough to pay National Insurance (\u00a39,564 a year) will also see the amount of tax they have to pay increase next April. That will affect somebody working more than about 20 hours a week on the minimum wage.\nTake as an example somebody without children, working 10 hours a week on the National Living Wage - which is going up to \u00a39.50 an hour in April.\nThey would earn \u00a395 a week, which means - at the current 63% taper rate - they lose \u00a359.85 of their universal credit. If the taper rate were cut to 55% they would get to take home an extra \u00a37.60 a week.\nHowever, most universal credit claimants are not working, so they would not receive any extra money.\nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) says that 1.4 million households still claim working tax credit and have not moved to universal credit, so they also would not benefit.\nThe cut to universal credit was opposed by many charities, opposition parties, and also some Conservative MPs.\nWriting on Twitter, Resolution chief executive Torsten Bell said that removing the boost would mean \"4.4 million households, with 5.1m adults and 3.5m children, will see their incomes fall by \u00a31,000 overnight. \nThe charity Citizens Advice warned that a third of people on universal credit would end up in debt when the extra payment is removed.\nIt said the average shortfall would be between \u00a351 and \u00a355 a month.\nThe government has defended its decision, saying the \u00a320 uplift was always meant to be temporary and that people getting back into work is the best way to tackle poverty.\nIt is complicated to work out exactly how much universal credit you might receive. Some people, such as those with \u00a316,000 or more in savings, are not eligible.\nOthers may find what they receive depends on their circumstances, including any income their family has, as well as housing and childcare costs.\nIt usually takes five weeks from the date of claiming to receiving a first payment, although an advance loan may be possible.\nAn application for universal credit may put a stop to any tax credits you receive, even if it proves to be unsuccessful.\nYou may be able to claim a reduction in council tax when on universal credit, and get help with childcare costs. There is also support to pay the rent, which works in different ways across the UK. \nIn time, there may also be assistance in paying the mortgage, although there are some strict criteria involved.\nThe main benefit for anyone losing their job after a period in work is new-style jobseeker's allowance (JSA).\nThis is worth \u00a359.20 a week, if you are under 25, or \u00a374.70 a week if you are 25 or over.\nYou can get this for up to six months and it will be paid into your bank, building society, or credit union account every two weeks. Unlike universal credit, your partner's or spouse's income will not affect your claim.\nYou may be able to claim new-style JSA as well as universal credit.\nUniversal credit may not be appropriate or available for everyone. Claiming it can affect other benefits, and it is vital to get some advice - available for free - before applying.\nPlaces offering guidance on this and other benefits questions include:\nHow will you be affected by this?

      "tags": "Chiltern Railways,Patisserie Valerie,Marylebone,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A rail company has begun an internal investigation after staff allegedly held a surprise baby shower in a closed Patisserie Valerie bakery at London's Marylebone station during lockdown.\nChiltern Railways workers told BBC News up to 20 colleagues, including some who were on shift, attended the gathering.\nThey claim some party-goers then had positive Covid tests, forcing most of the team to self-isolate.\nChiltern said \"appropriate action\" would be taken after its investigation.\nMembers of Chiltern Railways customer services staff based at the station told BBC News that about 30 people had been invited to the baby shower on the afternoon of 23 November - both via WhatsApp before the alleged gathering, and face to face on the day of the event.\nA national coronavirus lockdown was in place in England in November, so people were banned from meeting anyone indoors who was not part of their household.\nOne worker, David [not his real name], said he declined an invitation to the event but walked past the bakery later in his shift to see about 20 colleagues gathered inside.\nHe said he was \"shocked and alarmed\" to see people hugging each other, with most of them not wearing masks.\nPhotos of the alleged gathering, seen by the BBC, show a table inside a Patisserie Valerie outlet covered with dozens of cupcakes, mince pies, crisps and sandwiches, bunting saying \"it's a boy!\" and handmade flags reading \"happy baby shower\".\nOne photo appears to show a group of eight colleagues posing in front of the table of party food, without socially distancing from one another.\nSome images were shared on Instagram on 23 November with the caption: \"What a lovely surprise being thrown a baby shower at work today!\"\nA Patisserie Valerie spokesman said the company had not been informed of any such event and that none of its team members had access to the Marylebone station cafe, which has remained closed since March due to Covid restrictions.\nHe added it was normal for a member of station staff to have keys to the premises for \"security reasons\".\nDavid and another colleague claimed three people who allegedly attended the event tested positive over the following four days. \nThe positive tests meant 16 members of staff out of the team of about 26 people had to self-isolate for 14 days, David said.\nHe said colleagues who lived with, or cared for, vulnerable people were \"petrified\" to hear there had been a staff outbreak, with some \"scared to go home\" for fear of endangering loved ones.\nDavid added that he had been caring for his elderly grandmother so self-isolation was \"a real nightmare\" as he had to arrange alternative care for her.\nChiltern Railways confirmed a \"small number\" of workers tested positive for Covid or had to self-isolate in the 14-day period after 23 November, but a spokeswoman said \"none of the staff who were alleged to have attended [the baby shower] tested positive\".\nShe said Chiltern Railways was investigating and was \"making every effort\" to maintain a Covid-secure environment for staff and customers. \nIn an email seen by the BBC, which was sent to Chiltern Railways employees on 24 November, a manager said one team member had tested positive and added: \"It is disappointing that social distancing measures do not appear to have been followed and I will be investigating this further.\"\nDavid's colleague Peter (not his real name) said he was one of about 10 team members who had to work while the rest of the team was self-isolating.\nPeter said the outbreak left those at work feeling \"stretched\" and \"raised the anxiety levels of everyone\" as they worried they might have caught Covid as a result of having worked alongside the alleged party's attendees.\n\"A lot of us don't want to be at work during this time, for obvious reasons. We're doing a job where we do come into contact with a lot of people - it's stressful enough with your own family, who are a bit worried about you going in to work at a train station and asking if you're getting the proper protection,\" Peter said.\nHe added he felt \"demoralised\" to hear about the alleged party when he spends his shifts encouraging customers to wear masks and socially distance.\nThe Department for Transport said it had been made aware of the incident and had contacted Chiltern Railways for a \"full explanation\".\nA spokesman for the Office of Rail and Road - which protects the interests of rail and road users - said it had investigated \"an issue relating to Covid-19 concerns\" and had taken action, jointly with Westminster City Council, to \"ensure Chiltern Railways tightens its risk assessment for workers and to revise working arrangements\"."

      "tags": "Ministry of Justice,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Criminal justice system,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Four criminal justice watchdogs for England and Wales have warned they have \"grave concerns\" about the impact of court backlogs caused by the pandemic. \nThe inspectorates for policing, prisons, probation and prosecutions say issues it has caused could damage the criminal justice system for years. \nIt comes after figures revealed the backlog in the crown courts has reached 54,000 unheard cases. \nThat means some crimes from last year will not go before a jury before 2022. \nThe inspectorates say the unprecedented situation in the courts is having a ripple effect across all of criminal justice. \nCourt work slowed and, in the case of jury trials, stopped during the first part of the pandemic, when the lockdown advised people to stay at home, except for certain circumstances. \nWhile it has now crept back up, with social distancing measures in place, the watchdogs warn continuing delays will increase the likelihood of damage to the entire justice system. \nJustin Russell, the chief inspector of probation, said: \"Crown courts deal with the most serious cases, so this backlog concerns us all. The Covid-19 pandemic has meant severe delays and numerous cancellations throughout 2020, and this has had a negative impact on everyone involved.\n\"Delays mean victims must wait longer for cases to be heard. Some will withdraw support for prosecutions because they have lost faith in the process.\n\"Witnesses will find it difficult to recall events that took place many months ago, and prosecutors waste significant periods of time preparing for cases that do not go ahead.\"\nMPs will question Mr Russell and the other chief inspectors on their conclusions later on Tuesday. \nIn their report, the inspectors also found: \nAbout 65% of the Crown Court backlog - 27,700 cases - are believed to be trials. \nDelays worsened from the beginning of the UK pandemic because trials could not be safely held in court buildings, which often have very cramped conditions.\nToday, there are 410 courtrooms able to hear cases across 79 Crown Courts. Of those, only 290 are deemed safe to hold jury trials. That does not mean that all are able to be used at any one time. \nAt the Old Bailey, one large trial is taking up two courtrooms connected by a video link to meet Public Health England guidelines. The jurors are spread out and separated by plastic glass screens between each of them. Even then, trials can be delayed. The recent prosecution of men accused of smuggling Vietnamese migrants who died in a lorry was stopped twice as a juror had to isolate.\nMr Justice Edis, the senior judge who has worked on the arrangements, has praised court staff for the solutions they have found, including using portable buildings in car parks as Covid-safe jury rooms. \n\"We are now running fewer courtrooms than we could run in normal times if we had the funding to run all our courtrooms at the same time,\" he told the BBC.\n\"But the limits on capacity are not only funding. Limits on capacity are the physical capacity of the buildings, the size of the cells, the size of our docks and critically, the number of staff... Capacity in terms of physical court space, is probably about as good as it's going to get.\"\nWhile the court recovery plan has seen trials resume, some experts are predicting delays will still get worse. Crest Advisory, a crime and justice consultancy, argued last year that the government needs to double capacity. \nDetectives, lawyers and judges all know that the longer it takes a trial to be heard, the more likely something is to go wrong. Mr Justice Edis says that witnesses can simply forget what happened. And that concern, borne out of experience, is why one of the most important legal maxims is that \"justice delayed is justice denied\".\nDiana Fawcett, chief executive of Victim Support, said the watchdogs' report is damning for the prospects of anyone waiting for justice. \n\"For years, even before the pandemic, we knew first-hand from victims that the system wasn't working. Some victims face years of waiting while others have been told to pursue civil routes, for example applying for non-molestation orders. \nOne woman supported by the charity was the victim of domestic violence in the summer of 2019 - and she'd expected the trial to be in spring 2020. The case now won't be heard until spring 2022 - and the impact has been enormous. \nIn an open letter about her experiences, she said: \"The nightmares have increased in frequency and it is becoming very difficult to be able to enjoy anything,\" she wrote. \"I am so desperate to move on... I feel utterly powerless to do anything about it.\"\nHow has the justice system responded to the pandemic? \nBBC Radio 4's File on 4 hears stories from inside prisons where lawyers fear delays are creating miscarriages of justice. \nListen to Locked Up in Lockdown on BBC Sounds. \nThe Ministry of Justice insists that its courts recovery programme is having an effect. \n\"These efforts have allowed us to rapidly increase the use of video technology, establish 36 Nightingale courtrooms and prioritise urgent cases to protect the public,\" said a government spokesman. \n\"In recognition of the scale of the challenge we face, the government is investing \u00a3450m to boost recovery in the courts and deliver swifter justice, and this is already yielding results - the magistrates' backlog continues to fall and Crown Court cases reached pre-pandemic levels last month.\"\nBut shadow justice secretary David Lammy said: \"This damning report shows why the incompetent Conservative government cannot be trusted with the justice system, which it left vulnerable even before the pandemic began.\n \"Since the start of the coronavirus crisis, the Ministry of Justice has dithered and delayed.\""

      "text": "Jane works as an administrator for a private healthcare firm in Oxfordshire, a job she is expected to do from the office, even in lockdown. \nHowever, since she caught Covid-19 at work before Christmas, she has chosen to work from home because she feels safer - something that is causing problems with her boss.\n\"The office is so small and it is impossible to socially distance,\" she tells the BBC. \n\"My boss also didn't follow guidelines when I got ill and no one was told to isolate. It was so irresponsible.\"\nJane argues that her job, which is computer and phone-based, can be done easily from home. She feels that she is only following government guidelines. \nHowever, she says her boss wants her to come back in and she cannot hold out much longer: \"I have a mortgage to pay, I can't risk losing my home.\" \nUnder current lockdown restrictions, people across the UK who can work effectively from home should do so, including in areas such as healthcare.\nBut there are concerns that bosses are breaking Covid safety rules, with the head of the UK's unions calling for tougher enforcement.\nBetween 6 and 14 January, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) received 3,934 complaints relating to coronavirus and took enforcement action in 81 cases. \nThat usually meant a verbal or written warning however, with only one company facing tougher action. \nPolicing can be a problem as well, as some workers fear reprisals if they speak up. \nGeorge says he works in the office of a construction firm where social distancing rules \"are ignored or undermined\". He is torn about whether to complain. \nHe and 10 close colleagues could all do their jobs easily from home - and did so during the first lockdown - but that is not an option this time, even though half of them are over 60, with two people in the high-risk category. \n\"I was given a template letter saying we are unable to work from home, despite all of us having done so easily for six months prior,\" he tells the BBC.\n\"There's only one way to report this internally and doing that clearly flags you for redundancy.\"\nHe says the situation forces you to \"weigh up having a job in the pandemic, or standing up for what you think is right\".  \nUnder current lockdown restrictions, people across the UK who can work effectively from home should do so. They should only travel to their workplace if they cannot do their job remotely.\nThis includes healthcare professionals, teachers, childcare providers, transport workers, people who work in construction or manufacturing, funeral directors, and essential retail workers.\nFor workplaces that remain open in England, employers must \"carry out an appropriate Covid-19 risk assessment\" to develop a \"specific\" strategy to stop the virus's spread.\nIn England, guidelines set out strict measures which employers must follow, such as minimising the number of unnecessary visits to the office, frequent cleaning of workspaces and ensuring that staff observe 2m (6ft) social distancing wherever possible.\nThere is similar guidance for employers across a range of sectors in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nRead more from our Explainers team here.\nThe HSE, which has done 33,000 site visits since March, told the BBC it continued to \"scale up\" its checks on employers. \nThe Trades Union Congress (TUC) wants the government to strengthen enforcement and give the HSE more resources. \nSome say nothing will change, unless the government changes the rules to ensure only people doing essential work go in. \nJohn (not his real name) from Gloucester is part of a team installing smart meters in people's homes for SSE, the energy company owned by Ovo. \nHe tells the BBC he doesn't feel safe doing the job, which requires him to go into five or six people's homes each day, usually for several hours at a time.\nAnd while he accepts his job cannot be done from home, he thinks energy suppliers should only be doing essential emergency work as they did during the first lockdown, not installing smart meters which are largely about improving energy efficiency.\n\"We all know the quickest way to spread a virus is contact,\" he tells the BBC, adding that he thinks staff like him should be furloughed. \n\"They have given us face coverings and gloves, but NHS staff wear high grade PPE and yet they are still dying.\" \nAn SSE spokeswoman said the safety and wellbeing of staff was its \"primary focus\" and that the firm was open to discussing furlough options with staff.\n\"We have created rigorous protocols for working in homes including the opportunity for both the engineer or customer to cancel an appointment, or abort a job, if they do not feel comfortable,\" she said. \nSteve, who spent the last three months working at a fulfilment warehouse in Stoke-on-Trent, says he was shocked by the disregard for coronavirus rules at the site.\nHe said social distancing was \"non-existent\", with people working \"side by side\", but when he complained the managers did nothing. \n\"They were more interested in getting the product out,\" he adds.\nHowever, he felt he had no choice but to keep working, even when he learned that someone in the warehouse canteen had come down with Covid. \nA spokesman for the government says it has worked with trade unions, businesses and medical experts to produce \"comprehensive Covid-secure guidance\", so that businesses permitted to remain open can do so safely: \"This is kept under review as our understanding of the virus develops.\""

      "text": "US President Donald Trump has made his farewell address before leaving office, saying: \"We did what we came to do - and so much more.\"\nIn a video posted on YouTube, he said he took on \"the tough battles, the hardest fights... because that's what you elected me to do\". \nMr Trump has still not fully accepted the result of last November's election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.\nMr Biden will be sworn in as president on Wednesday. \nIn his final hours in office, Mr Trump has issued dozens of pardons and commutations for people including Steve Bannon, his former advisor, who is facing fraud charges.\nOn the eve of his inauguration, Mr Biden led a national tribute to the 400,000 Americans who have died of Covid-19. \nAt sundown on Tuesday, 400 lights were illuminated in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC to honour those who have lost their lives to the disease. \nThe last two weeks of Mr Trump's term have been dominated by the fallout from the deadly riot on Capitol Hill, when a mob of his supporters stormed Congress, seeking to overturn the election result. \n\"Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans. It can never be tolerated,\" Mr Trump said in his video, in which he did not acknowledge his successor by name. \nMr Trump himself has been impeached for \"incitement of insurrection\" over the attack and will face trial in the Senate after he leaves office. If convicted, he could be barred from standing for public office. \nHe is the first president in US history to be impeached twice. At his first trial, he was cleared on charges relating to dealings with Ukraine by the majority from his own Republican Party. \nThe politically motivated violence has overshadowed the growing toll from the coronavirus pandemic, in which more than 400,000 Americans have died and 24 million have been infected. \nIn his message, Mr Trump said his administration built \"the greatest economy in the history of the world\". \nUS stock markets have rebounded from the coronavirus pandemic, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index up 42% in 2020, and the wider S&P 500 up 15%. \nHowever, the rest of the economy is facing more of a struggle. Employers cut jobs in December, ending a string of job gains. Retail sales have dropped in recent months, while jobless claims rise.\n\"Our agenda was not about right or left, it wasn't about Republican or Democrat, but about the good of a nation, and that means the whole nation,\" Mr Trump said. \nHe leaves office with an approval rating of 34%, the lowest of his presidency.\nDonald Trump, in his 20-minute pre-recorded farewell speech, said his administration did what it came to do and more. \nOne can debate the significance of his accomplishments - whether 400 miles (640km) of rebuilt border wall, tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks, confirmed judges, trade wars and modest Mid-East diplomatic agreements amount to much in the way of substantive achievement. \nBut at least in one way, his boast is certainly true. Trump ran for president in 2016 to shake up the existing political order. He campaigned as an outsider giving voice to those who distrusted the establishment and felt the system no longer worked for them.\n\"I took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices because that's what you elected me to do,\" he said. \nThe unrest and resentment that Trump rode to the White House crested and crashed on the US Capitol two weeks ago, leaving behind wreckage - literal and metaphorical - that will take time and effort to clear. \nAfter four years of shattered norms and traditions, of turning expectations of presidential behaviour on their head, Trump leaves US government changed - fundamentally and, perhaps, irreversibly. \nThat, at least, was a promise made and a promise kept. \nMr Biden and his wife Jill Biden left their home state of Delaware on Tuesday to return to Washington, where the incoming president served as a senator for 36 years before becoming vice-president to Barack Obama from 2008 to 2016. \n\"When I die, Delaware will be written on my heart,\" he said in an emotional farewell speech. \nOn Wednesday, he will go to the White House and then the Capitol for his inauguration at 12:00 (17:00 GMT). \nThis will be an inauguration like no other: Washington is under heavy security after the Capitol riots, with thousands of reserve soldiers from the National Guard deployed and metal fences around the White House. \nOnly a limited number of people will be allowed on to the National Mall to witness his swearing in - contrasting to the hundreds of thousands who usually attend. \nThe inauguration ceremony will feature performances by Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez. \nAmong those staying away will be Mr Trump. He flies to Florida on Wednesday morning - the first president to skip his successor's inauguration since Andrew Johnson in 1869. \nMr Trump had tried to organise a military send-off for himself, according to local media. But two senior officials told Defense One that no such farewell was being planned for the commander-in-chief.\nOn Tuesday he is scheduled to deliver an evening address on Covid from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC.\nHe is set to immediately reverse a number of Trump policies, scrapping the ban on travellers from some mainly Muslim countries and rejoining the Paris climate accord. \nHe will also focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border and issuing mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing.\nMr Biden will also cancel the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline on his first day in office, US media report.\nThe pipeline is projected to carry oil nearly 1,200 miles (1,900km) from the Canadian province of Alberta down to Nebraska, to join an existing pipeline. Environmentalists and Native American groups have fought the project for more than a decade.\nConfirmation hearings for Mr Biden's appointees begin later on Tuesday.\nCorrection 27 January 2021: This article described President Trump's approval rating on leaving office as a record low for a departing president and this has been amended to make clear that it was the lowest of his presidency."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "About one in 10 people across the UK tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies in December, roughly double the October figure, data has shown.\nEstimates from the Office for National Statistics suggest between 8% of people in Northern Ireland and 12% of people in England showed signs of past Covid infection. \nIn October, antibody positivity ranged from 2% to 7% around the UK.\nAnd 6,586 Covid deaths were registered in the UK in the week to 8 January.\nThat brings the total registered so far close to 96,000.\nNearly a quarter of deaths were people living in care homes - a disproportionate impact on a group of people which accounts for less than 1% of the population.\nBack in July, though, care home residents accounted for 40% of deaths. \nThe ONS regularly tests a representative sample of the population, both for current infection and for antibodies indicating a past infection.\nPeople taking part in the survey are tested whether or not they have had symptoms.\nThis is used to estimate how common both the virus and antibodies are in the population as a whole.  \nAntibodies are proteins in the blood which fight off specific infections.\nThey are developed if somebody catches an infection and their body fights it off, or if they have been vaccinated.  \nYorkshire and the Humber topped the chart with 17% of people having positive antibodies, followed by London.\nProf Lawrence Young, a virologist at Warwick Medical School, said: \"This study shows that infection with the Sars-Cov-2 virus is much more widespread in the UK than previously realised, with around 1 in 10 people estimated to have been infected by December 2020. \n\"The implications are that infection rates increased significantly between November and December.\"\nBut Scotland had a considerably smaller growth in antibodies than the rest of the UK, rising from 7% to 9% of the population. \nIn December:\nThe fact that more people show signs of having at least some protection against Covid-19 is consistent with the dramatic rise in infections during that period. \nBut we know that antibodies from natural infection can fade.\nIn England, the ONS said, positive antibody tests equated to 5.4 million people aged over 16 having signs of past infection. \nThat does not tell you the total number of people infected, however, but acts as a snapshot in time.\nIn London, about 16% of people had antibodies in December, up from 11% in October. But at the last peak in May, an estimated 15% of the population had antibodies. This proportion fell, as detectable antibodies recede with time. \nExactly what this means for someone's likelihood to become infected again, however, is not fully known. \nIt also remains to be seen how long vaccines will protect people for, before they need a booster jab. \nBut Public Health England data suggests natural immunity provides at least five months' protection on average, and vaccines often give better protection than natural immunity.\nMore than 4 million people in the UK have been given their first dose of the vaccine. \nProf Janet Lord, director of the Institute of Inflammation and Ageing at the University of Birmingham, urged caution among those who have already been vaccinated.\nAsked whether people who have received the jab can hug their children, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I would certainly advise not to do that at the moment because, as you probably know, with the vaccines they take several weeks before they are maximally effective.\n\"It's really important that people stay on their guard even if they've had that first vaccination.\" "

      "text": "The BBC has apologised for the original headline in its reporting of the death of the convicted murderer Phil Spector.\nThe former music producer died on Saturday at the age of 81, while serving a prison sentence for the murder of Lana Clarkson in 2003.\nThe first version on the breaking news story on the BBC News website carried the headline: \"Talented but flawed producer Phil Spector dies aged 81\".\nThe BBC said the headline \"did not meet our editorial standards\".\nThe text was quickly changed to: \"Pop producer jailed for murder dies at 81.\"\n\"This was changed within minutes and we also deleted a tweet that had gone out automatically with the original headline,\" a statement issued by the BBC read.\n\"We apologise for this error.\"\n\"Our coverage of the story across BBC News has been clear that Phil Spector was convicted of the murder of Lana Clarkson and had a long history of violence and abuse,\" it continued.\nSpector was convicted of murdering Clarkson, an actress, in 2009.\nHis death was confirmed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\nReacting to the original version of the BBC's story, pop star Lily Allen tweeted: \"Rolling eyes at all the journos deliberately downplaying Phil Spector being a murderer in their headlines, so everyone points this out while linking to their articles resulting in lots of clicks.\"\n\"He murdered Lana Clarkson\" posted Labour MP Apsana Begum. \"Unforgivable reporting.\"\n\"How about 'Murderer, Phil Spector dies aged 81'?\" offered author and historian Hallie Rubenhold.\nThe headline was also discussed on TV and radio programmes on Monday, including Loose Women and Radio 4's Woman's Hour, and prompted an article in the Guardian.\nThe phrasing of the BBC's article - and others like it -  were \"a reflection of how a man's 'genius' is often viewed as more important than a woman's humanity,\" said columnist Arwa Mahdawi.\nSpector, who transformed pop with his \"wall of sound\" recordings, worked with The Beatles, The Righteous Brothers and Tina Turner.\nBut after the commercial failure of Tina Turner's River Deep, Mountain High, he largely withdrew from public life, and entered a long decline, marked by erratic behaviour, heavy drinking, and a fondness for guns.\nHis turbulent marriage to Ronettes singer Veronica Bennett, known as Ronnie Spector, ended in divorce.\n\"Unfortunately Phil was not able to live and function outside of the recording studio,\" she wrote after his death was announced. \"Darkness set in, many lives were damaged.\"\nSinger Darlene Love, who sang on several songs Spector produced, said he \"changed the sound of rock 'n' roll\" but likened their relationship to \"a bad marriage\".\n\"The problem I have with Phil is that he wanted to control Darlene Love's talent,\" she told Variety. \"If he couldn't do that, he was going to do everything in his power to keep my talent from shining.\"\nWeeks before Lana Clarkson was shot dead, Spector gave a rare interview to British broadsheet The Telegraph.\n\"I would say I'm probably relatively insane, to an extent,\" he told the paper, adding that he had \"devils inside that fight me\".\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Welsh government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Wales' health minister has denied Covid-19 vaccines are being held back. \nVaughan Gething was reacting to First Minister Mark Drakeford's comments the supply\u00a0had to last until February\u00a0to prevent \"vaccinators standing around with nothing to do\". \nIn a later tweet, Mr Drakeford said \"nobody is holding back vaccines\",  but the Conservative ex-Welsh secretary said his comments were \"astonishing\". \nMr Gething insists vaccines are being rolled out \"as quickly as possible\".\nAfter Mr Drakeford's comments on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the Welsh Government had said the reason for spacing out vaccine supply was to avoid wastage.\nAsked about those comments, Mr Gething said: \"We're rolling out the vaccination programme as quickly as possible.\n\"As the first minister's clarified tonight, we're not holding the vaccine back.\" \nPublic Health Wales said 151,737 people have been vaccinated, after at least 327,000 doses were delivered.\nMr Gething told BBC Wales Today: \"It's as quickly as we build our infrastructure to deliver, as quick as we're able to get the vaccines out to be delivered.\"\nBut former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said Mr Drakeford's comments had been \"astonishing\".\nThe Conservative MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire told Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales: \"I just find some of the excuses that have been made for why we are so behind in terms of vaccinating the over 80s - it just doesn't wash with our constituents I'm afraid\n\"When people in my constituency watch the television and they hear the first minister say 'this is not a sprint' when so many countries around the world are treating it exactly as that.\n\"The faster you roll out the vaccinations to the most vulnerable, ie the over 80s, the more lives that will be saved.\"\nOf the 327,000 delivered vaccines, 280,000 are the Pfizer-BioNTech type that has to be stored at -70C. \nA total of 4.8% of the population has been vaccinated in Wales, the same as in Scotland. This compares with 6.2% in England and 6.6% in Northern Ireland.\nAt the weekend the chairwoman of Wales' vaccination board Dr Gill Richardson, said the NHS was being supplied with as many vaccines as it could cope with.\nOn Monday, Mr Drakeford told the Today programme the supply of the Pfizer vaccine had to last until February and was not being used all at once.\n\"There will be no point, and certainly it will be logistically very damaging, to try to use all of that in the first week and then to have all our vaccinators standing around with nothing to do for another month,\" he said.\n\"The sensible thing to do is to use the vaccine you've got over the period that you've got it for so that your system can absorb it, they can go on working.\"\nIn a video he later posted on Twitter he said: \"Let me be completely clear, nobody is holding back vaccines. \n\"All our health boards are receiving doses of Pfizer as quickly as they can use it.\" \nThe British Medical Association (BMA) Wales tweeted it was \"extremely concerned\" about \"spacing out the Pfizer vaccine to make it last until the next delivery\". \n\"If Pfizer vaccines are available, second dose must be given to HCWs [health care workers] within the maximum 42-day timeline and all remaining vaccinations for staff must be accelerated,\" it said.\nThe Welsh Government's vaccine strategy pledges everyone will be offered a jab by autumn.\nThe NHS is vaccinating people in order of clinical risk, largely based on age groups from old to young.\nAs the roll-out ramps up, vaccines in Wales will be given in mass vaccination centres, GP surgeries, mobile units - and on Friday, the first pharmacy gave the Covid jab.\nThe Welsh Government said on Monday it was \"on course\" to complete 70% of vaccinations for over 80s and care home residents by the weekend.\nIt also confirmed that all ambulance staff had been offered the vaccine, and the ambulance service said so far more than 60% had had it.\nIn a statement, a government spokesman said: \"The Pfizer vaccine comes in large packs, which cannot be split and must be stored at ultra-low temperatures - at -70C. There are only two centres in Wales where we can keep them at this temperature. \n\"Once removed from storage, the vaccine lasts five days. Every dose wasted is a vaccine which cannot be given to someone in Wales.\n\"We want to ensure a consistent supply of the vaccine to minimise wastage.\"\nAt a coronavirus briefing on Monday, Education Minister Kirsty Williams also said ministers were not holding back on supplies.\n\"We are distributing Pfizer in a careful way to ensure there is infrastructure in Wales to deliver it safely and most efficiently, avoiding wastage because it is such a precious resource,\" she said.\nBut Paul Davies, Conservative group leader in the Senedd, said his inbox had been \"bombarded by people who are very, very angry\" about the pace of the roll-out.\n\"Suggesting that holding back the vaccine for a period of time so vaccinators aren't standing around doing nothing is absolutely preposterous,\" he said. \nWe've heard from two senior government ministers this morning - one of them the first minister - and received different explanations of what the strategy is for vaccine roll-out.\nThe first minister talked about having to make the Pfizer vaccine last until February, otherwise vaccinators would be standing around with nothing to do.\nHis education minister today denied that Welsh Government was doing anything to delay the use of the Pfizer vaccine - she talked about the need to go faster and to build up infrastructure and minimise wastage.\nPeople in vulnerable groups keen to know when they'll be receiving their jab won't be reassured by the lack of a coherent message.\nPlaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth MS said: \"Wales appears now to be dramatically behind England in terms of vaccine roll-out, so to see the first minister being relaxed about the slow pace of the vaccine roll-out here is very, very frustrating. Why are we rationing here?\" \nUK government vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi, when asked about the strategy in Wales, said his view for England was to use up supply and ensure it \"doesn't sit on a shelf or in a fridge\". \nThere are currently two approved vaccines being administered in Wales - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca.\nA third vaccine has been approved for use in the UK - made by US company Moderna - but supplies are not expected to arrive until spring.\nThere will be 35 mass vaccination centres across Wales but to ensure people - especially the elderly and those with mobility issues - can be inoculated where they live, about 250 GP practices across the country will be able to administer the jab by the end of January.\nMs Williams said that there would be 45 mass vaccination centres delivering the Pfizer jab by the end of the week.\nAs of Monday, the Cardiff and Vale health board said it had vaccinated more than 24,000 people, including nearly 19,000 health, social care and care home staff, nearly 600 care home residents and nearly 3,000 other people aged over 80.   \nCwm Taf Morgannwg health board in south Wales said it had vaccinated nearly 17,000 people as of Friday, and aimed to give all 100,000 people in the top priority groups at least a first dose by mid-February.\nThe Hywel Dda health board serving west Wales said on Monday it had given more than 18,000 vaccinations, including jabs to 42% of healthcare workers, 38% of care home staff, 25% of care home residents and just under 9% of people over 80.\nPowys Teaching health board said letters should arrive by Tuesday to everyone aged over 80 inviting them to get a vaccination, with more than 7,000 people in the priority groups having received their first dose.\nThe Swansea Bay board said it was \"on target\" to vaccinate all care home residents with a first dose by the end of January and that all over-80s would be offered a vaccine \"over the coming weeks\"\nIn north Wales, the Betsi Cadwaladr board said it aimed to vaccinate 90% of the priority groups by the end of January.\nIn south east Wales, the Aneurin Bevan board's most recent update from 11 January said that in its 94 care homes for elderly people all residents had been vaccinated in 34 homes and all staff in 63."

      "text": " Britain's climate change leadership is being undercut by a government decision to allow a new coal mine in Cumbria, MPs have warned.\nThe UK is hosting a UN climate summit in November, where it will urge other nations to phase out fossil fuels.\nThe MPs say the government's decision to allow a new colliery at home will make it harder to secure a deal.\nThe Woodhouse mine was approved by Cumbria County Council because it will create jobs in an area of high unemployment.\nThe planning minister Robert Jenrick could have overruled it, but said the issue was best decided at a local level.\nThat verdict was derided by environmentalists, who pointed out that climate change from fossil fuel burning is a global problem.\nAlok Sharma, who is leading the COP26 climate summit and who co-ordinates UK policies on climate change, was asked by the Commons business select committee whether the mine approval was \"an embarrassment\". He replied: \"I take your point\".\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the committee there was a \"slight tension\" between approving the mine, near Whitehaven, and broader attempts to clean up the economy.\nBut he said ministers decided to allow the pit because it will produce coking coal for steel-making, which otherwise would have to be imported. \nHe said: \"There's a slight tension between the decision to open this mine and our avowed intention to take coal off the grid\u2026 there was a debate in the government about what we could do about this, but this was a local planning decision. \n\"If we don't have sources of coking coal in the UK we would be importing those anyway\".\nThis appears to run counter to advice from the Climate Change Committee which has said all coal - including coking coal - should be phased out by 2035. Doubts have been raised about investors in the mine being left with a \"stranded asset\" if the pit is forced to close on climate grounds.\nThe mine approval is even more poignant because the UK founded the 'Powering Past Coal Alliance\" - a global club to persuade nations to leave coal in the ground. \nA source close to the Alliance secretariat told BBC News that staff were enraged by the decision. They believed the decision had been made to help secure so-called \"Red Wall\" votes in areas which previously voted Labour .\nMohamed Adow, from a pressure group, Powershift Africa, told BBC News: \"It is quite bizarre that the UK government, in the year it hosts the biggest global climate talks since the signing of the Paris Agreement, has approved a new coal mine.\"\nThe young campaigner Greta Thunberg said the decision showed pledges to achieve net zero emissions targets by 2050 \"basically mean nothing\".\nDarren Jones, chair of the business committee, told BBC News it would be hard for the UK to persuade countries like Poland to abandon coal whilst building a mine.\nHe argued that the government should have found another way to bring jobs to Cumbria. He said: \"Carbon-intensive industries are looking to the government for leadership on the transition to a green future. \n\"Backing coal at home doesn't look in line with the recent Energy White Paper and certainly makes our efforts to secure international agreement on ambitious decarbonisation harder to achieve.\"\nThe Environmental Audit Committee Chairman, Philip Dunne, told BBC News: \"If the UK is to achieve its ambition to be an environmental world leader, the government must offer clear guidance on how we can take every industry to net-zero, and offer a pipeline of investable projects. \n\"The steel sector needs to develop alternatives to importing coking coal. This could also support the next generation of green jobs - which are urgently needed.\"\nThe cross-bench peer Baroness Worthington told BBC News: \"This decision is real laziness of thinking from the government. Just think of signal it sends to all those countries who want to cling on to coal. \n\"The government doesn't yet have a cohesive strategy that makes sense. It's crazy. Absolute madness.\"\nFollow Roger on Twitter."

      "text": "Schools in England may reopen region by region after half term, the government's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries has said.\nSpeaking to the Commons education committee, Dr Harries suggested there would be different rates of infection across the country when lockdown ends.\nThis would mean a \"differential application\" of restrictive measures would be required, she said.\nSchools were closed at the start of January to stem the spread of Covid-19.\nAlthough schools remain open to vulnerable children and those of keyworkers, all others are due to learn remotely from home until after the February half term holiday.\nBut the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, has suggested they may not return fully then.\nA Department for Education spokesperson said the department was continuing to keep plans for the return to school under review and that it would inform schools, parents and pupils of the plans ahead of February half term.\nCommittee chairman Robert Halfon said he suspected schools would be closed for quite \"a few weeks yet\", but there has been no formal confirmation of this.\nMedical and science advisers were warning the government before Christmas that the NHS would not be able to manage the number of Covid-19 cases if schools remained open. \nThe new, more transmissible variant of the virus had been increasing exponentially in London and the south-east before Christmas. \nBut in some parts of the north  and north-east saw rates of increase were reducing.\nDr Harries said: \"It is highly likely that when we come out of this national lockdown we will not have consistent patterns of infection in our communities across the country.\n\"And therefore, as we had prior to the national lockdown, it may well be possible that we need to have some differential application.\"\nBut Dr Harries said schools would be at the top of the priority to ensure that the balance of education and wellbeing were \"right at the forefront\" of consideration.\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"Although the government intends that schools will fully reopen after the February half-term holiday, it is clearly in the balance when this happens and whether there will be any sort of regional approach. \n\"We expect that it will depend on coronavirus infection rates and the pressure on the NHS, and that the government will make a call on this issue nearer the time. \n\"What is important is that when schools fully reopen, everything possible is done to keep them open and to keep disruption to a minimum. \n\"This is why we are calling for education staff to be prioritised for vaccinations as soon as possible, and for schools to be given more support in the use of rapid turnaround mass testing.\"\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said if the government was planning to stagger opening of schools by region, it needed to \"provide clarity sooner rather than later\".\n\"This will give vital time to prepare for a smoother reopening of schools and business,\" he said.\nOn calls for vaccination of teachers, Dr Harries suggested the safe re-opening of schools did not depend on this.\nBut members of the committee suggested education would be less disrupted by teachers needing to go home and isolate when infected.\nThe vaccination programme had been worked out in order of vulnerability to the disease, she stressed.\nAnd Dr Harries added that although pupils could and did transmit the virus, she did not have evidence of them being \"a significant driver\" of \"large-scale community infections\"."

      "text": "Scotland's Covid-19 lockdown has been extended until at least the middle of February, with most school pupils to continue learning from home.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs that transmission of the virus appeared to be declining but was still too high to ease restrictions.\nBut she hopes schools will be able to at least begin a phased return to the classroom in the middle of next month. \nThe level four restrictions have been in place since Boxing Day. \nMeanwhile the islands of Barra and Vatersay are being moved into the top level of restrictions due to a \"significant outbreak\" there.\nThe current restrictions, which have closed non-essential shops and seen a \"stay at home\" message put down in law, had been due to expire at the end of this month. \nBut Scottish government ministers agreed they should be extended after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning.\nMs Sturgeon told MSPs that lockdown was \"beginning to have an impact\" on the number of new infections, but said Scotland remained in a \"very precarious position\".\nShe added: \"We need to be realistic that any improvement we are seeing is down, at this stage, to the fact that we are staying at home and reducing our interactions.\n\"Any relaxation of lockdown while case numbers, even though they might be declining, nevertheless remain very high, could quickly send the situation into reverse.\"\nThe announcement came as 1,165 new cases of Covid-19 were registered in Scotland, representing 11.1% of tests carried out.\nA total of 1,989 people are in hospital with the virus while a further 71 deaths of people who recently tested positive have been logged.\nMs Sturgeon said there was \"real and severe\" pressure on health services, with around 30% more patients in hospital than at the peak of the first wave in April 2020, and that this was \"almost certain to rise for a further period yet\".\nSchool buildings and nurseries have been closed to most pupils since the start of term, with all but the children of some key workers and vulnerable pupils learning from home.\nNot only will schools remain closed to most pupils until at least mid-February, they are unlikely to return to normal at that point.\nThe first minister has indicated that her aim is to begin a phased return, if coronavirus allows. So what might that mean?\nThe groups that will get back into class first are likely to include secondary school exam year pupils, the youngest primary school children and those in P7 getting ready to move to high school.\nFor others, online learning is likely to last a bit longer.\nBoth the return to school and the continuation of the wider lockdown will be reviewed again in a fortnight on 2 Feb. \nBy that week, first doses of vaccine should have been offered to all over 80s in Scotland as well as frontline NHS and social care staff and care home residents.\nWith only 15-20% of the over 80s reached so far, opposition parties think the programme is slipping behind schedule, which the first minister denies.\nMs Sturgeon said she knew how \"challenging and stressful\" home schooling was for families, but said community transmission was \"too high\" to allow a safe return to classrooms.\nShe said: \"If it is at all possible, as I very much hope it will be, to begin even a phased return to in-school learning in mid-February, we will.\n\"But I also have to be straight with families and say that it is simply too early to be sure about whether and to what extent this will be possible.\"\nStatistics released on Monday showed that Scotland had vaccinated 6% of its adult population so far - the same percentage as Wales, but lower than the 8% that have been vaccinated in England and 8.7% in Northern Ireland. \nEngland has also given a second dose of the vaccine to 427,386 people, compared to only 3,698 in Scotland.\nMs Sturgeon said approximately 100,000 people were being vaccinated per week in Scotland, and that health teams were \"on track\" to expand this to 400,000 per week by the end of February.\nMore than 90% of care home residents have now been given a first dose, along with 70% of care home staff and 70% of all frontline health and care workers.\nThe first minister said the focus on care homes - where it is \"time consuming and labour intensive\" to give out jabs -  was \"why overall figures are at this stage lower than in England\", where more over-80s have received the vaccine.\nShe said the \"pace of progress in the over-80s group is also now picking up\", and that the government remained on track to hit its target of completing everyone on the priority list by early May.\nScottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said the Scottish government were \"lagging behind their own targets\" on vaccination, saying the focus on care homes \"doesn't explain how slowly the vaccine is reaching GP surgeries and the public\".\nShe read out a series of letters from elderly people who had not been contacted about getting a jab, saying they were \"anxious they don't get left behind\".\nMs Sturgeon said she would not apologise for \"prioritising the most vulnerable first\", saying all four UK nations were \"working to the same targets\".\nScottish Labour's interim leader Jackie Baillie asked if Ms Sturgeon was confident the government could hit its \"critical\" targets, saying GPs were still complaining about \"patchy\" distribution of vaccines.\nThe first minister replied that her government would hit its goals, saying it was \"always the intention\" to increase the pace of vaccination as infrastructure and supplies became available.\nThis would see care home residents, healthcare staff and all over-80s get a first dose by the start of February, with over-70s and those deemed \"extremely vulnerable\" by mid-February and all over-65s by the beginning of March."

      "text": "Most people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least five months, a study led by Public Health England shows.\nPast infection was linked to around a 83% lower risk of getting the virus, compared with those who had never had Covid-19, scientists found.\nBut experts warn some people do catch Covid-19 again - and can infect others.\nAnd officials stress people should follow the stay-at-home rules - whether or not they have had the virus.\nProf Susan Hopkins, who led the study, said the results were encouraging, suggesting immunity lasted longer than some people feared, but protection was by no means absolute. \nIt was particularly concerning some of those reinfected had high levels of the virus - even without symptoms - and were at risk of passing it on to others, she said.\n\"This means even if you believe you already had the disease and are protected, you can be reassured it is highly unlikely you will develop severe infections but there is still a risk that you could acquire an infection and transmit to others,\" she added.\n\"Now more than ever, it is vital we all stay at home to protect our health service and save lives.\"\nCovid immunity: Can you catch it twice?\nFrom June to November 2020, almost 21,000 healthcare workers across the UK were regularly tested to see whether they:\nOf those who had no antibodies to the virus, suggesting they may have never had it, 318 developed potential new infections within this timeframe.\nBut among the 6,614 with antibodies, this figure was just 44 potential new infections.\nResearchers received various different pieces of evidence suggesting these people had become re-infected - including new symptoms more than 90 days after their first infection, new positive swab tests and blood tests. \nSome tests are still being run and researchers say their results will be updated as they come in. \nScientists will continue to monitor the healthcare workers for 12 months to see how long immunity lasts. \nThey will also look closely at cases with the new variant - which was not widespread at the time of this first analysis - and observe the immunity of participants who receive the vaccine. \nDr Julian Tang, a virus expert at the University of Leicester, said the results were reassuring for healthcare workers.\n\"Having the vaccine after recovering from Covid-19 is not an issue... and will likely boost the natural immunity,\" he added.\n\"We also see this with the seasonal flu vaccine.\n\"So hopefully the results from this paper will reduce the anxiety of many healthcare-worker colleagues who have concerns about getting Covid-19 twice.\"\nIn other developments:"

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Welsh government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Wales' health minister has denied Covid-19 vaccines are being held back. \nVaughan Gething was reacting to First Minister Mark Drakeford's comments the supply\u00a0had to last until February\u00a0to prevent \"vaccinators standing around with nothing to do\". \nIn a later tweet, Mr Drakeford said \"nobody is holding back vaccines\",  but the Conservative ex-Welsh secretary said his comments were \"astonishing\". \nMr Gething insists vaccines are being rolled out \"as quickly as possible\".\nAfter Mr Drakeford's comments on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the Welsh Government had said the reason for spacing out vaccine supply was to avoid wastage.\nAsked about those comments, Mr Gething said: \"We're rolling out the vaccination programme as quickly as possible.\n\"As the first minister's clarified tonight, we're not holding the vaccine back.\" \nPublic Health Wales said 151,737 people have been vaccinated, after at least 327,000 doses were delivered.\nMr Gething told BBC Wales Today: \"It's as quickly as we build our infrastructure to deliver, as quick as we're able to get the vaccines out to be delivered.\"\nBut former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said Mr Drakeford's comments had been \"astonishing\".\nThe Conservative MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire told Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales: \"I just find some of the excuses that have been made for why we are so behind in terms of vaccinating the over 80s - it just doesn't wash with our constituents I'm afraid\n\"When people in my constituency watch the television and they hear the first minister say 'this is not a sprint' when so many countries around the world are treating it exactly as that.\n\"The faster you roll out the vaccinations to the most vulnerable, ie the over 80s, the more lives that will be saved.\"\nOf the 327,000 delivered vaccines, 280,000 are the Pfizer-BioNTech type that has to be stored at -70C. \nA total of 4.8% of the population has been vaccinated in Wales, the same as in Scotland. This compares with 6.2% in England and 6.6% in Northern Ireland.\nAt the weekend the chairwoman of Wales' vaccination board Dr Gill Richardson, said the NHS was being supplied with as many vaccines as it could cope with.\nOn Monday, Mr Drakeford told the Today programme the supply of the Pfizer vaccine had to last until February and was not being used all at once.\n\"There will be no point, and certainly it will be logistically very damaging, to try to use all of that in the first week and then to have all our vaccinators standing around with nothing to do for another month,\" he said.\n\"The sensible thing to do is to use the vaccine you've got over the period that you've got it for so that your system can absorb it, they can go on working.\"\nIn a video he later posted on Twitter he said: \"Let me be completely clear, nobody is holding back vaccines. \n\"All our health boards are receiving doses of Pfizer as quickly as they can use it.\" \nThe British Medical Association (BMA) Wales tweeted it was \"extremely concerned\" about \"spacing out the Pfizer vaccine to make it last until the next delivery\". \n\"If Pfizer vaccines are available, second dose must be given to HCWs [health care workers] within the maximum 42-day timeline and all remaining vaccinations for staff must be accelerated,\" it said.\nThe Welsh Government's vaccine strategy pledges everyone will be offered a jab by autumn.\nThe NHS is vaccinating people in order of clinical risk, largely based on age groups from old to young.\nAs the roll-out ramps up, vaccines in Wales will be given in mass vaccination centres, GP surgeries, mobile units - and on Friday, the first pharmacy gave the Covid jab.\nThe Welsh Government said on Monday it was \"on course\" to complete 70% of vaccinations for over 80s and care home residents by the weekend.\nIt also confirmed that all ambulance staff had been offered the vaccine, and the ambulance service said so far more than 60% had had it.\nIn a statement, a government spokesman said: \"The Pfizer vaccine comes in large packs, which cannot be split and must be stored at ultra-low temperatures - at -70C. There are only two centres in Wales where we can keep them at this temperature. \n\"Once removed from storage, the vaccine lasts five days. Every dose wasted is a vaccine which cannot be given to someone in Wales.\n\"We want to ensure a consistent supply of the vaccine to minimise wastage.\"\nAt a coronavirus briefing on Monday, Education Minister Kirsty Williams also said ministers were not holding back on supplies.\n\"We are distributing Pfizer in a careful way to ensure there is infrastructure in Wales to deliver it safely and most efficiently, avoiding wastage because it is such a precious resource,\" she said.\nBut Paul Davies, Conservative group leader in the Senedd, said his inbox had been \"bombarded by people who are very, very angry\" about the pace of the roll-out.\n\"Suggesting that holding back the vaccine for a period of time so vaccinators aren't standing around doing nothing is absolutely preposterous,\" he said. \nWe've heard from two senior government ministers this morning - one of them the first minister - and received different explanations of what the strategy is for vaccine roll-out.\nThe first minister talked about having to make the Pfizer vaccine last until February, otherwise vaccinators would be standing around with nothing to do.\nHis education minister today denied that Welsh Government was doing anything to delay the use of the Pfizer vaccine - she talked about the need to go faster and to build up infrastructure and minimise wastage.\nPeople in vulnerable groups keen to know when they'll be receiving their jab won't be reassured by the lack of a coherent message.\nPlaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth MS said: \"Wales appears now to be dramatically behind England in terms of vaccine roll-out, so to see the first minister being relaxed about the slow pace of the vaccine roll-out here is very, very frustrating. Why are we rationing here?\" \nUK government vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi, when asked about the strategy in Wales, said his view for England was to use up supply and ensure it \"doesn't sit on a shelf or in a fridge\". \nThere are currently two approved vaccines being administered in Wales - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca.\nA third vaccine has been approved for use in the UK - made by US company Moderna - but supplies are not expected to arrive until spring.\nThere will be 35 mass vaccination centres across Wales but to ensure people - especially the elderly and those with mobility issues - can be inoculated where they live, about 250 GP practices across the country will be able to administer the jab by the end of January.\nMs Williams said that there would be 45 mass vaccination centres delivering the Pfizer jab by the end of the week.\nAs of Monday, the Cardiff and Vale health board said it had vaccinated more than 24,000 people, including nearly 19,000 health, social care and care home staff, nearly 600 care home residents and nearly 3,000 other people aged over 80.   \nCwm Taf Morgannwg health board in south Wales said it had vaccinated nearly 17,000 people as of Friday, and aimed to give all 100,000 people in the top priority groups at least a first dose by mid-February.\nThe Hywel Dda health board serving west Wales said on Monday it had given more than 18,000 vaccinations, including jabs to 42% of healthcare workers, 38% of care home staff, 25% of care home residents and just under 9% of people over 80.\nPowys Teaching health board said letters should arrive by Tuesday to everyone aged over 80 inviting them to get a vaccination, with more than 7,000 people in the priority groups having received their first dose.\nThe Swansea Bay board said it was \"on target\" to vaccinate all care home residents with a first dose by the end of January and that all over-80s would be offered a vaccine \"over the coming weeks\"\nIn north Wales, the Betsi Cadwaladr board said it aimed to vaccinate 90% of the priority groups by the end of January.\nIn south east Wales, the Aneurin Bevan board's most recent update from 11 January said that in its 94 care homes for elderly people all residents had been vaccinated in 34 homes and all staff in 63."

      "tags": "Hull,Mansfield,Sheffield,M1 motorway",
      "text": "A coroner has called for a review of smart motorways after an inquest heard the deaths of two men on a stretch of the M1 could have been avoided. \nJason Mercer, 44, and Alexandru Murgeanu, 22, died when Prezemyslaw Szuba crashed his lorry into their vehicles near Sheffield on 7 June 2019.\nCoroner David Urpeth said smart motorways without a hard shoulder carry \"an ongoing risk of future deaths\". \nHighways England said it was \"addressing many of the points raised\".\nMr Urpeth recorded a verdict of unlawful killing at Sheffield Town Hall. He added he would be writing to Highways England and the transport secretary asking for a review.\nThe inquest heard the deaths of the two men may have been avoided had there had been a hard shoulder. \nMore stories from around Yorkshire\nOn the stretch of the M1 where the crash took place, the hard shoulder has been replaced by an active lane. \nSzuba, 40, from Hull, was jailed last year after admitting causing their deaths by careless driving.\nHe was speaking from prison to the inquest.\nAnswering questions over the phone, Szuba told the hearing he accepted he was driving without paying proper attention. \n\"I have already accepted that at my trial,\" he said, but added: \"If there had been a hard shoulder on this bit of motorway, the collision would have been avoidable.\n\"I would have driven past these two cars as it would be safer and they would have been able to come home safely and I would be able to come back home.\"\nSzuba said he had only three to five seconds to react, and asked if he would have avoided the crash had he been paying attention, he said: \"It's difficult to say after everything now.\"\nSgt Mark Brady, who oversees major collision investigations for South Yorkshire Police, told the hearing: \"Had there been a hard shoulder, had Jason and Alexandru pulled on to the hard shoulder, my opinion is that Mr Szuba would have driven clean past them.\"\nBut he accepted the primary cause of the crash was Szuba's inattention to the road.\nThe crash happened after a collision between a Ford Focus driven by Mr Mercer, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and a Ford Transit driven by Mr Murgeanu, who was living in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, but was originally from Romania.\nWhen Mr Mercer and Mr Murgeanu got out to exchange details they were hit by the lorry, and both died at the scene.\nMr Mercer's wife Claire has campaigned against smart motorways since her husband's death, and was at the hearing on Monday.\nIn a statement, Highways England said it was \"determined\" to do everything it could to make roads as safe as possible and was already addressing many of the points raised by the coroner \"as published in the Government's Smart Motorway Evidence Stocktake and Action Plan of March 2020\". \n\"We will carefully consider any further comments raised by the coroner once we receive the report,\" it added.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he is self-isolating after being alerted by the UK's NHS Covid-19 app.\nThe West Suffolk MP said self-isolation was \"perhaps the most important part of all the social distancing\" and urged others to do the same if contacted.\nIn a tweet, Mr Hancock said he would be working from home until Sunday, adding \"we all have a part to play in getting this virus under control\".\nHe contracted coronavirus in March 2020 and suffered \"mild symptoms\".\nMr Hancock said he learned from the app he had been \"in close contact with somebody who's tested positive\" and so self-isolating was \"how we break the chains of transmission\".\n\"So you must follow these rules like I'm going to,\" he said. \"I've got to work from home for the next six days, and together, by doing this, by following this, and all the other panoply of rules that we've had to put in place, we can get through this and beat this virus.\"\nMr Hancock said he was alerted by the app on Monday night, having earlier led a Downing Street press conference alongside NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis and Public Health England's Dr Susan Hopkins.\nThe NHS app tells a person if they have been in close contact with someone who has later tested positive for coronavirus and tells them to isolate for 10 full days from their last contact.\nWhile it is not clear from Mr Hancock's statement if his isolation ends on Sunday or Monday, his period of quarantine suggests he was last in contact with the person who was infected on Wednesday or Thursday.\nDowning Street confirmed that Mr Hancock would not receive the vaccine early because he is leading the pandemic response.\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said: \"The PM and the rest of the cabinet will take the vaccine when it's their turn to do so based on the priority lists that have been published.\n\"We don't think it's right that the PM or other members of cabinet take the vaccine in place of somebody who is at higher clinical risk.\"\nIn March, the health secretary revealed he had tested positive for Covid-19 shortly after Prime Minister Boris Johnson had confirmed he too had the virus.\nWhile the health secretary recovered fairly swiftly, and was able to work from home during his illness, Mr Johnson required hospital treatment.\nSelf-isolation, which means staying at home and not leaving, is a legal requirement for anybody who has Covid symptoms, has tested positive for the virus, lives with someone who has symptoms, has arrived from abroad or has been contacted by NHS Test and Trace.\nIn December, the self-isolation period required was cut from 14 days to 10 days.\nUsing Bluetooth technology the NHS app makes contact between mobile phones when they are near each other, if an owner of a phone later tests positive for the virus and shares that with the app, alerts are sent to anyone who is deemed to have been a close contact."
