      "title": "Are the Conservatives keeping their election promises?",
      "tags": "Conservative Party,Climate change,Reality Check,Pensions,Conservative Party Conference",
      "text": "The Conservatives made a series of promises to voters in their 2019 election manifesto, which Boris Johnson campaigned on to win a big majority and become prime minister. \nAmid the upheaval created by the coronavirus pandemic, is the government on track to fulfil these key manifesto commitments?\nThe Conservatives promised this for England by March 2025. \nThe latest figures show there were 313,836 full-time equivalent NHS nurses and health visitors in September 2021. While that is up 17,743 since December 2019, it still leaves 32,257 full-time equivalent posts to fill over the next three-and-a-half years.\nOn GPs, there were 35,991 full-time equivalents in post in November 2021. That's up by 1,283 since December 2019.\nAnd if you exclude trainees and locums (doctors who temporarily fill a rota gap or who are not yet fully qualified), GP numbers have actually fallen by 72 since December 2019.\nBy either measure, an increase of 6,000 is a long way off.\nAsked about the target by the Health and Social Care Committee in November 2021, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"I definitely want to see that increase, but I am not going to pretend that we are on track when clearly we are not.\"\nThe Conservatives promised this for England and Wales by March 2023.\nThe latest figures, up to 31 December 2021, show an extra 11,048 police officers recruited. This is compared with 31 March 2019, the baseline the Home Office uses to track the 20,000 target. \nWith just over a year until the deadline, the government is more than half way to reaching its target.\nBut critics continue to point to the fact this does not compensate for the 20,545 officer reduction between March 2010 and March 2019 - under Conservative governments.\nThis promise was certainly achieved in a literal sense, as the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020. \nBritain departed from the EU's single market and customs union 11 months later, after agreeing a basic free trade deal with its neighbours. \nBut if the slogan implied Brexit would be done and dusted, this has clearly not happened. \nA huge amount remains unresolved. Disputes about Northern Ireland and fishing rights continue to fester. \nFrom food exporters to musicians who want to tour Europe, many people are still struggling to deal with new bureaucracy. \nAnd severe labour shortages in a number of industries have roots in the decision to cut ties with the EU.\nA large number of trade deals have been signed around the world to replace the ones the UK had in Europe, but the promise of a quick deal with the United States hasn't happened.\nSupporters of Brexit say sovereignty has been restored, and unwanted regulations can now be cut. But taking back control is still a work in progress.\nEU citizens wishing to live and work in the UK now have to apply via a points-based system (PBS), the same as citizens from the rest of the world.\nA visa is awarded if an applicant qualifies for a certain number of points. Having a job offer from an approved employer for a skilled job and being able to speak English provides 50 points, for example.\nBefore Brexit, these reforms were not possible because the UK was part of the EU single market, which gives citizens the freedom to live and work in all EU countries.\nThe process has not been all plain sailing. Leaving the EU single market is one of the factors that has contributed to the HGV driver shortage, because EU drivers can no longer come and go as they please. The government has had to introduce 5,000 temporary visas for this sector. \nBut the PBS is in place, as promised. \nThis decides how much the state pension increases each year, depending on which one of these is highest:\nIt was introduced in 2010, and the 2019 Conservative manifesto said it would stay for the duration of this Parliament.\nBut this promise was broken on 7 September when the government announced it was suspending the triple lock for a year. Instead of rising with average wages - the highest of the three measures - the government said pensions would rise by either inflation or 2.5% instead.\nIt said the unique situation of the pandemic justified the move.\nAt the start of pandemic, many people were placed on furlough, which meant they were earning less.\nNow, as people come off it and return to full pay, this has been recorded as a large rise in average earnings - up 8.3% between May and July compared with a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics. Under the triple lock, this would have meant a big rise in the state pension.\nThis promise has been broken. \nThe UK's annual aid budget has been reduced to 0.5% of GNI (gross national income) - a cut of about four billion pounds.\nAgain, the government blamed the pandemic - saying it had inflicted \"immense\" damage on the economy and cutting aid spending would help restore the public finances.\nIt says the 2015 legislation, which introduced the 0.7% target, refers to \"fiscal circumstances\" which governments may refer to, if they fail to meet it.\nSpending will return to 0.7%, the government says, but only when:\nBut some MPs have questioned when these tests will be met.\nThe promise on National Insurance (NI) has been broken. \nNI is a tax paid by workers on their earnings and on the profits of self-employed workers. Employers also pay extra NI contributions for staff.\nIn September 2021, the government announced that these groups will pay 1.25p more NI in the pound from April 2022. \nThe government says this will raise \u00a312bn a year, which will go initially towards easing pressure on the NHS.\nA proportion will then be moved into the social care system over the next three years. \nDefending the NI rise, Mr Johnson said the extra money would help with \"catastrophic [care] costs faced by millions of people up and down the country\". \nFrom April 2023, NI will return to its current rate, but the extra tax will stay as a new Health and Social Care Levy.\nNet zero is the point at which the country is taking as many climate-changing gases out of the atmosphere as it is putting into it.\nThe government has already taken some action, like continuing the move away from the use of coal and towards renewable energy. The sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned from 2030.\nIt has also set a target of reducing emissions (from 1990 levels) by 78% by 2035.\nThe independent Climate Change Committee said that the government had \"an achievable and affordable vision\" but added: \"further steps will need to follow quickly to implement the policies and proposals mapped out in the Net Zero Strategy if it is to be a success\".\nUpdate: This piece was published on 4 October 2021 (at the time of the Conservatives' party conference) and has been updated to reflect the latest figures on NHS staff and police recruitment.

      "tags": "UK economy,Fuel,Haulage",
      "text": "One in five forecourts in London and the south-east of England is still without fuel, the body that represents independent fuel sellers has said.\nThe Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there had been a \"marked improvement\" across the rest of the UK thanks to \"steady deliveries\".\nBut conditions in the South East are \"still challenging\", the PRA said.\nThe improvement in supplies has led to forecourt firm EG Group to remove its \u00a330 cap on buying fuel at its sites.\nIt said purchases were returning to normal levels in the majority of places, apart from the south of England.\nHowever, the company, which has about 400 sites in the UK, added it expected supply issues to ease \"in the coming days\" due to the military driving tankers to restore supplies.\nAbout 200 servicemen and women from the Army and RAF have been drafted in to deliver fuel from depots to forecourts.\nThe PRA said the situation around London and the South East was \"still challenging\". In these areas, it said 62% of the sites surveyed had both grades of fuel available, 18% had only one grade and 20% were dry.\nIn the rest of the country, the trade body said 86% of sites had both grades of fuel \"thanks to steady deliveries and stabilising demand\", with 6% having only one grade and 8% being dry.\n\"We are grateful for the support lent by the government through their provision of military drivers, although further action must be taken to address the needs of disproportionately affected areas,\" said Gordon Balmer, executive director of the PRA.\nThe PRA represents the interests of the independent filling stations across the UK, which account for nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,380 forecourts.\nThe government has been criticised for not deploying the military earlier after panic-buying led to chaos and queues on some petrol station forecourts.\nMore than 65 drivers will start work, with plans to increase this to 200 personnel to be deployed in total, including 100 drivers.\nThe drivers have undertaken refresher training with the fuel delivery firm, Hoyer in order to take on the work.\nHoyer said the training included company safety procedures as well as equipment familiarisation and forecourt driving manoeuvres. \nA government spokesperson said there were signs of improvement in average forecourt stocks across the UK, adding that demand was \"continuing to stabilise\".  \n\"More than half of those who have completed training to make fuel deliveries are being deployed to terminals serving London and the South-East of England, demonstrating that the sector is allocating drivers to areas most affected in this first phase from Monday,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe crisis began more than 10 days ago when BP said it had run out of petrol in a number of its outlets. That prompted motorists to fill up more than usual, leaving deliveries unable to keep up with demand. \nMany sectors of the UK economy, including food firms and petrol retailers, have been affected by a chronic shortage of lorry drivers, which the haulage industry has blamed on factors including Covid, Brexit, an aging workforce, and tax changes.\nDavid Charman, who runs Parkfoot Garage in West Malling in Kent, told the BBC's Today programme there was a big task ahead to restore supplies.\n\"This is not panic-buying anymore, this is people that have waited as long as they possibly can and now they have no fuel. We're having to push cars that are in the queue to get to our site because they've run out of fuel,\" he said.\n\"We didn't have the normal two days of stock underground... because of Covid but we were still managing the situation perfectly well. But now, when we're all empty, it needs a huge influx of fuel deliveries to everybody, not just to me, to ensure that we can get through this.\"\nAre you affected by issues covered in this story?

      "tags": "Companies,Media,United States,Broadcasting",
      "text": "In an about-turn, the scandal-hit US media firm Ozy Media has re-launched just days after it shut itself down.\nBoss Carlos Watson told broadcaster NBC that the firm was \"open for business\" again and this was its \"Lazarus moment\" - referring to the biblical character brought back to life by Jesus.  \nOzy shut on Friday after reports its co-founder had deceived potential investors during a conference call.\nMajor advertisers cut ties and its chairman Marc Lasry stepped down.\nOn Monday, Mr Watson told NBC that the previous week had been \"traumatic\" and \"heartbreaking\".\nHowever, he said the media firm had a change of heart: \"Over the weekend we spoke to advertising partners, we talked to our readers, our viewers our investors. \n\"I think Ozy is part of this moment. I think what we do... has a place.\"\nLaunched in California in 2013, Ozy Media produces left-leaning podcasts, television series and events. The firm has won an Emmy for its work.\nIn late September, the New York Times reported that co-founder Samir Rao impersonated a senior leader at YouTube during a conference call with Goldman Sachs in February. At that point the investment bank was considering making a $40m investment in the media company.\nMr Rao reportedly claimed that Ozy's videos were highly popular on YouTube.\nAccording to the Times, the investors realised something was wrong and did not go through with the deal. Mr Watson later apologised and Mr Rao was allowed to stay at the firm. \nAmid growing scrutiny last week, Ozy began an internal investigation and Mr Rao took a leave of absence.\nIt prompted veteran journalist Katty Kay - who joined Ozy in June after 30 years at the BBC - to quit, followed by Mr Lasry. Ford and Ally Financial cut ties with the media firm, amongst other advertisers. \nMr Watson told NBC that what Mr Rao had done was \"sad\" and \"wrong\". \nHe accepted that it was a \"fair question\" as to whether people would be able to trust him again as chief executive. The latest scandal is just one in a long string of allegations that has emerged, including claims the firm inflated its audience figures. \nMr Watson said he had been given \"incredibly bad advice\" last week \"to go silent\", when he should have engaged with the press. \nAs a result, he said \"half truths\", inaccuracies and \"cheap shots\" were reported in the media and that Ozy was not a \"house of cards\".\nMr Watson added Ozy intended to \"own\" the mistakes that had come to light around its use of data and marketing. \nThe firm could struggle to get back on its feet. It has lost most of its staff and only two people are currently on its board - Mr Watson and Michael Moe, founder of the Silicon Valley investment company GSV Holdings, which backs Ozy.\nIn a statement, Ozy told the BBC it was reaching out to its team to encourage them to return. It added that its newsletters will resume this week and TV production at the end of the month. \nThe firm added that several advertising partners had expressed excitement about the firm re-launching and intended to meet with Ozy in the coming days to discuss \"next steps\".\nOzy spokesman Phil Singer told the BBC: \"The bottom line is that we hit a bump in the road, but are committed to getting past this moment and renewing our commitment to being the kind of media company that delivers amazing content about topics and people that are too often overlooked.\" "

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Boris Johnson,Fuel,Conservative Party Conference",
      "text": "Boris Johnson is \"not worried\" about the current jobs gap and rising prices in the UK, saying supply chains will sort themselves out \"rapidly\".\nThe PM told the BBC that the economy was facing the \"stresses and strains\" of a post-Covid recovery. \nBut he said the country was \"moving to a new approach\", with companies paying higher wages for UK workers, rather than relying on low paid immigration.\nAnd he claimed government schemes, like the hardship fund, would help people.\nMr Johnson also said he was not worried about inflation as he believed \"supply would match demand\". \nEarlier, the prime minister denied there was a crisis in the UK, despite a shortage of HGV drivers disrupting fuel deliveries and leaving some shelves empty, and a range of industries warning there was a lack of skilled workers as a result of both the pandemic and Brexit.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the country was at a \"turning point\" and the UK's \"world leading\" logistics industry would fix the issues.\nThe PM also said on BBC Breakfast that only 127 HGV drivers had applied for temporary visas offered by the government to help tackle the shortage. \nThe department for business said 27 drivers had been identified, but have not confirmed what the prime minister's number of 127 was referring to.\nThe Road Haulage Association said a three month visa \"simply wasn't attractive enough for European truckers to give up their current jobs for a short term contract - perhaps only weeks long -  with all the hassle, including short term rents, that would be involved.\"\nIn an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg at the Conservative Party conference, Mr Johnson was asked about appeals from industry for help to fill vacancies and concerns from the public about prices - in a week when a weekly \u00a320 top-up to universal credit claimed by 5.8 million people is due to end.\nHe said the government was \"giving all the protections that we can\" to consumers through schemes like the winter hardship fund and increasing the warm homes allowance. \nBut he focused on the UK moving away from the \"tired, failed approach\" of relying on low skilled and low paid workers from abroad, saying the long term effects would be higher wages, better working conditions and a rise in productivity. \nThe PM added: \"Some people who have been writing to me maybe worried about this, but I'm not worried about this because, actually, I think it will be good for their businesses to invest in people.\"\nLaura Kuenssberg raised the issue of public sector staff, saying 2.5 million people were dealing with pay freezes rather than reaping the benefits of any wage rises.\nBut Mr Johnson said the government had \"done everything we can to increase people's pay\" but \"times have been very, very tight\".\nHe added: \"What you have got to do as the government is look at the long term, and look at how you can make the investments now that will bear down on costs.\"\nBoris Johnson says he's \"not worried\" about the squeeze on supply chains, labour shortages or inflation. \nHe's trying to use this moment to argue that what we are seeing is merely the birth pangs of a new economic model.\nBut talk to some of his colleagues - some of whom made their own warnings about specific economic pinch points before the summer - and you don't quite hear the same. \nWhen the prime minister displays a disregard for Westminster's conventions or politesse it's one thing. \nBut running the risk of looking like you don't understand everyday concerns is another. \nThe polls right now suggest that the government is not being punished for queues at the pump or empty shelves. \nJohnson loyalists credit his political appeal that seems to defy natural gravity. \nBut if prices continue to creep up and disruption continues, those feelings could turn.\nDowning Street is in a bullish mood, but confidence can tip into complacency - a sentiment that few voters would reward. \nRead more from Laura here.\nMr Johnson said companies in control of supplying goods will \"manage\" any issues, rather than the government \"stepping in to patch and mend every bit of our supply chains\".\nHe added: \"The government can't magic-up changes to their systems overnight.\n\"People need to recognise that we can't simply continue with models which have basically held this country back and held our economy back.\"\nAnd when it came to inflation - the rate at which prices are rising - Mr Johnson dismissed the worries of some economists.\n\"I think that people have been worried about inflation for a long time [but] it hasn't materialised,\" he said. \n\"What you're seeing stresses and strains that are caused by the global economy coming back to life and supply will match demand.\""

      "text": "Police officers have \"routinely\" taken people to hospital in the back of police vehicles because an ambulance was unavailable, it has been claimed.\nThe Scottish Police Federation (SPF) said officers were having to help relieve strain on under-pressure ambulance crews.\nIt has provided records to Scottish social affairs magazine, 1919, on about 30 incidents in the past three months.\nThe Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) has denied the claims.\nLast month, the military was called in to help drive ambulances in a bid to ease the \"unprecedented\" pressure on the NHS.\nSAS chief executive Pauline Howie said at the time the impact of Covid had placed the service at its \"highest level of escalation\".\nThe Scottish Police Federation said police reports show that officers stepped in to help when: \nAnother report records that a single paramedic dealing with an injured man asked police to drive his vehicles so he could continue treating the patient en route to hospital. \nAnd in another incident a family concerned about a relative contacted their GP and ambulance service, but were told to call the police instead. Officers took him to hospital. \nGordon Forsyth, of the SPF, said: \"Cops out there are taking people to hospital in the back of police cars simply because the ambulance is going to be hours, or there isn't anybody suitable to leave the person with and stand down.\n\"I've got a list of 30-odd examples, various things where the cops have been sent to calls because an ambulance hasn't been available, or having to wait for a significant period of time for an ambulance to get there.\"\nIn a statement to 1919, the ambulance service said police officers were only requested to attend cardiac arrest calls as a first response in the north of Scotland and they were immediately backed up by an ambulance resource.\nSAS said: \"In no other situation would police officers attend ambulance 999 calls or be asked to transport patients to hospital\".\nIn a statement to BBC Scotland, Police Scotland referred to comments made by Chief Constable Iain Livingstone to a meeting of the Scottish Police Authority Board last week.\nMr Livingstone said policing was \"so often the service of first and last resort\" and officers would \"never step away from those who are in crisis\".\nHe said: \"I recognise the pressures which exist across many other services, agencies and sectors. We know that when the health service, local authorities and other key partners come under significant strain, demand is diverted to policing. \n\"Additionally, delays in service provision by other agencies also mean officers and staff can spend longer dealing with an incident than would otherwise be the case.\n\"Covid is still with us and the global pandemic continues to put the National Health Service under critical pressure.\""

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nFunding for healthy lifestyle support - such as stop-smoking and obesity clinics - has reduced by a quarter in six years in England, research suggests. The Health Foundation says councils got \u00a33.3bn to run these services this year - \u00a31bn less than in 2015-16, once inflation is taken into account. The charity says such services are key, given the pandemic is likely to have worsened a situation meaning people in the poorest areas can expect to live nearly 20 fewer years in good health than those in wealthier areas.\nThe effect of the pandemic on the car market is revealed in trade body figures showing new car registrations fell to their lowest levels in September for more than two decades. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders says it represents a 35% drop compared with the same period in September 2020. Falling car production has been blamed on an ongoing global shortage of computer chips.\nThe Covid pandemic has left dental practices with severe backlogs of patients needing appointments, and dentists are saying they are being forced to take on more private work to survive. BBC Look East gauges the frustration of dentists and patients alike, including Danielle Watts who - finding herself unable to get help with her receding gums - ended up pulling out 11 teeth herself.\nThe charity that organises Manchester Pride saw its income drop by \u00a32.5m in 2020, after the festival was moved entirely online due to Covid-19. The organisation's accounts show an 85% dip in revenue, largely due to the postponement of the in-person \"celebration of LGBTQ+ life\", which was replaced by a virtual event. Its annual parade, which sees floats and performers travel through the city, was cancelled for a second year in July over concerns it could not run in accordance with Covid rules.\nThe Senedd in Wales will vote later on whether to back compulsory Covid passes for large events and nightclubs from 11 October. Labour ministers need the support of at least one opposition member to enact the plans, which would require passes to show if someone is fully vaccinated or has recently tested negative. The Night Time Industries Association, which represents 100 venues in Wales, said venues cannot afford the extra resources and logistical challenge.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nIf you're worried about your finances after the temporary \u00a320 uplift in Universal Credit is withdrawn, find out what other help might be available.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "The number of pupils absent from England's state schools rose by two-thirds to 204,000 in the fortnight to Thursday, 30 September.\nDepartment for Education figures show 2.5% of pupils were out of school for Covid-related reasons on this day.\nThe figures are the second batch of fortnightly statistics to be published since schools returned with much reduced Covid safety mitigations.\nThe government said it was trying to maximise time spent in the classroom.\nOverall, one in 10 pupils were absent, for Covid-related and other reasons, but in secondary schools, one in seven or 13.7% of pupils were out of school.\nAbsence rates in the autumn before the Covid pandemic were more like 4.5%.\nThe DfE says its measures strike a balance between protecting health and allowing young people to experience normality.\nA spokesperson said: \"We are working with parents and school and college staff to maximise students' time in the classroom - encouraging uptake of testing and the vaccine for 12-15-year-olds, and contracting specialist attendance advisers to work on strategies to improve attendance where problems are identified.\n\"If there are particularly high Covid case rates in a school or college, local directors of public health may advise they reintroduce additional temporary measures such as increased testing or face coverings - but face-to-face education should be prioritised.\" \nThey added that attendance advisers were being recruited to work with some local authorities and trusts to support their approach to attendance.\nUnder the current rules, neither close contacts of confirmed Covid cases nor bubble groups have to go home and isolate - only those pupils who test positive.\nNonetheless, teachers have been warning anecdotally of further disruption to education as case numbers in schools continue to rise.\nThe DfE statistics showed:\nIt looks like a normal scene in a school playground - pupils arriving with their heavy rucksacks and friends chatting in little groups.\nBut behind the apparent normality at Honley High School, in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, as in many schools, Covid cases are rising fast. Between the first week of term and the third, cases rose eightfold, to 156.\n\"It feels like a normal school again,\" Deputy head teacher Liz Lord says. \"But at the same time, we're dealing with, unfortunately, a rise in the number of Covid cases. \n\"It causes concern and it causes worry. The number of school Covid cases is higher than it was in the summer.\n\"But it hasn't got the same level of disruption, because we're not sending kids around the person who is ill home to self-isolate any more.\" \nRead more: How are schools managing Covid?\nAssociation of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said he was writing urgently to new Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi to ask what action he would be taking.\n\"These grim statistics show a big increase in the number of pupils out of school as a result of the continuing havoc caused by Coronavirus,\" he said. \n\"We are hearing from schools where there are 10% or more of pupils absent and where staff are also off work because of the virus. \n\"Teaching and learning is very difficult in these circumstances and it is clear that the educational disruption of the past 18 months is far from being over.\"\nThe National Association of Head Teachers is particularly concerned about the rule siblings of confirmed cases do not have to isolate.\nGeneral secretary Paul Whiteman said: \"School leaders want the government to revisit its guidance, particularly when it comes to contact tracing and self-isolation. \n\"No-one wants to see a child miss any time off school but there is a real risk that the current policy is inadvertently leading to more children missing school in the long run.\""

      "tags": "France,Brexit,Fishing industry",
      "text": "France has intensified pressure on the UK over post-Brexit fishing rights, warning bilateral co-operation could be at risk.\nThe government in Paris is angry that the UK granted 12 licences out of 47 bids for smaller vessels to fish in its territorial waters.\nFrench Prime Minister Jean Castex has accused the UK of not respecting its Brexit deal commitments on fishing.\n\"Britain does not respect its own signature,\" he told French MPs.\n\"Month after month, the UK presents new conditions and delays giving definitive licences... this cannot be tolerated.\" \nThe prime minister warned that all bilateral agreements with the UK could be at risk if the European Commission did not take a tougher stance on the UK government. No details were given, but the two countries have a raft of agreements covering defence, security and border controls as well as energy and trade.\nThe UK's Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has said the government's approach has been reasonable and fully in line with its commitments.\nSpeaking at the Conservative party conference, the UK's Brexit minister rejected French claims that the UK was in breach of the Brexit trade deal.\nLord Frost insisted that 98% of EU applications to fish in British waters had been granted, adding that the UK had been \"extremely generous\". \nThe Commission said it was in constant contact with UK authorities to ensure all licence applications were dealt with as soon as possible. \"The UK has published its methodology and we are now discussing the differences with the British and Jersey authorities regarding the rights of the boats involved.\"\nBBC Brussels correspondent Jessica Parker says there is little sense that the Commission is poised to act, with post-Brexit relations in a delicate state as the EU prepares solutions for fixing the controversial Northern Ireland Protocol.\nFresh tensions surfaced last week between Britain and France over post-Brexit fishing rights.\nFrance was infuriated last week by the relatively small number of licences granted to smaller vessels, when Sea Minister Annick Girardin spoke of French fishing being \"taken hostage\" for political ends. \nThe UK said it would consider further evidence to support remaining bids for fishing rights.\nFrance on Tuesday repeated its threat to cut the UK off from energy supplies. \nA UK government document in July said that 47% of the country's electricity imports were from France.\nFrench Europe Minister Cl\u00e9ment Beaune told Europe 1 radio: \"The UK depends on our energy exports, they think they can live alone while also beating up on Europe and, given that it doesn't work, they engage in aggressive one-upmanship.\"\nThe Channel island of Jersey became a flashpoint for tensions last May, when French fishermen staged a protest outside the port of St Helier and two Royal Navy ships were sent to patrol the area.\nAt the time Ms Girardin threatened to cut off Jersey's electricity supply - 95% of which is delivered by three underwater cables from France.\nFrench fishermen complained about being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences.\nUnder an agreement with the EU, French boat operators must show a history of fishing in the area to receive a licence for Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice."

      "text": "Boris Johnson is famous for looking publicly on the bright side. \nMaking people laugh, making people feel good, is part of what successful politicians do. \nHis optimism is what defines his public persona. It's also what fuels accusations that he isn't serious about the country's problems and would rather crack a joke than crack a problem. \nDon't doubt though for a moment that Boris Johnson is deadly serious about power and holding on to it. \nThere is concern in some corners of government, including among some cabinet ministers, that Number 10 is brushing away concerns about the economy too easily.\nIn our interview with the prime minister this morning he said he's \"not worried\" about the squeeze on supply chains, labour shortages or inflation. \nSpeaking earlier he said there was no crisis. And he's trying to use this moment to argue that what we are seeing are merely the birth pangs of a new economic model. \nBusiness will sort things out quickly, he believes, it's down to the market to fix it, rather than government to \"patch and mend\". \nBut talk to some of his colleagues, some of whom made their own warnings about specific economic pinch points before the summer, and you don't quite hear the same. \nWhen the prime minister displays a disregard for Westminster's conventions or politesse it's one thing. But running the risk of looking like you don't understand everyday concerns is another. \nThe polls right now suggest that the government is not being punished for queues at the pump or empty shelves. Johnson loyalists credit his political appeal that seems to defy natural gravity. But if prices continue to creep up and disruption continues, those feelings could turn. \nYou can't just tell people to cheer up if their gas bill is going up, their weekly shop costs more and they are losing \u00a320 a week from universal credit. \nAfter what they consider a successful first big foreign trip, and dominance in the polls, Downing Street is in a bullish mood. \nBut confidence can tip into complacency - a sentiment that few voters would reward.

      "text": "Fuel supplies to petrol stations in London and the south-east of England are improving but still remain behind the rest of the country, retailers say.\nThe Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said 64% of forecourts in those areas had both types of fuel compared to 86% of sites nationally.\nSupplies have increased in recent days after the military was deployed amid a shortage of fuel tanker drivers.\nThe government is offering 300 short-term visas to overseas lorry drivers.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said 127 foreign drivers had applied for visas aimed at tackling shortages, however, the Department for Business said only 27 drivers had been identified. It has not confirmed what Mr Johnson's number was referring to.\nThe Times reported that just 27 people from the European Union had applied to be tanker drivers. \nThe PRA, which represents independent forecourts across the UK, said \"steady deliveries and stabilising demand\" had led to improvements in stocks across the country.\nGordon Balmer, PRA executive director, said 15% of sites in London and the south-east of England still had no fuel, down from 20% on Monday.\n\"Whilst there has been a significant reduction in dry sites, these areas are still lagging behind in having both grades of fuel available compared to the rest of the UK,\" he said.\nNationally, the percentage of dry sites increased from 8% to 11% on Tuesday, the PRA said.\n\"Members are reporting they are now receiving deliveries from military drivers using commercial tankers, however further action must be taken to address the needs of disproportionately affected areas.\"\nBesides fuel drivers, the government is offering a further 4,700 temporary visas in total for foreign food lorry drivers, which will last from late October to the end of February, in an attempt to avoid other supply chain issues. It is not yet known how many people have applied to this scheme.\nMr Johnson said the slow rate of visa applications was a \"fascinating illustration of the problem\", which he added was a \"global\" issue, thought he admitted there was a \"particular problem in the UK\".\nHe said working in road haulage \"should be a great job\", but added that there had been an underinvestment in facilities and pay conditions. \nHe dismissed the suggestion that the problem was anything to do with Brexit. He noted the \"supply chain problem is linked to recovery\" and said other parts of the world were also affected.\n\"Imagine the UK has been in deep freeze and the pipes are unfreezing right now - stresses and strain of the economy waking up,\" Mr Johnson said.\nThe Road Haulage Association (RHA) said the small number of visa applications was the \"proof in the pudding\" that short-term visas were \"not going to be attractive\".\nA spokesman for the trade body said that for visas to be an attractive proposition to overseas lorry drivers, they needed to last 12 months.\n\"The reality is that we have to assume these drivers from abroad are already in employment elsewhere. If visas are only three months... it's unlikely there is going to be much take up,\" he added.\nLivia Spera, general secretary of the European Transport Workers' Federation, said she was \"not surprised\" drivers were not \"rushing to sign up for visas\".\n\"We already predicted and warned that short-term measures such as visas wouldn't work,\" she added.\nMs Spera said there was \"no quick fix\" to the problem. She said increasing driver wages and improving working conditions was the \"only answer to the crisis\".\nIn response to the prime minister's comments on roadside facilities, the RHA's Rod McKenzie said it was a \"false premise\" that a trade body could deal with the issue alone.\n\"The majority of hauliers are small companies, less than 10 lorries,\" he said. \"It requires government commitment to facilitate the development of commercial sites.\n\"Government departments however have consistently ignored industry calls to press for cleaner and safer facilities on our roads.\"\nTrade bodies have estimated the UK currently has a shortage of about 90,000 HGV drivers, which has been caused by several factors, including the coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and an ageing workforce.\nThe shortages have started to affect supply chains in recent months, with some supermarkets struggling to stock certain products and petrol stations being unable to stock enough fuel to meet demand.\nThe government has said temporary visas are not a long-term solution and has urged firms to invest in a UK workforce.\nMr Johnson said the UK economy could not \"go back to the failed model where you mainline low-wage, low-skilled labour\". \n\"It's time for investing in people and skills.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Car industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "New car registrations fell to their lowest levels in September for more than two decades, according to figures from the industry's trade body.\nThe Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said new registrations dropped 35% compared with the same month a year earlier.\nFalling car production has been blamed on an ongoing global shortage of computer chips.\nHowever, sales of electric cars are rising rapidly, the SMMT said. \nWhile the car market as a whole has suffered through the pandemic, more than 32,000 electric cars were registered last month, almost as many as registered in the whole of 2019.\nSeptember is usually a bumper month for car sales as the half-yearly change in number plates often attracts buyers.\nHowever, just 214,000 cars were sold in September - the lowest total for the month since the current registration system for Great Britain was introduced 23 years ago.\nLast year, new car registrations fell to their lowest level in nearly three decades due to falling production.\nAbout 1.63 million new cars were registered in 2020, compared with 2.3 million in 2019. The 29% decline was the biggest one-year fall since World War Two, when factories were turned over to military production.\nSMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said the latest figures showed a \"desperately disappointing September and further evidence of the ongoing impact of the Covid pandemic on the sector\".\n\"Despite strong demand for new vehicles over the summer, three successive months have been hit by stalled supply due to reduced semiconductor availability, especially from Asia.\"\nWhen lockdowns forced production lines to halt, microchip manufacturers diverted the chips that would normally go into new cars to the consumer electronics market, and supply is yet to fully recover.\nAlternative-powered cars remain the industry's bright spot, Mr Hawes said.\n\"The rocketing uptake of plug-in vehicles, especially battery electric cars, demonstrates the increasing demand for these new technologies. \n\"However, to meet our collective decarbonisation ambitions, we need to ensure all drivers can make the switch - not just those with private driveways - requiring a massive investment in public recharging infrastructure. Chargepoint roll-out must keep pace with the acceleration in plug-in vehicle registrations.\"\nSecond-hand car sales in the UK have more than doubled in recent months due to a shortage of new models.\nYear-on-year, the used car market grew 108.6% in the second quarter, with more than 2.2 million vehicles changing hands, according to the trade body. \nIncreased demand led to a rise in sales of older used cars, with only 12.7% of all vehicles sold being made within the last three years, the lowest on record.\nNew car sales are falling - while demand for used cars is rising. It's a question of availability.\nThe chip shortage has forced car makers around the world to curb production, and focus their efforts on particular models - those which are most profitable to make and sell.\nThe result is that waiting times for new cars have been getting longer. Scarcity is also pushing up prices, with discounts being slashed. That may well be deterring buyers.\nThe slump in sales is bad news for the industry overall - but higher prices could be good for the carmakers long term.\nCustomers, though, could have to get used to paying more."

      "text": "A fresh pay offer is expected to be made to ScotRail workers in a bid to end six months of industrial action, the Scottish government has said.\nThe rail operator has cancelled numerous services following a pay dispute with train conductors.\nScotRrail engineers have now also voted to take part in a series of strikes during Glasgow's COP26 event.\nHowever, the government said it was hopeful \"an appropriate and fair pay increase\" could be agreed.\nRail services across Scotland have been disrupted for months by industrial action, with disagreements over pay and planned cuts in the wake of reduced passenger numbers as a result of the pandemic. \nTransport Minister Graeme Dey told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the unions and management were being \"actively encouraged\" to seek a resolution.\nHe said: \"We need to step back from some of the rhetoric that has been dominating the agenda of late and focus on trying to get a suitable outcome to this.\n\"But we are in a challenging position, financially. To put this in perspective, prior to the pandemic we were spending circa \u00a31.1bn a year on Scotland's railways. We are currently spending north of \u00a31.5bn. That isn't sustainable, so we have got significant challenges.\"\nHe said the government was encouraging the company and staff to consider where efficiency savings could be made, in part, to fund a pay increase.\nHe added: \"I understand that later today the unions and ScotRail are meeting and a fresh offer is likely to be tabled. It's one I hope that the unions will view in the spirit that it is going to be made and consider settling these disputes.\"\nThe Unite union has said engineers will stage a series of strikes in the coming weeks due to the \"reckless\" actions of management at Abellio, the Dutch-based company which runs the ScotRail franchise.\nThe protest is also in response to \"the failure by Abellio ScotRail to make a meaningful pay offer\", despite repeated industrial action since 24 September, the union said.\nThe planned 24-hour strikes will take place between 18-19 October, 1-2 November, 10-11 November and 12-13 November.\nA number of rail depots, workplaces and stations will be affected by the strike action, including Glasgow Queen Street, Glasgow Central, Edinburgh Waverley and Perth.\nSeveral of the dates clash with the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow which will see world leaders in the city from 31 October to 12 November.\nUnite's engineering members at ScotRail voted by 78% in support of strike action in a 68.4% ballot turnout.\nMeanwhile, 92% supported taking industrial action short of a strike.\nPat McIlvogue, Unite's industrial officer, said: \"Unite has been left with no choice but to resolutely respond to the reckless behaviour displayed by Abellio ScotRail management.\"\nHe said that while discussions had been taking place, there had been no pay offer or movement by the company to date.\n\"The talks have been spun out and cynically used as a delaying tactic to avoid the national embarrassment of having strike action during the COP26 climate change conference which is being held in Glasgow.\n\"Well, these tactics have spectacularly backfired because our engineering members will now hold several 24-hour stoppages in the coming weeks.\"\nMr McIlvogue insisted that union members had made exhaustive attempts to engage Abellio ScotRail and called on the Scottish government to intervene to bring the dispute to an end.\nAbellio posted a pre-tax loss of \u00a364.5m in the 12 months to 31 March 2020.\nIn December 2019, the company was stripped of the contract to run ScotRail services by the Scottish government amid criticism of performance levels.\nThe Scottish government announced in April that the franchise would be taken over by a public sector body from the end of March next year.\nA ScotRail spokesman said it would \"continue to engage with the rail trade unions to find an agreement on pay and conditions\" but that the financial situation it faced was \"stark\".\nThe spokesman added: \"To build a more sustainable and greener railway for the future and reduce the burden on the taxpayer, we need to change.\n\"All of us in the railway - management, staff, trade unions, suppliers and government - need to work together to modernise the railway so that it is fit for the future.\""

I'm taking the opportunity to see it for myself. What a miracle,\" Shatner said in a statement.\nShatner will be joining three other people aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket for the company's second human spaceflight. \nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos joined the first crewed flight in July, along with his brother, an 82-year-old pioneer of the space race and an 18-year-old student. \nAs with the previous flight, the October voyage is expected to last about 10 minutes and will take the crew just beyond the Karman Line - the most widely recognised boundary of space which lies 100km (60 miles) above the Earth. \nBlue Origin said its vice president of mission and flight operations, Audrey Powers, would also be on board the flight, as well as a former Nasa engineer and the co-founder of a software company specialising in clinical research. \nA Canadian actor, Shatner famously played Captain James T Kirk of the USS Enterprise in the original Star Trek TV series in the 1960s, and later appeared in films of the franchise. \nReports in 2013 said he had turned down Sir Richard Branson's offer to fly him into space with Virgin Galactic - the billionaire's space travel company which took Sir Richard to the edge of space in July.\nSir Richard told The Sun newspaper at the time it was because Shatner has a fear of flying. But in 2011 the actor said he had turned down the offer because the billionaire allegedly wanted him to pay for the journey.\n\"He wanted me to go up and pay for it and I said: 'Hey, you pay me and I'll go up. I'll risk my life for a large sum of money.' But he didn't pick me up on my offer,\" Shatner told reporters.\nThe Star Trek star will not however be the first original cast member to leave the planet. \nLast year The Times revealed that the ashes of James Doohan, who played Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott, were smuggled on board the International Space Station in 2008, three years after Doohan's death.\nNew Shepard, built by Bezos' company Blue Origin, is designed to serve the burgeoning market for space tourism. \nDubbed \"NewSpace\", an increasing number of entrepreneurs are joining in the race to create cheap, commercialised space travel.\nBezos's Blue Origin hit headlines in recent days after 21 current and former employees claimed it had ignored safety concerns to gain an advantage in the space race, and complained of a culture of sexism. \nBlue Origin rejected the charges and said it stands by its safety record.

      "text": "A panel has called for a public inquiry to be held into institutions for unmarried mothers in Northern Ireland.\nThe three experts also advised that there should be immediate redress payments to survivors.\nThe devolved government committed to an investigation after research into mother-and-baby homes and Magdalene Laundries was published. \nWomen said they were detained against their will, used as unpaid labour and had to give up babies for adoption.\nThe primary recommendation in Tuesday's report is to establish an \"integrated investigation\" by a non-statutory independent panel, feeding into a statutory public inquiry.\nThere are also further recommendations for supporting measures to ensure that victims and survivors can participate in the investigation, including access to records legislation.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Health Minister Robin Swann are due to meet the panel on Tuesday evening.\nThey welcomed the report and added that the Northern Ireland Executive would consider the recommendations and \"next steps will be set out by the executive as soon as possible\".\nMr Givan said the issue was a priority for the executive.\n\"I would hope within the next number of weeks the executive will be in a position to take definitive decisions around what the next steps should be,\" he said. \nMs O'Neill said the report was \"another step forward for victims and survivors\", adding that she supported a full public enquiry. \n\"The barbaric way in which women and girls were treated over many decades is utterly shameful and a stain on our society,\" she said. \nThe Truth Recovery Design Panel recommends:\nThe panel, along with victims and survivors, called on \"all state, religious and other institutions, agencies, organisations and individuals complicit in the processes of institutionalisation and forced labour, family separation and adoption to act without delay in issuing unqualified apologies\".\nThey said that they should clearly state their role, \"accept responsibility for harms done; demonstrate sincerity in their apology; and demonstrate the safeguards now in place to ensure there will be no repetition of the inhumanity and suffering to which they contributed\".\nMaria Cogley, who was born in the Marianvale home in Belfast, told the BBC's Evening Extra programme that \"now is the time to take it [an inquiry] forwards\".\n\"This is the start,\" she said.\n\"Now we need the Department of Health and Robin Swann to sign this off as quickly as possible, in full, and the recommendations that are made today, in the report, that's the only way we're going to get the answers to the questions and shine some light on the truth.\"\nThe homes and laundries across the island of Ireland have in recent years come to the attention of United Nations (UN) human rights monitors. \nDr Lia Nadaraia, who sits on the UN's Committee Against Torture, and Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), told the BBC there was evidence of \"systematic torture and ill-treatment\".\n\"Girls and women were involuntarily detained, stripped of their identities, forced to work constantly, and not paid wages,\" she said. \nDr Nadaraia said any investigation should be aimed at uncovering the full truth about what happened in the institutions, bringing about prosecutions if possible, and providing financial redress for victims.\nThe Truth Recovery Design Panel, which was established by the Stormont Executive in March, has been working with survivors to come up with recommendations.\nThe three members are Professor Phil Scraton from Queen's University law school, Dr Maeve O'Rourke from the Irish Centre for Human Rights at the National University of Ireland (NUI) Galway, and Deirdre Mahon, executive director for social work at the Western Health Trust. \nProf Scraton said that \"lives and futures lost through the cruelty within these institutions cannot be recovered, but we must acknowledge the inter-generational pain and suffering inflicted on victims, survivors and families\".\nAt a press conference, Prof Scraton thanked the victims and survivors, and their families, but said that their pain \"will never, ever, be assuaged by whatever we do because this is one of the great scandals of our time\".\nDr O'Rourke said that any future investigation must be accessible to everyone involved, in particular those with disabilities.\n\"The key priorities raised by survivors and the relatives are that funding and resources should be sufficient to ensure effective and sustainable implementation of all the panel's recommendations; that the human rights of survivors and relatives are central to the recommendations' implementation; that all of the measures recommended must ensure full access for victims, survivors and relatives of the deceased to information,\" she said.\nThe research report, published in January, found at least 10,500 women passed through mother-and-baby homes. \nThere were eight institutions in Northern Ireland, run by Catholic and Protestant religious organisations.\nMore than 3,000 women spent time in a Magdalene Laundry.\nThese institutions were, in effect, workhouses, and were situated in Londonderry, Belfast, and Newry. \nThe researchers recommended there should be more investigations into levels of infant mortality among children who were born to mothers in the homes. \nThey also said there were more questions to be asked about potential illegal adoptions, including the movement of babies across the border with the Republic of Ireland. \nReligious orders, and the head of the Catholic Church in Ireland, Archbishop Eamon Martin, have said they will co-operate with the new investigation.\nThere has already been a state inquiry into mother-and-baby homes in the Republic of Ireland. \nCampaigners in Northern Ireland - including the survivors' group Birth Mothers and Their Children For Justice NI - have said the investigation must have the power to compel religious organisations and state agencies to provide records and witnesses.

      "text": "The Scottish government has announced a \u00a3300m funding package to help the health services get through the \"extremely challenging\" winter ahead.\nThe plan includes the hiring of extra support workers, cash for care at home services and a pay rise for care staff.\nHealth Secretary Humza Yousaf said it was \"vital\" to maximise the capacity of the NHS as winter approaches.\nBut opposition parties claimed the plans were a \"sticking plaster\" for a health service facing crisis.\nAnd the GMB union said the pay rise for social care staff did not go far enough, calling for a \"substantial\" increase in the basic rate of pay to \u00a315 per hour.\nScotland's health services are already under severe pressure in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, with demand \"extremely high\" and the NHS on an emergency footing.\nMr Yousaf warned MSPs that the NHS was \"under more pressure than it has been at any point in the pandemic\", adding that \"quite frankly it is likely to get worse\" in the coming months.\nThe minister announced a multi-year funding package worth more than \u00a3300m for hospital and community care services, which includes the recruitment of 1,000 additional support staff in the NHS.\nIt also includes \u00a340m for \"step down\" care, which enables hospital patients to temporarily move into care homes or get extra help at home, and \u00a360m to maximise the capacity of care at home services.\nSocial care workers will be given a pay rise to a minimum of \u00a310.02 per hour, while \u00a34m will be invested in \"staff wellbeing\" - with a focus on the physical and emotional needs of workers.\nMr Yousaf said the measures would help reduce delays in patient discharge from hospitals and reduce pressure on unpaid carers.\nHe said: \"This significant new investment will help get people the care they need as quickly as possible this winter. Bolstering the caring workforce by increasing their numbers, providing them with additional support, and increasing the wages of social care staff.\n\"Our NHS, social care staff and social work staff have been remarkable throughout the pandemic and today's additional investment will help support them to deliver care to people across Scotland this winter.\"\nThe GMB union said the promised pay rise \"isn't nearly enough\" to tackle an \"understaffing crisis in social care\".\nCalling for a \u00a315 per hour minimum, GMB Scotland Secretary Louise Gilmour said: \"To transform social care for the people who need it and the people who deliver it, particularly as we roll-out a national care service, then we must go further.\"\nAt Holyrood, opposition parties welcomed the extra funding but also said ministers must go further.\nScottish Conservative public health spokeswoman Sue Webber said there was a \"growing crisis\" in the NHS even before the winter, with long waiting times at A&E departments and queues at vaccination clinics.\n\"While I really welcome the \u00a3300m outlined today in investment in our NHS and comments around investing in our workforce, we continue to need to see urgent action now.\"\nMeanwhile Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie said the plan \"feels like a sticking plaster for a much more profound problem\".\nShe said supermarket checkout workers were paid more than social care staff, adding: \"You will not retain or recruit staff if you continue to pay the low wages.\""

      "title": "Pandora Papers: How leak is being reported around the world",
      "tags": "Russia,Pandora Papers ,Jordan,Ukraine",
      "text": "A huge leak of financial documents has put the spotlight on the hidden assets of some of the world's most powerful people.\nUnsurprisingly, the Pandora Papers have hit headlines worldwide. But what's the reporting like in some of the countries where leaders' financial dealings have been exposed?\nThe Pandora Papers revealed that King Abdullah II of Jordan secretly spent more than \u00a370m ($100m) on a property empire in the UK and US.\nBut stories on the leak were notably absent in Jordan where - observers say - local media censor themselves and avoid subjects that are implicitly off limits. \nOn Monday morning, the state-run Petra news agency, as well as the privately-owned Al-Ghad, Al-Dustour and Jordan Times newspapers, were all leading instead on the king's comments about democratic reforms in the country.\nThey were also prioritising stories about King Abdullah meeting the World Bank president, and his first phone call with Syria's President Bashar al-Assad since the start of the Syrian civil war a decade ago.\nLawyers for King Abdullah said he used his personal wealth to buy the homes and there was nothing improper about him using offshore firms to do so.\nThe palace also put out a statement saying that it was \"no secret\" that the king owned a number of properties abroad.\n\"Any allegations that link these private properties to public funds or assistance are baseless and deliberate attempts to distort facts,\" it said. \nThere was also deafening silence over the leak in much of the media in Kenya, where the family of President Uhuru Kenyatta were revealed to have secretly owned a network of offshore companies for decades.\nThe Star newspaper was leading with the story on its website, under the headline \"No evidence Kenyatta's stole state assets - Pandora Papers\". Others either did not cover it at all, or put the focus outside of Kenya. \nThe country's leading daily newspaper The Nation published a story written by a news agency with the headline \"Pandora Papers expose leaders' offshore millions\", using a picture of Jordan's king. The story included four lines about the Kenyattas. \nCitizen TV - the biggest TV station in Kenya - also published agency copy on its website, in which the revelations about Mr Kenyatta's family were at the end. \nThe Standard and The People Daily newspapers did not publish the findings on their websites. \nHowever, the leak was sparking a lot of conversation on social media in Kenya, with the hashtag #PandoraPapers and #client 13173 - the code name the Kenyattas were given by their asset managers - trending on Twitter. \nMr Kenyatta's family have not yet responded to requests for comment.\nThe leak linked Russian President Vladimir Putin to secret assets in Monaco.\nHowever, Russia's main Sunday evening TV news reviews made no mention of the allegations, which were published shortly before the programmes aired.\nThe Russian part of the investigation was published by the website Vazhnyye Istorii (Important Stories). The English-language Moscow Times news site had the Pandora Papers as its top story on Monday, with the headline: \"Leaked papers link Putin associates to offshore dealings\".\nRussian social media users have also been talking about the revelations. \nHowever a number of media outlets steered stories away from President Putin. The state-owned Gazprom-Media's NTV aired a brief report on the investigation on Monday morning, focusing on allegations against foreign officials, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \nMeanwhile, state news agency Tass highlighted findings related to the US being used as a tax haven.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday called the findings \"a collection of fairly groundless claims\". \nThe Pandora Papers revealed that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky transferred his stake in a secret offshore company just before he won the 2019 election.\nUkraine's Slidstvo.info website published an investigation based on the data obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and the English-language Kyiv Post had the findings as its top story with the headline: \"Pandora Papers reveal offshore holdings of Zelensky and his inner circle\". \nHowever, it was not a major story in most Ukrainian media.\nThe findings were widely discussed online, including in a number of blogs, with many arguing that the revelations would not affect Mr Zelensky's popularity. \nThe papers revealed that Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis - who is facing an election later this week - failed to declare an offshore investment company used to purchase two villas for \u00a312m in the south of France.\nThe findings were initially published by Investigace.cz, and then picked up by a number of media outlets, including the Pravo newspaper, which ran the story on its front page.\nMr Babis' denial of having done anything illegal was being widely reported on Monday. \nThe Novinky news site also quoted opposition figure Petr Fiala as calling for answers.\n\"Andrej Babis must prove that he used taxed money for the transaction. If not, he has no right to be in politics and take care of taxpayers' money,\" he said.\nBut despite the leak being widely covered, most media focus has remained on general election coverage. It is not clear whether the leak will have an impact on the outcome of the vote. \nThe leak found that Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan's inner circle, including cabinet ministers and their families, secretly own companies and trusts holding millions of dollars.\nAll of Pakistan's major newspapers covered the revelations.\nThe leak was discussed on Pakistan's Dunya TV talk show \"Think Tank\" on Sunday. The website of Dawn newspaper - the largest and oldest English-language newspaper in Pakistan - was leading on Monday with a number of stories about the Pandora Papers and the Pakistani findings. \nThe coverage has been met with cautious or defensive reactions from those who were named. \nMr Khan said his government would investigate all citizens mentioned in the report.\n\"We welcome the Pandora Papers exposing the ill-gotten wealth of elites, accumulated through tax evasion & corruption & laundered out to financial 'havens',\" he tweeted. \nThree presidents and 11 former presidents from Latin America have been mentioned in the investigation. One of them is Ecuador's Guillermo Lasso, a former banker, who replaced a Panamanian foundation that made monthly payments to his close family with a trust based in South Dakota, in the US, in 2017. \nReacting to the revelations, Mr Lasso said all his investments, in and out of Ecuador, were legal.\nThe news involving the president is the main headline on the website of newspaper Expreso, but many Ecuadorean outlets have given it little or no coverage.\nThe website of newspaper El Universo ran several items about the findings, including those related to the president. They also reported on the revelation that Spanish singer Julio Iglesias, a star in Latin America, has a \"property empire\" in Florida of an estimated value of up to $120m.\nAnother Latin American leader mentioned in the papers is Chile's President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, a billionaire businessman, who is accused of selling a copper and iron mine in an environmentally sensitive area to a childhood friend, as detailed in Spain's El Pa\u00eds newspaper.\nIn 2010, nine months after Mr Pi\u00f1era took office, his family sold their shares in the mine for $152m. Part of the deal took place in the British Virgin Islands.\nThe Chilean presidency said Mr Pi\u00f1era had no role in, or information about, the sale of the mining project, and that he had not been involved in the management of any company for more than 12 years. \nMany Chilean outlets are covering the leaks, with the website of newspaper La Naci\u00f3n giving a lot of prominence to local reaction, with Senator Manuel Jos\u00e9 Ossand\u00f3n, who belongs to the president's party, calling for an investigation.\nThe Pandora Papers showed that the law firm founded by Cyprus's President Nicos Anastasiades appears to have provided fake owners to disguise the real owner of a series of offshore companies - a former Russian politician who had been accused of embezzlement. \nThe findings were given prominent coverage on many Cypriot news sites, including the Greek-language Politis and Phileleftheros. \nMr Anastasiades told local media he had \"no knowledge\" of what the company was claimed to have done. The law firm has denied any wrongdoing. \nOther documents showed how Azerbaijan's ruling Aliyev family have secretly acquired UK property using offshore companies.\nThe files show how the family - long accused of corruption in the European nation - bought 17 properties, including a \u00a333m office block in London for the president's 11-year-old son, Heydar Aliyev.\nThe leak received little or no coverage in most of the country's media outlets. However, the daily Azerbaijani newspaper Azadliq - which is not accessible inside the country - was leading with the story on its website on Monday. \nThe findings related to British officials were widely reported in UK media. \nThe leaked documents showed how the former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, bought a London property in an offshore deal that saved them \u00a3312,000 in stamp duty.\nMrs Blair said the sellers had insisted the building was sold in this way but they had brought it under UK control. She said they would be liable to pay capital gains tax if they sell it.\nThey also showed how prominent Conservative Party donor Mohamed Amersi worked on a series of controversial deals for a Swedish telecoms company that was later fined \u00a3700m in a US prosecution. Mr Amersi denies any wrongdoing.\nThe Guardian and i newspapers both led with reports about the Pandora Papers on their front pages on Monday. \nBBC Monitoring contributed to this report. \nThe Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC which has led one of the the biggest ever global investigations.\nMore than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK.\nPandora Papers coverage: Follow reaction on Twitter using #PandoraPapers, in the BBC News app, or watch Panorama on the BBC iPlayer (UK viewers only)"

      "tags": "Apps,Microsoft",
      "text": "Windows 11, the latest version of Microsoft's computer operating system, launches worldwide on Tuesday as a free upgrade for Windows 10 users.\nWindows chief product officer Panos Panay, told the BBC the latest version was built to be \"clean and fresh and simpler\" for the user.\nHe promised that the new operating system would not be an \"extreme departure\" from what people know.\nAnd even the least tech-savvy users can upgrade easily, he added.\n\"I use the frame of my father - he's 89,\" Mr Panay said. \"I'm so excited for him to hit that button and upgrade, you have no idea. \n\"Not because he's my dad - because I just want it to be easy for him.\"\nHe said expert users had already tested it extensively through Window's Insider trial programme and was confident there would be no teething issues, adding the upgrade is \"ready now\".\nWindows 11 has some significant design changes, along with some alterations on how the system works under the hood. \nBy default, the Start menu is centred on screen, along with icons in the taskbar. When clicked on, the Start button opens a menu of frequently used apps.\nIn some ways, it mimics the appearance of a smartphone app menu or launcher. Microsoft has also dropped the \"tiles\" which were present on Windows 10's start menu.\nMr Panay said the team had learned from Windows 8, which got rid of the start menu entirely, upsetting many users.\n\"You learn from that, of course, and then you adapt,\" he said. \nDeveloping Windows 11's interface involved watching how people use their computers - \"what they want to click on, where their eyes are on the machine when they come into our labs,\" he explained. \n\"You get this confidence of learning from history,\" he added. \nFor Windows 11, \"the Start button is right there. It's right in the middle of the screen. It's not gone.\" \nWhen Windows 10 came out, Microsoft declared it would be the \"last version\" of the system. That has obviously changed.\n\"We're in a time where there is a bit of a new era for the PC happening right now,\" Mr Panay said.\n\"I think Windows 11 kind of stamps that moment and it is a signal for that moment.\"\nAcross the operating system, the design favours rounded corners, and has simplified most menus and folder views. And there are new, improved options for arranging windows and \"snapping\" them into grids. \nWidgets, a major selling point of 2007's Windows Vista, also make a comeback - but instead of \"floating\" on the screen where the user puts them, they live in a sidebar on the left, and are also linked to Microsoft services.\nSome changes go deeper than the interface and design. \nSystem integrations for Microsoft Teams - replacing Skype - and the Xbox app both feature heavily in Microsoft's advertising. \nThe Microsoft Store - the Windows version of an app store - has been completely redesigned and will allow third-party apps to sell inside it, without taking a substantial cut. \nAnd one new feature which raised eyebrows in the technology world was that Windows 11 would run Android smartphone apps through the Amazon app store. \nEarly adopters have reported that the in-built search function of the new version is significantly faster on most devices - but also that it favours Microsoft's own services, Bing and the Edge browser, when delivering web results. \nFor gamers, Microsoft promises that its new drive technology - Direct Storage - will lead to much better loading times in games by allowing a graphics card to access storage drives without going through the central processor. \nBut that feature, like some others, needs newer hardware to work. \nAs a result, not every computer will see all the potential advantages to upgrading - and some machines may not be able to upgrade at all. \nThe minimum requirements include a type of security chip - called a TPM - only installed on modern computers.  \n\"If your device does not meet these requirements, you may not be able to install Windows 11 on your device and might want to consider purchasing a new PC,\" Microsoft says. \nThe company has just launched a range of its own new hardware devices to coincide with the new Windows version. \nBut users already running Windows 10 do not need to go to this expense if the computer is still working. Windows 10 will continue to be supported and receive security updates until October 2025. "

      "title": "Lilly Hanrahan: Case review finds missed chances to check on killer",
      "tags": "Birmingham",
      "text": "Authorities' failure to share details about a man before he murdered a girl in his partner's care \"contributed\" to her death.\nThe Probation Service admitted error following a serious case review over toddler Lilly Hanrahan, killed in Birmingham in 2017.\nThe probe highlighted a catalogue of missed chances to check on killer Sean Sadler's presence in her life.\nSadler, 32, was jailed in March for at least 20 years.  \nBabysitting Lilly in the Northfield area of the city, he threw and violently shook her, causing a brain injury that led to her death.\nHe had also attacked the 21-month-old about a week before the fatal assault. \nBut despite authorities being aware of Lilly since her mother became unable to care for her, chances to monitor the adults in her life were missed, the review found.\nInformation about Sadler going unshared by the Probation Service was said by the investigation to be a key \"omission\". \nA Probation Service spokesperson has apologised for \"failure\" which she said \"contributed\" to Lilly's death. \nThe report, published on Tuesday, said Lilly had been hospitalised as a baby and, due to her mother's substance misuse, was placed in the care of her maternal grandmother.\nBut in 2016 the woman informed authorities she felt unable to manage the toddler.\nA special guardianship order (SGO) was made in September of that year, with another woman, unnamed in the report, appointed.\nHer first biological child was fathered by Sadler. During her assessment prior to appointment as guardian, she said there had been no contact with him since becoming pregnant.\nBy 2017, they were in a new relationship, with Sadler murdering Lilly in November of that year. \nThe SGO assessment, the review concluded, could have \"made inquiries of previous partners\" and \"also have explored [the guardian's] family dynamics more closely\", although the report added that had those components been completed, it was unlikely the SGO would not have been made.\nThe review found a catalogue of additional issues.\nHad a supervision order been in place, it concluded, there would have been a requirement for the guardian to inform the local authority about her new partner. \nSadler, the report added, had a history of mental health problems. Following a conviction for battery and criminal damage, he began to be supervised by the Probation Service, and in September 2017, two months before Lilly died, he disclosed he was in a new relationship with a woman whom he used to see when he was younger.\nBut, the report said, information about the risks posed by him was not shared by the Probation Service with the guardian or children's social services, as required by procedure.\n\"Had [the Probation Service] done so, Children's Social Care would have been alerted and safeguarding processes put in place,\" the review said. \nIt added: \"Indeed, this omission may well have had very serious consequences for Lilly, and may be the single omission that could have made a difference.\"\nAdditionally, notes from 25 January 2017 in the children's social work team suggested that visits were taking place to see Lilly and the guardian, but no records of those visits exist, and the case was closed on 22 March 2017.\nFrom October to 14 November 2017, Lilly's guardian and her nursery reported seeing bruises on her, but no safeguarding concerns were identified. \nTwo days later, Lilly was found collapsed, and died on 22 November.\nOf Lilly's guardian, the review said: \"She told us that she blames herself completely for the death of Lilly: that she should have been more suspicious of her then partner, should not have taken his word, should not have allowed him to babysit for Lilly, should have seen the pattern in the bruises.\n\"She also blames the police for not informing her about her then partner's convictions.\n\"In fact, probation had a duty to inform her. She said, that had she known, she would have immediately taken steps to distance herself from him.\"\nSarah Chand, head of West Midlands Probation Service, said:\"My heartfelt sympathies remain with Lilly's family and I would like to apologise to them for the failure by probation which contributed to her death.\n\"Since this horrific crime, we have recruited more staff, work more closely with social services and continue to conduct visits to offenders' homes to better protect children and partners from domestic violence.\" \nAndy Couldrick, chief executive of Birmingham Children's Trust, which manages children's care in the city, said the trust \"acknowledged\" the shortcomings in the report and offered its \"deepest\" condolences.\n\"In this case, services were involved for six months following the [SGO], and there were no issues or concerns being raised that suggested our involvement needed to continue,\" he said.\n\"When Mr Sadler became reattached to the family, children's services' involvement had ended. \n\"If children's services had been alerted by Probation, or by the services that were made aware of unexplained bruising to the child, then of course children's services would have become involved once more with the family.\"\nHe added the \"robustness and rigour\" of services, including support following the issuing of an SGO, had been improved.\nPenny Thompson CBE, independent chair of Birmingham Safeguarding Children Partnership, said Lilly's death was \"profoundly sad\". \nShe added: \"I offer condolences to her family and loved ones. I know they continue to feel her loss intensely.\"\nFollowing the review, she said she wanted to highlight the importance of adult-oriented services sharing information with those supporting children, and the importance of professionals having \"open and curious minds\". \nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Barking,LGBT",
      "text": "Inquests into the deaths of the victims of serial killer Stephen Port will be a key step in their families' \"quest for accountability\", their lawyer has said.\nBetween June 2014 and September 2015, Port murdered Anthony Walgate, 23, Gabriel Kovari, 22, Daniel Whitworth, 21, and Jack Taylor, 25.\nIn 2016, he was jailed for life after he was convicted of giving lethal doses of date rape drug GHB.\nThe Met Police has apologised for how it initially responded to the deaths.\nThe inquests will open later at Barking Town Hall, just yards from where the victims were given fatal overdoses.\nPort met his victims online, including through the dating app Grindr, before luring them to his flat where they were drugged and raped.\nThe first victim, Anthony Walgate, was found outside Port's flat and the other three either in or next to a nearby churchyard.\nThe families' lawyer Neil Hudgell said: \"Their families have felt every single day of their absence. They have waited with great patience and conducted themselves with real dignity.\n\"Yet, they've always wondered about whether there would have been a different outcome if the police had investigated Port properly and taken their concerns seriously, and if their boys hadn't been gay.\n\"For them, the inquests mark a key step in their quest for accountability.\"\nFollowing the court case, the Met Police offered an apology to the victims' families and highlighted changes the force had made, which included a written protocol for minimum standards of investigation for unexplained deaths.\nIt said the force had also given extra training to officers on how drugs could be used as a weapon by offenders to facilitate rape and sexual assault, as well as on issues that impact on the confidence of LGBT+ communities.\nCommander Jon Savell said: \"Our thoughts are firstly with the family and friends of those murdered by Stephen Port. We know this will be a painful and difficult time for them, hearing details once more of what happened to their loved ones.\"\nHe said the Met was offering \"every assistance\" to the coroner and welcomed a \"full examination of all the facts surrounding the tragic deaths\".\nHe said: \"At the time of Port's conviction, we apologised to the victims' families and Daniel Whitworth's partner for how we initially responded to the deaths, and I would like to apologise again.\"\nMr Savell added: \"It is extremely important to us that members of the LGBT+ communities trust the police and feel confident they are being provided with the best possible service.\" "

      "tags": "Policing,Violence against women,Sarah Everard murder",
      "text": "Met Police officer Wayne Couzens has been sentenced to a whole-life term for the murder of Sarah Everard, in a case that sparked national outrage and calls for more action to tackle violence against women. \nCouzens admitted the kidnap, rape and murder of the 33-year-old marketing executive when he appeared in court several months ago.\nBut it was only during his sentencing that the full details of his crimes emerged. \nMs Everard was walking home from a friend's house in Clapham, south London, at about 21:30 BST on 3 March when she was abducted. \nCouzens' choice of victim was random, but the attack was planned. \nIn his sentencing remarks, Lord Justice Fulford said there had been \"significant planning and premeditation\" by Couzens.\nThe police officer had \"long planned to carry out a violent sexual assault on a yet-to-be-selected victim\" who he intended to coerce into his custody, noted the judge. \nCouzens spent at least a month travelling to London from Deal, Kent, where he lived, to research how best to carry out his crimes. \nSeveral days before the attack, he booked a hire car, which he would use for the abduction, as well as a roll of self-adhesive film advertised as a carpet protector on Amazon.\nAfter finishing a 12-hour shift at the US embassy that morning, Couzens, a parliamentary and diplomatic protection officer, went out \"hunting\" for a lone, young woman to kidnap and rape, the prosecution said.\nThe court heard how Couzens used the knowledge he had gained from working on Covid patrols in January and his Metropolitan Police-issue warrant card to trick his victim under the guise of a fake arrest for breaching coronavirus guidelines. \nThe 48-year-old, who had been a police officer since 2002, handcuffed her before bundling her into the car and driving away. \nThe abduction was witnessed by a couple travelling past in a car - but they believed they had seen an undercover police officer carrying out a legitimate arrest, so did not intervene. \nThe whole kidnapping took less than five minutes.\nCouzens then drove to Dover in Kent, where he transferred Ms Everard to his own car, before travelling to a remote rural area nearby. \nIt was there that he raped and murdered his victim - strangling her with his police belt. \nBy 02:31 Couzens had left the scene and was spotted at a service station buying drinks. \nHe visited the site where Ms Everard's body was dumped twice, leaving just before dawn. \nThe next day, as the search for her escalated, Couzens bought petrol, which he used to burn her body inside a fridge. \nHe also purchased two green rubble bags, which he used to dump the remains in a pond near an area of woodland he owned in Hoads Wood, Ashford. \nA week after she disappeared, Ms Everard's body was found in a woodland stream, just metres from land owned by Couzens.\nMeanwhile, Couzens returned to normal life, carrying out mundane activities like calling a vet about his dog. \nDays later, he even took his wife and two children on a family trip to the woods where he had burnt his victim's body. \nHowever, on the 8 March, the day he was due to return to work, he reported in sick. \nThe following day he was arrested at his home in Deal.\nIn a brief police interview, he told a false story about being threatened by an Eastern European gang, claiming they had demanded he deliver \"another girl\" after he had underpaid a prostitute a few weeks before. He then claimed he kidnapped Ms Everard, drove out of London and handed her over to three men in a van in a layby in Kent, while she was alive and uninjured.\nBut after Ms Everard's body was discovered in a pond just 130 metres from land owned by Couzens, he was charged. \nCouzens has since been sacked by the Met, but the force is still facing questions over whether chances were missed to prevent his predatory behaviour. \nAfter Ms Everard's murder, the police watchdog announced it was probing alleged failures by the Met to investigate two indecent exposure incidents linked to Couzens in February. \nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct is also investigating alleged failures by Kent Police to investigate a flashing incident linked to Couzens in 2015. \nCouzens transferred to the Met in 2018, from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, where he had worked since 2011. \nTwo years later he began working for the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command as an authorised firearms officer at diplomatic premises around central London.\nIn July, appearing by video link from Belmarsh high security jail, Couzens pleaded guilty to murder at the Old Bailey. \nOn Wednesday he appeared in court again - this time in person - for a two-day sentencing hearing. \nThere, he faced Ms Everard's mother, father and sister, who described to the court the torment of losing their loved one in such horrendous circumstances. \nHer father, Jeremy, demanded that Couzens looked at him as he told the murderer he could never forgive him for taking away his daughter. \nHer mother, Susan, said she was \"tormented\" at the thought of what her \"precious little girl\" had endured. \n\"I go through the sequence of events. I wonder when she realised she was in mortal danger,\" she told the court. \n\"Burning her body was the final insult. It meant we could never again see her sweet face and never say goodbye.\n\"Our lives will never be the same. We should be a family of five, but now we are four. Her death leaves a yawning chasm in our lives that cannot be filled.\""

      "tags": "France,Catholic Church sexual abuse cases,Roman Catholic Church",
      "text": "Some 216,000 children - mostly boys - have been sexually abused by clergy in the French Catholic Church since 1950, a damning new inquiry has found.\nThe head of the inquiry said there were at least 2,900-3,200 abusers, and accused the Church of showing a \"cruel indifference towards the victims\".\nPope Francis \"felt pain\" on hearing about the inquiry's finding, a Vatican statement said.\nOne of those abused said it was time the Church reassessed its actions.\nFran\u00e7ois Devaux, who is also the founder of the victims' association La Parole Lib\u00e9r\u00e9e (Freed speech), said there had been a \"betrayal of trust, betrayal of morale, betrayal of children\". \nThe inquiry found the number of children abused in France could rise to 330,000, when taking into account abuses committed by lay members of the Church, such as teachers at Catholic schools.\nFor Mr Devaux it marked a turning point in France's history: \"You have finally given institutional recognition to victims of all the Church's responsibility - something that bishops and the Pope have not yet been prepared to do.\"\nAccording to the Vatican statement, the Pope learnt about the report after he met visiting French bishops in the last few days. \n\"His first thoughts are for the victims, with a deep sadness for their wounds and gratitude for their courage in coming forward,\" it read. \n\"His thoughts also turn to the Church in France, and that, in recognising these terrible events and united by the suffering of the Lord for his most vulnerable children, it can take the path of redemption.\"\nThe report's release follows a number of abuse claims and prosecutions against Catholic Church officials worldwide. \nThe independent inquiry was commissioned by the French Catholic Church in 2018. It spent more than two-and-a-half years combing through court, police and Church records and speaking to victims and witnesses.\nMost cases assessed by the inquiry are thought to be too old to prosecute under French law.\nThe report, which is nearly 2,500 pages long, said the \"vast majority\" of victims were boys, many of them aged between 10 and 13.\nIt said the Church had not only failed to prevent abuse but had also failed to report it, at times knowingly putting children in contact with predators.\n\"There was a whole bunch of negligence, of deficiency, of silence, an institutional cover-up,\" the head of the inquiry, Jean-Marc Sauv\u00e9, told reporters on Tuesday. \nHe said that until the early 2000s, the Church had shown \"deep, total and even cruel indifference\" towards victims.\n\"The victims are not believed, are not listened to. When they are listened to, they are considered to have perhaps contributed to what they had happen to them,\" he explained.\nHe added that sexual abuse within the Catholic Church continued to be a problem. \nWhile the commission found evidence of as many as 3,200 abusers - out of a total of 115,000 priests and other clerics - it said this was probably an underestimation. \n\"The Catholic Church is, after the circle of family and friends, the environment that has the highest prevalence of sexual violence,\" the report said.\nOlivier Savignac, head of victims association Parler et Revivre (Speak out and Live again), was abused at the age of 13 by the director of a Catholic holiday camp in the south of France.\nHe told the Associated Press news agency that before the abuse, he had thought of the priest as \"someone who was good, a caring person who would not harm me\".\n\"We keep this, it's like a growing cyst, it's like gangrene inside the victim's body and the victim's psyche,\" he said.\nThe inquiry found that about 60% of the men and women who were abused had gone on to \"encounter major problems in their emotional or sexual lives\".\nThis was over 70 years and more than half the cases were before 1970. But still - for many French this will be the moment they wake up to the sheer scale of the phenomenon of Church sexual abuse.  What was once anecdotal and prurient is suddenly a defining feature of society. \nThe burden of the report is that ad-hoc expressions of repentance and a bit of tinkering with ecclesiastical structures are no longer good enough.  \nThere has to be recognition that sexual abuse of youngsters by priests was systematic.  It was the Church - not rogue individuals - that was responsible.\nMany in the Church will be horrified by what they discover. Many will welcome the moment as a catharsis.  As Sister Veronique Margron, president of the Conference of Religious Orders, put it: \"If the Church must tremble, well let it tremble.\"\nOnly a handful of the cases covered by the inquiry had prompted any disciplinary action, let alone criminal prosecutions.\nBut while most cases are now too old to prosecute via the courts, the inquiry called on the Church to take responsibility for what happened, including by providing compensation to the victims. \nIt noted that while financial compensation would not address the trauma that victims had endured, it was \"nonetheless indispensable as it completes the recognition process\". \nIt also made a series of recommendations about how to prevent abuse, including training priests and other clerics, and fostering policies to recognise victims. \n\"We expect clear and concrete responses by the Church,\" a group of six victims' associations said.\nThe president of the Bishops' Conference of France, who co-requested the report, said the numbers of victims and their experiences were \"beyond what we could imagine\".\n\"I express my shame, my fear, my determination to act with them [the victims] so that the refusal to see, the refusal to hear, the desire to hide or mask the facts, the reluctance to denounce them publicly, disappears,\" Archbishop Eric de Moulins-Beaufort said. \nThe French Church has previously announced a plan for \"financial contributions\" to victims, beginning next year.\nEarlier this year, Pope Francis changed the Roman Catholic Church's laws to explicitly criminalise sexual abuse, in the biggest overhaul of the criminal code for nearly 40 years."

      "tags": "Tax haven,Pandora Papers ,FinCEN Files,Money laundering",
      "text": "The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents that reveals hidden wealth, tax avoidance and, in some cases, money laundering by some of the world's rich and powerful.\nMore than 600 journalists in 117 countries have been trawling through the files from 14 sources for months, finding stories that are being published this week.\nThe data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington DC, which has been working with more than 140 media organisations on its biggest ever global investigation.\nBBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK.\nThe Pandora Papers leak includes 6.4 million documents, almost three million images, more than a million emails and almost half-a-million spreadsheets.\nStories revealed so far include:\nThe files expose how some of the most powerful people in the world - including more than 330 politicians from 90 countries - use secret offshore companies to hide their wealth.\nLakshmi Kumar from US think-tank Global Financial Integrity explained that these people \"are able to funnel and siphon money away and hide it,\" often through the use of anonymous companies.\nThe Pandora Papers reveal complex networks of companies that are set up across borders, often resulting in hidden ownership of money and assets.\nFor example, someone may have a property in the UK, but own it via a chain of companies based in other countries, or \"offshore\".\nThese offshore countries or territories are where:\nThe destinations are often called tax havens or secrecy jurisdictions. There is no definitive list of tax havens, but the most well known destinations include British Overseas Territories such as the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands, as well as countries such as Switzerland and Singapore. \nLoopholes in the law allow people to legally avoid paying some taxes by moving their money or setting up companies in tax havens, but it is often seen as unethical. The UK government says tax avoidance \"involves operating within the letter, but not the spirit, of the law\".\nThere are also a number of legitimate reasons people may want to hold money and assets in different countries, such as protection from criminal attacks or guarding against unstable governments.\nAlthough having secretive offshore assets is not illegal, using a complex network of secret companies to move around money and assets is the perfect way to hide the proceeds of criminality.\nThere have been repeated calls for politicians to make it harder to avoid tax or hide assets, particularly following previous leaks such as the Panama Papers. \nBut Mr Ryle said the Pandora Papers show that \"the people that could end the secrecy offshore\u2026 are themselves benefiting from it. So there's no incentive for them to end it\".\nAll you need to do is set up a shell company in one of the countries or jurisdictions with high levels of secrecy. This is a company that exists in name only, with no staff or office.\nIt costs money though. Specialist firms are paid to set up and run shell companies on your behalf. These firms can provide an address and names of paid directors, therefore leaving no trail of who is ultimately behind the business.\nIt is impossible to say for sure, but estimates have ranged from $5.6 trillion to $32 trillion, according to the ICIJ. The International Monetary Fund has said the use of tax havens costs governments worldwide up to $600bn in lost taxes each year.\nMs Kumar said it is detrimental to the rest of society: \"The ability to hide money has a direct impact on your life... it affects your child's access to education, access to health, access to a home.\"\nThe UK has been criticised for allowing property to be owned by anonymous companies overseas. \nThe government published draft legislation in 2018 that would require the ultimate owners of UK properties to be declared. But it is still waiting to be presented to MPs.\nA 2019 parliamentary report said the UK system attracts people \"such as money launderers, who may wish to use property to conceal illicit funds\".\nIt said criminal investigations are often \"hindered\" because police cannot see who ultimately owns properties.\nThe government recently raised the risk of money laundering through property from \"medium\" to \"high\".\nIt says it's cracking down on money laundering with tougher laws and enforcement, and that it will introduce a register of offshore companies owning UK property when parliamentary time allows.\nThe Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations. More than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet.

      "text": "An inquiry will be launched into \"systematic failures\" that allowed Wayne Couzens to continue to be a police officer, Priti Patel announced. \nThe home secretary said the public \"have a right to know\" why he remained in the Metropolitan Police despite concerns about his behaviour.\nCouzens kidnapped, raped and murdered Sarah Everard while he was a serving officer, using his police warrant card.\nHe has since been linked to allegations of indecent exposure.\nThe Met has faced mounting questions over its policies and procedures in the wake of Ms Everard's murder.\nIt was revealed Couzens - who worked as an armed officer in the Met's parliamentary and diplomatic protection team - was linked to several alleged incidents of indecent exposure, including in the days before  Ms Everard's abduction in March.\nSpeaking at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, Ms Patel said: \"We need answers as to why this was allowed to happen.\n\"I can confirm today there will be an inquiry, to give the independent oversight needed, to ensure something like this can never happen again.\"\nThe Home Office said the inquiry would be in two parts, with the first examining Couzens' behaviour and establishing a definitive account of his conduct in the lead up to his conviction for Ms Everard's murder.\nIt said the second part would address specific issues, such as vetting procedures, standards, discipline and workplace behaviour. \nThe exact nature of the inquiry is still unclear.\nThe Home Office said it would initially be non-statutory but could be converted to a statutory one if required.\nIf statutory, the inquiry would have the legal power to call witnesses and limit the government's control over how it operated.\nThe person who would lead the inquiry and its terms of reference would be confirmed \"in due course\".\nPolicing minister Kit Malthouse pointed out the first option - a non-statutory inquiry - was much quicker to put in place but stressed it would not begin until the separate Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) inquiry was complete.\nOn BBC Radio 4's PM, he acknowledged his surprise on finding out that examining social media postings had only became a part of the police vetting procedure a year ago.\nThe modern world was moving fast, he said. The vetting \"net\" has to be as tight as possible, with a regard for recruits' right to privacy while ensuring they were \"the right people with the right values\", he added.\nJamie Klingler, co-founder of the campaign group Reclaim These Streets, set up after Sarah Everard's murder, insisted the inquiry needed to be statutory and judge-led - and needed to include women.\n\"It seems really specific about Wayne Couzens and not about the system that allowed a Wayne Couzens to happen,\" she told the BBC.\n\"It's not admitting that there is systemic misogyny within the force that allowed this to happen, and by not doing so it's pushing it under the carpet rather than exposing [it] at all levels.\"\nCouzens, 48, killed Ms Everard, 33, after stopping her on a street in Clapham, south London. He was sentenced to a whole-life prison term last week.\nSpeaking earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he did not support calls to make misogyny a hate crime, saying there was \"abundant\" existing legislation to tackle violence against women.\nHe told BBC Breakfast that \"widening the scope\" of what you ask the police to do would just increase the problem - but recruiting and promoting more female officers would help change the culture within forces.\nThere is an air of crisis in British policing as it faces a significant moment of reckoning.\nNever have leaders felt that public trust is so low they have had to advise women to consider fleeing if they are uncomfortable when confronted by one of their own officers.\nThis is the aftershock of the appalling crimes of Wayne Couzens, who kidnapped, raped and murdered Sarah Everard while working for the Metropolitan Police.\nDespite repeated attempts to force Home Secretary Priti Patel's hand, she has very publicly backed Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick by renewing her contract last month.\nBut questions now confront policing - and the difficulty its chiefs and ministers are having in answering them is why the crisis feels too deep.\nWas Couzens' ability to pull on the uniform a failure of the system?\nIs there a wider cultural problem?\nAnd how should police leaders and the government respond?\nRead more from Dominic here.\nMet Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick, who has rejected calls to resign, confirmed on Monday there would be a separate independent review into the force's standards and culture.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Dame Cressida said Ms Everard's murder had made \"everyone in the Met furious and we depend on public trust\".\n\"In this country policing is done by consent and undoubtedly the killing of Sarah and other events has damaged public trust,\" she said, adding she was determined to rebuild it.\nLabour's Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said it was important the inquiry looked at how allegations of violence against women and girls were handled by police officers, as well as Couzens' conduct and the culture within the police.\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan said the inquiry \"must leave no stone unturned\" and should address reports of \"widespread cultural issues\".\nSpeaking earlier at the Conservative Party conference, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said making communities safer and allowing women to walk home feeling safe at night was his \"number one priority\".\nThe Met Police said 650 more police officers would patrol hotspot areas in London over the next six months, with 150 of these working in local wards as \"Bobbies on the beat\".\nHave you been affected by issues covered in this story?

      "text": "A woman battling long Covid for 18 months has said she feels angry and frustrated at the lack of help in Northern Ireland.\nZoe McNulty, 27, from Londonderry feels people have been left relying on internet support groups for help.\nThere are still no dedicated health services for those living with long Covid symptoms in Northern Ireland.\nBut the health department has pledged to start services by the end of October.\nLong Covid clinics were opened across England in November 2020.\nMs McNulty told BBC Northern Ireland's Spotlight programme: \"You see people over in England going to long Covid clinics and they're doing really well.\n\"No offence to the [Northern Ireland] government but they've been happy to leave me sitting here.\n\"If I had a long Covid clinic months ago, could I have been better by now? I am essentially just left in the dark, like, figure it out on your own.\"\nRebecca Logan, a former fitness instructor and nurse, is an advocate for long Covid sufferers in Northern Ireland.\nShe said the situation was \"desperate and inexcusable\".\n\"Since this time last year, I have been trying to get answers about when we will get health service help,\" she said.\nMs Logan said the situation was \"absolutely appalling\".\n\"Large numbers of working-age people have been left with no support or guidance from the NHS, while they become more and more debilitated.\"\nThe programme also features Newtownards pastor Mark McClurg who faced a life-threatening battle with Covid in March 2020 and still has long Covid.\nHe said: \"My faith is what I am. It's what's carried me through from ICU to this moment in time. \n\"And the amount of people who have continually prayed for me, that's just so humbling.\"\nThe Department of Health (DoH) said it intends to have new services for the treatment and assessment of long Covid available in all health trust areas by the end of October.\nHowever, the department admitted to Spotlight that it also has not yet collected the data required to assess what services are actually needed.\nAn estimated 20,000 people in Northern Ireland have some form of long Covid.\nMs McNulty suspects she caught Covid-19 while working in a pharmacy in March 2020.\nShe is no longer able to work or study, and had to end her three-year relationship with her Italian boyfriend.\n\"There is a fear that this could be forever. That this could be my life,\" she said.\nMs Logan now uses a wheelchair and walking stick because she can't walk far without being breathless.\n\"I hosted a meeting of people with long Covid the other night, and there were people so desperate and even crying,\" she said.\n\"People in their 40s, young children, all ages. People grieving the life they had before long Covid hit them, it's heart-breaking.\"\nIn the UK, long Covid is broadly defined as a condition that develops during or after the initial Covid-19 infection; continues for more than 12 weeks; and its symptoms cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis.\nMore than 200 symptoms have been linked to the illness, but some of the main symptoms are: extreme fatigue, breathlessness, brain fog (neurological and memory loss), heart problems and severe headaches.\nMore than one-in-10 people in the UK who have had Covid-19 are self-reporting with long Covid symptoms, according to a recent survey by the Office of National Statistics (ONS). \nIt is estimated that about \u00a32.5m a year will be needed for long Covid support in Northern Ireland.\nThe Department of Health said there are difficulties collecting data on long Covid because of a changing picture in which some people recover but others become ill.\nInformation is now being gathered but it will be a number of months before there is enough to analyse, the department said.\nSpotlight's Living with Long Covid is available on BBC iPlayer."

      "tags": "Social media,Instagram,Facebook,Internet",
      "text": "Facebook has apologised after it stopped working for users around the world for several hours on Monday.\nWhatsApp and Instagram - which are owned by the company - were also down.\nIn a nutshell, Facebook's systems stopped talking to the wider internet. \nIt was as if \"someone had pulled the cables from their data centres all at once and disconnected them from the internet\", explained web infrastructure firm Cloudflare.\nFacebook's explanation was a little more technical. \nIt said \"configuration changes on the backbone routers that co-ordinate network traffic between our data centres caused issues that interrupted this communication\". This had a \"cascading effect... bringing our services to a halt\".\nThe internet breaks down into hundreds of thousands of networks. Big firms like Facebook have their own larger networks - known as autonomous systems.\nWhen you want to visit Facebook (or Instagram or WhatsApp), the back-end system that allows computers to connect with their network uses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - a kind of postal service for the internet. \nIn order to direct people to the websites they want to visit, BGP looks at all of the available paths that data could travel and picks the best route.\nOn Monday Facebook suddenly stopped providing the information the system needed to function.\nIt meant nobody's computers had any way of connecting to Facebook or its other sites.\nThe failure of such key internet players had a knock-on effect on individuals and businesses across the globe.\nDowndetector, which tracks outages, said some 10.6 million problems were reported around the world - the largest number ever recorded.\nFor many, losing access to Facebook's services was just an inconvenience. But for some small businesses in the developing world without other reliable ways to communicate with customers, it may have been a serious problem. \nLikewise, some organisations where staff are still working remotely after the pandemic, now rely on WhatsApp to keep colleagues in touch.\nA flurry of reports began around 16:45 BST on Monday that Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp weren't working.\nAt first, this caused the usual jokes about how people would cope, and jibes from rivals such as Twitter.\nBut it soon became clear that this was a more serious issue - with reports of mayhem at Facebook's California headquarters. \nSheera Frenkel, a tech reporter for the New York Times, told the BBC part of the reason it took so long to fix was because \"the people trying to figure out what this problem was couldn't even physically get into the building\" to work out what had gone wrong.\nWe don't yet know whether the issue was due to a software bug or simple human error. \nHowever, the conspiracy theories are already circulating - deliberate foul play from a Facebook insider being just one of many.\nFacebook's apology, rather embarrassingly, was posted on rival network Twitter.\nMike Proulx - an analyst for research company Forrester - says the incident raises questions about the way Facebook brought lots of its technical operations together in recent years.\nHe says it made them more efficient but means that if one thing goes wrong there can be \"a cascading effect, like old-school Christmas lights where one goes out, they all go out\".\nFacebook has experienced outages before but they've generally been fixed within an hour or so. \nA longer and more disruptive blackout like this one demonstrates the problem of so much of the world's communications being concentrated in Silicon Valley.\nAnd this in turn raises questions whether the working of the internet should be in the hands of just a few big companies.\nPerhaps the biggest issue for Facebook itself will have been the effect it had on its revenue and stock price. The shutdown meant ads weren't served for over six hours across its platforms.\nAccording to some, the outage could have wiped as much as $6bn (\u00a34.4bn) from Mr Zuckerberg's personal wealth, with its shares dropping nearly 5%.\nOthers estimate that the loss of revenue to the company could amount to more than $60m.\nAnd this blow to Facebook's reputation comes at a difficult time. \nA whistle-blower responsible for leaking many internal documents, takes the stand at a US Senate hearing today.\nIt is also under scrutiny from regulators around the world who have questioned whether it's responding appropriately to issues such as misinformation, hate speech and handling user data, or whether - as the whistleblower says - it's putting \"growth over safety\".\nNow its technical abilities are also in question."

      "tags": "Companies,Car industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "New car registrations fell to their lowest levels in September for more than two decades, according to figures from the industry's trade body.\nThe Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said new registrations dropped 35% compared with the same month a year earlier.\nFalling car production has been blamed on an ongoing global shortage of computer chips.\nHowever, sales of electric cars are rising rapidly, the SMMT said. \nWhile the car market as a whole has suffered through the pandemic, more than 32,000 electric cars were registered last month, almost as many as registered in the whole of 2019.\nSeptember is usually a bumper month for car sales as the half-yearly change in number plates often attracts buyers.\nHowever, just 214,000 cars were sold in September - the lowest total for the month since the current registration system for Great Britain was introduced 23 years ago.\nLast year, new car registrations fell to their lowest level in nearly three decades due to falling production.\nAbout 1.63 million new cars were registered in 2020, compared with 2.3 million in 2019. The 29% decline was the biggest one-year fall since World War Two, when factories were turned over to military production.\nSMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said the latest figures showed a \"desperately disappointing September and further evidence of the ongoing impact of the Covid pandemic on the sector\".\n\"Despite strong demand for new vehicles over the summer, three successive months have been hit by stalled supply due to reduced semiconductor availability, especially from Asia.\"\nWhen lockdowns forced production lines to halt, microchip manufacturers diverted the chips that would normally go into new cars to the consumer electronics market, and supply is yet to fully recover.\nAlternative-powered cars remain the industry's bright spot, Mr Hawes said.\n\"The rocketing uptake of plug-in vehicles, especially battery electric cars, demonstrates the increasing demand for these new technologies. \n\"However, to meet our collective decarbonisation ambitions, we need to ensure all drivers can make the switch - not just those with private driveways - requiring a massive investment in public recharging infrastructure. Chargepoint roll-out must keep pace with the acceleration in plug-in vehicle registrations.\"\nSecond-hand car sales in the UK have more than doubled in recent months due to a shortage of new models.\nYear-on-year, the used car market grew 108.6% in the second quarter, with more than 2.2 million vehicles changing hands, according to the trade body. \nIncreased demand led to a rise in sales of older used cars, with only 12.7% of all vehicles sold being made within the last three years, the lowest on record.\nNew car sales are falling - while demand for used cars is rising. It's a question of availability.\nThe chip shortage has forced car makers around the world to curb production, and focus their efforts on particular models - those which are most profitable to make and sell.\nThe result is that waiting times for new cars have been getting longer. Scarcity is also pushing up prices, with discounts being slashed. That may well be deterring buyers.\nThe slump in sales is bad news for the industry overall - but higher prices could be good for the carmakers long term.\nCustomers, though, could have to get used to paying more."

      "text": "One in five forecourts in London and the south-east of England is still without fuel, the body that represents independent fuel sellers has said.\nThe Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there had been a \"marked improvement\" across the rest of the UK thanks to \"steady deliveries\".\nBut conditions in the South East are \"still challenging\", the PRA said.\nThe improvement in supplies has led to forecourt firm EG Group to remove its \u00a330 cap on buying fuel at its sites.\nIt said purchases were returning to normal levels in the majority of places, apart from the south of England.\nHowever, the company, which has about 400 sites in the UK, added it expected supply issues to ease \"in the coming days\" due to the military driving tankers to restore supplies.\nAbout 200 servicemen and women from the Army and RAF have been drafted in to deliver fuel from depots to forecourts.\nThe PRA said the situation around London and the South East was \"still challenging\". In these areas, it said 62% of the sites surveyed had both grades of fuel available, 18% had only one grade and 20% were dry.\nIn the rest of the country, the trade body said 86% of sites had both grades of fuel \"thanks to steady deliveries and stabilising demand\", with 6% having only one grade and 8% being dry.\n\"We are grateful for the support lent by the government through their provision of military drivers, although further action must be taken to address the needs of disproportionately affected areas,\" said Gordon Balmer, executive director of the PRA.\nThe PRA represents the interests of the independent filling stations across the UK, which account for nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,380 forecourts.\nThe government has been criticised for not deploying the military earlier after panic-buying led to chaos and queues on some petrol station forecourts.\nMore than 65 drivers will start work, with plans to increase this to 200 personnel to be deployed in total, including 100 drivers.\nThe drivers have undertaken refresher training with the fuel delivery firm, Hoyer in order to take on the work.\nHoyer said the training included company safety procedures as well as equipment familiarisation and forecourt driving manoeuvres. \nA government spokesperson said there were signs of improvement in average forecourt stocks across the UK, adding that demand was \"continuing to stabilise\".  \n\"More than half of those who have completed training to make fuel deliveries are being deployed to terminals serving London and the South-East of England, demonstrating that the sector is allocating drivers to areas most affected in this first phase from Monday,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe crisis began more than 10 days ago when BP said it had run out of petrol in a number of its outlets. That prompted motorists to fill up more than usual, leaving deliveries unable to keep up with demand. \nMany sectors of the UK economy, including food firms and petrol retailers, have been affected by a chronic shortage of lorry drivers, which the haulage industry has blamed on factors including Covid, Brexit, an aging workforce, and tax changes.\nDavid Charman, who runs Parkfoot Garage in West Malling in Kent, told the BBC's Today programme there was a big task ahead to restore supplies.\n\"This is not panic-buying anymore, this is people that have waited as long as they possibly can and now they have no fuel. We're having to push cars that are in the queue to get to our site because they've run out of fuel,\" he said.\n\"We didn't have the normal two days of stock underground... because of Covid but we were still managing the situation perfectly well. But now, when we're all empty, it needs a huge influx of fuel deliveries to everybody, not just to me, to ensure that we can get through this.\"\nAre you affected by issues covered in this story?

It's one I hope that the unions will view in the spirit that it is going to be made and consider settling these disputes.\"\nThe Unite union has said engineers will stage a series of strikes in the coming weeks due to the \"reckless\" actions of management at Abellio, the Dutch-based company which runs the ScotRail franchise.\nThe protest is also in response to \"the failure by Abellio ScotRail to make a meaningful pay offer\", despite repeated industrial action since 24 September, the union said.\nThe planned 24-hour strikes will take place between 18-19 October, 1-2 November, 10-11 November and 12-13 November.\nA number of rail depots, workplaces and stations will be affected by the strike action, including Glasgow Queen Street, Glasgow Central, Edinburgh Waverley and Perth.\nSeveral of the dates clash with the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow which will see world leaders in the city from 31 October to 12 November.\nUnite's engineering members at ScotRail voted by 78% in support of strike action in a 68.4% ballot turnout.\nMeanwhile, 92% supported taking industrial action short of a strike.\nPat McIlvogue, Unite's industrial officer, said: \"Unite has been left with no choice but to resolutely respond to the reckless behaviour displayed by Abellio ScotRail management.\"\nHe said that while discussions had been taking place, there had been no pay offer or movement by the company to date.\n\"The talks have been spun out and cynically used as a delaying tactic to avoid the national embarrassment of having strike action during the COP26 climate change conference which is being held in Glasgow.\n\"Well, these tactics have spectacularly backfired because our engineering members will now hold several 24-hour stoppages in the coming weeks.\"\nMr McIlvogue insisted that union members had made exhaustive attempts to engage Abellio ScotRail and called on the Scottish government to intervene to bring the dispute to an end.\nAbellio posted a pre-tax loss of \u00a364.5m in the 12 months to 31 March 2020.\nIn December 2019, the company was stripped of the contract to run ScotRail services by the Scottish government amid criticism of performance levels.\nThe Scottish government announced in April that the franchise would be taken over by a public sector body from the end of March next year.\nA ScotRail spokesman said it would \"continue to engage with the rail trade unions to find an agreement on pay and conditions\" but that the financial situation it faced was \"stark\".\nThe spokesman added: \"To build a more sustainable and greener railway for the future and reduce the burden on the taxpayer, we need to change.\n\"All of us in the railway - management, staff, trade unions, suppliers and government - need to work together to modernise the railway so that it is fit for the future.\""

      "tags": "Metropolitan Police Service,London violence,Barking",
      "text": "The inquests into the deaths of four men killed by Stephen Port are to examine if their lives may have been saved if police had acted differently.\nBetween June 2014 and September 2015, Port murdered Anthony Walgate, 23, Gabriel Kovari, 22, Daniel Whitworth, 21, and Jack Taylor, 25.\nThey were all given fatal overdoses of the drug GHB.\nJurors heard the inquests will consider whether opportunities were missed to uncover what happened earlier.\nIn 2016, Port was found guilty of their murders and attacking several others. He was given a whole life prison term.\nIn her opening statement to the jury, Judge Sarah Munro QC - who is sitting as the coroner - said Port's trial did not answer the question of whether the deaths \"might have been prevented had the police investigated any of the deaths differently\".\nShe added Port would \"not play any part in these inquests but you will hear a great deal about him and his lifestyle\". \nJurors heard police did not realise the men had been murdered by Port until after the final death.\nPort met his victims online, including through the dating app Grindr, before luring them to his home where they were drugged and raped.\nThe inquests are taking place at Barking Town Hall, just yards from the east London flat where Port's victims were given fatal overdoses.\nMs Munro said the function of the inquests was not to attribute criminal or civil liability.\nShe told the jury: \"If there appear to have been shortcomings in the way in which the police investigated these deaths, we must consider those shortcomings dispassionately and resist the temptation to look for scapegoats.\"\nShe stressed the ultimate responsibility for the four men's murders lies with Port.\nProviding an overview of the four deaths, Ms Munro said Mr Walgate was found outside Port's flat in Cooke Street, Barking, on 19 June 2014. Port had called an ambulance, however he did not provide his real name. \nIt was decided the local police team rather than the Met's specialist homicide command should lead the investigation into the fashion student's death.\nInvestigators quickly established it was Port who had called an ambulance for Mr Walgate, but when questioned he lied to police and gave no indication he knew him.\nIt was a week later before they realised that Port, using the name Joe Dean, had in fact arranged to meet Mr Walgate, who was working as an escort at the time.\nA special post-mortem examination could not establish the cause of death and it was another two months before it emerged he had died from an overdose of GHB.\nPort was arrested and convicted of perverting the course of justice.\nIn the months before he was imprisoned, he killed Mr Kovari and Mr Whitworth three weeks within each other in August and September 2014.\nThe two young men's bodies were found in St Margaret's churchyard, some 300m (1,000ft) from Port's flat.\nAt the time, Mr Kovari's death was treated as \"unexplained\" but not suspicious, the court was told.\nToxicology tests found he had GHB in his system and he died from a \"mixed drug overdose\".\nWhen Mr Whitworth was found, a fake suicide note - written by Port - was in his hand. The note appeared to claim Mr Whitworth had accidentally killed Mr Kovari and was taking his own life in response.\nMs Munro said the note was a lie, written by Port in an attempt to \"cover up\" the death - but that only became clear \"much later\".\nThe first three deaths were not treated as homicides until weeks after the final one.\nThe court heard inquests into the deaths of Mr Kovari and Mr Whitworth were held in 2015, however they were later set aside at the High Court in the wake of the murder trial.\nDuring the first inquests, a friend of Mr Kovari, John Pape, had asked if it had ever been considered there could be a link with the earlier death of Mr Walgate. In response, a police officer said it had been considered but no link established.\nOpen conclusions were given, with the original coroner saying she had concerns about \"third party involvement\" in Mr Whitworth's case, so she could not be sure he took his own life, the court heard.\nMr Taylor was found in Barking Abbey ruins on 14 September, 2015, just over the wall from where Mr Kovari and Mr Whitworth were discovered.\nToxicology tests found he had traces of alcohol and GHB in his blood.\nThe police established that on 13 September Mr Taylor had taken a taxi to Barking station, where CCTV footage showed him meeting an unidentified man.\nOn 15 October, Port was arrested on suspicion of murder after a police officer, who was working on the investigation into Mr Walgate's death, identified Port as the man seen walking with Mr Taylor as he happened to see the CCTV images.  \nThe hearing is expected to last 10 weeks.

      "text": "Stormont departments have \"no duty\" to follow a government direction to set up abortion services in NI, the High Court in Belfast has heard. \nThe remarks were made by John Larkin QC during the start of a second legal challenge over abortion laws.\nIn July, political disagreement in the executive led the government to impose a deadline to establish services by next March.\nBut Mr Larkin said there was a \"screamingly obvious\" gap in the law.\nThe formal direction was issued by Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis in a bid to force Stormont to make progress.\nIt put in place a timetable on Stormont's Department of Health to bring proposals for commissioned services to executive ministers.\nIt also directed that there should be \"immediate support\" for interim early medical abortion services in Northern Ireland.\nBut the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (Spuc) is challenging the move, arguing that Mr Lewis has imposed a power grab on Stormont by overriding the devolution settlement.\nMr Larkin QC - Northern Ireland's former attorney general - is acting on behalf of Spuc.\nOn Monday, he argued there was a \"fundamental lacuna\" in how the regulations were drawn up by the Northern Ireland Office.\nHe said there had been no creation of a duty when the laws were drafted.\n\"Here we have a minister of the Crown issuing a direction, with no status given to the direction and no-one is obliged to respond in the terms of the direction,\" he told the court.\n\"In the absence of that, the rule of the requirement is precisely that, to ignore it.\"\nHe argued the formal direction had omitted details specifying the requirement for the Northern Ireland Executive, or Stormont departments individually, to comply.\n\"A minister of the Crown cannot boss people about unless the law gives them power to do it and act in accordance with his edict, and this doesn't.\n\"The Northern Ireland Office may wish such a provision had been made, it may be bitterly regretting it now, but in these regulations as it stands there is no obligation to comply with them.\"\nAbortion is a matter devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nBut in 2019 a vote by MPs at Westminster - during the suspension of devolution - brought about significant changes to Northern Ireland's abortion laws.\nStormont's institutions returned three months later and remained under a responsibility to establish a permanent, central abortion service.\nBut health trusts have been only carrying out limited services, meaning some women seeking an abortion beyond 10 weeks in their pregnancy have had to travel to Great Britain to access services.\nThe Department of Health has maintained that the matter is \"controversial\" and any decision on abortion services must be made by the whole executive.\nIn May, proposals from Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) Health Minister Robin Swann on commissioning of services were blocked by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\nThe party is opposed to abortion and has previously criticised Mr Lewis for taking powers to act, saying it would have \"serious consequences for devolution\".\nSinn F\u00e9in, the SDLP and Alliance have said they would support the commissioning of services being imposed by Westminster, if it remains stalled by the executive.\nIn July, Mr Lewis said the \"ongoing stalemate\" had left him with no choice but to intervene, to uphold international human rights obligations. \nThe secretary of state is already facing a separate judicial review taken by Northern Ireland's Human Rights Commission, which has criticised both Stormont and Westminster over the delay in implementing full abortion services. \nThat case was heard in May. \nThis latest challenge is scheduled to last for two days, but it could be several months before judgement is delivered in both cases.\nThe Department of Health has said in line with the secretary of state's direction, it is preparing proposals on commissioning of abortion services that will be submitted to the executive later this year or in early 2022.

      "tags": "Fossils,Palaeontology,Dinosaurs,Natural History Museum",
      "text": "More than half a century after first being unearthed from a Welsh quarry, four small fossil fragments have finally been assigned to a new species of dinosaur.\nResearchers from London's Natural History Museum say Pendraig milnerae is the oldest meat-eating dinosaur ever discovered in the UK. \nIt existed over 200 million years ago, their analysis suggests. \nThe name Pendraig means \"chief dragon\" in Middle Welsh.\nThe animal was very likely the apex, or top, predator in its environment. That said, it wasn't exactly a giant. Think of something chicken-sized with a very long tail.\n\"It was a typical theropod; so, a meat-eating dinosaur that walked around on two legs, like T. rex or Velociraptor that you'll know from the movies, but much earlier in time,\" explained the NHM's Dr Stephan Spiekman.\nThis is one of those classic fossil stories. \nPendraig is described by just four, albeit beautifully preserved, bone pieces. A vertebra, elements of the pelvis and a femur. These items were originally pulled from a limestone quarry near Cowbridge in South Wales in the 1950s. \nTheir interesting features were occasionally discussed within the NHM, but then the fossil material somehow got lost in the vast collections of the museum, mistakenly stored with crocodilian remains.\nOnly recently were the bones recovered from the \"wrong drawer\" and recognised for their true significance.\nPendraig is really ancient. It's late Triassic in age. It could be as much as 214 million years old, putting it close to the base of dinosaur emergence. \nIndeed, Pendraig would have been a fossil when the previously mentioned T. rex and Velociraptor were still strutting their stuff in the Cretaceous, just before the asteroid struck to wipe them both from the face of the Earth 66 million years ago.\n\"We've only got these four fragments, but the preservation is fantastic. The fossil is completely three dimensional; it's undistorted,\" Dr Spiekman told BBC News.\n\"What's so interesting and important here is that we're getting to see the very early stages of the evolution of the dinosaurs. These animals eventually came to dominate the Earth, but in the late Triassic they were only one of several groups of reptiles that were living on land.\"\nThe geological study of the British Isles tells us that during this time, what is now the Bristol Channel region of the UK was a series of islands made from much older limestone that had been folded and pushed upwards.\nPendraig would have lived somewhere across the archipelago. \nHow this particular specimen died, we can only speculate. But its bones were embedded in a gryke, or fissure, in the limestone. Perhaps the dino fell in; maybe it was already dead and got washed in during a flood. No-one can say for sure.\nThere's a bit of a puzzle related to the size of the animal, which is on the small side of what might be expected. Dr Spiekman wondered if Pendraig might be an example of dwarfism, a phenomenon you sometimes see in species that are confined to islands and their limited resources. But the analysis in this case came to no firm conclusions. \nThe second part of Pendraig's name - its species name - recognises an influential figure in British dinosaur science: Angela Milner, who died in August.\nThe former deputy keeper of palaeontology at the Natural History Museum was associated with another major theropod discovery in the 1980s - an animal called Baryonyx - and was key in helping to bring Pendraig milnerae to light again.\n\"It wasn't lost for very long in the collections, but it was Angela we have to thank for tracking it down. She'd remembered seeing it and went off to look through the museum's drawers. And after three or four hours she returned to say, I found it!\" recalled co-author Dr Susie Maidment.\n\"Angela had a really influential career in UK palaeontology and was a huge loss to us here at the museum. We were some way through describing the fossil when she died, but we wanted to honour her by naming the fossil after her.\"\nPendraig milnerae is reported in the journal Royal Society Open Science. Authors on the paper are affiliated to the NHM; the University of Birmingham; Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Argentine Museum; and National Museums Scotland."

      "text": "A former Facebook employee has told US politicians that the company's sites and apps harm children's mental health and stoke division in society.\nFrances Haugen, a 37-year-old former product manager turned whistleblower, heavily criticised the company at a hearing in the Senate.\nFacebook has faced growing scrutiny and increasing calls for its regulation.\nFounder Mark Zuckerberg hit back, saying the latest accusations were at odds with the company's goals.\nIn a letter to staff, he said many of the claims were \"illogical\" and pointed to Facebook's efforts to fight harmful content.\n\"We care deeply about issues like safety, well-being and mental health,\" he said in the letter, made public on his Facebook page. \"It's difficult to see coverage that misrepresents our work and our motives.\"\nFacebook is the world's most popular social media site. The company says it has 2.7 billion monthly active users. Hundreds of millions of people also use the company's other products, including WhatsApp and Instagram.\nBut it has been criticised on several fronts - from failing to protect users' privacy to not doing enough to halt the spread of disinformation.\nMs Haugen told CBS News on Sunday that she had shared a number of internal Facebook documents with the Wall Street Journal in recent weeks.\nUsing the documents, the WSJ reported that research carried out by Instagram showed the app could harm girls' mental health. \nThis was a theme Ms Haugen continued during her testimony on Tuesday. \"The company's leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people,\" she said. \nShe criticised Mark Zuckerberg for having wide-ranging control, saying that there is \"no one currently holding Mark accountable but himself.\"\nAnd she praised the massive outage of Facebook services on Monday, which affected users around the world. \n\"Yesterday we saw Facebook taken off the internet,\" she said. \"I don't know why it went down, but I know that for more than five hours, Facebook wasn't used to deepen divides, destabilise democracies and make young girls and women feel bad about their bodies.\"\nThe answer, she told senators, was congressional oversight. \"We must act now,\" she said. \nMr Zuckerberg, in his letter, said the research into Instagram had been mischaracterised and that many young people had positive experiences of using the platform. But he said \"it's very important to me that everything we build is safe and good for kids\".\nOn Monday's outage, he said the deeper concern was not \"how many people switch to competitive services or how much money we lose, but what it means for the people who rely on our services to communicate with loved ones, run their businesses, or support their communities\".\nBoth Republican and Democratic senators on Tuesday were united in the need for change at the company - a rare topic of agreement between the two political parties.\n\"The damage to self-interest and self-worth inflicted by Facebook today will haunt a generation,\" Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said. \n\"Big Tech now faces the Big Tobacco jaw-dropping moment of truth,\" he added, a reference to how tobacco firms hid the harmful effects of their products. \nFellow Republican Dan Sullivan said the world would look back and ask \"What the hell were we thinking?\" in light of the revelations about Facebook's impact on children.\nIn a statement issued after the hearing, Facebook said it did not agree with Ms Haugen's \"characterisation of the many issues she testified about\". But it did agree that \"it's time to begin to create standard rules for the internet.\" \n\"It's been 25 years since the rules for the internet have been updated, and instead of expecting the industry to make societal decisions that belong to legislators, it is time for Congress to act,\" the statement read.\n Zuckerberg rattled\n Mark Zuckerberg's blog is lengthy and thoughtful. He doesn't name Frances Haugen - but he has clearly been rattled.\nHis main argument is that the research she leaked has been misrepresented by both her and the media. He argues that the negative internal research has been cherry-picked and positive conclusions brushed over. \nInterestingly, he thinks this episode could have a chilling effect on internal research in companies - worried that bad conclusions might one day be leaked. \nBut there is of course a simple come back to this. Release the data. \nFacebook and other social media companies don't have to do internal research; they could let their data be analysed independently. \nTo be fair to Facebook, the company does give researchers some access. However, only Facebook has the full spectrum of user metrics needed to fully analyse its effect on society. \nHis arguments too are at times overly simplified. Why would we want to make people angry, he asks. \nI'm sure he doesn't. But it's been proven over and over again that social media that provokes any emotion, whether it be laughter, love or anger gets more engagement.\nZuckerberg believes passionately that Facebook is a force for good. It's becoming harder and harder to find people on Capitol Hill who think that."

      "tags": "Physics,Sweden,Nobel Prize,Climate change,Stockholm",
      "text": "Three scientists have been awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work to understand complex systems, such as the Earth's climate.\nSyukuro Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann and Giorgio Parisi were announced as the winners at an event in Stockholm.\nResearch by Manabe and Hasselmann led to computer models of the Earth's climate that can predict the impact of global warming.\nThe winners will share the prize money of 10 million krona (\u00a3842,611).\nIt is incredibly difficult to predict the long-term behaviour of complex physical systems such as the climate. Computer models that anticipate how it will respond to rising greenhouse gas emissions have therefore been crucial for understanding global warming as a planetary emergency.\nIndeed, the award comes as world leaders are preparing for a critical UN climate conference, known as COP26, to be held in Glasgow this November. Asked about the timing, Prof Parisi said: \"We have to act now in a very fast way and not with a strong delay.\"\nThe climate models that have built on the winners' research form a crucial part of the evidence on which leaders at COP26 will base their decisions.\nJapan-born Syukuro Manabe, 90, who is senior meteorologist at Princeton University in New Jersey, demonstrated how increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could lead to increased temperatures at the surface of the Earth. In the 1960s, he led the development of physical models of the climate.\nRoughly a decade later, Klaus Hasselmann, 89, from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, created a computer model that linked together weather and climate. His work answered the question of why climate models can be reliable despite weather being changeable and chaotic.\nOn a superficial level, the original work carried out by Prof Parisi, who is currently at the Sapienza University of Rome, seems to bear little relation to climate change. \nIt was concerned with a metal alloy called spin glass, in which iron atoms were randomly mixed into a grid of copper atoms. Even though there are only a few iron atoms, they change the material's magnetic properties in a radical and very puzzling manner.\nBut the Nobel Committee saw spin glass as a microcosm for the complex behaviour of the Earth's climate. Complex systems, on atomic and planetary scales, may share certain features, such as being chaotic and disordered, with behaviour that seems to be governed by chance.\nParisi, who is 73, found that hidden rules influence the apparently random behaviour of solid materials - and worked out a way to describe them mathematically.\nProf John Wettlaufer, a physicist at Yale University in New Haven, US, explained: \"What emerged from the committee's work was the duality between the study of Earth's climate - which is complex on scales from millimetres to the size of the planet - and Giorgio Parisi's work.\nThe Italian physicist was \"building from the disorder and fluctuations of complex systems at [the level of] their microscopic constituents\", Prof Wettlaufer said. The work of Syukuro Manabe, on the other hand, \"is taking the components of individual processes and knitting them together to predict the behaviour of a complex physical system\". \nProf Hasselmann's work encompassed both the microscopic and macroscopic worlds, added the physicist from Yale.\n\"Even though we've divided the prize between the climate part and the disorder part, they really are linked,\" he explained.\nDr Martin Juckes, head of atmospheric science and research and deputy head of the UK's Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA), said: \"It is fantastic to see the work of climate scientists rewarded with the Nobel prize in physics today. The problems of complexity in climate systems, compounded by threats of the climate crisis, continue to challenge climate scientists today.\"\nThis year's physics laureates were announced during a news conference at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. One half of the 10 million krona goes to Manabe and Hasselmann, while the other goes to Parisi.\nThe Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel founded the prizes in his will, written a year before his death in 1896.\nA total of 218 individuals have now won the physics prize since it was first awarded in 1901.\nOnly four of these laureates have been women. One physicist, John Bardeen, won the prize twice - in 1956 and 1972.\nFollow Paul on Twitter.\n2020 - Sir Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez received the prize for their work on the nature of black holes.\n2019 - James Peebles, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz shared the prize for ground-breaking discoveries about the Universe. \n2018 - Donna Strickland, Arthur Ashkin and Gerard Mourou were awarded the prize for their discoveries in the field of laser physics.\n2017 - Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish earned the award for the detection of gravitational waves.\n2016 - David Thouless, Duncan Haldane and Michael Kosterlitz shared the award for their work on rare phases of matter.\n2015 - Takaaki Kajita and Arthur McDonald were awarded the prize the discovery that neutrinos switch between different \"flavours\"."

Universal credit is being reduced for millions.\nThere are fears in the Conservative Party too about the cost of living over winter. \nSo while Mr Johnson sells his economic plan for the future, many will want assurances about the next few weeks and months.\nWhen he addresses the Manchester conference, the prime minister will restate his commitment to \"level up\" all areas of the UK - a pledge credited with helping his party take many previously Labour-held seats in northern England and the Midlands at the 2019 general election.\nHe will say the country is moving \"towards a high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity economy\", in which \"everyone can take pride in their work and the quality of their work\".\nMr Johnson will say \"talent, genius, flair, imagination, enthusiasm\" are \"evenly distributed around this country\", adding: \"There is no reason why the inhabitants of one part of the country should be geographically fated to be poorer than others, or why people should feel they have to move away from their loved ones, or communities to reach their potential.\"\nThis, he will argue, will take \"pressure off parts of the overheating South East, while simultaneously offering hope and opportunity to those areas that have felt left behind\".\nThe prime minister is not expected to make an announcement on raising the level of the national living wage. \nThe Low Pay Commission is expected to make a recommendation on a national living wage later this month, ahead of the Budget, but earlier this year, the commission predicted it would recommend a rate of \u00a39.42 an hour from April 2022.\nSome Conservative supporters have raised concerns that the party might be regarded as neglecting its traditional heartlands in favour of its newly conquered former Labour seats.\nThe loss of the previously true-blue constituency of Chesham and Amersham, Buckinghamshire, to the Liberal Democrats in a by-election in June added to those worries.\nBut Mr Johnson will argue that altering society in the wake of Brexit will benefit the whole UK.\n\"We are not going back to the same old broken model with low wages, low growth, low skills and low productivity, all of it enabled and assisted by uncontrolled immigration,\" he will say.\nInstead of using migrant labour to keep wages down, he will say, the system must work to \"allow people of talent to come to this country, but not to use immigration as an excuse for failure to invest in people, in skills and in the equipment or machinery they need to do their jobs\".\nOn Sunday the government announced that 300 temporary visas would be issued to overseas lorry drivers to ease fuel shortages.\nSome 4,700 visas intended for foreign food haulage drivers are being extended, as well as 5,500 for foreign poultry workers."

      "text": "The first new sickle-cell treatment in 20 years will help keep thousands of people out of hospital over the next three years, NHS England has said.\nSickle-cell disease is incurable and affects 15,000 people in the UK.\nAnd the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said the hope of reducing health inequalities for black people, who are predominantly affected and often have poorer health outcomes due to a number of social factors, made the drug worth recommending.\nIt called it \"an innovative treatment\".\nThe drug, crizanlizumab, made by Novartis, is injected into a vein and can be taken on its own or alongside standard treatment and regular blood transfusions.\nAnd in a trial, patients taking the crizanlizumab had a sickle-cell crisis 1.6 times a year on average, compared with nearly three times a year normally.\nThese painful episodes, which can require hospital treatment and lead to other health complications, are caused by by sickle-shaped red blood cells blocking the small blood vessels .\nBut because the trial was small and lasted only a year, it remains unknown how long the benefits last for - and that makes it difficult to judge how cost-effective crizanlizumab is.\nNevertheless, NICE, which recommends treatments in England and Wales, is recommending its use for over-16s, albeit under a special arrangement rather than routinely, on the NHS.\nAnd additional data on the treatment will be collected through clinical trials.\nThe charity Sickle Cell Society said the new treatment brought \"new hope\" for people living with the world's most common genetic blood condition.\nNHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said: \"The moment that a new drug comes that is approved to be used, our job is to make sure that we can do a deal to ensure it's affordable and get it out as quickly as possible.\"\nDiagnosed at birth, Sarah-Jane Nkrumah, 27, had her first crisis aged six months and has chronic pain in her joints.\n\"Every day is pain,\" she says.\n\"I don't remember the last time I had zero pain.\" \nSarah-Jane prefers to take breaks from taking painkillers -  but some days cannot get out of bed.\n\"You just have to try and manage it,\" she says.\n\"I don't have a choice.\n\"It's all about having a lot of mental strength and support.\"\nAnd every six weeks, she has a blood transfusion to boost her energy levels.\n\"I feel weak and exhausted leading up to them and refreshed and stronger afterwards,\" she says.\n\"Thanks to donors, I get a chance to live another day.\"\nSarah-Jane had to give up her ambition to become a nursery teacher because it put her at risk of serious infection.\n\"Now, I have found my true purpose and love spreading awareness of sickle-cell disease,\" she says.\nMeindert Boysen, deputy chief executive and director of the Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, at NICE, said: \"Treatment for sickle-cell disease has been limited for years and there has been a lack of treatments for patients whose lives are affected by the condition. \n\"Crizanlizumab... has shown the potential to improve hundreds of lives and we are delighted to be able to recommend it as the first new treatment for sickle cell disease in two decades.\"\nSource: Sickle Cell Society / NHS UK"

      "tags": "Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland's first minister has apologised for the botched introduction of the country's vaccine passport app.\nThe app - which allows people to show they have been double vaccinated - was launched just hours before the scheme came into effect. \nBut many people were unable to access their records through the app, leading to several venues not asking for proof of vaccination over the weekend. \nNicola Sturgeon acknowledged that this had caused \"extreme frustration\".\nSpeaking in the Scottish Parliament, she added: \"I apologise for that\".\nThe first minister insisted that the app itself - which was developed by a Danish firm that was paid about \u00a3600,000 by the Scottish government - was not the problem.\nShe explained: \"Essentially the high level of demand after the launch of the app - combined with an error in one part of the NHS system - meant that information wasn't being sent quickly enough from the NHS system to the app. \n\"This also, for a period, caused problems for those requesting paper copies of vaccination certificates, or seeking to download a PDF.\"\nThe app went live shortly after 17:00 last Thursday, with the vaccine passport scheme being introduced at 05:00 the next morning.\nHowever, the government had already announced two days earlier that the scheme would not actually be enforced until 18 October - which opposition parties and industry groups said at the time suggested it was not yet ready.\nQuestions have also been asked about why the Scottish government evidently failed to anticipate and prepare for large numbers of people downloading and attempting to use the app, and why it decided to create its own app rather than sharing the one that is in use in England and Wales. \nMs Sturgeon said improvements to remedy the problem were made to the NHS system on Friday evening, with the \"initial backlog\" of people waiting to access their vaccine status being cleared by lunchtime on Saturday. \nShe said the government would continue to monitor the performance of the app, and to \"engage with businesses and sectors subject to the requirement for Covid certification\".\nAberdeen FC announced ahead of their match with Celtic on Sunday that they would not be checking the vaccination status of fans.\nBut Ms Sturgeon said both Hearts and Rangers had managed to check about 20% of their crowds despite saying they would not turn anyone away who was unable to provide evidence of their vaccination status. \nThe first minister also said she continued to believe that vaccine passports are a \"proportionate way of encouraging people to get vaccinated, and also of helping large events and night-time hospitality to keep operating during a potentially difficult winter.\"\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the scheme had been \"an utter shambles from day one\" and a \"complete embarrassment\".\nHe added: \"The app was delayed and only came into force less than 12 hours before the scheme began. It was instantly a disaster - people couldn't find the app, they couldn't get the app to open, there were issues with facial recognition. \n\"People are still putting in all of their details correctly and cannot get their vaccine passport up on the app - there continue to be issues days on.\n\"It seems the government did not foresee high demand for an app that they want everyone who goes to gigs, football or nightclubs to download.\"\nAnas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, said the rollout of the app had been a \"predictable disaster\", and accused Ms Sturgeon of \"making this up as you go along\".\nHe said: \"This is the consequence of an arrogant government forcing through its ill-thought-through plans despite concerns from the public, public health experts and businesses.\"\nIt comes as Scotland recorded a further 21 Covid-related deaths and 2,056 new cases of the virus.\nA total of 998 people are in hospital with recently confirmed Covid-19, of whom 65 are in intensive care.\nThe number of new daily cases has reduced by more than 20% over the past week, and is now 60% lower than at the peak of the latest wave a month ago.\nThe most significant declines have been among the 15 to 24 age group, with the number of children under the age of 14 also falling dramatically in recent weeks. \nMs Sturgeon said the number of people in hospital wards or ICU units with Covid has also been falling over the past fortnight, but warned that the pressure on the health service was still intense.\nShe added: \"As we head further into autumn and then winter, we know that people meeting indoors more often or travelling by public transport rather than walking, for example, will create the conditions for the virus to circulate.\n\"There is a risk that this will lead to a further rise in cases - and that would, of course, put further pressure on the NHS. \n\"So for all the improvement we have seen - and collectively helped achieve - at least until we are well through the winter, we must remember that the overall position remains fragile and potentially very challenging.\""

Fully enclosing the site would not be possible for some time, it added. \nThe Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum and Memorial preserves the Nazi extermination camp set up on occupied Polish soil by Germany during World War Two.\nAt least 1.1 million people were murdered at Auschwitz in the four and a half years after it opened in 1940. Almost one million of them were Jews. The majority of the victims were sent to the gas chambers at Birkenau.\nIsrael's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial condemned what it said was an \"attack not only on the memory of the victims, but also on the survivors and any person with a conscience\".\nWhile vandalism at Auschwitz is rare, in 2010 a Swedish man was jailed for more than two years for plotting the theft of the infamous \"Arbeit macht frei\" sign that hangs over the entrance.\nEarlier this year the wall of a Jewish cemetery near the camp was defaced with swastikas and other Nazi symbols.

      "text": "The culture in an armed policing unit within Police Scotland was \"horrific\" and an \"absolute boys' club\", an employment tribunal has found. \nIt accepted evidence of a \"sexist culture\" in the armed response vehicles unit (ARV) in the east of Scotland. \nFormer firearms officer Rhona Malone raised the tribunal against the force alleging sex discrimination and victimisation. \nHer victimisation claims succeeded but the discrimination claim was dismissed.\nIt also found that Ms Malone was an \"entirely credible and reliable witness\", but the evidence of her former superior, Insp Keith Warhurst, was \"contradictory, confusing and ultimately incredible\". \nInsp Warhurst sent an email in January 2018 saying two female firearms officers should not be deployed together when there were sufficient male staff on duty. \nPolice Scotland apologised unreservedly to Ms Malone and said it would address the issues raised in the judgement \"as a matter of urgency\".  \nMs Malone told BBC Scotland she was \"extremely emotional and phenomenally grateful\". \nHer solicitor, Margaret Gibbon, described the employment tribunal's judgement as \"damning\". \n\"The employment tribunal's findings lay bare the misogynistic attitudes and culture within armed policing and the hostile treatment police officers face when they try to call it out,\" she added. \n\"Of equal concern is the employment tribunal's findings that it did not consider credible much of the evidence it heard from Police Scotland's witnesses, including testimony from high-ranking police officers and senior members of staff.   \n\"The serious issues this judgement brings to light need to be urgently addressed by Police Scotland\".\nMs Malone had worked as a police officer for seven years before becoming an authorised firearms officer (AFO) in Police Scotland's ARV team in 2016. \nShe was based in Edinburgh, Fettes Team 1, in October 2016, where she was one of two women in a team of 12 AFOs. Of 60 AFOs in Edinburgh's ARV division, four were women.  \nIn its judgement, the tribunal accepted evidence that there was an \"absolute boys' club culture\" within the ARV which was \"horrific\". It also found: \nThe tribunal also accepted that Insp Warhurst sent an email saying two female officers should not be deployed together. \nIn the email he referred to \"the obvious differences in physical capacity\" and said it made \"more sense from a search, balance of testosterone perspective\". \nBut the tribunal found that the instruction was not implemented, as staff were told it did not represent the views of senior management. As a result of this, it dismissed the direct discrimination claim.  \nIf the email had been acted upon, the tribunal said it would have been viewed as \"inherently discriminatory\". \nHowever the tribunal did accept Ms Malone's claims of victimisation. \nThese related to incidents including a threat of withdrawing her firearms authority, a suggestion that she could be transferred to Stirling, handling of grievances and a failure to investigate complaints. \nIn one of the tribunal hearings, Richard Creanor, a former firearms officer, said there was \"absolutely a boys' club culture\" that existed in parts of Police Scotland's armed response unit and also claimed Insp Warhurst had sent a message with a picture of topless women to a WhatsApp group of police officers. \nHe told the hearing: \"You have to understand the culture in firearms, they operate within their own rules.\"\nLawyer Stewart Healey, acting for Police Scotland, suggested to Mr Creanor during the evidence session that he \"had it in for Mr Warhurst\" and was making up the claims.\nBut the tribunal ruling accepted Mr Creanor's evidence and described him as a \"credible and reliable\" witness. \nThe tribunal judgement was also critical of two senior officers. \nIt found the evidence of Ch Supt Andrew McDowell's \"implausible\" in that the reason he gave for not investigating Ms Malone's complaint was because he \"receives thousands of emails\". \nThis was described as  \"wholly unsatisfactory\" in the judgement given Ch Supt McDowell's seniority. \nIn addition, the judgement said the actions of Police Scotland official Alasdair Muir were \"neither honest nor reasonable\". \nIn a statement published in response to the judgement Assistant Chief Constable Mark Williams, of Police Scotland, said the culture in armed policing in 2017 and 2018 was unacceptable. \n\"Since then we have worked hard to improve standards but we know there is much still to do,\" he said.  \n\"As an organisation, our response when a dedicated female officer raised legitimate concerns was no where near good enough. I apologise unreservedly to Ms Malone for those failings and for the significant impact they had on her,\" he added. \n\"This judgement highlights serious issues and we will set out action to address them as a matter of urgency.\""

      "text": "Boris Johnson is \"not worried\" about the current jobs gap and rising prices in the UK, saying supply chains will sort themselves out \"rapidly\".\nThe PM told the BBC that the economy was facing the \"stresses and strains\" of a post-Covid recovery. \nBut he said the country was \"moving to a new approach\", with companies paying higher wages for UK workers, rather than relying on low paid immigration.\nAnd he claimed government schemes, like the hardship fund, would help people.\nMr Johnson also said he was not worried about inflation as he believed \"supply would match demand\". \nEarlier, the prime minister denied there was a crisis in the UK, despite a shortage of HGV drivers disrupting fuel deliveries and leaving some shelves empty, and a range of industries warning there was a lack of skilled workers as a result of both the pandemic and Brexit.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the country was at a \"turning point\" and the UK's \"world leading\" logistics industry would fix the issues.\nThe PM also said on BBC Breakfast that only 127 HGV drivers had applied for temporary visas offered by the government to help tackle the shortage. \nThe department for business said 27 drivers had been identified, but have not confirmed what the prime minister's number of 127 was referring to.\nThe Road Haulage Association said a three month visa \"simply wasn't attractive enough for European truckers to give up their current jobs for a short term contract - perhaps only weeks long -  with all the hassle, including short term rents, that would be involved.\"\nIn an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg at the Conservative Party conference, Mr Johnson was asked about appeals from industry for help to fill vacancies and concerns from the public about prices - in a week when a weekly \u00a320 top-up to universal credit claimed by 5.8 million people is due to end.\nHe said the government was \"giving all the protections that we can\" to consumers through schemes like the winter hardship fund and increasing the warm homes allowance. \nBut he focused on the UK moving away from the \"tired, failed approach\" of relying on low skilled and low paid workers from abroad, saying the long term effects would be higher wages, better working conditions and a rise in productivity. \nThe PM added: \"Some people who have been writing to me maybe worried about this, but I'm not worried about this because, actually, I think it will be good for their businesses to invest in people.\"\nLaura Kuenssberg raised the issue of public sector staff, saying 2.5 million people were dealing with pay freezes rather than reaping the benefits of any wage rises.\nBut Mr Johnson said the government had \"done everything we can to increase people's pay\" but \"times have been very, very tight\".\nHe added: \"What you have got to do as the government is look at the long term, and look at how you can make the investments now that will bear down on costs.\"\nBoris Johnson says he's \"not worried\" about the squeeze on supply chains, labour shortages or inflation. \nHe's trying to use this moment to argue that what we are seeing is merely the birth pangs of a new economic model.\nBut talk to some of his colleagues - some of whom made their own warnings about specific economic pinch points before the summer - and you don't quite hear the same. \nWhen the prime minister displays a disregard for Westminster's conventions or politesse it's one thing. \nBut running the risk of looking like you don't understand everyday concerns is another. \nThe polls right now suggest that the government is not being punished for queues at the pump or empty shelves. \nJohnson loyalists credit his political appeal that seems to defy natural gravity. \nBut if prices continue to creep up and disruption continues, those feelings could turn.\nDowning Street is in a bullish mood, but confidence can tip into complacency - a sentiment that few voters would reward. \nRead more from Laura here.\nMr Johnson said companies in control of supplying goods will \"manage\" any issues, rather than the government \"stepping in to patch and mend every bit of our supply chains\".\nHe added: \"The government can't magic-up changes to their systems overnight.\n\"People need to recognise that we can't simply continue with models which have basically held this country back and held our economy back.\"\nAnd when it came to inflation - the rate at which prices are rising - Mr Johnson dismissed the worries of some economists.\n\"I think that people have been worried about inflation for a long time [but] it hasn't materialised,\" he said. \n\"What you're seeing stresses and strains that are caused by the global economy coming back to life and supply will match demand.\""

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nThe number of pupils absent from England's state schools rose by two-thirds in the fortnight to 30 September, reaching 204,000. About 2.5% of pupils were out of school for Covid-related reasons on that day, according to Department for Education figures. Liz Lord, deputy head teacher at a high school in West Yorkshire, says the sharp rise in cases since the start of term is worrying - but disruption is limited \"because we're not sending kids around the person who is ill home to self-isolate any more\". \nScotland's first minister has apologised for the botched introduction of the country's vaccine passport app. The app, which allows people to show they have been double vaccinated, went live last Thursday - but many people couldn't access their records. It led to several venues not asking for proof of vaccination over the weekend. Nicola Sturgeon said the issue was to do with high levels of demand after the launch and acknowledged the \"extreme frustration\" it had caused.\nConservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden has said \"people need to get off their Pelotons and back to their desks\" - referring to the brand of exercise bikes. The former culture secretary said civil servants should \"lead by example\" by returning to the office, after a top civil servant reportedly said she preferred working from home because she could spend more time on her Peloton. A union representing civil servants said his comments were an \"insult\" to thousands of dedicated government workers.\nZoe McNulty, a 27-year-old from Londonderry, tells the BBC she feels angry and frustrated about the lack of help she has received in Northern Ireland after she developed long Covid. She says people have been left to rely on internet support groups for help, while, in contrast, long Covid clinics were opened across England in November 2020.\nMissing your pooch now you're back at work? Well, they're probably missing you, too. In fact, analysis suggests that insurers are increasingly covering claims for treatment of distressed dogs as their owners return to work. Of an estimated 12 million dogs in the UK, about 3.2 million were acquired as puppies during the Covid crisis. Market analysts Defaqto said 44% of dog insurance policies now included full cover for behaviour, compared with 30% in February last year. It means insurers cover the cost of behavioural therapy recommended by a vet to treat an animal's emotional distress - perhaps owing to separation.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nAnd are schools back to normal yet?

We've got to start leading by example on that.\"\nHe said there were currently \"more desks occupied\" at Conservative Party headquarters than in his former department.\nThe government has clashed with trade unions for changing its advice to civil servants working from home and suggesting staff were being \"lazy\".\nThe First Division Association, which represents senior civil servants, accused Mr Dowden of \"hypocrisy\" and pandering to the party faithful, with his latest comments.\n\"As the civil service, the broader public sector and thousands of companies in the private sector already know, what you deliver is far more important than where it's delivered from,\" FDA general secretary Dave Penman said. \n\"The pandemic has driven a quiet revolution in working practices that has seen innovation and reform from both the public and private sectors. \n\"Yet despite the incredible feats performed, ministers continue to want to stand in the way of progress and reform for the sake of a quick headline.\"\nThe \"vast majority of staff want hybrid working\", said the FDA leader, and it was key to the government's plan to move civil service jobs out of London.\n\"The hypocrisy of ministers - who are happy to bank the savings in office space delivered by hybrid working but decry the practice for the party faithful - is frankly insulting to the dedication, professionalism and commitment of hundreds of thousands of public servants,\" he added.\nIn a statement, the Cabinet Office said civil servants have been working hard to deliver the government's priorities \"from home and the workplace\" since the pandemic began.\n\"Like other employers, the civil service continues to follow the latest government guidance and is gradually increasing the numbers of staff in the workplace,\" it added.\nSales of Peloton exercise bikes - which cost \u00a31,750 plus monthly subscriptions to online classes - surged during lockdown, although they have slowed down in recent months."

      "tags": "Music,Adele",
      "text": "Adele has released a snippet of her first new music for six years, and revealed that the full song will be out next week.\nThe pop star posted a 21-second black-and-white clip on Twitter, showing her putting a cassette bearing the song's title, Easy On Me, into a car stereo.\nThat's followed by 13 seconds of the song's instrumental piano introduction.\nHer tweet said Easy On Me will be released on Friday, 15 October, with her fourth album expected to follow.\nIt comes after posters and projections appeared around the world bearing the number 30, which is expected to be the title of the highly anticipated album.\nThe clip was watched five million times in the first hour on Twitter and Instagram, a figure that had doubled by the end of the day.\nAccording to La Presse, the clip was shot in the Canadian Eastern Townships in September.\nIt was directed by Quebec filmmaker Xavier Dolan, who previously provided the visuals for her hit Hello. The 2015 video now has more than 3 billion views.\nBy Ian Youngs, entertainment reporter\nSo what does this clip tell us about Adele's new music? For a start, the album's not a drum 'n' bass record, as she (jokingly) suggested in 2019. At least the opening 13 seconds don't suggest it.\nThe first single is clearly the kind of emotive piano ballad that she does so well, with a melody that instantly sounds like classic Adele. The video cuts out before her vocals kick in.\nAs for the visuals, she's in a car pulling a trailer with furniture stacked on the back, driving down a deserted American road. Leaving something, or someone, behind.\nThe album title 30 would connect the album to Adele's previous pattern of naming records after her age during a pivotal year in her life, following 19, 21 and 25.\nThe singer separated from her now ex-husband Simon Konecki when she was 30 (she is now 33) and has subsequently kept a low public profile.\nAs in the sepia video for Hello, the first single from her last album, there's a distinctly nostalgic vibe. In that, she had a flip phone. In this, she goes even further back in time to put a tape of her new song into the car stereo.\nShe then glances at us in the rear view mirror before driving off, her arm making a wave motion out of the window, signalling a sense of freedom.\nPages of sheet music fly out of the car window in the breeze and are strewn behind her along the road - possibly works by Bach and Chopin with one that could be another new Adele song, musician James B Partridge told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nAnd what of the song title itself? Easy On Me is missing the more overt plea to \"take it\" easy on her, but nonetheless there is an implied reference to another person who has taken it easy on her, or she wants to, or she wishes had.\nIt would seem to fit with the template of her best songs, which couple the melancholic hues of loss, disappointment and passing time with an inner defiance that sees her moving forward despite the heartbreak.\nWelcome back, Adele."

      "tags": "Financial services,Tax,Pandora Papers ,FinCEN Files",
      "text": "The financial secrets of hundreds of world leaders, politicians and celebrities has been exposed in another huge leak of financial documents.\nDubbed the Pandora Papers it features almost 12 million files from companies providing offshore services in tax havens around the world. \nThe data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington DC, which has organised the biggest ever global investigation, spanning 117 countries and involving more than 600 journalists. In the UK the investigation has been led by BBC Panorama and the Guardian. \nThe files are the latest in a series of whistleblower-led investigations that have rocked the world of finance in recent years.\nSo let's round up the other major leaks of the past decade.\nIn September 2020 the FinCEN Files exposed the failure of major global banks to stop money laundering and financial crime. They also revealed how the UK is often the weak link in the financial system and how London is awash with Russian cash.\nThe files included more than 2,000 suspicious activity reports (SARs), filed by financial institutions to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Agency, or FinCEN, a part of the US Treasury Department. They also include 17,641 records obtained through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and other sources.\nThey were obtained by BuzzFeed News which shared them with the ICIJ and 400 journalists around the world, including BBC Panorama, which led the investigation in the UK.\nA huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which revealed the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.\nWho was named? The documents contained details about investments made by the Queen's private estate, a tax avoidance scheme used by three stars of BBC sitcom Mrs Brown's Boys and showed that Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton avoided tax on his \u00a316.5m luxury jet. They also revealed how Apple protected its low-tax regime by using the Channel Island of Jersey and that Prince Charles campaigned to alter climate-change agreements without disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting.\nWho leaked the data? The BBC does not know the identity of the source. The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the ICIJ. Panorama led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including the Guardian, in 67 countries.\nA confidential settlement was later reached between the BBC, the Guardian and Appleby over the reporting of the leaked documents, which Appleby said were taken by hackers. The Guardian and BBC said the reports were in the public interest but did not give more detail about the settlement.\nUntil Pandora this leak was seen as the daddy of them all in data size. If you thought the Wikileaks dump of sensitive diplomatic cables in 2010 was a big deal, this carried 1,500 times more data.\nThe Panama Papers came about after an anonymous source contacted reporters at German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung in 2015 and supplied encrypted documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. It sells anonymous offshore companies that help the owners hide their business dealings.\nOverwhelmed by the scale of the dump, which eventually grew to 2.6 terabytes of data, the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung called in the ICIJ, which led to the involvement of about 100 other partner news organisations, including the BBC's Panorama.\nAfter more than a year of scrutiny, the ICIJ and its partners jointly published the Panama Papers on 3 April 2016, with the database of documents going online a month later.\nWho was named? Where do we start? A few of the news partners focused on how associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin shuffled cash around the globe. Not that the Russians cared much. The prime ministers of Iceland and Pakistan came to far stickier ends, the former quitting and the latter being thrown out of office by the Supreme Court. Overall the financial dealings of a dozen current and former world leaders, more than 120 politicians and public officials and countless billionaires, celebrities and sports stars were exposed. \nWho leaked the data? John Doe. Yes, we know. It's not a real name. In US crime series it is mostly used to label anonymous victims but Mr (or Ms) Doe's manifesto, released a month after publication, reveals a self-styled revolutionary. The real identity is still unknown.\nFive months after the Panama Papers, the ICIJ published revelations from the Bahamas corporate registry. The 38GB cache revealed the offshore activities of \"prime ministers, ministers, princes and convicted felons\", it said. Former EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes admitted an \"oversight\" in failing to disclose her interest in an offshore company.\nThis ICIJ investigation, involving hundreds of journalists from 45 countries, including BBC Panorama, went public in February 2015.\nIt focused on HSBC Private Bank (Suisse), a subsidiary of the banking giant, and so lifted the lid on dealings in a country where banking secrecy is taken for granted.\nThe leaked files covered accounts up to the year 2007, linked with more than 100,000 individuals and legal entities from more than 200 countries.\nThe ICIJ said the subsidiary had served \"those close to discredited regimes\" and \"clients who had been unfavourably named by the United Nations\".\nHSBC admitted that the \"compliance culture and standards of due diligence\" at the subsidiary at the time were \"lower than they are today\". \nWho was named? The ICIJ said HSBC had profited from \"arms dealers, bag men for Third World dictators, traffickers in blood diamonds and other international outlaws\".\nIt also cited those close to the regimes of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, former Tunisian President Ben Ali and Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad.\nWho leaked the data? Actually, we know this one. The ICIJ investigation was based on data originally leaked by the French-Italian software engineer and whistleblower Herv\u00e9 Falciani, though the ICIJ got it later from another source. From 2008 onwards he passed information on HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) to French authorities, who in turn passed them to other relevant governments. Mr Falciani was indicted in Switzerland. He was held in detention in Spain but was later released and now lives in France.\nOr LuxLeaks for short. Another extensive ICIJ investigation, which revealed its findings in November 2014.\nIt centred on how professional services company PricewaterhouseCoopers helped multinational companies gain hundreds of favourable tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010.\nThe ICIJ said multinationals had saved billions by channelling money through Luxembourg, sometimes at tax rates of less than 1%. One address in Luxembourg was home to more than 1,600 companies, it said.\nThe leak of documents was first exposed in 2012 after a joint investigation between Panorama and France2 which lifted the lid on the tax agreements of UK pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline and media company Northern & Shell. \nWho was named? Pepsi, IKEA, AIG and Deutsche Bank were among those named.\nA second tranche of leaked documents said the Walt Disney Co and Skype had funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars in profits through Luxembourg subsidiaries. They and the other firms denied any wrongdoing.\nJean-Claude Juncker had been PM of Luxembourg when it enacted many of its tax avoidance rules. He had been appointed president of the European Commission just a few days before the leak came out. He said he had not encouraged avoidance.\nEurosceptics went to town and pushed a censure motion against him and his commission. It was rejected. But the EU did investigate, and by 2016 had proposed a yet-to-be realised common tax scheme for the EU.\nWho leaked the data? Frenchman Antoine Deltour, a former PricewaterhouseCoopers employee, was the main man, saying he had acted in the public interest. Another PwC employee, Raphael Halet, helped him.\nThe pair, along with journalist Edouard Perrin, were all charged in Luxembourg after a PwC complaint. A first verdict was later revisited, watering down sentences, with Deltour given a six-month suspended jail term which was later quashed. Halet received a small fine and Mr Perrin was acquitted.\nThis was about a tenth of the size of the Panama Papers but was seen as the biggest expos\u00e9 of international tax fraud ever when the ICIJ and its news partners went public in November 2012 and April 2013.\nSome 2.5 million files revealed the names of more than 120,000 companies and trusts in hideaways such as the British Virgin Islands and the Cook Islands.\nBBC Panorama exposed a flourishing tax evasion industry in the UK in an undercover investigation based on the files. \nWho was named? The usual suspects. A mix of politicians, government officials and their families, with the Russians notable, but also those in China, Azerbaijan, Canada, Thailand, Mongolia and Pakistan. The Philippines - in the form of the family of late strongman Ferdinand Marcos - get a dishonourable mention. To be fair, the ICIJ does point out that the leaks are not necessarily evidence of illegal actions.\nWho leaked the data? The ICIJ cites \"two financial service providers, a private bank in Jersey and the Bahamas corporate registry\" as the sources, but says nothing more other than it was \"data obtained\".\nThe Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations. \nMore than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK.\nPandora Papers coverage: follow reaction on Twitter using #PandoraPapers, in the BBC News app, or watch Panorama on the BBC iPlayer (UK viewers only)"

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Russia,Pandora Papers ",
      "text": "The Conservative Party is facing fresh questions about donations made by the wife of a former Russian minister.\nLubov Chernukhin is one of the biggest donors to the Tories, giving more than \u00a31.8m since 2012.\nLeaked documents reveal her personal wealth comes from her husband Vladimir. He has been financially linked to people who were close to the Kremlin.\nMrs Chernukhin's lawyers say she is a British citizen and is entitled to do as she wishes with her money.\nHer donations to the Conservative Party have given the 48-year-old access to figures at the top of UK government. \nMrs Chernukhin's winning auction bids have seen her play tennis with Boris Johnson and dine with Theresa May, when she was prime minister.\nBut until now, very little has been known about the Chernukhins' wealth and where it comes from.\nThe documents in the Pandora Papers leak of internal files and correspondence from offshore financial firms show the couple are linked to a network of 32 companies, three trusts and more than \u00a3100m in assets.\nThe documents indicate that Mrs Chernukhin's wealth comes from her husband, with one email describing her as being \"financially supported by her husband\", and another as \"a housewife\".\nOne document shows Mr Chernukhin's offshore company loaned \u00a34m to his wife's UK company.\nThe latest revelations follow separate allegations about two businessmen linked to donations to the party.\nBoth men deny any wrongdoing.\nWorking with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and the Guardian, BBC Panorama has had access to almost 12 million documents files from 14 companies in countries including the British Virgin Islands, Belize, Cyprus and Switzerland.\nThe Conservative Party say all donations have been properly and lawfully declared and followed all the rules.\nAsked about the revelations about party donors that have emerged from the Pandora Papers investigation, the prime minister said all party donations are \"'vetted in the normal way in accordance with rules set up by the Labour government\", adding:  \"So we vet them the whole time\".\nThe main political parties including Labour and the Liberal Democrats have all faced calls to hand donations back over the years.\nMeanwhile, in response to the claims, Transparency International UK says that vetting process for all political donors in the UK is \"little more than a box-ticking exercise\".\n\"It's easy to evade the rules or not look too closely. We must do better,\" they add.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said HM Revenue & Customs will examine the leaked papers \"to see if there's anything we can learn\".\nThe Russian-born Chernukhins are both now British citizens.\nPandora Papers documents reveal how they secretly acquired properties in the UK through offshore companies.\nThey purchased a house overlooking Regents Park in London now worth \u00a338m, as well as a mansion in Oxfordshire bought for \u00a310m.\nMr Chernukhin, 52, a former deputy minister of finance under Vladimir Putin left Russia for London in 2004 after being sacked by the president.\nThe Pandora Papers investigation found evidence that suggests Mr Chernukhin abused his position as the government appointed head of a state bank to advance his private business interests.\nIn evidence to a court hearing in London in 2018, Mr Chernukhin testified how he had reached an arrangement with the former mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, to secure planning permission for a development he had a secret personal interest in.\nIn return Mr Chernukhin told the court he proposed helping the mayor in relation to two other development sites in Moscow in which his bank had an interest. \nHe told the court: \"As a part of negotiations or agreement with them how to proceed, we agreed...\u202fthat I will help them\", \"and Mr Luzhkov will help me\".\u202f\nAndrew Mitchell QC, a leading corruption barrister, told Panorama: \"That's a conflict, there's no two ways about it. Here is a man who's chairman of the bank, using the bank as a mean by which he enhances his own personal wealth. And that has corruption written all over it.\"\nPandora Papers files also show Mr Chernukhin has carried on doing business with people close to the Kremlin.\nThey reveal his secret involvement in a property deal in St Petersburg in 2017, in which his partner was the wife of a then Russian government minister. He sold his stake in the property the following year for $30m, the documents show.\nQuestioned in 2018 about the Chernukhin's wealth, Mr Johnson - then foreign secretary - said \"all possible checks have been made and... will continue to be made\" on donations.\nAsked whether the donations to the Conservatives should be declared as coming from Mr Chernukhin as well, political law expert Gavin Millar QC said: \"If it's joint money, if it's family money, why isn't he willing to have his name alongside hers in the quarterly return to the Electoral Commission, publicly identified as a donor, and the source of the money?\"\nHe added: \"When you've got somebody who's a prominent associate of people who are connected with the Kremlin and\u2026 with Russian government, you would have thought any British political party\u2026 would start to investigate it and ask why that money is being given.\"\nLawyers for the Chernukhins said Panorama's interpretation of the court case involving Mr Chernukhin was a \"gross mis-characterisation\".\nThey said \"the suggestion that he acted improperly whilst an official of the state is wholly untrue\" and he \"has not accumulated his wealth.... in a corrupt manner\".\nThe lawyers said it was not accepted that any of Mrs Chernukhin's political donations have been funded by improper means or affected by the influence of anyone else.\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats have both said the Tories should return the money donated by Mohamed Amersi.\nInvestigations by the BBC and its media partners have indicated the businessman was involved in negotiations for Swedish telecoms company Telia that resulted in $220m being paid to a Gibraltar-based company controlled by the daughter of the then president of Uzbekistan. The payment was described by the US authorities as a \"$220m bribe\".\nMr Amersi has denied wrongdoing and his lawyers said the offshore company had been \"vetted and approved by Telia\" and that its involvement \"did not raise any red flags\" to him.\nRepresentatives for Mr Amersi said on Monday he had \"never knowingly facilitated corrupt transactions\" and the Pandora Papers reports sought to \"embarrass the Conservative Party\".\nLiberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said: \"The Electoral Commission should launch an immediate investigation into these allegations.\"\nThe Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds said the allegations were \"concerning\".\nReferring to comments by Mr Amersi earlier this year that high-spending donors have been able to gain meetings with the prime minister and chancellor, she added: \"The Conservatives should return the money he donated to them and come clean about who else is getting exclusive access\".\nElsewhere, the Russian government has dismissed allegations of financial impropriety involving President Putin contained in the documents leak.\nOther world leaders, including Jordan's King Abdullah, and the Czech Prime Minister, Andrej Babis, have also rejected allegations concerning the secret purchase of properties using offshore companies.\nPakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has said his government will investigate citizens linked to the leak. Hundreds of Pakistanis, including members of Mr Khan's cabinet, are said to have had secretly moved wealth through offshore companies.\nUpdate 3 December 2021:  Following publication, Mr and Mrs Chernukhin have made legal complaints about this article.  They say that the article is defamatory of them. In their complaint, they have told the BBC that no deal (corrupt or otherwise) was ultimately concluded with Mayor Luzhkov in respect of the properties in Moscow.\nThe Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations.

      "text": "Hundreds of people have held a vigil in Eastbourne, the town where the man suspected of murdering school teacher Sabina Nessa was arrested.\nAbout 200 people gathered to pay tribute to Ms Nessa and to call for an end to male violence against women.\nMs Nessa was found a few minutes' walk from her home in Cator Park, Kidbrooke, on 18 September.\nKoci Selamaj, 36, of Terminus Road in Eastbourne, has been charged with the 28-year-old's murder.\nThe vigil at Eastbourne Pier was held amid continuing outrage and debate over women's safety and policing.\nAt about 19.00 BST, those who had gathered paused in thoughtful reflection as a Muslim prayer was read out.\nMany of those attending held pictures of Ms Nessa, while others carried signs protesting against male violence or remembering Sarah Everard.\nAddressing the crowd on the seafront, co-organiser Natasha Peacock said: \"Sabina Nessa should still be alive. She was loved and she will be deeply missed.\"\nShe said the vigil had be organised \"to mourn Sabina and the other 109 women killed this year due to male violence\", and described it as \"a peaceful protest to say that we need to make the safety of women and girls a priority\".\nAnother attendee, Nicolette Florides, said: \"A lot of the girls around me are too scared to walk home. We want the community to make girls and women feel safe.\"\nMarie Goodchild added: \"The police force needs more resources and there needs to be more victim support. \n\"There should be a safe space for victims to come forward, not feel humiliated or that you are going to get scrutinised if you do come forward.\"\nKoci Selamaj was arrested in Eastbourne in the early hours of 26 September. \nHe has indicated he will deny the charge of murder and has been remanded in custody ahead of a plea hearing on 16 December.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "text": "Courts will get new powers to stop disruptive activists attending protests, the home secretary has said.\nIn a Tory conference speech, Priti Patel said new orders would stop the \"small minority of offenders\" intent on \"causing disruption\".\nA Tory source said they will target people with a \"history of disruption\", or those likely to commit crime. \nClimate activists blocking roads have previously been warned they could face fines and up to six months in prison.\nProtests from Insulate Britain have continued in recent days, despite three court injunctions banning activists blocking the M25, and other major roads in London.\nOn Tuesday the High Court heard that more than 100 protesters associated with the group have now been served with injunctions.\nThe group has apologised for disruption - but added that \"the reality of our situation\" on climate change has to be faced. \nIn her conference speech in Manchester, Ms Patel unveiled plans to increase the maximum sentence for disruption of a motorway.\nShe also announced a new criminal offence for interfering with critical national infrastructures such as roads, railways and newspaper printing presses.\nPolice are also expected to be given wider stop and search powers allowing officers to inspect activists for \"lock on\" equipment used to prevent them from being moved.\nThe new measures to be announced by Ms Patel are to be included in the Police, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Bill currently going through Parliament.\nMs Patel said the actions of climate activists, who in recent weeks have blocked the M1, M4 and M25, \"amounted to some of the most self-defeating environmental protests this country has ever seen.\"\n\"Freedom to protest is a fundamental right our party will forever fight to uphold. But it must be within the law,\" she added. \nThe campaign by Insulate Britain has been running for over three weeks and has led to hundreds of arrests.  \nThe group wants the government to insulate all UK homes by 2030 to help cut carbon emissions.\nOn Tuesday, the High Court heard that 111 activists associated with the group had been served with injunctions. \nA hearing on the injunctions has been adjourned to next week, after government lawyers argued all three should be dealt with together. \nSpeaking outside the court, an Insulate Britain spokesman said the group \"wishes to profoundly apologise for the disruption caused over the past three weeks.\"\nHe added: \"We cannot imagine undertaking such acts in normal circumstances. But we believe that the reality of our situation has to be faced.\"\nOn Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson described Insulate Britain activists as \"irresponsible crusties\".\nHe told LBC: \"There are some people who call those individuals legitimate protesters.\"\nHe added: \"They are not. I think they are irresponsible crusties who are basically trying to stop people going about their day's work and doing considerable damage to the economy.\"\nOn Monday, Insulate Britain activists were confronted by angry drivers as they blocked more London roads, including the entrance to the Blackwall Tunnel, Wandsworth Bridge, Arnos Grove and the Hanger Lane gyratory.\nIn a video captured by LBC, a motorist told demonstrators she was desperate to see her 81-year-old mother in hospital, asking them: \"How can you be so selfish?\"\nIn other footage shared by Talk Radio, angry motorists at Wandsworth Bridge were filmed dragging protesters out of the road, where an ambulance appeared to be blocked.\nBut in an open letter to Ms Patel, Insulate Britain said: \"You can throw as many injunctions at us as you like, but we are going nowhere.\"\nOne activist told BBC News: \"We have tried lobbying, we have tried targeting political leaders, government departments, people have been doing this for two, three, four, five decades, without any success at all.\n\"We know through history that disruptive direct actions work. The government are forcing our hand because they are not taking the biggest threat to humanity seriously.\"\nMeanwhile, Dominic Raab used his first speech as the new justice secretary to promise \u00a3183m with the aim of doubling the number of offenders in England and Wales on electronic tags by 2025.\nHe told delegates this included an expansion in the \"game-changing\" use of alcohol-monitoring ankle tags on offenders, to see if they breach court-ordered drinking bans. \nMr Raab, who was also made deputy prime minister in last month's cabinet reshuffle, also pledged \u00a390m to pay for more hours of community payback by offenders.\nReferencing the \"harrowing\" murder of Sarah Everard, he also vowed to make tackling violence against women and girls his \"number one priority\".\nHave you been affected by issues covered in this story?

      "tags": "WhatsApp,Instagram,Facebook",
      "text": "Social media services Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram are back up and running after an outage that lasted almost six hours, Facebook says. \nIt blamed an internal technical issue, which not only affected Facebook's services, but reportedly also employees' work passes and email.\nThe services were down from about 16:00 GMT until around 22:00 on Monday.\nBut the company said there was \"no evidence that user data was compromised\". \nSheera Frenkel, the New York Times' technology reporter, told the Today programme part of the reason it took so long to fix was because \"the people trying to figure out what this problem was couldn't even physically get into the building\" to work out what had gone wrong.\nIn a statement, Facebook said that the faulty configuration change affected the company's internal tools and systems which complicated attempts to resolve the problem. \nDowndetector, which tracks outages, said some 10.6 million problem reports around the world. However, the real number of people affected is much higher: more than 3.5 billion people use Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Whatsapp.\nMany found themselves cut off from family and friends they interact with over the various services, while small businesses which use social media to connect with customers were faced with the prospect of an unexpected financial hit.\nAccording to the business website Fortune, it also cost Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg an estimated $6bn (\u00a34.4bn) at one point as shares plummeted. \nMr Zuckerberg has apologised to those affected by the outage. \nSome people also reported problems using Facebook's virtual reality headset platform, Oculus, and apps which require Facebook logins were affected, including Pok\u00e9mon Go.\nAn outage of this scale for such a long time is rare. A disruption in 2019 left Facebook and its other apps mostly inaccessible across the world for more than 14 hours. \nSeveral other tech companies, including Reddit and Twitter, poked fun at the social media giant's predicament - prompting responses from the affected apps.\nThe disruption comes the day after an interview with a former Facebook employee who leaked documents about the company. \nFrances Haugen told CBS news on Sunday that the company had prioritised \"growth over safety\".\nOn Tuesday she will testify before a Senate subcommittee in a hearing titled \"Protecting Kids Online\", about the company's research into Instagram's effect on the mental health of young users.\nMany outages get resolved fairly quickly. They are often localised too, with some people unable to open a website that can be viewed in another country.\nThis outage, however, was global, and affected all of Facebook's many spin-offs.\nThe length of time it was off grid is also unusual. There were reports of \"mayhem\" in Facebook headquarters, as technicians scrambled to fix the problem.\nInteresting too that the outage hampered Facebook's ability to tackle the crash - bringing down internal tools needed to remedy the problem.\nIt should also be said that Facebook's statement is carefully written. It doesn't rule out foul play.\nThe week had already started off badly - after the whistleblower in the \"Facebook Files\" revelations revealed herself on Sunday.\nBut a bad week has become a terrible one for the social network."

      "text": "Taiwan has urged Beijing to stop \"irresponsible provocative actions\" after a record number of Chinese warplanes entered its air defence zone. \nMonday's incursion marks the fourth straight day of incursions by Chinese aircraft, with almost 150 aircraft sent into Taiwan's defence zone in total. \nSome analysts say the flights could be seen as a warning to Taiwan's president ahead of the island's national day.\nBeijing views Taiwan as a breakaway province.\nHowever, democratic Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state.\nIn an essay for Foreign Affairs magazine on Tuesday, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen warned there would be \"catastrophic\" consequences for peace and democracy in Asia if the island were to fall to China.\n\"It would signal that in today's global contest of values, authoritarianism has the upper hand over democracy,\" she wrote.\nMs Tsai added that while Taiwan did not seek confrontation, Taiwan would \"do whatever it takes to defend itself\".\nTaiwan has been reporting for more than a year that China's air force has been repeatedly flying nearby.\nThe latest Chinese mission included 34 J-16 fighters and 12 nuclear-capable H-6 bombers, which all flew in an area near the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands, according to a map provided by the Taiwanese government. \nFour more Chinese fighters were spotted late on Monday, taking the total to 56 aircraft in one day.\nTaiwan's top China policy-making body, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), accused Beijing of \"seriously damaging the status quo of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait\". \n\"We demand the Beijing authorities immediately stop its non-peaceful and irresponsible provocative actions,\" MAC spokesman Chiu Chui-cheng said in a statement.\n\"China is the culprit for causing tensions between the two sides of the (Taiwan) Strait and it has further threatened regional security and order,\" he added, saying Taiwan \"will never compromise and yield\" to threats. \nIn response, China accused Washington of being the provocateurs, while warning against supporting Taiwanese independence. \n\"Engaging in Taiwan independence is a dead end. China will take all steps needed and firmly smash any Taiwan independence plots,\" the ministry said. \nThe US should stop supporting and \"inflating\" Taiwan separatist forces, it added.\nAnalysts have previously warned that Beijing is becoming increasingly concerned that Taiwan's government is moving the island towards a formal declaration of independence and wanted to warn President Tsai against taking steps in that direction.\nMs Tsai, however, has repeatedly said that Taiwan is already an independent state, making any formal declaration unnecessary.\nThe island has its own constitution, military, and democratically elected leaders.\nChina has not ruled out the possible use of force to achieve unification with Taiwan."

      "text": "Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg has apologised for the \"disruption\" caused after its social media services went down for almost six hours - impacting more than 3.5bn users worldwide.\nThe billionaire said sorry after an internal technical issue took Facebook, Messenger, Whatsapp and Instagram offline at about 16:00 GMT on Monday.\nThe scramble to bring it back online eventually succeeded at around 22:00.\nBut it is likely to increase scrutiny of the social media giant's reach.\nFor hours, potentially billions of people found themselves without the social media tools they relied upon to keep in touch with friends and family. Others reportedly found they could not access services which required a Facebook login.  \nMeanwhile, businesses around the world, which use social media to connect with customers, were faced with the prospect of an unexpected financial hit.\nMr Zuckerberg himself was thought to have lost an estimated $6bn (\u00a34.4bn) from his personal fortune at one point as Facebook shares plummeted, according to the business website Fortune's tracking software.\nDowndetector, which tracks outages, said some 10.6 million problems were reported around the world - the largest number it had ever recorded.\nIn a blog post published on Tuesday, Facebook explained that during a routine maintenance job, its engineers had issued a command that unintentionally took down all the connections in its network, \"effectively disconnecting Facebook data centres globally\".\nSantosh Janardhan, the company's infrastructure vice-president, added that Facebook's program audit tool had a bug and failed to stop the command that caused the outage.\nThe outage also caused employees to lose access to internal tools, including those used by Facebook employees to correct such issues, the company said. Those tools included Facebook's internal email and even employee work passes. \nSome reports suggest that Facebook headquarters was in \"meltdown\". \nEven \"the people trying to figure out what this problem was\" couldn't access the building, New York Times technology reporter Sheera Frenkel told the BBC. \nFacebook has said it is working to understand what happened so it can \"make our infrastructure more resilient\". Tech experts have described the issue as being akin to the social media giant falling off the internet's map, so it could not be found.\nThe company said there was \"no evidence that user data was compromised\".\nThe outage comes at a particularly difficult time for the company, which is finding itself increasingly under pressure over its reach and impact on society.\nOn Sunday, former Facebook employee Frances Haugen told CBS news the company had prioritised \"growth over safety\".\nShe told a US Senate committee that she believed the company's sites and apps \"harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy\"."

      "text": "A woman said she feared for her and her children's lives after men, including Wales rugby international Cory Hill, damaged her home in the early hours.\nShe said South Wales Police officers made her feel like an \"inconvenience\" following the disturbance in Rhondda Cynon Taf in May.\nThe force said it was investigating a complaint.\nA representative for Mr Hill said he had made a full and remorseful apology through Cardiff Rugby and the police.\nBBC Wales has learned Cardiff Rugby and the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) were made aware of the incident at the time.\nIt is understood former Cardiff and Dragons player, and Wales international, was \"under the influence of alcohol\" and accompanied by two other men.\nThere is no connection between Mr Hill, 29, and the woman. A representative for Mr Hill said the group went \"to the wrong property\".\nSara - who did not wish to give her real name - said she did not want to be identified for fear of any backlash.\n\"What I could hear was glass smashing against the upstairs windows and this most horrific banging sound at the front door,\" she said.\n\"The floor was shaking under my feet, I could feel the vibrations.\n\"It sounded to me, at the time, as if there was a sledge-hammer being taken to my front door. At the same time there was the sound of broken glass coming from the top floor windows, so it was really disorientating.\"\nShe said her baby was screaming and her eldest child was \"distraught\" and asked: \"Mammy, are there people trying to get us?\"\nShe told her eldest child to take the baby and \"hide in the bedroom\" because she believed \"something really horrific was going to happen\". \nSara said she feared \"somebody was coming to kill us\" and believed the disturbance lasted for about 15 minutes.\nShe added: \"The outside of my house looked like the aftermath of an explosion - glass everywhere.\"\nIt is understood Mr Hill was not responsible for throwing any glass bottles.\nSara said police officers attended the incident quickly, but felt the attitude of some officers changed when they realised one of the men was Mr Hill.\nShe said: \"That was when everything changed in terms of their response.\n\"The police made it very clear to me that attempting to take this to court, attempting to formally arrest these men, was a waste of time.\n\"I was having the sense that it would be an inconvenience and ostensibly that nothing would happen.\"\nAccording to Sara, one of the men in the group attempted to clean up outside the house, at the suggestion of police.\nIt was also suggested she swap telephone numbers with the same individual to \"sort out\" the damage caused.\nSara said she was also handed \u00a3100 by the same man, who said it was for \"you and the children\", which she said was observed by a police officer.\nBBC Wales has seen text messages from one of the men involved in the incident insisting he returned to apologise.\nSara said she had received direct apologies from two of the men involved but only indirect apologies from Mr Hill.\nSouth Wales Police said the incident had been dealt with through \"community resolution\".\nSara said she accepted she had agreed to the approach taken by police on the night, but now felt it should have been handled differently.\nShe has made a complaint against the force to its professional standards department.\nShe said: \"I feel like they minimised and mollified what had happened to us to such an extent that they treated this as if these grown men were a group of 15-year-olds, who had walked home from youth club one night and pushed my bin over in the street.\"\nIn June, it was revealed Mr Hill had been released from the Wales summer squad and would leave Cardiff Blues, now named Cardiff Rugby, to play abroad after receiving an offer he \"couldn't refuse\".\nHe now plays for the Japanese club Yokohama Cannon Eagles.\nEmails seen by BBC Wales from Cardiff and the WRU from early June showed club and country were made aware of the incident.\nCardiff officials said the club had undertaken an investigation and spoken to Mr Hill at a disciplinary meeting.\n\"We are all very sorry to hear what your children and yourself experienced - and hope you are now at ease in your home,\" the club told Sara.\nThey said Mr Hill's actions were \"entirely out of character\" and he was \"extremely remorseful for the part he played\".\nThe club stated the player fully accepted that behaviour \"was not in line with that of a professional sportsperson and did not reflect Cardiff Rugby's cultural values\".\nA spokesman added: \"While clearly under the influence of alcohol - we have warned Cory around his future conduct and liaised with the WRU, who are aware of the incident, and he would like to unreservedly apologise to you.\"\nIn a statement, Cardiff Rugby said a \"full internal investigation took place\".\n\"The player in question is no longer an employee of Cardiff Rugby. However, as you will appreciate, we cannot and do not comment publicly on internal employment matters,\" said the club.\nThe WRU confirmed the matter had been investigated by Cardiff Rugby as a disciplinary matter, and it endorsed the club's response.\nHowever, Sara said she was disappointed the incident was not publicly recognised, and believed what has happened to her had been \"dismissed\" and \"covered up\".\nShe said: \"The impact this has had on me physically and mentally has been quite significant.\"\nShe said her youngest child now screams when the front door is knocked.\n\"My child is still sleeping in bed with me, I cannot get my child to go back\", she said.\nShe said she was disappointed Mr Hill has been allowed to continue a \"lucrative career in another country\".\nShe added: \"The themes that come up are around power and status, and how, if you have power and status and you are involved in sports, you can pretty much do what you want - and I feel like that's the message they have communicated to any young boy that wants to grow up to be a rugby player.\"\nSouth Wales Police confirmed a man in his late 20s had admitted causing damage to a property, and apologised and paid for the damage.\nA decision to deal with the matter in an \"out of court disposal order\" was agreed by the victim at the time of the incident, said the force.\n\"Community resolutions are an opportunity for the police to deal with appropriate offences where an individual accepts full responsibility and are consistent with national policies and guidance,\" added Ch Insp Anthony Moyle.\nThe senior officer said, following the incident, police became aware the victim \"was not satisfied\" with the resolution and a man voluntarily attended a police station, where a decision was taken to refer him to a scheme to focus on his behaviour.\n\"We can confirm that we have since received a complaint from the victim which is being investigated and until this process is complete we cannot comment further,\" he added.\n\"But there are clearly aspects of the investigation which do not entirely meet the expectations of the victim and we will work with her to address concerns and provide further context around officer actions and the restorative approach taken. \n\"Anything which falls below the high standards we expect from officers will be addressed, and any learnings which can help improve the service we provide will be put in place.\"\nSpeaking on behalf of Mr Hill, his representative said he and the other men involved \"sincerely apologise for their genuine mistake in going to the wrong property, for the damage and any distress caused to the occupiers of the property\".\nHe added: \"Mr Hill has at all times fully co-operated with Cardiff Rugby, who were his employers at the time, the WRU and the police who all investigated the incident and took the appropriate action deemed necessary\".\nThe representative said Mr Hill did attempt to contact the occupier of the property to apologise directly and he had \"made a full remorseful apology to the occupier via Cardiff Ruby, and via the police.\" \n\"It was a mistake, and Mr Hill is genuinely sincerely sorry for being involved in the incident and any distress caused,\" he added."

In some cases anxious dogs may tremble, whine or pace around, as well as excessive salivation, self-mutilation, repetitive behaviour and vomiting.\nSome pets might require professional help that can cost thousands of pounds.\nBrian Brown, consumer finance expert at Defaqto, said insurers had increased their cover.\n\"However, there is no excuse for not training and socialising a dog properly and insurers will not pay claims where this is the case,\" he said.\n\"If your dog is showing signs of distress, seek advice straight away. Many insurers offer free vet helplines where you can get advice over the phone, even if you don't have to make a claim. If you find you don't have insurance cover, speak to the animal charities to get advice.\""

      "tags": "Policing,Sarah Everard murder,Metropolitan Police Service,Cressida Dick",
      "text": "There is an air of crisis in British policing this weekend as it faces a great moment of reckoning.\nNever have leaders felt that public trust is so low they have had to advise women to consider fleeing if they are uncomfortable when confronted by one of their own officers. \nBut that is the aftershock of the appalling crimes of Wayne Couzens, who raped and murdered Sarah Everard while working for the Metropolitan Police, after kidnapping her in a fake arrest. \nHe was sentenced this week to a whole-life term in prison.\nSo what happens now?\nWell first there is no sign that ministers are going to make Dame Cressida Dick, the commissioner of the Met and the UK's top officer, take the blame. \nDespite repeated attempts to force Home Secretary Priti Patel's hand, she has very publicly backed Dame Cressida by renewing her contract last month. \nBut questions now confront policing - and the difficulty its chiefs and ministers are having in answering them is why the crisis feels too deep.\nWas Couzens' ability to pull on the uniform a failure of the system? \nIs there a wider cultural problem? \nAnd how should police leaders and the government respond?\nClearly, society is not filled with homicidal sex offenders. But the fact is they do exist and it's unarguable that they use deception to get themselves into positions of trust. \nIn that context, Couzens' ability to hide undetected within policing is similar to the dreadful story of the Soham murders almost 20 years ago - in which a suspected sex offender was able to work as a school caretaker.\nCouzens, we now know, has been the subject of three allegations of indecent exposure - including reports he drove into McDonald's naked from the waist down. \nThe first allegation of what has long been downplayed as \"flashing\" occurred in 2015 when he was in the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, guarding the Dungeness power station on the English Channel. \nThe police watchdog is still investigating what Kent Police knew about Couzens before he was able to transfer to the neighbouring Metropolitan force in London.\nScotland Yard says its vetting systems did not fail - but admits the system did not pick up this incident.\nAn investigation continues into how far an officer had got in establishing that Couzens was the suspect.  \nThis question of how officers are vetted is now a very live issue - not just because of \"missed opportunities\" from previous allegations - but also whether the system is set up to screen out candidates who may have a propensity to violence. \nBut the focal point is quickly moving beyond whether vetting systems are technically good enough to root out dodgy candidates - to whether there is a permissive sexist culture that allows them to remain in the police.\nWhen I was a trainee reporter in Humberside more than 20 years ago and our newsroom got a tip of some kind of violence in the town, I'd call the police control room. \n\"Nah, just a domestic,\" the bored duty sergeant would reply. \nAnd that response, say critics, is the first part of the problem. For too long police forces have downplayed or ignored the everyday violence and misogyny that men inflict on women. \nJust last month, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary said there was an epidemic of violence against women and girls that deserved the same resources and focus as terrorism. \nSo why is it not a bigger priority? \nSue Fish, the former chief constable of Nottinghamshire, says there is a significant minority in uniform who are \"actively deviant\" - misogynistic officers who are abusing power - some of whom are in turn involved in domestic and sexual abuse.\nIn 2016, she ordered her force to start recording misogyny as a hate crime - and the Law Commission, which advises ministers on major legal reforms will soon publish its own proposals on the issue. \nBut Ms Fish's point is reinforced by the fact that the police watchdog is not just investigating what was known about Couzens - but also five other officers who were in a Whatsapp group that shared allegedly misogynistic and discriminatory messages.\nSue Fish says she has seen nothing from either the prime minister or Dame Cressida Dick that shows they understand how pervasive this culture is.\nThe Victims Commissioner Dame Vera Baird QC - a former police and crime commissioner and career criminal justice expert - also says sexism is rife in policing.\n\"There is no doubt whatsoever that, particularly for female victims, faith in the police has collapsed,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. \n\"We did a survey a year ago which showed that only 5% of rape complainants thought they could get justice by going to the police. This is the worst it has been - but it is not a new thing.\n\"Probably innate sexism runs through the police more deeply than it runs through society. \n\"There is no critical mass of female officers to change the culture. The culture remains male-dominated. \n\"I have heard people say that 'you can be gay, you can be black, you can be a woman. As long as you behave like a straight white male'.\"\nThe BBC understands recruitment data shows the number of women applying this year to join the police has been rising - and so chiefs know that their response to Sarah Everard's murder will be critical to maintaining that progress.\nMaggie Blyth, Hampshire's deputy chief constable, is about to become the first senior officer to co-ordinate a national strategy on violence against women and girls. \nShe's told the BBC that there is work to be done to regain the trust that has been lost - but this is also an opportunity that has to be seized.\nBack in the summer, Dame Cressida Dick wanted to emphasise that Wayne Couzens was a shocking but exceptional case.\nBut as he begins a whole life sentence, the dreadful crime has become British policing's third major crisis of trust in just over three decades.\nThe first was the 1989 Hillsborough disaster - in which innocent football fans were blamed for their own deaths amid a police cover-up of mistakes.\nThe second was the 1993 murder of Stephen Lawrence, leading to the devastating public inquiry conclusion that the Met Police was institutionally racist. \nHistory shows that the response to both of these awful events was, for too long, driven by denial, dither and delay. \nBut ultimately there had to be recognition of the injustice. \nAnd that's why the response to Sarah Everard's death will tell us so much about the future direction of British police.

      "text": "The Conservatives say they are \"working with the police\" after an energy boss attending their party conference said she was \"violently assaulted\" by a man. \nClementine Cowton, director of external affairs at Octopus Energy Group, told a fringe event the incident happened in the bar of The Midland hotel in Manchester.\nThe party member involved has been suspended and had his pass revoked.\nThe Conservatives say the behaviour is \"completely unacceptable\".\nAccording to a report in The Times newspaper, Ms Cowton was in the hotel bar - one of the main destinations at the autumn political gathering - when a drunk man in his 30s, sat in a seat vacated by her friend.\nShe said he made her so uncomfortable that she asked him \"several times politely to leave\" and when he refused to do so, she took his phone and dropped it on the floor.\n\"He went to retrieve it and then he came back and attacked me,\" Ms Cowton told the paper. \nAccording to the report, Ms Cowton said the man tried to punch her but was stopped by others in the bar, with the resulting scuffle ending up with her glass being smashed.\n\"He was very intoxicated and I felt a bit unsafe around him\", she added.\nAnd in a video posted on the ConservativeHome website, Ms Cowton told the guests in the audience she was \"sorry to dump this on everyone, it's a bit of a surprise\".\nBut she said she wanted to take the opportunity to highlight how \"women are often unsafe in places where other people feel safe\".\nAnd she said it was \"really important that we start to take that much more seriously as a society and starting with the police\".\n\"I'm fine by the way, don't worry\" she added. \nA Conservative spokeswoman said the man's party membership has been suspended. \n\"This behaviour is completely unacceptable and the party has revoked the pass of the individual concerned and is working with the police\", she added.\nIn a statement, Greater Manchester Police said they responded to reports of an assault on a woman at The Midland hotel at around 00:30 BST on Monday.\nThey said there were no reports of any injuries and no arrests were made but a man was identified and had his conference pass removed. \nThe investigation into what happened is ongoing they said, adding: \"Women's safety is a top priority, and something we continue to take incredibly seriously.\""

      "text": "Boris Johnson does not support calls to make misogyny a hate crime saying there is \"abundant\" existing legislation to tackle violence against women.\nThe PM told the BBC that \"widening the scope\" of what you ask the police to do would just increase the problem.\nPolicing of crime against women has come under scrutiny since the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving officer.\nThe PM said recruiting and promoting more female officers would also help to change the culture within forces.\nWayne Couzens was given a whole life jail term last week after admitting the kidnap, rape and murder of 33-year-old Ms Everard while he was a Met Police officer.\nDuring his sentencing hearing it emerged that he had used his warrant card to fake an arrest of Ms Everard.\nThe case has sparked a debate about women's safety as well as trust in the police and criminal justice system.\nAn inquiry is to take place into Couzens' previous behaviour and conduct, and will widen out into workplace behaviour, professional standards and vetting practices within the police as a whole.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel told the Conservative Party conference the public \"have a right to know\" why he remained in the Metropolitan Police despite concerns about his behaviour.\nAlso speaking at the conference, the new justice secretary, Dominic Raab, said he had been \"shocked and horrified\" by the recent cases of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa, a teacher killed in south-east London last month on her way to meet a friend.\nHe said making communities safer and allowing women to feel safe walking home at night was his \"number one priority\".\nThe government would \"transform\" the way the justice system treats violence against women, he said, including from the time it takes to examine phone evidence to the \"potential ordeal\" vulnerable victims can face at trial.\nCampaigners say misogyny - prejudice against women - is one of the \"root causes\" of violence against women and are calling for it to be made a hate crime in England and Wales.\nThis would give judges the ability to increase the punishment if the offence falls into a hate crime category. \nCurrently, the law only recognises hate crimes based on race, religion, sexual orientation, disability and transgender identity.\nDuring an interview with the prime minister, BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker pointed out that 11 out of 43 police forces in England and Wales record misogyny as a hate crime. \nAsked twice whether he thought it should be made a hate crime, Mr Johnson said: \"I think that what we should do is prosecute people for crimes that we have on the statute book.\n\"I think, to be perfectly frank, if you simply widen the scope of what you ask the police to do you'll just increase the problem. \n\"What you need to do is get the police to focus on the very real crimes, the very real feeling of injustice and betrayal that many people feel.\"\nThe prime minister said \"there must be radical change\" in policing when it comes to tackling crimes such as rape, adding: \"There is abundant statute that is not being properly enforced, and that's what we need to focus on.\"\nJustice minister Victoria Atkins said it was important to understand why police were not prosecuting these crimes and she had asked police to record instances where the victim felt they were a victim of crime because of their gender.\nShe told the BBC's World At One it was time to move away from this feeling in society that women have to put up with unpleasant, violent banter and being \"touched up\" on the Tube or bus.\nA working group on whether misogyny should be a distinct crime in Scotland will report back in February.\nNottinghamshire Police was  the first police force to introduce a \"misogyny hate crime\" policy in 2016 and university researchers have pointed to \"shifting attitudes\" as a result.\nLabour MP Stella Creasy, who has long campaigned on the issue, said she was confident there was cross-party support to pass legislation soon that would make all police forces have to record when a crime was motivated by misogyny.\n\"The fact the prime minister dismisses it and doesn't have an alternative plan speaks volumes about whether you can trust Boris Johnson to take this seriously,\" she told the BBC.\nInitial findings of a review by the Law Commission - an independent body that advises government - said sex or gender-based hostility should become a hate crime, but its official recommendations have not been published yet.\nMet Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick, who has rejected calls to resign after Ms Everard's death, said a separate a independent review would be carried out into the force's standards and culture.\nAn extra 650 police officers are to be added to London's streets over the next six months to try to reduce violent crime in the city."

      "title": "Hollywood union workers vote to authorise strike",
      "tags": "United States,Hollywood",
      "text": "The union that represents some of Hollywood's most important workers has voted to approve a strike in a move that could shut down nearly all US film and television production.\nMembers of the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employees (IATSE), which covers camera crews, prop masters, hairdressers and other craft workers say they are being worked to death with gruelling hours and no guaranteed rest or meal breaks.\nMembers are demanding better work conditions, as well as fairer pay from streaming services to cover their share of labour.\nOver 50,000 workers voted overwhelmingly - 98% in favour to 2% against - to approve a work stoppage. Should they carry out the stoppage, the strike would be the biggest labour walkout in Hollywood since World War Two.\nNegotiations between the union and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers broke down last month after the IATSE walked away from a deal.\nThe deal would have improved wages and rest periods, the Alliance said, and included a nearly $400m (\u00a3293m) pension and health plan. \nHowever, with the vote, the union has \"spoken loud and clear\" said its president Matthew Loeb. \n\"This vote is about the quality of life as well as the health and safety of those who work in the film and television industry,\" his statement Monday said. \"For those at the bottom of the pay scale, they deserve nothing less than a living wage.\"\nAfter months of pandemic lockdowns in 2020, Hollywood's film and TV sets have been booming in recent months - and crew members say the hours and demands placed on them have become worse than ever.\nLike many around the world, Hollywood's crew members are re-evaluating how and when they want to work.\nOn the streets of Los Angeles and on social media, Hollywood crew members have been sharing harrowing stories of 15-plus hour days, with claims of working more than 70 and 80 hour weeks.\nSome spoke of having \"work done\" - surgeries to rebuild backs and knees - failed marriages and missed weddings and funerals.\n\"Fraturdays\" are said to be a common occurrence in the entertainment industry - workers start on Monday mornings at 06:00, and on Fridays, start late in the afternoon or evening and work until Saturday morning. It leaves little time to do anything but sleep all weekend.\n\"My hours are insane,\" sound mixer Thomas Pieczkolon said during a rally on Sunset Boulevard as he decorated cars with chalk \"Vote Yes\" signs. He works on a $300m show for a streaming service and has to work nine hours most days before they even break for lunch, he said.\nMr Pieczkolon recently worked a nearly 18-hour day on a Monday and his friend Jade Thompson, a costume dresser on the show, fell asleep at the wheel driving home.\n\"I nodded off and then came to and drifted off to the side and had a panic attack,\" she said. \"It wasn't even the end of the week! It was a Monday.\"\nWorkers have claimed that is a common problem - the adrenaline of a long day leaves them and the tiredness kicks in on the drive home.\n\"Sometimes you don't even realise until you're already in your car on that long ride home by yourself,\" Ms Thompson said, adding that her colleagues have WhatsApp group chats to make sure everyone gets home safe.\nThe authorisation vote does not necessarily mean that a strike will take place. Most workers who spoke to the BBC said they hoped it would instead be the leverage their union needed to negotiate better deals.\nThe last time Hollywood shut down for a labour dispute was the writers' strike in 2007 and 2008 amid the rise of reality TV and the soaring popularity of reality television stars like Donald Trump.\nToday, producers are under pressure to make a deal with workers. More than 100 members of Congress have urged them to implement more humane conditions.\nThe authorisation for a strike could also set up a showdown with streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon, which union members said were taking advantage of their work.  \n\"Streaming companies are getting a discount on our labour,\" said set decorator Lisa Clark. \"We deserve a fair share of that profit - we deserve to be paid at least what we used to be paid when we used to do network television.\" \nStreaming services have transformed the industry with ambitious sets and epic shows and storytelling. Workers love that streaming shows look incredible like feature films, Ms Clark said - but she gets 10 weeks to prepare hundreds of sets which would have taken six months for a feature film.\n\"It's not a reasonable request,\" she said."

      "tags": "Personal finance,Universal Credit,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A \u00a320-a-week increase to universal credit (UC), brought in to help people on low incomes struggling through the Covid pandemic, is being withdrawn from Wednesday.\nThe government has always said the extra money was going to be temporary, but MPs, pressure groups and charities have argued it should be kept in place to help those who are struggling.\nWe asked three women how the reduction will affect their lives.\nAlthough the reduction in Harriet Duffy's UC payment is imminent, she can barely think about the financial impact. \"I feel overwhelmed,\" she says. \"I literally just take each day as it comes. It's been daunting.\"\nShe's been on UC since February last year. When hit by a car while cycling, Harriet fractured her leg, and was forced to leave her twin jobs as a door-to-door charity helper and call centre worker.\nThe \u00a320 uplift made a \"phenomenal difference\", she says. \"People have come to rely on it.\"\nAnd the money has been all the more important in the last few months. Harriet now has a four-month-old son. \"We are currently in temporary accommodation. I'm in a hotel until the 18th, but after that I've not got a clue where I am going to be.\n\"The accommodation has no access to laundry facilities - I'm using launderettes and living off microwave meals. This all comes at an expense. Losing that extra bit of income will be devastating.\"\nFor a start, Harriet says she won't be able to do basic things, like go to the launderette as often. With a baby, that could be a problem. She'd like to go back to work, but with such a young baby \"it's just not possible\".\n\"I'm completely aware this [uplift] hasn't always been part of UC and was only supposed to be temporary,\" she says when asked for a message to the government. \"But a lot people have become reliant on it during this time.\"\nFor Nicola Flower, from Cornwall, the uplift in universal credit has helped her stay warm by paying for heating bills during her cancer treatment.\nShe told the BBC she has had to shield for a year due to the coronavirus pandemic and is still waiting for an operation.\n\"I had no choice but to go on it [universal credit],\" she said. \"It was a godsend because I wouldn't have managed otherwise. I have never been on benefits before in my life. I have always done three jobs.\"\nNicola, who worked as a seamstress, in a supermarket and as a cleaner, said the she knew the \u00a320 uplift was \"an extra\", but added with fuel prices and gas prices rising, she could do with the money.\n\"When I was going through my treatment I was quite ill and I needed the heating on day and night so it allowed me to pay for that, otherwise I don't know what I would have done to be quite honest,\" she said. \"I would have gone into debt.\"\n\"I was quite ill, especially with the chemotherapy,\" she adds. She also suffers issues with her joints and fears the problem could get worse when it gets colder. \"I will need the heating on to keep my joints warm.\"\nNicola said she knows she \"physically\" cannot go back to doing three jobs and isn't sure if she could go back to two.\n\"If I had to go back to doing one job, my lifestyle would have to change dramatically,\" she said. \"I have no options at the moment, I'm not fit to go back to work.\"\nShe said the government had \"not got a clue how the average person manages, lives, survives\". \"I don't think half of them know how much a pint of milk is,\" she added.\nDeirdre McCausland was a secondary school teacher in England before moving to Northern Ireland. She thought she could get a job but \"fell into the benefits trap\".\nDeirdre said the \u00a320-a-week UC uplift made a \"massive\" difference to her. Her daughter may not have been able to go to grammar school without the extra cash.\n\"It got to the point where if I hadn't had the \u00a320 extra, I was contemplating putting her into a school where perhaps it was closer and the uniform was cheaper,\" she said.\nDeirdre's daughter needs to get the bus, but doesn't qualify for a weekly bus pass. \"As you can imagine, the money [\u00a320] goes a long way,\" Deirdre says.\nHer daughter wants to pursue a career in music, and the money is helping to pay for her piano and guitar lessons.\n\"That's what she wants to do in later life, and I may have to take something away from her. It will gall me to have to say to her: 'I need to make cutbacks',\" Deirdre says. The reduction \"will have a massive impact on my children\", she adds.\n\"When government is deciding these things, they don't speak to real people with real experiences. They don't realise the impact that will have on children.\"\nShe says there is a \"domino effect\" which means a reduction in benefits leads to debt, effects on adult and child mental health, and it perpetuates poverty.\nA government spokesman said: \"We've always been clear that the uplift to Universal Credit was temporary.\n\"It was designed to help claimants through the economic shock and financial disruption of the toughest stages of the pandemic, and it has done so.\n\"Universal credit will continue to provide vital support for those both in and out of work and it's right that the government should focus on our Plan for Jobs, supporting people back into work and supporting those already employed to progress and earn more.\"\nReporting by BBC social affairs correspondent Michael Buchanan and Claire Jones"

      "tags": "Financial services,Housing market,Pandora Papers ",
      "text": "The secret owners of more than 1,500 UK properties bought using offshore firms have been uncovered by a BBC investigation.\nThe details are featured in the Pandora Papers leak of offshore financial documents and list property with an estimated value in excess of \u00a34bn.\nThe owners include high-profile foreign politicians, individuals accused of corruption and UK political donors.\nMinisters say they will bring in a new law when they have parliamentary time.\nSuccessive Conservative governments have pledged to introduce legislation making it compulsory to name those owning property via foreign companies in a bid to stamp out money-laundering.\nAmong the revelations:\nThe BBC worked with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), the Guardian, Finance Uncovered and other media outlets to identify in the leaked files the individuals behind overseas companies that owned property in England and Wales.\nOwning real estate through an offshore firm is legal, and there is no suggestion of wrongdoing in simply using a foreign company to purchase property.\nHowever, the UK government recently raised its own assessment of the money laundering risk for the property market from \"medium\" to \"high\".\nThe greatest level of risk is where there are \"difficulties in determining the ultimate beneficial owners\", according to a Home Office report in December 2020. \nIt comes as a number of world leaders - including the King of Jordan and the ruling family of Azerbaijan - have featured in the Pandora Papers leak after buying property in the UK using offshore companies.\nThe wife of retail tycoon Sir Philip Green purchased multi-million-pound prime London real estate as BHS, the department store chain they had owned, headed for collapse.\nHer identity as the buyer of properties in London was hidden because they were bought through anonymous companies based in the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven.\nThe purchases included a \u00a315m apartment in Mayfair and a new home for their daughter near Buckingham Palace, bought for \u00a310.6m in 2016.\nThe buying spree took place in the months after the Greens sold BHS for a token sum to a one-time bankrupt who had no retail experience. The chain collapsed, leading to the loss of 11,000 jobs and vacant sites in town centres.\nThe downfall also led to an outcry when it emerged the business had left a black hole of up to \u00a3571m in its pension fund.\nThrough their lawyers, both Sir Philip and Lady Green declined to answer detailed questions, suggesting that these were private matters.\nThe Pandora Papers leak also reveals the property portfolio of the Qatari ruling family owned through another cross-border network of companies.\nThe royal Al-Thani family purchased two properties on one of the world's most expensive terraces, overlooking Regent's Park in London. They were bought through offshore companies, saving millions of pounds in tax.\nBBC analysis found numerous other properties owned by members of the family through these structures, estimated to be worth over \u00a3650m.\nThe Qatari government did not respond to questions about the BBC's findings.\nGennadiy Bogolyubov is a Ukrainian billionaire who is under investigation by the FBI for money laundering.\nHe and his business partner are accused of defrauding the bank they founded of more than \u00a31bn.\nCourt documents included in the Pandora Papers reveal him to be the ultimate owner of a collection of UK properties likely to be worth over \u00a3400m, including a building on Trafalgar Square.\nThey are held via a network of companies, some offshore, that hide the identity of the owners.\nMr Bogolyubov is the co-founder of PrivatBank, Ukraine's largest lender.\nThe bank was nationalised in 2016 after regulators found a $5.5bn hole in its balance sheets.\nPrivatBank has been pursuing Mr Bogolyubov and his business partner Igor Kolomoisky through court action in England and the US, trying to reclaim more than $3bn relating to the money lost during their leadership.\nIn 2020 the US Department of Justice sought to seize commercial properties in Texas, Ohio and Kentucky from the pair, suspecting that they were \"acquired using funds misappropriated from Privatbank\". The court cases are ongoing.\nMr Bogolyubov's assets are currently subject to a worldwide freeze, secured in court by PrivatBank in 2017.\nIn 2016 he decided to leave the country and settle in Switzerland, partly for \"tax reasons\".\nLawyers for Mr Bogolyubov declined to comment as legal action is ongoing.\nMikhail Gutseriev is a Russian oligarch who was sanctioned by the UK in August for his close relationship with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko.  The Pandora Papers reveal that his son owns a multi-million pound office block through a secret offshore company, purchased for more than \u00a340m.\nMr Gutseriev is the founder of Safmar Group, a Russian conglomerate with interests in oil, coal, property and retail.\nFollowing the crackdown on human rights and democracy in Belarus in 2020, the UK and EU have recently brought in sanctions against President Lukashenko, along with Mr Gutseriev and other close associates.\nThe British government has accused the Belarusian regime of continuing to \"crush democracy and violate human rights\".\nIt described Mr Gutseriev as \"a prominent Russian businessman who is one of the main private investors in Belarus and a longstanding associate of Alexander Lukashenko\". It added that he had \"provided support for the government of Belarus, including through use of his business interests\".\nMr Gutseriev is no longer involved in Safmar, which is now part-owned by his son, Said, a British citizen.\nSaid Gutseriev's representatives told the BBC he did not have \"any business links with his father\".His lavish wedding made headlines in 2016 - it featured performances by Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias and was reported to have cost $1bn.\nPlans for a register of foreign companies owning UK property were first announced in 2016 by then Prime Minister David Cameron, so that \"corrupt individuals and countries will no longer be able to move, launder and hide illicit funds through London's property market, and will not benefit from our public funds\".\nDraft legislation was published two years later and \"progress\" on changing the law was promised in the 2019 Queen's Speech.\nEarlier this year, following the G7 summit, the government reiterated its commitment to create a public register of overseas entities who own UK real estate.\nHowever, the law has still not been introduced to Parliament and was not listed as one of the government's legislative priorities at this year's Queen's Speech.\nLabour MP Margaret Hodge told the BBC that when in government David Cameron and his Chancellor George Osborne \"promised us that they would create a public register of beneficial ownership here in the UK... but we've been waiting since 2016 for that promise to be enacted\".\nShe added: \"It's ready, it's sitting there, it's not complicated... but it has yet to emerge... so it's a scandal that that's not happened.\"\nThe government says it is cracking down on money laundering with tougher laws and enforcement, and that it will introduce a register of offshore companies owning UK property when parliamentary time allows.\nThe UK property holdings of the King of Jordan and the ruling family of Azerbaijan were exposed by BBC Panorama on Sunday.\nLawyers for King Abdullah said he used his personal wealth to buy the homes and there was nothing improper about him using offshore firms to do so.\nOther revelations from the Pandora Papers highlight further links between foreign leaders and offshore ownership of UK property.\nThe family of Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta, which has dominated the country's politics since independence, secretly owned offshore companies for decades.\nOne of these firms bought an apartment in central London, according to Land Registry records.\nThe company was set up by Ngina Kenyatta, the president's mother, and her two daughters Kristina and Anna.\nIn 2018, Mr Kenyatta told the BBC Hardtalk programme that his family's wealth was known to the public, and as president he had declared his assets as required by law.\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky participated in a network of offshore companies, co-owned with his long-time friends and TV business partners, the Guardian revealed on Sunday.\nThese firms held assets including apartments near London's Regent's Park.\nA number of world leaders have released statements denying wrongdoing after featuring in the leak.\nCloser to home, major political donors to the Conservatives have invested in properties through offshore companies.\nMohammed Amersi, bought two properties using offshore companies: a Mayfair townhouse and a country home in Gloucestershire. He was revealed by Panorama to have been involved in one of Europe's biggest corruption scandals. He denies any wrongdoing.\nLubov Chernukhin has given more than \u00a31.8m to the party since 2012. The Pandora Papers leak revealed the scale of the secret offshore wealth she shares with her husband, a former Russian minister. It includes a house near Regent's Park in London now worth about \u00a338m, and a mansion in Oxfordshire bought for \u00a310m. The properties were secretly acquired through a network of offshore companies. Mrs Chernukhin's lawyers say she is a British citizen and is entitled to do as she wishes with her money\nRussian businessman Victor Fedotov's companies have given \u00a3900,000 to MPs. He purchased a Hampshire manor house through a network of offshore companies. Files in the Pandora Papers suggest he made millions from a project that became mired in allegations of corruption. Mr Fedotov's lawyers said \"there is no evidence whatsoever\" he behaved improperly.\nThe BBC searched for information about donors to all of the political parties among the Pandora Papers documents but the stories that emerged from the files were about Conservative donors.\nThe Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations. More than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK.\nImages from: BBC, London News Pictures, Central News, Shutterstock\nPandora Papers coverage: follow reaction on Twitter using #PandoraPapers, in the BBC News app.\nWatch Panorama - Pandora Papers: Political Donors Exposed and Pandora Papers: Secrets of World Leaders Exposed on iPlayer (UK viewers only)"

      "text": "Insurers are increasingly covering claims for treatment of distressed dogs as their owners return to work, analysis shows.\nMarket analysts Defaqto said 44% of dog insurance policies now included full cover for behaviour compared to 30% in February last year.\nThis means insurers would cover the cost of behavioural therapy recommended by a vet to treat an animal's emotional distress, perhaps owing to separation.\nPet ownership rose during the pandemic.\nOf an estimated 12 million dogs in the UK, about 3.2 million were acquired as puppies during the Covid crisis.\nMany were bought by young people to help with companionship and exercise while working from home during lockdowns.\nDog welfare charity, Dogs Trust, has warned that an increasing number of owners are trying to hand over dogs for adoption since coronavirus restrictions were lifted.\nThe RSPCA has also said that dogs could face separation anxiety that made them distressed.\nIndicators include destructive behaviour, unwanted toileting or reports of howling and barking. In some cases anxious dogs may tremble, whine or pace around, as well as excessive salivation, self-mutilation, repetitive behaviour and vomiting.\nSome pets might require professional help that can cost thousands of pounds.\nBrian Brown, consumer finance expert at Defaqto, said insurers had increased their cover.\n\"However, there is no excuse for not training and socialising a dog properly and insurers will not pay claims where this is the case,\" he said.\n\"If your dog is showing signs of distress, seek advice straight away. Many insurers offer free vet helplines where you can get advice over the phone, even if you don't have to make a claim. If you find you don't have insurance cover, speak to the animal charities to get advice.\""

      "text": "The number of pupils absent from England's state schools rose by two-thirds to 204,000 in the fortnight to Thursday, 30 September.\nDepartment for Education figures show 2.5% of pupils were out of school for Covid-related reasons on this day.\nThe figures are the second batch of fortnightly statistics to be published since schools returned with much reduced Covid safety mitigations.\nThe government said it was trying to maximise time spent in the classroom.\nOverall, one in 10 pupils were absent, for Covid-related and other reasons, but in secondary schools, one in seven or 13.7% of pupils were out of school.\nAbsence rates in the autumn before the Covid pandemic were more like 4.5%.\nThe DfE says its measures strike a balance between protecting health and allowing young people to experience normality.\nA spokesperson said: \"We are working with parents and school and college staff to maximise students' time in the classroom - encouraging uptake of testing and the vaccine for 12-15-year-olds, and contracting specialist attendance advisers to work on strategies to improve attendance where problems are identified.\n\"If there are particularly high Covid case rates in a school or college, local directors of public health may advise they reintroduce additional temporary measures such as increased testing or face coverings - but face-to-face education should be prioritised.\" \nThey added that attendance advisers were being recruited to work with some local authorities and trusts to support their approach to attendance.\nUnder the current rules, neither close contacts of confirmed Covid cases nor bubble groups have to go home and isolate - only those pupils who test positive.\nNonetheless, teachers have been warning anecdotally of further disruption to education as case numbers in schools continue to rise.\nThe DfE statistics showed:\nIt looks like a normal scene in a school playground - pupils arriving with their heavy rucksacks and friends chatting in little groups.\nBut behind the apparent normality at Honley High School, in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, as in many schools, Covid cases are rising fast. Between the first week of term and the third, cases rose eightfold, to 156.\n\"It feels like a normal school again,\" Deputy head teacher Liz Lord says. \"But at the same time, we're dealing with, unfortunately, a rise in the number of Covid cases. \n\"It causes concern and it causes worry. The number of school Covid cases is higher than it was in the summer.\n\"But it hasn't got the same level of disruption, because we're not sending kids around the person who is ill home to self-isolate any more.\" \nRead more: How are schools managing Covid?\nAssociation of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said he was writing urgently to new Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi to ask what action he would be taking.\n\"These grim statistics show a big increase in the number of pupils out of school as a result of the continuing havoc caused by Coronavirus,\" he said. \n\"We are hearing from schools where there are 10% or more of pupils absent and where staff are also off work because of the virus. \n\"Teaching and learning is very difficult in these circumstances and it is clear that the educational disruption of the past 18 months is far from being over.\"\nThe National Association of Head Teachers is particularly concerned about the rule siblings of confirmed cases do not have to isolate.\nGeneral secretary Paul Whiteman said: \"School leaders want the government to revisit its guidance, particularly when it comes to contact tracing and self-isolation. \n\"No-one wants to see a child miss any time off school but there is a real risk that the current policy is inadvertently leading to more children missing school in the long run.\""

      "text": "Amazon is expanding its presence on the High Street by opening its first non-food store in the UK.\nThe shop, in the Bluewater shopping mall near Dartford, will sell around 2,000 of its most popular and best-rated products.\nIt's called Amazon 4-star, because every item has been given more than four stars by customers.\nHowever, one retail expert said the shop could be \"muddled and uninspiring\".\nThis will be the first Amazon 4-star store outside the US, where there are already more than 30 outlets. \nThe range of products, which takes in books, consumer electronics, toys, games and homeware, reflects what Amazon customers are buying online.\nThere's a \"Most Wished For\" section, for instance, showing the most popular products from customers' wish lists. \nDigital price tags are used to ensure the prices are the same in-store and online. Shoppers don't need to have an Amazon account to use it. \nAnd customers will also be able to collect items ordered online as well as return items without the need for packaging and labels.\nAndy Jones, director of Amazon 4-star UK, declined to say how many more stores he plans to open in the UK.\nThis global giant is often accused of killing the High Street by undercutting traditional retailers and paying less tax.\nNow it's moving onto their physical patch as well. \nHowever, retail expert Natalie Berg said the Amazon move \"is purely about experimentation\".\nThe giant's aim, she said, is to encourage more online shopping.\n\"This is not about shifting more product; it's about baiting shoppers into Amazon's ecosystem,\" Ms Berg said. \n\"It's about getting shoppers to engage with Amazon's devices, reminding Prime customers of the value in their memberships, and offering additional choice when it comes to collection and returns of online orders.\" \nAmazon has already opened six grocery convenience stores in the UK with checkout-free technology. \nBut Ms Berg said the jury is still out as to whether the world's most disruptive retailer can do one of the most fundamental retail tasks - run stores. \n\"The 4-star concept has the potential to be a bit muddled and uninspiring,\" she said.\n\"The store features a smorgasbord of products, the result of Amazon's very scientific, data-led approach to physical retail.\n\"But when you strip out the high-tech touches, I struggle to see how it differentiates from any other retailer,\" says Ms Berg. \nLandlords, though, may welcome the move as they try to find new players to take on empty shops, driven largely by our shopping habits moving online."

      "text": "Russia has taken the lead in a space race with a difference, sending a team to the International Space Station to shoot a feature film ahead of an American crew.\nYulia Peresild, 37, is set to star in the film, directed by Klim Shipenko. \nTheir Soyuz MS-19 spacecraft took off from Baikonur in Kazakhstan, and three hours later docked with the International Space Station.\nUS actor Tom Cruise and Nasa have also been planning to make a film there.\nThere was more than a touch of show business glamour when the Soyuz crew launched on Tuesday, as the TV cameras focused on Peresild and her 12-year-old daughter Anna, who was watching from a safe distance.\nIt was from the Kazakh steppes where camels and susliks (ground squirrels) roam, rather than in the studios of Hollywood, that real actors went into space, said Russia's Komsomolskaya Pravda website. Shipenko's actress wife Sofia Karpunina noted that the director had had to shed 15kg (33lbs) beforehand.\nThe launch, led by cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov, went according to plan at 11:55 Moscow time (08:55 GMT). \"The crew is feeling well,\" said the commander shortly after take-off.\nThe Soyuz docked with the ISS a little over three hours afterwards. However, it was a little later than planned as the Soyuz's automatic Kurs docking system failed and the commander had to switch to manual control.\nShkaplerov would normally have had the help of a flight engineer but his two colleagues would have been unable to help him, despite their fast-track flight training.\nEventually the hatch connecting the Soyuz to the ISS opened and the crew joined the seven others waiting in the Russian section of the ISS.\n\"The hatch is open! Everything as planned,\" tweeted Roscosmos space agency chief Dmitry Rogozin.\nAlthough Shkaplerov will stay on board, director and actress have just 12 days to film their scenes in space, with Peresild playing a cardiac surgeon sent into orbit to save a cosmonaut. Two of the Russian cosmonauts already on board, Oleg Novitsky and Pyotr Dubrov, will also take part in the film, reports say.\nFilming will take part in the Russian section of the ISS and the mission has proved contentious in Russia's space industry.\nThe feature film is the brainchild of the Roscosmos chief, who at one point fired the space agency's head of crewed missions in a row over the project. \nSergei Krikalev, a veteran of space missions, got his job back days later amid widespread anger at his sacking.\nAnother cosmonaut, Mikhail Kornienko, told BBC Russian he was one of many who were opposed to it. \"The ISS is no place for performers, all sorts of clowns or tourists. It's a huge space lab and you shouldn't get in the way of professional work.\"\nThe film is being funded by Russia's Channel One TV, and a Roscosmos subsidiary said it would not require money from the federal budget.\nRussia's space agency has had a troubled few years, with corruption overshadowing the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.\nIts long-delayed Nauka laboratory finally arrived at the space station during the summer, 14 years after it was due to for launch.\nRussia has warned it could pull out of the ISS within four years, because of its ageing hardware on board."

      "tags": "UK economy,Fuel,Haulage",
      "text": "Fuel supplies to petrol stations in London and the south-east of England are improving but still remain behind the rest of the country, retailers say.\nThe Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said 64% of forecourts in those areas had both types of fuel compared to 86% of sites nationally.\nSupplies have increased in recent days after the military was deployed amid a shortage of fuel tanker drivers.\nThe government is offering 300 short-term visas to overseas lorry drivers.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said 127 foreign drivers had applied for visas aimed at tackling shortages, however, the Department for Business said only 27 drivers had been identified. It has not confirmed what Mr Johnson's number was referring to.\nThe Times reported that just 27 people from the European Union had applied to be tanker drivers. \nThe PRA, which represents independent forecourts across the UK, said \"steady deliveries and stabilising demand\" had led to improvements in stocks across the country.\nGordon Balmer, PRA executive director, said 15% of sites in London and the south-east of England still had no fuel, down from 20% on Monday.\n\"Whilst there has been a significant reduction in dry sites, these areas are still lagging behind in having both grades of fuel available compared to the rest of the UK,\" he said.\nNationally, the percentage of dry sites increased from 8% to 11% on Tuesday, the PRA said.\n\"Members are reporting they are now receiving deliveries from military drivers using commercial tankers, however further action must be taken to address the needs of disproportionately affected areas.\"\nBesides fuel drivers, the government is offering a further 4,700 temporary visas in total for foreign food lorry drivers, which will last from late October to the end of February, in an attempt to avoid other supply chain issues. It is not yet known how many people have applied to this scheme.\nMr Johnson said the slow rate of visa applications was a \"fascinating illustration of the problem\", which he added was a \"global\" issue, thought he admitted there was a \"particular problem in the UK\".\nHe said working in road haulage \"should be a great job\", but added that there had been an underinvestment in facilities and pay conditions. \nHe dismissed the suggestion that the problem was anything to do with Brexit. He noted the \"supply chain problem is linked to recovery\" and said other parts of the world were also affected.\n\"Imagine the UK has been in deep freeze and the pipes are unfreezing right now - stresses and strain of the economy waking up,\" Mr Johnson said.\nThe Road Haulage Association (RHA) said the small number of visa applications was the \"proof in the pudding\" that short-term visas were \"not going to be attractive\".\nA spokesman for the trade body said that for visas to be an attractive proposition to overseas lorry drivers, they needed to last 12 months.\n\"The reality is that we have to assume these drivers from abroad are already in employment elsewhere. If visas are only three months... it's unlikely there is going to be much take up,\" he added.\nLivia Spera, general secretary of the European Transport Workers' Federation, said she was \"not surprised\" drivers were not \"rushing to sign up for visas\".\n\"We already predicted and warned that short-term measures such as visas wouldn't work,\" she added.\nMs Spera said there was \"no quick fix\" to the problem. She said increasing driver wages and improving working conditions was the \"only answer to the crisis\".\nIn response to the prime minister's comments on roadside facilities, the RHA's Rod McKenzie said it was a \"false premise\" that a trade body could deal with the issue alone.\n\"The majority of hauliers are small companies, less than 10 lorries,\" he said. \"It requires government commitment to facilitate the development of commercial sites.\n\"Government departments however have consistently ignored industry calls to press for cleaner and safer facilities on our roads.\"\nTrade bodies have estimated the UK currently has a shortage of about 90,000 HGV drivers, which has been caused by several factors, including the coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and an ageing workforce.\nThe shortages have started to affect supply chains in recent months, with some supermarkets struggling to stock certain products and petrol stations being unable to stock enough fuel to meet demand.\nThe government has said temporary visas are not a long-term solution and has urged firms to invest in a UK workforce.\nMr Johnson said the UK economy could not \"go back to the failed model where you mainline low-wage, low-skilled labour\". \n\"It's time for investing in people and skills.\""
