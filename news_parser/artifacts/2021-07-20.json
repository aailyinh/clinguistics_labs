      "tags": "Sleep,UK heatwaves",
      "text": "With much of the UK experiencing high temperatures, the difficulty of getting a good night's sleep will be on many people's minds. \nBut there are things you can do to beat the heat.\nHot weather can make us feel a bit lethargic during the day. That's because we're using more energy to regulate our internal temperature.  \nBut if your sleep is disturbed at night, try to avoid napping during the day. When it's hot, sleepiness can be precious - save it for bedtime. \nHot weather can encourage you to change your habits. Don't. That can disrupt sleep.\nTry to keep to your usual bedtime and routines. Do the things you normally do before bed.\nTake steps to make sure your bedroom is as cool as it can be at night.\nDuring the day, draw the curtains or blinds to keep the sun out. Make sure you close the windows on the sunny side of your home, to keep hot air out.\nOpen all the windows before you go to bed, to get a through breeze.\nReduce your bedding but keep covers handy. Thin cotton sheets will absorb sweat.\nHowever hot it is in your bedroom, your body temperature will fall during the night. That's why we sometimes wake up feeling cold. \nUsing even a small fan can be sensible in hot weather, especially when it's humid.\nIt encourages the evaporation of sweat and makes it easier for your body to regulate your internal temperature. \nIf you don't have a fan, try filling your hot water bottle with ice cold liquid instead. \nAlternatively, cool socks in the fridge and put those on. Cooling your feet lowers the overall temperature of your skin and body. \nDrink enough water throughout the day but avoid drinking very large amounts before bed. \nYou probably don't want to wake up thirsty - but you don't want to take an additional trip to the bathroom in the early hours either. \nBe careful about soft drinks. Many contain large amounts of caffeine, which stimulates the central nervous system and makes us feel more awake.\nAvoid drinking too much alcohol as well. Many people drink more when the weather is hot. \nAlcohol might help us fall asleep but it promotes early morning waking and a poorer quality of sleep overall. \nIf you're struggling to sleep, get up and do something calming. Try reading, writing, or even folding your socks. \nJust make sure you don't play on your phone or a video game - the blue light makes us feel less sleepy and the activity is stimulating.\nReturn to bed when you feel sleepy.\nChildren are usually quite robust sleepers - but they are very sensitive to changes in family \"mood\" and routine. Make sure usual bedtimes and bath times don't go out of the window just because it's warm. \nAs part of the bedtime routine, lukewarm baths are recommended by the NHS UK website. Make sure they aren't too cold, as that will boost circulation (your body's way of keeping warm).\nA baby can't let you know if they're too hot or too cold, so it's important to monitor their temperature. They'll sleep best when the temperature is kept between 16C and 20C.\nYou could install a thermometer where the baby is sleeping or check their forehead, back or stomach to see if they feel hot to the touch. \nMost of us need about seven to eight hours of good-quality sleep each night to function properly. \nBut remember that most people can function well after a night or two of disturbed sleep. \nAlthough you might yawn a little more frequently than usual, you'll probably be fine. \nThese tips were based on suggestions by Prof Kevin Morgan, former director of the Clinical Sleep Research Unit at Loughborough University, and Lisa Artis, of the Sleep Council. This article was first published in July 2019."

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson was reluctant to tighten Covid restrictions as cases rose last autumn because he thought people dying from it were \"essentially all over 80\", Dominic Cummings has claimed.\nHe also said the prime minister had messaged him to say: \"I no longer buy all this NHS overwhelmed stuff.\"\nMr Johnson had wanted to let Covid \"wash through the country\" rather than destroy the economy, Mr Cummings said.\nThe claims came in an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.\nIt is the first time Mr Cummings - Mr Johnson's former chief adviser - has given a one-on-one TV interview during his career in politics.\nIn response, Downing Street said the prime minister had taken the \"necessary action to protect lives and livelihoods, guided by the best scientific advice\" throughout the pandemic.\nAnd the government had prevented the NHS \"from being overwhelmed through three national lockdowns\", a spokesperson added.\nIn a wide-ranging interview, Mr Cummings also said that, near the start of the pandemic last year, Mr Johnson had wanted to keep his weekly face-to-face meetings with the Queen going - but he had to warn his boss that she might die if she caught coronavirus.\nAnd he defended his controversial decision to drive to his parents' farm in County Durham after the first lockdown started, but admitted he had not \"come clean\" about all the reasons behind it, including \"security concerns\" around his family home in London.\nThis is the first major interview Mr Cummings has given, but he has answered MPs' questions on the government's response to Covid.\nThe claims made at that session were explosive, but he's since been criticised for failing to provide the evidence to back up some of those assertions.\nDominic Cummings: The Interview will be broadcast in the UK on BBC Two at 19:00 BST on Tuesday, and it will be available on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds\nCovid cases dipped last summer but began to rise rapidly again as autumn started, prompting a debate within government about what measures were needed.\nMr Cummings told the BBC that he, UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty had pushed for tougher restrictions from mid-September - Sir Patrick and Professor Whitty declined to comment.\nMr Cummings went on to allege Mr Johnson had said: \"No, no no, no, no, I'm not doing it.\"\nThe prime minister had \"parts of the media and Tory party screaming\" not to increase restrictions and \"always referred\" to the Daily Telegraph, for which he had previously written a column, as \"my real boss\", Mr Cummings said.\nOn 13 October, with Covid deaths having risen to more than 100 a day, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for a \"circuit-breaker\" lockdown of two to three weeks, but the government decided against this.\nIn a WhatsApp message sent on 15 October, shared with the BBC, Mr Johnson appears to have described himself as \"slightly rocked by some of the data on Covid fatalities\".\nThe \"median age\" for those dying was between 81 and 82 for men and 85 for women, the prime minister allegedly wrote, adding: \"That is above life expectancy. So get Covid and Live longer.\n\"Hardly anyone under 60 goes into hospital... and of those virtually all survive. And I no longer buy all this NHS overwhelmed stuff. Folks I think we may need to recalibrate... There are max 3m in this country aged over 80.\"\nHe reportedly went on to write: \"It shows we don't go for nationwide lockdown.\"\nBut on 31 October the prime minister announced a four-week lockdown for England to begin on 5 November, saying this was needed to protect the NHS as figures suggested deaths could reach \"several thousand a day\" without \"tough action\".\nSpeaking on Tuesday, Business Minister Paul Scully defended the PM's actions during the autumn, adding that economic restrictions also had an impact on people's health and lives and \"you have to take all of those factors into account\".\nHe said the 17-day so-called firebreak lockdown in Wales, introduced around two weeks before England's autumn lockdown, \"didn't have a particularly big effect at the time\".\n\"These decisions are not quite as black and white as necessarily we can make them now,\" he told Radio 4's Today programme. \nLooking back to the start of the pandemic, Mr Cummings told the BBC he had intervened to stop Mr Johnson continuing to see the Queen, then aged 93, for weekly face-to-face meetings.\nMr Cummings claimed that, on 18 March last year, the PM had said: \"I'm going to see the Queen... That's what I do every Wednesday. Sod this. I'm going to go and see her.\"\nHe added that he had told Mr Johnson: \"There's people in this office who are isolating. You might have coronavirus. I might have coronavirus.\n\"You can't go and see the Queen. What if you go and see her and give the Queen coronavirus? You obviously can't go.\"\nHe continued: \"I just said, 'If you give her coronavirus and she dies, what are you going to [do]? You can't do that. You can't risk that. That's completely insane.'\n\"And [the PM] said - he basically just hadn't thought it through - 'Yeah...I can't go'.\"\nDowning Street denied that this incident took place and Buckingham Palace declined to comment.\nOn 27 March last year, four days after the first lockdown began, Mr Cummings drove his wife and son from London to his parents' farm in County Durham.\nWhile staying there, he made a 30-mile road journey to Barnard Castle on 12 April, which he later said had been to test his eyesight before the 260-mile drive back to London.\nWhen these details were revealed they provoked huge anger - and accusations of double standards at a time when the government had banned all but essential long-distance travel.\nIn his BBC interview, Mr Cummings said that, during the Barnard Castle trip, he had been trying to work out \"Do I feel OK driving?\"\nHe also said he had decided to move his family to County Durham before his wife fell ill with suspected Covid because of security concerns over his home in London.\nAsked why he had given a story that was \"not the 100% truth\" when he held a special press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on 25 May, Mr Cummings admitted that \"the way we handled the whole thing was wrong\".\n\"What I should have done is either just resigned and said nothing about anything,\" he said, \"or I should have spoken to my family and said, 'Listen, we're just gonna have to come clean about the whole thing.'\"\nMr Cummings was repeatedly challenged throughout the interview to back up his version of events.\nHe says many of his claims will be corroborated if there is a public inquiry.\nLabour's shadow health minister Justin Madders said NHS workers, patients, and the relatives of Covid victims would find Mr Cummings's interview \"shocking and difficult to hear\".\n\"The revelations are further evidence that the prime minister has made the wrong calls time and again at the expense of public health,\" he added. \n\"Boris Johnson is reckless, unfit to govern and a public inquiry cannot be delayed\".\nA Downing Street spokesperson said: \"Since the start of the pandemic, the prime minister has taken the necessary action to protect lives and livelihoods, guided by the best scientific advice.\n\"The government he leads has delivered the fastest vaccination rollout in Europe, saved millions of jobs through the furlough scheme and prevented the NHS from being overwhelmed through three national lockdowns.\n\"The government is entirely focused on emerging cautiously from the pandemic and building back better.\"\nSir Iain Duncan Smith - who briefly employed Mr Cummings as an adviser when he was Conservative leader, said the prime minister should be judged on the decisions he made, rather than the processes that led up to them.\nOf Mr Cummings, he said: \"He obviously is a very bitter man, I know I employed him, I sacked him. I know exactly how he works, this will go on for some time.\""

      "tags": "Welsh Ambulance Service,Swansea,UK heatwaves",
      "text": "People have been walking into A&E with life-threatening conditions because of ambulance delays during the heatwave, a hospital boss has said.\nMorriston Hospital in Swansea made the revelation amid a 30% rise in life-threatening \"red\" calls to the Welsh Ambulance Service in the past week.\nOn Monday, ambulance chiefs said the service was at risk of being disrupted.\nIt said the hot weather and hospital delays meant demand had overtaken its capacity to respond safely.\nAn extreme heat warning - the UK's first - is in place across large parts of Wales and southern England until Thursday.\nMorriston Hospital said the heatwave was putting an additional strain on health services which were already experiencing high demand.\nWelsh Ambulance Service Trust (WAST) figures showed overall calls had risen by 11% compared to last Monday, with red category calls up by almost 30%, and were up 29% compared to the same Monday last year.\nIt responded by asking people to make their own way to hospital in some cases.\nWAST operations director Lee Brooks said: \"Yesterday's heat, coupled with the delays at hospitals, meant we reached a point in the early evening where demand actually overtook our capacity to respond in a safe and timely way.\n\"For anyone who had an excessive wait for an ambulance yesterday, we are very sorry for your experience and this is not the service we want to provide.\"\nMr Brooks said there was a \"significant step change\" on Saturday.\n\"I think we've had the culmination of further easing of restrictions here in Wales, the start of the holiday period and of course the sharp rise in temperatures,\" he said.\nMr Brooks said the service was more stable on Tuesday but urged people only to call 999 \"if a life is on the line\".\nMark Poulden, clinical director of emergency medicine at Morriston, said: \"Like emergency departments across Wales, Morriston Hospital has been seeing higher numbers of sicker patients coming through the doors for some time.\n\"As the Welsh Ambulance Service is under extreme pressure, we have begun seeing patients walk in with life-threatening conditions. \n\"All of this has a knock-on effect of increasing waiting times for those with less serious injuries or illnesses.\"\nKevin McKeown, who has epilepsy and mental health issues, needed an ambulance after falling down stairs at Grange Lodge care home.\nHis sister, Amanda Wells, said staff at the home on Clive Road, Cardiff, called the service to ask for an ambulance and were told 'no'.\n\"He's got a broken collar bone, a punctured lung, broken ribs, a gash on his head, because he was bleeding so badly,\" Ms Wells said. \n\"The care home had to take him in themselves, which they were very concerned about because they didn't want to move him, in case they caused any more damage.\"\nShe said she had \"had nothing\" from the ambulance service\nMs Wells added: \"I've tried speaking to members of the Senedd, I've tried contacting the ambulance service, the Welsh government, and nobody has spoken to me.\n\"They want me to send an email instead, and that's not good enough\".\nWAST said it was \"sorry\" and \"concerned\" to hear of Mr McKeown's injuries and was experiencing \"incredibly high demand\" at the time of the 999 call. \n\"We will be reaching out to Mr McKeown's family to fully hear and explore their concerns,\" a spokesman added."

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Boris Johnson,Leave campaigns spending investigations,Brexit,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Dominic Cummings was never going to go quietly after being forced out of Downing Street at the end of last year.\nBut the number, and seriousness, of his claims about what went on at the heart of government, as ministers battled to get on top of the coronavirus crisis, are unprecedented in modern times.\nRarely has a former adviser made so many potentially damaging revelations about a sitting prime minister.\nHis critics say Mr Cummings is motivated by revenge against Boris Johnson, and will not rest until the PM has been removed from No 10.\nMr Cummings insists he is driven by a desire to make what he views as a broken and chaotic government machine work better in future. \nHe left his Downing Street role following an internal power struggle, amid claims the PM's then-fiancee had blocked the promotion of one of his allies, Lee Cain, after months of internal warfare.\nIn his final year at Downing Street, Mr Cummings had a \u00a340,000 pay rise, taking his salary to between \u00a3140,000 and \u00a3144,999.\nThere was speculation that the 49-year-old would seek a post-politics career as the first head of Aria, the UK's new \"high risk\" science agency, which had been one of his pet projects.\nBut he appears to have a different career path in mind. \nIn February, he started a technology consultancy firm, Siwah Ltd. He is the sole director of the firm, according to Companies House, and it is registered at an address in his native Durham, in north-east England. This would appear to be a successor to Dynamic Maps, his previous tech consultancy. \nBut in recent months, most of his time appears to have been taken up with spilling the beans on his time in government.\nThe BBC did not pay Mr Cummings for his exclusive interview with political editor Laura Kuenssberg.\nAnd he has not yet taken the time-honoured route of selling his story to a newspaper, or signing a book deal.\nBut he has found a way of generating income through online platform Substack, where he has launched a newsletter.\nHe plans to give out information on the coronavirus pandemic and his time in Downing Street for free, but \"more recondite stuff on the media, Westminster, 'inside No 10', how did we get Brexit done in 2019, the 2019 election etc\" will only be available to subscribers who pay \u00a310 a month.\nHe is also offering his marketing and election campaigning expertise, for fees that \"slide from zero to lots depending on who you are / your project\".\nThis new venture has incurred the wrath of Whitehall watchdog Lord Pickles, who chairs the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which vets jobs taken by former ministers and top officials.\nIn a letter to Cabinet Office Minister Micheal Gove, he says Mr Cummings has sought advice on working as a consultant. \nBut he adds: \"It appears that Mr Cummings is offering various services for payment via a blog hosted on Substack, the blog for which he is also receiving subscription payments.\n\"Mr Cummings has failed to seek the committee's advice on this commercial undertaking, nor has the committee received the courtesy of a reply to our letter requesting an explanation.\n\"Failure to seek and await advice before taking up work is a breach of the government's rules.\" \nThere are few repercussions for failing to consult Acoba, however.\nLittle was heard from Mr Cummings for several months after his departure from Downing Street - but that all changed in April.\nAfter being named in media reports as the source of government leaks, he launched a scathing attack on Mr Johnson via a 1,000-word blog post in April.\nAs well as denying he was behind the leaks, he went on to make a series of accusations against the PM and questioned his \"competence and integrity\". \nThe following month, Mr Cummings expanded on his criticisms at a seven-hour select committee appearance, declaring Boris Johnson \"unfit for the job\", and claiming he had ignored scientific advice and wrongly delayed lockdowns.\nHe also turned his fire on then-health secretary Matt Hancock, who he said should have been fired for lying.\nThis sparked a bitter war of words with Mr Hancock, who flatly denied all of Mr Cummings's allegations.\nIt thrust Mr Cummings back into the spotlight for the first time since his now infamous visit to County Durham, four days after the start of the first national lockdown, in March last year.\nWhile staying with his family at his father's farm, he made a 30-mile road journey to Barnard Castle, which he later said had been to test his eyesight before the 260-mile drive back to London.\nThis revelation - at a specially-convened press conference in the Downing Street garden - made Mr Cummings a household name and led to furious allegations of double standards at a time when the government had banned all but essential long-distance travel.\nIn an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Cummings said that, during the Barnard Castle trip, he had been trying to work out \"Do I feel OK driving?\"\nHe also said he had decided to move his family to County Durham before his wife fell ill with suspected Covid because of security concerns over his home in London.\nAsked why he had given a story that was \"not the 100% truth\" when he held a special press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on 25 May, Mr Cummings admitted that \"the way we handled the whole thing was wrong\".\nBoris Johnson stood by his adviser throughout the Barnard Castle episode - to the consternation of some of his supporters, who feared it was undermining his attempts to hold the country together during a national crisis. \nSome said the episode burned through the political capital the prime minister had generated months earlier during the 2019 general election.\nBut it is hard to overstate how important Mr Cummings was to the Johnson project.\nThe two are very different characters - Mr Johnson likes to be popular, Mr Cummings appears indifferent to such concerns - but they formed a strong bond in the white heat of the 2016 Vote Leave campaign to get Britain out of the EU, which Mr Cummings led as campaign director. \nThe combination of Mr Johnson, the flamboyant household-name frontman, with Mr Cummings, the ruthless, data-driven strategist, with a flair for an eye-catching slogan, proved to be unbeatable. \nMr Cummings was credited with formulating the \"take back control\" slogan that appears to have struck a chord with so many referendum voters, changing the course of British history.\nYet some were surprised when Mr Cummings was brought into the heart of government as Mr Johnson's chief adviser, given his past record of rubbing senior Tory politicians up the wrong way.\nIt proved to be a shrewd move. It was Mr Cummings who devised the high-risk strategy of pushing for the 2019 election to be fought on a \"Get Brexit Done\" ticket, focusing on winning seats in Labour heartlands, something no previous Tory leader had managed to do in decades. \nMany of the policy ideas that have shaped the Johnson government's agenda have his fingerprints all over them.\n\"Levelling up\" - moving power and money out of London and the South East of England - is a Cummings project, as are plans to shake-up the civil service, take on the judiciary and reform the planning system.\nThe team that surrounded Mr Cummings at Downing Street, some of whom are Vote Leave veterans, were fiercely loyal to him and shared a sense that they were outsiders in Whitehall, battling an entrenched \"elite\".\nLee Cain, the former Downing Street and Vote Leave communications chief, left No 10 just before Mr Cummings did.\nThere had been rumours of a rift between the Vote Leave veterans and other No 10 aides, who didn't like Mr Cummings's and Mr Cain's abrasive style.\nThere were tales of crackdowns on special advisers suspected of leaking to the media and angry, dismissive behaviour towards Tory MPs, civil servants and even secretaries of state.\nNone of this will have come as much of a surprise to veteran Cummings watchers.\nMr Cummings has been in and around the upper reaches of government and the Conservative Party for nearly two decades, and has made a career out of defying conventional wisdom and challenging the established order.\nBut he has never been a member of the Conservative Party, or any party, and appears to have little time for most MPs.\nA longstanding Eurosceptic who cut his campaigning teeth as a director of the anti-euro Business for Sterling group, Mr Cummings's other passion is changing the way government operates.\nHe grabbed headlines when he posted an advert on his personal blog for \"weirdos and misfits with odd skills\" to work in government, arguing that the civil service lacked \"deep expertise\" in many policy areas.\nMr Cummings is a native of Durham, in the North East of England. His father, Robert, was an oil rig engineer and his mother, Morag, a teacher and behavioural specialist.\nHe went to a state primary school and was then privately educated at Durham School. He graduated from Oxford University with a first-class degree in modern history and spent some time in Russia, where he was involved with an ill-fated attempt to launch an airline, among other projects.\nHe is married to Spectator journalist Mary Wakefield, the daughter of aristocrat Sir Humphry Wakefield, whose family seat is Chillingam Castle, in Northumberland.\nAfter a stint as campaign director for Business for Sterling, Mr Cummings spent eight months as chief strategy adviser to then Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who fired him.\nHe played a key role in the 2004 campaign against an elected regional assembly in his native North East.\nIn what turned out to be a dry run for the Brexit campaign, the North East Says No team won the referendum with a mix of eye-catching stunts - including an inflatable white elephant - and snappy slogans that tapped into the growing anti-politics mood among the public.\nHe is then said to have retreated to his father's farm, in County Durham, where he spent his time reading science and history books in an effort to attain a better understanding of the world.\nHe re-emerged in 2007 as a special adviser to Michael Gove, who became education secretary in 2010 and turned out to be something of a kindred spirit. \nThe pair would rail against what they called \"the blob\" - the informal alliance of senior civil servants and teachers' unions that sought, in their opinion, to frustrate their attempts at reform. \nHe left of his own accord to set up a free school, having alienated a number of senior people in the education ministry and the Conservative Party.\nHe once described former Brexit Secretary David Davis as \"thick as mince\" and as \"lazy as a toad\" and irritated David Cameron, the then prime minister, who called him a \"career psychopath\". \nHis appointment as head of the Vote Leave campaign - dramatised in Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War - was seen as a risk worth taking by those putting the campaign together but he left a controversial legacy.\nVote Leave was found to have broken electoral law over spending limits by the Electoral Commission and Mr Cummings was held in contempt of Parliament for failing to respond to a summons to appear before and give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. \nLike most advisers, he shunned media interviews when he was in government, and his rare appearances before MPs were characterised by animosity on both sides.\nAll that has changed in recent weeks, but it would be a brave person who said he had now joined the ranks of the former Westminster insiders who make their living as pundits - a class he appears to view with as much disdain as he does his former colleagues in government."

      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus vaccines,Robin Swann,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser has said he is concerned about the uptake of vaccination. \nProf Ian Young said about 18% of adults have still not come forward for their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.\nIt comes as Health Minister Robin Swann said first doses of the vaccine will end at Northern Ireland's mass vaccination centres on 31 July.\nMr Swann said the vaccination programme would not be available indefinitely. \nVaccination centres are sited at the SSE Arena in Belfast, as well as the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, Foyle Arena in Londonderry, Omagh Leisure Centre, Lakeland Forum, South Lake Craigavon and the Seven Towers in Ballymena.\nA total of 2,175,663 Covid-19 vaccines had been administered in Northern Ireland as of Tuesday afternoon.\nOf those, 1,187,005 were first doses and 988,658 were second doses.\nNorthern Ireland's rate is the lowest in the UK.\nReferring to those who had not come forward for vaccines, Prof Young said: \"That means 18% who are just as susceptible to the most severe effects of Covid as they were earlier in the epidemic.\"\nHe said he was also very concerned about the rise in cases and hospital admissions in Northern Ireland. \n\"Pressures on our hospitals have been very significant all through the summer for multiple reasons,\" he said. \n\"Certainly adding a significantly increased number of Covid admissions on top of that is going to bring considerable pressures to bear and I know our hospitals are thinking carefully about how they can best manage and cope with that as we go through the next six to eight weeks.\n\"Unfortunately I think that there will be some increases in deaths, which is inevitable as a result of a very large number of cases leading to quite a large number of hospitalisations and patients in critical care.\n\"But the number of deaths, the proportion of deaths from Covid, will be much less than in previous waves of the epidemic as a result of the impacts of vaccination and of improved treatments, which have gradually come into place during the last 18 months.\"\nAnother 1,138 positive cases were reported by the Department of Health on Tuesday. This includes samples taken in recent days, not necessarily in the last 24 hours.\nThe Department of Health is continuing to operate a number of walk-in Covid-19 vaccine clinics across Northern Ireland this week.\nThe appointment-free pop-ups were established as part of a \"final push\" to get younger people vaccinated.\nChief medical officer Sir Michael McBride said young people presenting for first doses in Northern Ireland is lower than other areas of the United Kingdom. \nSpeaking to the BBC's Nolan Show on Tuesday, he said: \"Unfortunately, over the past number of weeks, the number of people presenting to get a first dose of the vaccine has slowed quite significantly, particularly in the younger age groups.\"\nHe added: \"There is 6% more people in England, eight percent in Scotland and 10% more in Wales.\"\nSir Michael also discouraged young people from believing false vaccine rumours circulating on social media.\nHe estimated, based on current modelling, that by the end of this month Northern Ireland may exceed \"over 2,000 Covid-19 cases a day\" and \"by the middle of August that could be anywhere between 3,000 - 4,000 cases\". \nHe said if Northern Ireland could increase the number of people getting their first doses by 5% it could could reduce the number of new cases by half.\nThe chief medical officer said that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has provided interim advice on a booster vaccination programme in Northern Ireland.\nHe said it could be rolled out for over-50s and clinically vulnerable people from September.\nPatricia Donnelly, the head of Northern Ireland's vaccination campaign, said \"if you want to return to normality, do your part and come forward for vaccination\". \n\"Overall we've been very pleased, until we've reached this younger age group. It's our under 30s who have given us that lower overall up-take level,\" she said. \nThe health minister, Mr Swann, said there was a \"new surge in Covid cases\" and now was the right time to get vaccinated.\n\"A new surge in Covid cases is under way and getting your jab will protect you and others. It will also help our health service cope, by pushing down infection numbers and hospital admissions.\"\nHe said that aspects of the programme will have to be stood down in the coming weeks. \n\"We will maintain some provision for people who belatedly change their minds and decide they want a jab after all. But it won't be as convenient or as widely accessible as it is currently.\n\"We will have to start standing down the mass vaccination centres in August, with first doses there ending on 31 July. \n\"This will allow us to redeploy much-needed staff back into the health service. Also, the SSE Arena and the leisure centres that we've been using can't be commandeered for vaccination use forever.\"\nMr Swann said that GPs' role in the vaccination programme had shifted from first and second doses to preparing for the vaccine booster dose.\n\"It is simply not possible to maintain a mass vaccination programme of this nature as a permanent feature of our health service. That is an unavoidable fact,\" the minister said.\nOn Monday, it was confirmed that some children and young people aged over 12 in Northern Ireland are to be offered a Covid vaccine.\nOfficials say those with specific underlying health conditions and who are at risk of serious illness from the virus can now receive the Pfizer/BioNtech jab.\nTeenagers within three months of their 18th birthday can also get a jab.\nAt present health officials are not recommending routine universal vaccination of under-18s. \nThe list of eligibility currently includes those with severe neuro-disabilities, Down's Syndrome, underlying conditions resulting in immunosuppression, and those with profound and multiple learning disabilities, severe learning disabilities or who are on the learning disability register.  \nIn England, face coverings are no longer required by law and nightclubs have been allowed to reopen.\nDUP MP Sammy Wilson said Northern Ireland \"should quickly be moving to that situation\".\n\"We're not seeing the increase in deaths that was hanging over us when the discussions took the place - we're seeing impact vaccines has had in dealing with cases,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\nHe said he did not think teenagers should be given the vaccine.\n\"When you look that risk that children have from Covid, it's very low,\" he added."

      "text": "The Home Office advised against the Queen opening the future Welsh Assembly ahead of the devolution referendum in 1997, newly released papers show.\nAn official wrote such an event would not be appropriate, with the body not able make new laws at the start.\nAs it would be \"wholly subordinate\" to Westminster \"no question of direct relations with the sovereign would arise\", she wrote.\nThe monarch went on to attend the official opening of the body in 1999.\nThe 1997 files from the National Archives files also show that former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair was urged to visit Wales to bolster support in the vote on whether to set up the Welsh Assembly.  \nAfter the referendum took place a senior official blamed what he called the Welsh \"language mafia\" for the narrow result.\nThe assembly changed its name to the Welsh Parliament/Senedd Cymru in 2020.\nIt was established in 1999 following the referendum in September 1997, with 50.3% of voters supporting Yes and 49.7% voting No, on a turnout of 50.22%.\nWhen it was created it could not pass its own bills into law, but that changed in 2011 following a further referendum.\nA letter from a senior civil servant to the then Wales Office, dated 19 June 1997, said: \"Although it is intended that The Queen or Her representative should formally open the Scottish Parliament, we do not think that the same treatment would be appropriate for the Welsh Assembly, which has no primary legislative functions.\"\nIt added that there had been no discussion about it at a cabinet sub-committee on devolution, \"presumably because it was assumed that as a body wholly subordinate to the Westminster Parliament no question of direct relations with the sovereign would arise\". \nThe monarch, together with the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles, opened the Assembly on 27 May 1999.\nShe has visited the Cardiff Bay parliament on several occasions since, including the official opening of the Senedd building in 2007, and at the start of the last term in 2016.\nWelsh ministers also became appointees of the Crown in 2007.\nThe papers also show that a Downing Street official had urged Tony Blair to visit Wales ahead of the 1997 referendum to campaign for the assembly's creation.\nThe official said Welsh public opinion was \"finely balanced\" and Mr Blair should do his \"July regional tour there\". \nHowever, the official added: \"Watch out for the Welsh National Show. This is a ghastly cows and National Costume affair.\" \nThe former prime minister went on to take part in the pro-devolution campaign, visiting south Wales in July 1997.\nThe documents released by the National Archives also included a confidential memo which identified a number of issues with the Yes campaign, proffering suggestions on why the result was not more clear cut.\nIt highlighted an \"absence of clear political direction\" and \"no clear campaign strategy\".\nThe memo also suggested the campaign failed to adequately counter the accusation from the \"no\" campaign that people \"will be forced to speak Welsh\".\nPeter Hain, the parliamentary under-secretary for Wales, was said to be \"particularly concerned about the need to reform Wales' Labour Party\" to ensure it was both \"better at campaigning\" and offered \"proper opportunities for women candidates\".\nAnd Pat McFadden, a Downing Street aide who would become a Labour MP in 2005, agreed attacks over cost and allegations of an assembly creating \"jobs for the boys\" were successful \"because we could not advance a good positive reason for having an Assembly\".\nHe said: \"In other words, the cost would have been more defensible if it was for something people thought was worth having.\"\nHe added, in his note to Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair's chief of staff: \"On the Welsh language you know my view - this scared people in much of Wales who already resent the language mafia.\"\nMr Blair later said he \"steamrolled\" devolution into being in Wales despite objections from many within his party.

      "tags": "France,Emmanuel Macron,Cyber-attacks,Phone Hacking,Morocco",
      "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron is one of several world leaders believed to have been targeted for phone hacking using spyware, media reports say.\nThe software, known as Pegasus, infects phones and allows operators to spy on their targets. \nThe leaders are on a list of some 50,000 phone numbers of people believed to be of interest to clients of Israeli-based firm NSO Group. The list was leaked to major news outlets.\nNSO denies any wrongdoing.\nIt says the software is intended for use against criminals and terrorists.\nIt says it is made available only to military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies with good human rights records. \nThe original investigation which led to the reports - by Paris-based NGO Forbidden Stories and the human rights group Amnesty International - was \"full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories\", the Israel-based group said.\nThe reports are part of a series of news articles suggesting thousands of prominent people have been targeted.\nFrench newspaper Le Monde reports that Moroccan intelligence services identified a phone that Mr Macron had been using since 2017. \nMorocco has denied being a client of Israeli manufacturer of Pegasus.\nBeing on the list does not mean that the software was used but it does mean that the person was a potential target. \nIt is not clear if the software was ever installed on the French president's phone. \nNumbers on the leaked list are also said to include those of President Baram Salih of Iraq and South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa, as well as the current prime ministers of Pakistan, Egypt and Morocco, and the King of Morocco.\nMore than 600 government officials and politicians from 34 countries are on the list.\nThe French presidency said that if the revelations were true, they would be very serious. \nForeign leaders are always a top target for spies - intercepting their communications means uncovering their intentions and secrets. \nPoliticians and officials know they are frequently targeted but when this becomes public it can cause real fall-out.\nEspecially because it is not always just a country's adversaries who are involved. \nBack in 2013, it emerged that America's NSA was potentially tapping dozens of world leaders - including ally German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone, causing severe embarrassment and a fairly hefty diplomatic row.\nWhat is notable about the latest reports is that the possibility of carrying out surveillance against foreign leaders is now potentially for sale and available to a much wider range of states. \nIt is not clear how many of those on this list were actually targeted but even the possibility will do much to raise the pressure on NSO Group - and the governments who might have targeted other leaders.

      "tags": "Children,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "Children aged 12 to 15 are to be offered a second dose of the Covid vaccine.\nIt's in response to concerns about the newly identified Omicron variant.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - which advises the UK governments on vaccines - has said that 12 to 15-year-olds should be offered a second jab - to be given at least 12 weeks after the first.\nIt's one of of a number of measures the JCVI say should be carried out, in case the Omicron variant spreads more easily or is more severe than current types of Covid.\nChildren aged 16 and 17 are already being offered a second dose.\nEngland and Scotland have already said they will act on the JCVI's advice, and it is likely to be accepted in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nNo. When vaccination for 12-15s was first rolled out, Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said it would be as an \"offer\".\nHe said young people and their parents needed to be supported, and there should be no stigma attached to their choice.\nHealthy children aged 12 to 17 are advised to wait 12 weeks after testing positive for coronavirus before having their Covid jab.\nA four-week gap applies to children who are deemed at higher risk because of underlying health conditions, or because they live with vulnerable adults.\nAlthough parental consent is being sought, children under 16 who can prove they understand the risks and benefits can ask for the vaccine - or refuse it - if they disagree with their parents.\nThis important legal test of whether a child can consent to treatment is known as \"Gillick competence\". It is named after a famous dispute in which a teenager wanted contraceptive advice without her mother's consent.\nIn practice, it would be extremely unusual for a child under 13 to be judged Gillick-competent.\nTeenagers aged 16 and 17 don't need parental permission, unless there are exceptional circumstances. \nUnder-18s are being given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, although the Moderna vaccine has also been authorised for use in children in the UK.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for under-12s in the UK. \nThe MHRA - which regulates medicines in the UK - said today that despite initial concerns about side-effects in under-18s, monitoring and a \"thorough review\" had found the jab to be safe, with \"no new safety issues\". \nEarlier in the year, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said that Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were linked to extremely rare cases of heart inflammation in young men. However, the EMA said that the benefits of vaccination still far outweighed the risks. \nAlmost all children and young people are at very low risk from Covid-19. \nData for England suggests about 25 children died from Covid in the first 12 months of the pandemic. \nThe majority of them also had severe health problems, including complex neurodisabilities. \nOnly six had no recorded health conditions. \nIn the year to 31 August 2021, Public Health England statistics suggest there were about 50 deaths among under-19s.\nMany countries are vaccinating children over the age of 12.\nCorrection 21 September 2021: An earlier version of this article wrongly implied that the Gillick competence test was named after a case involving a mother and daughter and this line has been amended."

So, it's only fair on the staff that we give them a couple of days off... We didn't ever think we would close due to sun.\"\nOwner Simon Cole said he was also thinking of the customer enjoyment when making the decision.\n\"I went there and had a pint on my day off and the pint was warm within five minutes and it wasn't very nice,\" he told BBC Wales.\nHe said as well as the fridges, he had an ice machine which pumped out hot air and there was no air conditioning. Even the outdoor area which has a pergola was \"like a greenhouse\".\nThe temperature inside the bar when he opened up had registered 40C and a bottle of spirits he picked up was hot to the touch.\n\"It's mainly just for our staff to have a break and not have to endure the heat. I think they felt relief,\" he said.\n\"We have great staff. I messaged them at the weekend and they said it was awful.\n\"It's not worth the money to have upset staff. It's [only closing] for a few days.\"\nThe Stone Crab said on Facebook it was \"with a heavy heart and with deep thought\" that they have closed until Friday due to the Met Office's extreme temperature weather warnings.\n\"We cannot in good knowledge let our staff continue to suffer in this hot weather,\" their statement said.\n\"We have already been under significant pressure whilst working due to this heat wave, and the new warnings that have come out this evening make it unsafe for our staff to work, let alone the hours that we are all working due to staff shortages in the area.\"\nUnder UK law, there is no legal right to leave work when workplaces hit a certain temperature.\nHowever under the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992, employers have a legal obligation to provide a \"reasonable\" temperature in the workplace, although that does not mean they have to provide air conditioning, for example.\nBy 14:00 BST on Tuesday, Cardiff had recorded the highest temperature in Wales at 30.2C, with Usk in Monmouthshire and Llysdinam in Powys both registering 29.3C, the Met Office said.\nThe highest temperature of the year in Wales was set on Monday in Cardiff at 30.9C, and could still be beaten on Tuesday as temperatures are still rising.\nHealth services have issued advice to the public on how to stay cool and safe in the heat.\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service declared a business continuity incident - where service is at risk of being disrupted - because of pressure on its services and asked people to think carefully before calling an ambulance.\nIt said the easing of Covid-19 restrictions, coupled with the warm weather and an influx of holidaymakers and day-trippers to Wales, meant it was facing a busy summer period.\nCardiff and Vale University Health Board said its emergency unit remained very busy and asked people not to attend unless it was life-threatening but to ring for an appointment instead.\nHywel Dafydd, consultant plastic surgeon at Morriston Hospital's Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery, warned people to be very careful in the hot weather, especially in regard to protecting children.\n\"The UV index is very high at the moment, and so the risk of getting severe damage from the sun in the form of sunburn is very, very high and it will happen very quickly,\" he told BBC Wales.\n\"My advice primarily is to stay out of the sun, particularly in the height of the sun between the hours of 11am and 3pm, and if you do have to be in the sun then protect yourself by wearing high factor sun screen such as factor 50 and cover up by wearing long-sleeved light cotton or linen-type shirts, wear a wide-brimmed hat to protect your face, and sunglasses.\"\nHe said children who got a severe blistering sunburn before the age of 10 doubled their risk of getting melanoma skin cancer, which was more prevalent among people aged 16-30.\nExcess heat was also affecting transport.\nNetwork Rail said three watchmen were on the lines to monitor temperatures since early morning and had identified three places where speed restrictions were needed, including Llanbister in Powys, where trains were running at 20mph."

      "tags": "Agriculture,Aberystwyth,Health and Safety Executive ",
      "text": "The number of fatal farming accidents in Wales more than doubled last year, according to official figures.\nA report by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) showed there were seven deaths in 2020-21, compared with three in 2019-20.\nFarmer Alun Hopkins, 80, said he would take more care after he broke his ankle and spent two days in hospital when he was charged by a cow in February.\nThe HSE called it \"disappointing\" and urged farmers to call out bad practice.\nThe rise in Wales reflected a similar increase across the UK, where there were 41 fatal incidents in 2020-21, compared with 23 in 2019-20. \nThe provisional figure for 2020-21 was also higher than the UK five-year average of 33 deaths per year between 2016 and 2021.\nMore than half the fatal incidents in the UK involved people aged over 60, and there was also a large increase in victims among the 45-54 age group.\nThe main causes included moving vehicles, animals, contact with machinery and being struck by an object.\nAlun Hopkins was struck by a cow on his farm near the village of Pisgah, in Ceredigion, in February.\nHe said: \"I went to tag a newborn calf in the calving pen. The calf was quiet and I was on my way out when the cow hit me.\n\"I fell to the floor where she kept ramming me. I managed to fight her off, open the gate and limped up to the house.\"\nMr Hopkins was taken by air ambulance to Bronglais Hospital in Aberystwyth, where he spent two nights with a broken ankle.\nHe said: \"I was shocked more than anything. I've had a few hits before, but nothing like this.\"\nAlun said farmers should think twice before doing any job on the farm.\n\"I should have waited for my son to help me. One to tag the calf and one to watch the cow,\" he reflected.\n\"That's what will happen next time. I'm not going to risk it. It's happened once, it could happen again.\"\nAgriculture has the worst rate of fatal injury among workers of the main industrial sectors - 20 times higher than the all-industry rate, according to the HSE.\n\"It is not acceptable that agriculture continues to fail to manage risk in the workplace,\" said HSE's acting head of agriculture, Adrian Hodkinson.\n\"We need everyone to play their part to improve their behaviour, do things the right way and call out poor practices whenever they are seen.\"\nHe added: \"It is disappointing to be highlighting another high annual fatality rate in the industry when the causes are well known and the precautions to avoid injury are straightforward.\"\nBut a Welsh charity which provides a helpline for farmers said the extra stress and isolation caused by the pandemic may have contributed to an increase serious incidents.\n\"The more worries farmers face, the more stress they're under, the less help they have, the more likely you are to see accidents happening on farms,\" said Wyn Thomas, from the Tir Dewi organisation.\n\"It's a terrible state of affairs that farmers are so stressed and so worried about so many issues, that things go wrong and things happen.\"\nGlyn Davies, ambassador for the Wales Farm Safety Partnership, said his message to farmers was to \"take care\".\n\"Make sure you know what you're doing, prepare ahead, make sue you have the right equipment, think about what you're going to do, take a few seconds, a few minutes - that's the main thing,\" he said."

      "tags": "Policing,Violence against women,Sarah Everard murder",
      "text": "A top police officer will be put in charge of tackling violence against women and girls in England and Wales, the home secretary has announced.\nThe creation of the role was recommended in a report after 33-year-old Sarah Everard was murdered in March.\nHer death sparked a public debate about women's safety.\nThe new national policing lead is part of a broader strategy to deliver \"lasting change\", Priti Patel said.\nIt comes amid concern about record low rape conviction rates and a culture of sexual harassment in schools.\nMs Patel said the new policing lead would \"drive change\" to end \"abhorrent abuse and violence\" against women and girls.\n\"Every aspect of policing and criminal justice system must have a determined approach to ending violence against women and girls,\" she said.\nShe added that the new post would \"bring together the incredible work of police officers around the country and create a consistent response to ending these appalling crimes\".\nThe government's strategy to tackle violence against women and girls includes a 24-hour rape and sexual assault helpline, \u00a35m of funding to tackle violence in public places at night, and an online tool where women and girls can log areas where they have felt unsafe.\nIn a statement to the House of Commons on Wednesday evening, Home Office minister Victoria Atkins said the message from government was \"enough is enough\", before telling MPs: \"Through this strategy we will strive relentlessly to prevent these crimes, to support victims and to bring perpetrators to justice.\"\nHowever, shadow Home Office minister Jess Phillips said the government's strategy was \"not ambitious enough\".\nShe told MPs: \"The first responsibility of any government is the safety and security of its citizens.\n\"Today rape prosecutions are at a record low, domestic abuse in this country is soaring, charging is falling. Sexual abuse in schools is being normalised, according to the recent Ofsted inspections.\n\"Ending violence against women and girls is a cross-party issue, on all sides of this House there is a profound concern and desire for an ambitious strategy that would deliver. \n\"The strategy today is not ambitious enough.\"\nWomen's groups have been calling for new legislation to make sexual harassment of women in public places, such as wolf-whistling and lewd or sexual comments, to be made illegal.\nSpeaking in the Commons, Tory former minister Caroline Nokes said she was disappointed there is \"no current commitment to outlawing public sexual harassment\" and asked Ms Atkins to commit to \"identifying gaps\" in the law.\nMs Atkins vowed to appear before the Women and Equalities Committee, which Ms Nokes chairs, and that ministers were \"looking very thoroughly at the issue of street harassment\".\nMaya Tutton, co-founder of Our Streets Now - a campaign to end public sexual harassment in the UK, said existing legislation for these type of offences was \"piecemeal and antiquated\" and not written with public sexual harassment in mind.\nRose Caldwell, chief executive of Plan International UK - a charity promoting equality for girls, is urging the government to quickly review legal gaps -\u202fand\u202fthen\u202fcommit to a new\u202fpublic\u202f sexual\u202fharassment\u202flaw \"as a matter of urgency\".\u202f\u202f\u202f \n\"It is extraordinary that if a girl is going to school on the train and a man leans against her; presses his body against her, invades her space and whispers obscene comments in her ear, she is not protected by existing laws,\" she said. \nAre you scared to walk home alone at night? Have you been sexually harassed, abused or assaulted? Most women would answer yes to these questions.\nViolence against women has always been an issue. But in March the murder of Sarah Everard brought acute distress and anger. It changed the idea that women would remain silent about their experiences.\nAnd the launch of Everyone's Invited, where schoolgirls and students spoke out about their sexual assaults and rapes, shone a much needed light on what women were facing.\nThe government's reaction to this is, sensibly, to take a comprehensive approach trying to improve policing, transport, education, victim support and offender management.\nBut the scale of the problem and the lack of justice women face means solutions need to be on a grand scale. \nPlans including a few more million pounds to protect women out at night, an advertising campaign and a promise to look at new laws don't feel like enough to make an immediate difference.\nThe Association of Police and Crime Commissioners said it welcomed the \"whole system approach to tackling violence\" but added it would \"only succeed with sustainable funding\".\n\"It is tragic that it took the murder of Sarah Everard for society to recognise that violence against women and girls is an epidemic in this country,\" said Sophie Linden and Donna Jones, victims leads.\n\"We want all victims to feel safe coming forward to report, knowing that the police will listen and confident that justice will be served.\"\nMs Everard's death sparked vigils and protests calling for more action to tackle violence against women.\nIt prompted the government to reopen its Call for Evidence to inform its strategy, which was originally launched last December. \nThe 33-year-old was abducted by serving police officer Wayne Couzens as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham on 3 March. He has admitted murdering her.\nLast month, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland admitted in an interview with the BBC that budget cuts were partly to blame for record low rape conviction rates.\nIn the year to the end of March 2020, 58,856 cases of rape were recorded by police forces in England and Wales.\nThese led to just 2,102 prosecutions, compared with 3,043 in the previous 12 months.\nAnd in recent months, the Everyone's Invited website has revealed a culture of sexual harassment among some school students.\nSupport and resources for sexual abuse and violence are available via the BBC Action Line.\nHave you been affected by issues covered in this story?

      "tags": "Companies,HMV,Retailing,UK High Streets,Music",
      "text": "Music and entertainment retailer HMV has said it is looking to open 10 new stores this year as it continues to put its faith in High Street stores.\nThe plans include a search for a new London flagship site.\nIts former London landmark store on Oxford Street closed along with many others after HMV fell into administration more than two years ago. \nIt was bought by Canadian music retail executive Doug Putman, who says he still thinks stores have a future.\n\"People obviously love going out shopping, they like touching and feeling and that's something that online is not going to replace,\" he told the BBC.\n\"I do believe... you're going to get more people trying to open up different stores and have different ideas.\n\"I'm still very optimistic on the [HMV] business and business as a whole on the High Street. I still think the High Street is just something so special.\"\nThe new store plans were announced as HMV commemorates opening its first store on London's Oxford Street 100 years ago. \nHe said he could not give any details as to where the replacement flagship store in London would be as they were still taking a \"very hard look\" trying to find the best site. \nHowever, Mr Putman added that the long-term viability of the new stores was dependent on what the government did about business rates, which are currently being levied at a reduced rate until April next year.\nHMV would not be signing \"any long-term deals\" for the new stores, he said, given the level of uncertainty in the retail sector. \nAn HMV spokesman added: \"We're continuing to expand with new sites, looking at a combination of factors before making a decision. The upcoming business rates review will no doubt have an impact, not only on HMV, but on the wider British High Street. In some locations, even with good deals from landlords, rates make stores unviable.\"\nMr Putman said HMV's online business had done well throughout the pandemic, helping to offset the loss of sales in stores.\n\"Our online business - very similar to most retailers - doubled, tripled throughout the pandemic... [but] it still doesn't obviously make up for the loss of 100-plus stores.\"\nMusic stores have been particularly affected by the shift to digital over the years. The challenges from music downloading and streaming have added to the general shift to online sales affecting most retailers.\nEarlier this month, supermarket giant Sainsbury's said it had stopped selling CDs and DVDs as its customers increasingly went for music and films online.\nCD sales have shrunk in the past decade but were still worth \u00a3115m last year and vinyl sales continue to enjoy a revival of fortunes. \nThere aren't many companies that have continued to trade on our High Streets for a century. That HMV survives may surprise many who wonder how a bricks-and-mortar retailer of physical media survives in a world of downloads and streaming. \nThe venerable brand has focused on staying relevant to pop culture fans. The company's Canadian owner appears to have continued faith in the UK High Street at a time when it's undergoing a change just as challenging as any in HMV's history.  New stores are planned just as some people have questioned the purpose of the High Street post-pandemic. \nUK retailers have been through a deeply painful period of forced temporary closure, plunging sales and an accelerated shift to online shopping. Despite financial support from the government, some businesses have not survived the pandemic and the pain may not be over.\nThere are dire predictions of thousands of more High Street closures to come, as firms are weighed down by lockdown loans. The profound changes taking place in retail cannot be stopped, but businesses say they need the government to act. \nA radical change to the business rates regime is top of most retailers' list of requests. Ministers are already conducting a fundamental review of the rates system and the outcome should be published in the autumn. Confidence is also key at a time when many shoppers are anxious about the ending of the legal requirement to wear a face covering in England. "

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings",
      "text": "Dominic Cummings has revealed he discussed ousting Boris Johnson within days of the Conservatives winning the December 2019 election by a landslide.\nThe PM's former chief adviser told the BBC it seemed that, by mid-January 2020, Mr Johnson did not \"have a plan\".\nMr Cummings also alleged the PM's wife Carrie Johnson had tried to influence government appointments.\nBut, despite quitting Downing Street last autumn following a power struggle, he denied being motivated by revenge.\nAsked about Mr Cummings's comments, a government spokesperson said ministers were fully focused on recovery from the pandemic and restoring the economy.\nIn his first major TV interview, Mr Cummings - who ran the Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum campaign before working as the prime minister's adviser - told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that:\nThe Conservatives won the 2019 general election with a far better than expected 80-seat Commons majority, after a campaign involving Mr Cummings and other former Vote Leave staff in which they promised to \"get Brexit done\".\nMr Cummings claimed that Carrie Johnson - then Carrie Symonds - had been pleased to have Vote Leave veterans working in Downing Street until then. \nBut he added: \"As soon as the election was won, her view was 'Why should it be Dominic and the Vote Leave team? Why shouldn't it be me that's pulling the strings?'\"\nDominic Cummings: The Interview will be broadcast in the UK on BBC Two at 19:00 BST on Tuesday, and it will be available on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds\nMr Cummings said he and his allies began to fear for their positions by January 2020 and started discussing Mr Johnson's future.\n\"[People] were already saying, 'By the summer, either we'll all have gone from here or we'll be in the process of trying to get rid of [Mr Johnson] and get someone else in as prime minister',\" he said.\nDefending the discussions about removing the democratically elected Mr Johnson, Mr Cummings said: \"He [the prime minister] doesn't have a plan, he doesn't know how to be prime minister and we only got him in there because we had to solve a certain problem not because he was the right person to be running the country.\"\nHe also said: \"The situation we found ourselves in is that, within days... the prime minister's girlfriend is trying to get rid of us and appoint complete clowns to certain key jobs.\"\nBad feelings remained within Downing Street, Mr Cummings said, with his relationship with the prime minister effectively broken by July last year.\nFour months later, on 14 November, he quit his government job.\nHis departure also came at a point when the prime minister was \"fed up with the media portrayal of him being a kind of puppet for the Vote Leave team - it was driving him round the bend\", Mr Cummings said.\nA Downing Street spokesperson declined to comment in detail on Mr Cummings's allegations against Mrs Johnson, but said: \"Political appointments are entirely made by the prime minister.\" \nDespite running the successful Vote Leave campaign in the referendum, Mr Cummings said that \"no-one on Earth\" could be certain it had been the right decision to quit the EU.\n\"I think anyone who says they're sure about questions like that has a screw loose, whether you're on the Remain side or on our side,\" he said.\n\"One of the reasons why we won is... we didn't think we were all right and all Remainers were idiots or traitors or anything else.\"\nBut the Leave campaign has come in for criticism over its use during the campaign of a controversial claim that the UK was giving \u00a3350m a week to the EU.\nQuestioned over this, Mr Cummings said it had been a trap \"to try and drive the Remain campaign and the people running it crazy, so they would start arguing about it\".\nUK voters decided by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.\nAsked whether the UK had become more divided and politics more brutal in the years since, and whether he had damaged to the country through his campaigning style, Mr Cummings replied: \"Obviously I think Brexit was a good thing\u2026 I think that the way in which the world has worked out since 2016 vindicates the arguments that Vote Leave made in all sorts of ways. \n\"I think it's good that Brexit happened.\"\nIn recent months, Mr Cummings has written several blogs highly critical of Mr Johnson and attacked his competence and handling of the the pandemic when appearing before a parliamentary select committee.\nBut he denied that doing all this, and agreeing to be interviewed by the BBC, was part of a quest for revenge.\nMr Cummings admitted that people thought of him \"generally as a nightmare\", but said it \"doesn't matter if people are upset\" by attempts to reform government.\n\"A lot of people have a pop at me, but you don't see me crying about it,\" he said.\nHe also revealed that he had not spoken to the prime minister since quitting, having not answered a call from Mr Johnson shortly after he left Downing Street.\nIt did not \"bother me one way or the other\" whether they would speak again, he added. \nMr Cummings was repeatedly challenged throughout his BBC interview to back up his version of events.\nHe said many of his claims about the workings of government would be corroborated if there was a public inquiry into its handling of the Covid pandemic."

      "text": "Germany's government has hit back at criticism over its warning systems after the worst flooding in decades left at least 160 people dead.\nThe deluge caught many off guard, sweeping away houses and leaving residents trapped in rising waters. More than 170 people are still missing.\nThe opposition Green Party said the disaster showed Germany must prepare better for extreme weather events. \nBut Interior Minister Horst Seehofer defended the government's actions. \nLocal communities should decide how to respond, he said. Under Germany's political system, regional states are responsible for emergency efforts. \n\"It would be completely inconceivable for such a catastrophe to be managed centrally from any one place - you need local knowledge,\" he said.\nHe called the criticism \"cheap election rhetoric\". Germany votes in September to elect a successor to Chancellor Angela Merkel. She is retiring after 16 years in power. \nFlood warning systems sent out alerts a few days before the heavy rain. However, they failed to reach many residents or officials in time. \nArmin Schuster, head of the Federal Office for Civil Protection, said \"the warning infrastructure wasn't our problem, but the effectiveness with which authorities and the population reacted to these warnings\". \nHe said \"we sent out 150 warnings via our apps, via the media\". But in many cases, he said, it was impossible to predict even half an hour ahead which places would be hit hardest.\nBut some have questioned the usefulness of warning apps, as the floods severed many phone links.\nMany factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely.\nOn the ground the risk of floods is easing as the weather improves. \nIn the severely hit Ahrweiler area, in Rhineland-Palatinate, the death toll rose to 117 on Monday. In North Rhine-Westphalia, at least 46 people died.\nA massive clean-up is under way. German media report oil pollution of rivers, including parts of the Rhine, from heating oil in flooded cellars and abandoned cars.\nThe government is considering an aid package of about \u20ac400m (\u00a3344m; $470m).\nDonations, including clothes and other essentials for people left homeless, have poured in from other parts of Germany. \nA priority is to provide drinking water. In some flooded areas, officials say, damaged water pipes cannot be repaired quickly."

This position is very much being kept under review. \n\"JCVI on balance would like to review more data on vaccine effect on young people, so prefer a precautionary approach, given the low risk of serious illness from Covid to young people.\"\nMr Yousaf added that the position for children generally was being kept under review and experts were continuing to look at the data.\nVulnerable 16 and 17-year-olds were already able to get the vaccine.\nThose aged 12 to 17 will also be offered a vaccine if they live with somebody with a weak immune system.\nTeenagers within three months of their 18th birthday will be offered the jab - the aim is to protect people leaving school before they start work or university.\nScotland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said work was under way to deliver the vaccines in the \"forthcoming weeks\".\nHe added: \"I know that the committee will give any additional update to advice as soon as the evidence supports this and, in the meantime, we will offer the vaccine to those children and young people currently recommended.\"\nDr Smith said young people who turn 18 by 31 July were already being vaccinated and invites would continue to be rolled out for those who reach the milestone within a three-month window.\nPublic health expert Prof Linda Bauld later told BBC Scotland's The Nine that the JCVI may be waiting to make a decision based on the health outcomes of \"millions\" of young people vaccinated in countries like the US and Canada.\nExperts would be looking at instances of rare heart conditions which may be linked to certain vaccines, she said.\n\"When you have a very big campaign in the US and Canada encouraging parents to bring their teenagers forward for vaccination, as a message to getting out in the face of Delta, parents in the UK will be asking questions about that,\" Prof Bauld said.\n\"The benefit of the JCVI waiting to see more teenagers vaccinated is they will get a lot more safety data from the millions of young people in the US. That seems to be the strategy but it is going to be controversial.\"\nMeanwhile, Mr Yousaf confirmed every adult in Scotland has now been invited for a vaccination appointment and added the programme is \"significantly ahead of schedule\".\nHowever almost a third (30.6%) of younger adults have still not been vaccinated, according to the latest statistics published by the Scottish government. \nIt is hoped all adults will have received their second dose by 12 September.\nMr Yousaf added: \"It is vital that everyone takes the opportunity to get both doses of their vaccination when this is offered. The second dose gives greater and longer lasting protection, and should not be missed.\n\"Vaccination is crucial to protect ourselves, our families and our communities, and to help us on the path back to normality.\"\nLatest Scottish government figures show 3,981,950 people have now received the first dose of the Covid vaccination and 2,978,746 have received their second dose."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged the UK vaccines authority not to \"rule out\" offering all teenagers a Covid-19 jab.\nChildren over 12 who are at higher risk of falling ill from the virus are to be added to the vaccine programme.\nBut the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said there would be little benefit in doing this for all young people.\nMs Sturgeon said it was \"extremely important\" this was kept under review.\nThe Scottish government is to follow the JCVI advice - which is to offer doses to children with certain health conditions and those who live with other vulnerable people.\nBut chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith has written to the group asking that the matter be kept under \"close and ongoing review\".\nThe JCVI conducted a study of whether children aged 12 to 17 should all be offered a Covid-19 vaccine.\nThey concluded that those with severe neurodisabilities, Down's syndrome, a severely weakened immune system or profound learning disabilities should be offered a jab - along with over-12s who live with someone with a weak immune system.\nHowever, the group stopped short of recommending that all teens should be included in the vaccine drive.\nProf Anthony Harnden, the group's deputy chairman, said: \"The primary aim of the vaccination programme has always been to prevent hospitalisations and deaths.\n\"Based on the fact that previously well children, if they do get Covid-19, are likely to have a very mild form of the disease, the health benefits of vaccinating them are small.\"\nOther countries including the US and Canada have added children aged 12 to 17 to their mass vaccination programmes, and Ms Sturgeon said it was important to learn from developments there.\nShe said: \"The Scottish government has always followed the advice of the JCVI, and for good reason.\n\"But I am acutely aware that some other countries are vaccinating younger teenagers, and I certainly consider it to be extremely important that this is not ruled out here.\n\"The chief medical officer is writing to the JCVI asking that the benefit of vaccinating all 12 to 17-year-olds is kept under close and ongoing review and that it takes account of all available data from countries already doing this.\n\"I think that is really important - if there is a benefit to be got from vaccinating younger teenagers then it's really important that younger people do not miss out on that.\"\nYoung people who are eligible will be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, as it is the only one approved for use in children aged 12 to 17 in the UK.\nVulnerable 16 and 17-year-olds were already able to get the vaccine, while teenagers within three months of their 18th birthday will also be offered a jab - with the aim of protecting school leavers before they start work or university.\nFewer than 30 children have died with Covid-19 in the UK, and the JCVI also says the benefit of vaccinating children to stop them spreading the virus to older age groups is unclear with so many vulnerable adults already fully immunised.\nThe Scottish government is encouraging more young people to come forward for vaccination, with the 18 to 29 age group and young men in particular less likely to have had a jab.\nThe JCVI has concluded that until there is more safety data on vaccines in children then it is best only to offer it to those for whom there is a direct benefit.\nIt says the vast majority of children will experience mild illness if they contract Covid, so at this moment in time the chance of rare vaccine side effects is a greater risk.\nBut there is not universal consensus on this view. Some experts say that more attention should be paid to the possible complications of long Covid in children and the use of vaccines to stem the spread of coronavirus. \nThe Scottish government has always accepted the advice of the JCVI and will continue to do so here, but the country will face challenges first.\nSchools go back earlier here and Scotland generally has higher numbers of under-18s starting college or university than other parts of the UK.  That could lead to a very disrupted start to term and some students feeling like they are unprotected as they move into halls of residence.\nGiven some other countries are already routinely vaccinating 12-18 year olds, this is one reason why the chief medical officer is writing to the JCVI asking for the decision to be regularly and closely reviewed.\nMs Sturgeon said that \"each and every person who gets jagged helps us take a step back to normality\", and that any groups who do not do so present a \"vulnerability against the virus\".\nShe said: \"Covid is less of a threat to young people, but that doesn't mean it poses no threat at all. \n\"Some young people do need hospital care when they get the virus, some can even end up in intensive care, and as we know young people can get long Covid - which we still don't fully understand the implications of.\n\"So please get vaccinated as soon as you possibly can. If you know somebody in a younger age group in your own family who hasn't had the vaccine yet, please encourage them to do so.\n\"It is the single most important thing any of us can do right now to give protection to ourselves, to protect others, and to help all of us collectively get back to normality.\"\nOpposition parties have called on the Scottish government to do more to push through the final phases of the programme.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross questioned the decision to close the NHS Louisa Jordan vaccination hub at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow.\nHe said: \"I think we have got to look at opportunities for getting people vaccinated in every part of Scotland and that means keeping the Hydro and other vaccination centres open.\" \nAnd Labour's Daniel Johnson said there were still problems with inviting people for jabs, saying some were still not receiving blue letters.\nHe said: \"I think there are clear and obvious issues that we never got to the bottom of in terms of how the vaccination programme has been operating, particularly around communication. We need to grapple with those and deal with them instead of brushing them aside.\""

      "text": "Almost a quarter (23.3%) of pupils in England were out of school last week, the latest official attendance figures show.\nThis means there were 1.7 million pupils absent, up from 1.5 million the week before.\nThe latest figures include over a million off for Covid-related reasons, but only 47,000 actually had Covid.\nIn secondary schools, the absence rate was nearer a third (32.7%) of pupils, while in primaries it was 17%.\nSome 661,500 pupils out of the total were absent from school for unspecified non-Covid related reasons. \nThese figures show a snapshot of the situation in state schools last Thursday - before changes introduced from 19 July, which are intended to reduce the numbers having to be sent home.\nThere has been speculation that many families may have chosen to take their children out of school early so isolation rules do not interfere with holiday plans.\nWhile others, including some teaching unions, have highlighted the impact of the pandemic on pupil engagement and mental health.\nElaine Blowers and her family in Hampshire are among many hundreds of thousands of families affected by having to self isolate. \nShe says each time it happens, the mental health of her daughter Gracie and son Harley is affected.\nMrs Blowers, a mum of two young, primary-aged children in Andover told how her son and daughter had to isolate due to one person in their class testing positive. Both children took a PCR test and were Covid-negative.\nHer son, Harley, has special needs and has missed out on the additional help he gets in school and has not really got on well with home-learning. And she explained how her daughter, Gracie, experiences anxiety every time she has to isolate - developing nightmares and stomach pains. \n\"What is frustrating is that it is not the first time this has happened,\" she says.\n\"Every time we have always been negative and felt very frustrated that my children have had to be locked up and I've had to lose an income unnecessarily.\"\nElaine runs her own business as a childminder working from home, so every time her children need to isolate, it impacts her business. \nShe said the current situation was tricky for parents.\n\"I know some parents have approached schools to keep children off so not to affect holidays. But other parents are still choosing to keep children in school.\n\"We've stuck to the rules but begrudgingly.\"\nElaine says both her children have really suffered by not being in school, but she does not blame the school which she says has been \"fantastic\" in offering support.\n\"The prime minister needs to get a grip and allow for people that are contacted to get a PCR test and if negative return to work or  school. This needs to change now - 16 August is too late,\" she says, referring to the date when Covid self-isolation rules are expected to change.\n\"It is having such a negative impact on businesses and people's, including children's, mental health.\"\nA Department for Education (DfE) spokesman said: \"Our priority is for schools and colleges to deliver face-to-face, high quality education to all pupils as we know that being out of education causes significant harm to educational attainment, life chances, mental and physical health.\n\"Where children have needed to isolate, they must be offered immediate access to high-quality remote education.\"\nHe added that the DfE had now removed its system of grouping pupils in \"bubbles\" to restrict transmission, and that self-isolation would not be required next term for pupils coming into contact with positive cases. \nThe National Association of Head Teachers' general secretary Paul Whiteman said the government's decision to end \"bubbles\" and school isolation requirements was intended to stop so many missing school. \nBut he warned that rising case numbers would mean more disruption, unless there was action to prevent transmission in schools.\n\"The government's own modelling predicts that the number of cases among children and young people is only going to get worse by the start of next term,\" he added.\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the latest figures \"bring a year of unprecedented educational disruption to a grim end\".\nHe said schools and colleges needed substantial financial and practical support for on-site testing for students and ventilation systems\n\"This work cannot be done on the cheap and the government needs to stop counting the pennies and address the situation with a proper injection of support and funding,\" he added.\nNatalie Perera, chief executive of the Education Policy Institute said the stark figures on pupil absence underline the importance of education recovery programmes. \n\"Supporting pupils through this crisis has to be a number one priority for the government,\" she said. \"We need to see far more ambitious and better-targeted education recovery policies which address the scale of this challenge.\""

      "text": "Extreme heat warnings are in place until Friday as the heatwave continues. \nPublic Health England extended its heat-health alert until Friday, as temperatures hit 32.2C (89.9F) at Heathrow Airport, making it the hottest day of the year again.\nThe Met Office has issued two new-style extreme heat weather warnings and told people to watch out for sunburn and heat exhaustion.\nIt has also warned of thunderstorms for parts of England. \nOne of the amber heat warnings covers parts of Wales, all of south-west England and parts of southern and central England. It will be in place until Thursday, when temperatures are expected to peak. \nThe second amber warning, which is for Northern Ireland, is in place from 08:00 BST on Wednesday to 23:59 on Friday. \nPublic Health England advises staying out of the sun between 11:00 and 15:00, drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding excess alcohol and physical exertion during the hottest parts of the day. \nThe two amber warnings in place for thunderstorms last until 19:00 on Tuesday. \nOne is in the East of England, taking in Cambridgeshire, Essex and Suffolk, while the other affect parts of London and south-east England, including Greater London, Kent and Medway. \nThe storms could last for two to three hours with a few places may seeing 40 to 60mm (1.6 to 2.4in) of rain in one or two hours.\nThere is a wider yellow weather warning for isolated thunderstorms across south-east England on Tuesday, lasting from 13:00 to midnight, with the Met Office saying there could be torrential rain, lightning, large hail and gusty winds. \nThe Met Office is warning that over the next few days many people could be at risk of sunburn or heat exhaustion, including dehydration, nausea and fatigue.\nThe more vulnerable are being warned of more adverse health effects.\nAnd it has warned that, as temperatures soar, some heat-sensitive systems and equipment may fail, leading to power cuts. There could also be delays to road, rail and air travel, meaning people experiencing long delays might suffer.\nThe Met Office said the high temperatures were expected in the day and at night, meaning disrupted sleep for many.\nIt also warned that as more people visited coastal areas, lakes and rivers, there was an \"increased risk of water safety incidents\".\nSix people drowned in English lakes and rivers over the weekend, with rescuers warning of the invisible but deadly dangers of open water. And a 13-year-old boy drowned in a lake in County Down on Monday. \nIn Scotland, people watering plants and filling paddling pools increased the demand for water by 200 million litres a day last week, Scottish Water said.\nKes Juskowiak, operations general manager at Scottish Water, said the company had \"struggled\" to meet demand in places, with tankers used to ensure supply.\nBBC Weather forecaster Matt Taylor said the high day-time and high night-time temperatures are set to continue for the coming days.\nNorthern Ireland, in particular, is going to see further increases in temperature on Wednesday and Thursday and could get close to breaking the record - set only last weekend - for its hottest day.\nThing will start to cool down again over the weekend, with temperatures returning to those expected at this time of year of between 20C and 25C (68-77F). \nHe said hot spells like this one do happen every summer - but that extreme heat episodes in the UK are becoming more frequent, prolonged and hotter.\nAccording to the Met Office, warm spells have more than doubled in length, from 5.3 days in 1960-1991 to more than 13 days between 2008 and 2017. \nBut we are some way off the UK's hottest day recorded - which was 38.7C (101.7F)  in Cambridge two years ago.\nThis temperature comparison tool uses three hourly forecast figures. For more detailed hourly UK forecasts go to BBC Weather.\nIf you can't see the calculator, tap here. \nThe Met Office launched its new extreme heat warning at the start of June 2021 to highlight potential widespread disruption and adverse health effects. Amber is the second-highest level in the system.\nIt comes after a record-breaking number of heatwave deaths were recorded in England last summer.\nHeatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. \nThe world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began, and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world take steep cuts to emissions.\nIf they can be cooled down within half an hour, then heat exhaustion is not normally serious.\nThe NHS advice is to: \nHowever, if they do not recover within 30 minutes, then what follows is heat stroke.\nIt is a medical emergency and you should call 999.\nPeople with heat stroke may stop sweating even though they are too hot, their temperature could have passed 40C and they may have seizures or lose consciousness.

The criteria isn't clear and it risks being both unfair and devastating to an already creaking supply chain.\"\nMs Dee, of the airport operators association, said the government \"must reconsider and exempt categories of workers\", such as airport security staff  and air traffic controllers from the requirement to self-isolate.\n\"As 24-hour operations, we need clear rules that are workable and easy to implement or there is a risk of unnecessary temporary closures,\" she said.\n\"Applying for each individual for an exemption from self-quarantine if they are 'pinged' is simply unworkable.\"\nShane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, said: \"What is the application process for businesses to use this? Who will qualify? Do you have to prove you are severely affected? How long will it take? \n\"If it's not simple and quick, it will not help and most businesses will have to ignore it.  \nHe said the number of people absent in the food sector due to isolation requests was \"growing exponentially across the food supply chain\".\nAndrew Selley is the chief executive of food wholesaler Bidfood, which has about 5,000 employees across the UK and 24 depots.\nHe said the number of staff who were self-isolating changed on a day-to-day basis, but added the company had \"well over 100 people\" off at the moment.\nThe firm, which has large contracts with schools, hospitals and prisons, recently had half a shift off at one depot due to staff being told to isolate.\nMr Selley said it was a \"little ridiculous\" to expect individual companies to seek exemptions for staff who had been told to self-isolate.\nHe added entire sectors, such as food supply, should be exempted and the government's scheme should work in the \"same way it did for key workers\" at the beginning of the pandemic.\nThe government has said it is \"crucial\" for people to quarantine after being \"pinged\" by the NHS Covid-19 app.\nIts message comes after business minister Paul Scully said it was a decision for individuals and employers whether they should isolate after a \"ping\" from the app.\nThe Times reported that another minister in the business department, Lord Grimstone of Boscobel, stressed in a letter to one large employer that the app was only an \"advisory tool\" and that people were not under any \"legal duty\".\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said \"business-critical areas\" would be able to apply to be exempt from isolating.\n\"It's not a blanket exemption and my understanding is we're not going to be producing a list covering individual sectors,\" he said.\n\"It's important that anyone who feels they're in a critical industry or wants to raise potential issues because of isolation are able to contact departments and get advice and where necessary get exemptions.\"\nAsked specifically about supermarket workers, the spokesman said: \"We're not seeking to draw lines specifically around who or who is not exempt. \n\"What's important is to make sure critical services are able to function and get that balance right between requiring people to isolate... but also making sure critical services can function.\""

      "text": "Extreme heat warnings are in place until Friday as the heatwave continues. \nPublic Health England extended its heat-health alert until Friday, as temperatures hit 32.2C (89.9F) at Heathrow Airport, making it the hottest day of the year again.\nThe Met Office has issued two new-style extreme heat weather warnings and told people to watch out for sunburn and heat exhaustion.\nIt has also warned of thunderstorms for parts of England. \nOne of the amber heat warnings covers parts of Wales, all of south-west England and parts of southern and central England. It will be in place until Thursday, when temperatures are expected to peak. \nThe second amber warning, which is for Northern Ireland, is in place from 08:00 BST on Wednesday to 23:59 on Friday. \nPublic Health England advises staying out of the sun between 11:00 and 15:00, drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding excess alcohol and physical exertion during the hottest parts of the day. \nThe two amber warnings in place for thunderstorms last until 19:00 on Tuesday. \nOne is in the East of England, taking in Cambridgeshire, Essex and Suffolk, while the other affect parts of London and south-east England, including Greater London, Kent and Medway. \nThe storms could last for two to three hours with a few places may seeing 40 to 60mm (1.6 to 2.4in) of rain in one or two hours.\nThere is a wider yellow weather warning for isolated thunderstorms across south-east England on Tuesday, lasting from 13:00 to midnight, with the Met Office saying there could be torrential rain, lightning, large hail and gusty winds. \nThe Met Office is warning that over the next few days many people could be at risk of sunburn or heat exhaustion, including dehydration, nausea and fatigue.\nThe more vulnerable are being warned of more adverse health effects.\nAnd it has warned that, as temperatures soar, some heat-sensitive systems and equipment may fail, leading to power cuts. There could also be delays to road, rail and air travel, meaning people experiencing long delays might suffer.\nThe Met Office said the high temperatures were expected in the day and at night, meaning disrupted sleep for many.\nIt also warned that as more people visited coastal areas, lakes and rivers, there was an \"increased risk of water safety incidents\".\nSix people drowned in English lakes and rivers over the weekend, with rescuers warning of the invisible but deadly dangers of open water. And a 13-year-old boy drowned in a lake in County Down on Monday. \nIn Scotland, people watering plants and filling paddling pools increased the demand for water by 200 million litres a day last week, Scottish Water said.\nKes Juskowiak, operations general manager at Scottish Water, said the company had \"struggled\" to meet demand in places, with tankers used to ensure supply.\nBBC Weather forecaster Matt Taylor said the high day-time and high night-time temperatures are set to continue for the coming days.\nNorthern Ireland, in particular, is going to see further increases in temperature on Wednesday and Thursday and could get close to breaking the record - set only last weekend - for its hottest day.\nThing will start to cool down again over the weekend, with temperatures returning to those expected at this time of year of between 20C and 25C (68-77F). \nHe said hot spells like this one do happen every summer - but that extreme heat episodes in the UK are becoming more frequent, prolonged and hotter.\nAccording to the Met Office, warm spells have more than doubled in length, from 5.3 days in 1960-1991 to more than 13 days between 2008 and 2017. \nBut we are some way off the UK's hottest day recorded - which was 38.7C (101.7F)  in Cambridge two years ago.\nThis temperature comparison tool uses three hourly forecast figures. For more detailed hourly UK forecasts go to BBC Weather.\nIf you can't see the calculator, tap here. \nThe Met Office launched its new extreme heat warning at the start of June 2021 to highlight potential widespread disruption and adverse health effects. Amber is the second-highest level in the system.\nIt comes after a record-breaking number of heatwave deaths were recorded in England last summer.\nHeatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. \nThe world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began, and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world take steep cuts to emissions.\nIf they can be cooled down within half an hour, then heat exhaustion is not normally serious.\nThe NHS advice is to: \nHowever, if they do not recover within 30 minutes, then what follows is heat stroke.\nIt is a medical emergency and you should call 999.\nPeople with heat stroke may stop sweating even though they are too hot, their temperature could have passed 40C and they may have seizures or lose consciousness.

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nBoris Johnson was reluctant to tighten Covid restrictions as cases rose last autumn because he thought people dying from it were \"essentially all over 80\", his former chief adviser says. Dominic Cummings tells the BBC the prime minister messaged him to say: \"I no longer buy all this NHS overwhelmed stuff.\" A Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Johnson had three times prevented the NHS from being overwhelmed by imposing national lockdowns and during the pandemic has \"taken the necessary action to protect lives and livelihoods, guided by the best scientific advice\".\nThe government will give more details today about its plans to relax isolation rules for critical workers in England who are \"pinged\" by the NHS Test and Trace app. The prime minister has said some fully vaccinated food, utility and border workers will join nurses and care staff in qualifying for the exemption. You can read more about the current self-isolation rules here.\nHospitalisations due to coronavirus are rising, even as the UK's nations have been gradually easing restrictions. We hear from patients at a hospital in Nottingham, who urge the public to continue to take precautions.\nSome dubbed Monday's easing of restrictions a \"Grand Reopening\". But it's far from business-as-usual for most companies as the pandemic continues to affect the way they trade. We hear from small businesses in York, where some still strongly encourage use of masks, others are struggling with staff isolation and many are missing international tourists.\nThe start of the school summer holidays have combined with the current heatwave to give a welcome boost to pandemic-hit Welsh resorts. But are differences in Welsh and English national rules on wearing masks causing problems with tourists? \"People realise the rules are not the same but on the whole they are very good,\" says beach shop worker Diane Simons.

      "text": "Scotland's social distancing regulations are being reviewed following a row with cross-border rail operators, the first minister has said.\nNicola Sturgeon said lawyers would see whether \"clarification or tightening\" of the 1m rule was necessary.\nOn Monday London North Eastern Railway (LNER) told customers it was operating \"under English guidance\" as the measure had been lifted down south.\nTransport Scotland criticised the firm for issuing \"inaccurate advice\".\nOperator Avanti West Coast also refused to enforce the 1m rule on its cross-border services, and will instead make announcements about changes in restrictions as trains enter Scotland.\nCurrently people in Scotland should stay 1m from each other in public places - but the rule has been lifted in England.\nScottish legislation states that anyone providing a service in a level zero area take measures to ensure that \"as far as reasonably practicable\", that a 1m distance is maintained.\nDuring a Covid briefing on Tuesday, the first minister said she had seen commentary suggesting trains may not be included in the law because they were not classified as \"premises\".\nShe said: \"I've just asked our lawyers to look at that to see whether there is any clarification or tightening required.\n\"But the intention is clear. I would expect companies operating in Scotland to follow the law in Scotland and follow the guidance in place in Scotland, even if it is not contained in statute.\"\nHours after saying it would not enforce Scottish regulations, LNER changed its position saying it was \"reviewing its approach\" on Anglo-Scottish services. \nIt said it would provide an update in due course.\nA spokesperson for the firm said: \"The safety of our customers and colleagues remains our top priority. We are continuing to provide an enhanced cleaning programme onboard our trains and at our stations as well as reminding customers to wear a face mask, unless exempt. \n\"We are also using our reservation system to prevent overcrowding and our website to continue to inform customers which are our least busy and busier services.\"\nThe first minister thanked the firm for \"making clear\" it would follow Scottish guidance.\nThe BBC understands that Avanti West Coast will make announcements on trains leaving Carlisle, advising people of Scotland's social distancing rules to give them a chance to move seats.\nThe firm has encouraged passengers to travel at quieter times.\nMeanwhile, operator ScotRail said \"physical distancing can't be guaranteed\" in stations or on trains and asks people to \"take personal responsibility\". \nTransport Scotland earlier said the \"law was clear\" and that rail operators had to take steps to ensure social distancing was \"reasonably practicable\" in level zero areas.\nA spokesman said: \"It is our expectation that operators providing a public transport service in Scotland to comply with the law as far as is reasonably practical and inform passengers using their services.\"Transport Scotland officials received assurance from LNER on Friday that their messages to customers would be changed to reflect and respect Scottish government law and guidance. It is not acceptable that LNER has continued to issue inaccurate advice.\"\nScotland has moved to the lowest level of Covid restrictions, while England has lifted most legal restrictions.\nThe move means more people in Scotland will be allowed to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals but there are some \"modifications\".\nIn public places, one-metre physical distancing remains for people from different households.\nSome limits on outdoor meetings are also being maintained and the mandatory use of face coverings is to remain in place for \"some time\"."

We'll have another update for you on Wednesday morning. \nDowning Street is insisting it is \"crucial\" to self-isolate when sent an alert by the Covid app - and businesses should help employees to do so. The remarks came after business minister Paul Scully said he would encourage people who are \"pinged\" to self-isolate but they can make an \"informed decision\". The app has always been voluntary to download and any alerts are advisory. The government also says there will be no list of critical workers exempt from isolating rules and exemptions will be \"considered on a case-by-case basis\". Individual businesses will have to contact their relevant government department to apply for any exemption. \nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is urging the UK vaccines authority not to \"rule out\" offering all teenagers a Covid-19 jab. Children over 12 who are at higher risk of falling ill from the virus are to be added to the vaccine programme. But the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation says there would be little benefit in doing this for all young people. Ms Sturgeon says it is \"extremely important\" that this is kept under review. Here's our explainer on which children are being vaccinated and why.\nAlmost a quarter of pupils in England were out of school last week, according to the latest official attendance figures showing the impact of Covid. In secondary schools, the absence rate was nearer a third of pupils, while in primaries it was 17%. Elaine Blowers and her family in Hampshire are among those affected by having to self isolate. She tells the BBC each time it happens, the mental health of her daughter Gracie and son Harley is affected. Our explainer looks at how school will be different next term.\nRescheduling the Tokyo Olympics \"caused sleepless nights\" but the Games must go ahead \"to give hope\" for the future, says International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach. He says cancellation \"was never an option\" despite the difficulties involved in hosting the event during the Covid pandemic. The opening ceremony for the delayed 2020 Games is on Friday. Meanwhile, BBC Scotland's Olympics team has been forced to isolate in Tokyo.\nThe Balearic Islands were added to the UK's amber list last week only 15 days after they were added to the green watchlist, meaning many people will have to isolate when they return.

something denied by the health secretary.\n\"Tens of thousands of people died, who didn't need to die,\" Mr Cummings added.\nAt a marathon seven-hour evidence session, the former Downing Street insider painted a picture of policy failure, dithering and a government that had no useful plan for handling a pandemic.\nHe told MPs: \"The truth is that senior ministers, senior officials, senior advisers like me fell disastrously short of the standards that the public has a right to expect of its government in a crisis like this.\"\nHe added: \"I would like to say to all the families of those who died unnecessarily how sorry I am for the mistakes that were made and for my own mistakes at that.\"\nMr Cummings -

and he was against a so-called \"circuit breaker\" lockdown in autumn 2020 for economic reasons, despite scientific advice.\nAsked on what basis the PM had taken this decision, Mr Cummings said: \"He wasn't taking any advice, he was just taking his own decision that he was going to ignore the advice.\"\nHe added: \"The cabinet wasn't involved or asked.\"\nAsked if the prime minister had said he would rather see \"bodies pile high\" than take the country into a third lockdown, as reported by the BBC, Mr Cummings said: \"I heard that in the prime minister's study.\"\nMr Johnson has denied making these comments.\nThe former adviser reserved his most savage criticism for Matt Hancock, claiming the health secretary should have been fired for \"15 to 20\" different things - accusing him of \"criminal, disgraceful behaviour that caused serious harm\".\nHe said he had repeatedly called on Mr Johnson to sack Mr Hancock, calling him \"completely incapable of doing the job\".\nThe prime minister had been furious when he came back to work after recovering from coronavirus to find that untested patients had been discharged to care homes in England, thereby allowing the virus to spread, Mr Cummings claimed.\nBoth he and the PM had been told \"categorically in March that people will be tested before they went back to care homes\".\nSubsequent government claims about putting a \"shield\" around care homes were \"complete nonsense\", he said.\nMr Cummings also attacked Mr Hancock over PPE shortages, and accused him of \"disgraceful behaviour\" in setting a \"stupid\" target of offering 100,000 Covid tests a day, which he said had disrupted wider work to establish the test and trace system.\nCommittee chairman Greg Clark said Mr Cummings must provide written evidence to back up his claims about Mr Hancock, who will be quizzed by the MPs in two weeks' time.\nMr Hancock said he had not seen Mr Cummings' evidence in full adding \"instead I've been dealing with getting the vaccination rollout going, especially to over-30s, and saving lives\". \nHowever he added that he would have \"more to say\" when he gives a statement to the House of Commons on Thursday.\nEarlier, a spokesman for Mr Hancock said: \"We absolutely reject Mr Cummings' claims about the health secretary.\n\"The health secretary will continue to work closely with the prime minister to deliver the vaccine rollout, tackle the risks posed by variants and support the NHS and social care sector to recover from this pandemic.\"\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the \"very grave allegations\" appeared to be \"well-founded\" and the health secretary \"needs to give us an explanation\" if the country is to \"maintain confidence in him\".\nIn other explosive claims, Mr Cummings said:\nMr Cummings was questioned by the Health and Science select committees, for their inquiry into \"lessons learnt\" on the government's response to the pandemic.\nBefore the hearing began, he tweeted a picture of a whiteboard on which the government's \"plan B\" for the first wave of the virus was sketched out.\nHe told the MPs the original plan had been for limited intervention, with the hope of achieving \"herd immunity\", and he was \"completely baffled\" by Downing Street's denial of this.\nHe said the herd immunity strategy was abandoned when the scale of the death toll that would result from it became clear.\nMr Cummings was frank about some of his own failings - and admitted that his defence of a trip to County Durham during the first lockdown had \"undermined public confidence\".\nBut he said he had made the journey due to threats against his family - and he defended his claim that he had driven his family to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight, saying the story was too \"weird\" to have been made up.\nHe also gave his version of his departure from Downing Street, saying his relationship with Mr Johnson had broken down after the second national lockdown in October.\n\"The fact that his girlfriend (Carrie Symonds) also wanted rid of me was relevant but not the heart of the problem,\" he told MPs.\nHe said he regarded Mr Johnson as \"unfit for the job\" and that he had been \"trying to create a structure around him (the PM) to try and stop what I thought were extremely bad decisions and push other things through against his wishes\".\nHe also described how a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee on 12 March had been disrupted by US President Donald Trump wanting to start a \"bombing campaign\" against Iraq.\nAt the same time, he added, Mr Johnson's partner Carrie Symonds was \"going crackers\" about a \"completely trivial\" story in the Times regarding the dog she co-owned with the prime minister.\nResponding to Mr Cummings' evidence, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: \"Boris Johnson's casual disregard for the safety of the British people has had fatal consequences. \n\"From care homes to borders, repeatedly locking down too late and failing to learn from his mistakes, the PM's decisions and failures resulted in tens of thousands of avoidable deaths.\"\nSpeaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson told MPs: \"The handling of this pandemic has been one of the most difficult things this country has had to do for a very long time and none of the decisions have been easy,\" he said.\n\"To go into a lockdown is a traumatic thing for a country, to deal with a pandemic on this scale has been appallingly difficult, and we have at every stage tried to minimise loss of life, to save lives, to protect the NHS and we have followed the best scientific advice that we can.\"\nHe added that he had not seen Mr Cummings' evidence to the select committee.\nConservative MP Tobias Ellwood defended the prime minister, saying that ministers should be free to speak their minds and even ask \"silly questions\" without \"fear that one day they may be quoted or misquoted back to you\".\n\"That completely diminishes the competence of the No 10 machine,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nMore than 127,000 people diagnosed with coronavirus have died in the UK since the start of the pandemic."

      "tags": "Nightclubs,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People attending nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather in England will need to be fully vaccinated from the end of September, the government says. \nLatest figures show 35% of 18 to 30-year-olds have not had their first jab. \nCurrently nightclubs and other crowded venues are only encouraged to ask clubbers to show proof of vaccination, a negative test result or immunity.\nBut Boris Johnson said he was concerned by the continuing risk of transmission.\nThe announcement came on the day nightclubs in England were allowed to reopen after 16 months of closure. \nThe prime minister told a press conference on Monday: \"I don't want to have to close nightclubs again as they have elsewhere. But it does mean nightclubs need to do the socially responsible thing.\n\"As we said last week, we do reserve the right to mandate certification at any point if it's necessary to reduce transmission.\n\"And I should serve notice now that by the end of September, when all over 18s have had their chance to be double jabbed we're planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather.\"\nChief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said nightclubs and other such venues could be \"potential super spreading events\" because of crowds in close contact.\n\"I would expect that with opening of nightclubs, we'll continue to see an increase in cases, and we will see outbreaks related to specific nightclubs as well,\" he said.\nHow have you been affected by issues covered in this story?\nNightclubs are still closed in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe Welsh government said it would never mandate the use of vaccination certificates but that businesses would be free to ask for them.\nAcross the UK, 39,950 cases were recorded on Monday alongside another 19 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nIt's easy to understand how a loud and busy nightclub could be the perfect stomping ground for Covid. \nHaving lots of people packed closely together, snogging, singing and shouting in a confined space with relatively poor ventilation creates ideal conditions for a virus carried in our spit to spread. \nAdd in the fact that many of those attending may not have had two or even one dose of a vaccine that helps protect against catching and transmitting the virus, and you could have a super-spreading event on your hands. \nThe Netherlands recently tried reopening its clubs and quickly decided to close them again amid rising infection rates. Its government said most of the new infections occurred in nightlife settings and parties with large numbers of people. \nFor now, it is asking its citizens to use their common sense and act responsibly; keeping gatherings small and manageable. Time will tell if the UK might go the same way. \nMany nightclubs have shut down during the pandemic and the industry reacted angrily to the prime minister's announcement.\n\"So, 'freedom day' for nightclubs lasted around 17 hours then,\" said Michael Kill, boss of the Night Time Industries Association. \n\"Leaving aside the fact that this is yet another chaotic U-turn that will leave nightclubs who have been planning for reopening for months having to make more changes to the way they operate - this is still a bad idea. \n\"80% of nightclubs have said they do not want to implement Covid passports, worrying about difficulties with enforcing the system and a reduction in spontaneous consumers, as well as being put at a competitive disadvantage with pubs and bars that aren't subject to the same restrictions and yet provide similar environments.\"\nBoss of UK Hospitality Kate Nicholls called the announcement \"a hammer blow\" for a struggling industry trying to rebuild. \nOne major nightclub firm, Rekom UK, which owns 42 venues including chains Pryzm, Bar&Beyond, and Fiction, said clubs had become a political football. \nBoss Peter Marks said: \"Mandatory Covid passports may make sense one day once the entire adult population has been offered vaccines, but does government really think this threat will entice the 'vaccine wary' to take the vaccine? They will just stay later in the pubs and hold their parties in their houses.\"\nMark Harper MP, who chairs the Covid Recovery Group of Conservative backbenchers, also criticised the plans, saying the government was \"effectively moving to compulsory vaccination.\"\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, he called on the government to bring forward the evidence for the policy in September ahead of any vote, saying he didn't think the evidence from pilot schemes supported the idea. \nVaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi MP promised to share the evidence with the Commons, \"working with the nightclub industry or at-risk large scale events that are indoors\"."

      "text": "A Florida man has become the first to be sentenced to prison for his part in the US Capitol riots on 6 January. \nPaul Allard Hodgkins pleaded guilty in June to one felony count of entering the Capitol to obstruct Congress. He was jailed for eight months. \nProsecutors had asked for a term of 18 months, saying Hodgkins \"contributed to the collective threat to democracy\". \nThe sentence is expected to set a benchmark for hundreds of upcoming cases from the Capitol riots. \nHodgkins, 38, told a Washington DC court that taking part in the invasion of the Capitol had been a \"foolish decision\". \nHe said he regretted \"the damage that day's incident caused and the way this country that I love has been hurt\".\nThe crane operator from Tampa, was among an estimated 800 people who breached the Capitol on 6 January. \nThe FBI has so far arrested more than 535 people for criminal activity on the day of the siege. \nVideo footage shows Hodgkins inside the Senate chamber, wearing a Trump 2020 t-shirt, with a pair of goggles around his neck and a Trump flag slung over his shoulder. \nCourt documents include a selfie taken by Hodgkins inside the Senate. One of the most prominent participants in the riots, the so-called QAnon Shaman, can be seen in the background. \nProsecutors noted that Hodgkins did not personally engage in violence or destroy property. \nA lawyer for Hodgkins had asked for judge for leniency, saying any sentence given \"will pale in comparison\" to the lifelong shame he will carry.\nHodgkins' felony sentence follows one other Capitol riot sentence issued so far. \nAnna Morgan-Lloyd, a 49-year-old woman from Indiana, received three years of probation and no jail time after pleading guilty in June to a disorderly conduct charge, a misdemeanour. \nMs Morgan-Lloyd, who was inside the Capitol for around 10 minutes and did not engage in violence, apologised for taking part."

      "tags": "Oregon,Wildfires,United States,Canada",
      "text": "In the US state of Oregon, the nation's largest active wildfire has burned through more than 364,000 acres, prompting thousands of evacuations.\nOver 2,000 firefighters are tackling the so-called Bootleg Fire - one of the largest blazes in Oregon's history.\nSince starting on 6 July, it has already scorched an area larger than the city of Los Angeles.\nIt is one of more than 80 major fires raging across 13 US states, spurred by recent heat waves and high winds.\nClimate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions..\nThe Bootleg Fire in Oregon, named after the nearby Bootleg Spring, has forced at least 2,000 residents from mostly rural areas to abandon their homes. At least 160 homes and buildings have been destroyed so far. No deaths have yet been reported. \nAuthorities said that about one-third of the fire's perimeter had been contained.\n\"We've had to fight for pretty much every foot of this, but we're getting there,\" said John Flannigan, an operations section chief at a news conference on Monday. \nMr Flannigan described the intensity of the fire as that of a hurricane, saying that it had ripped trees out of the ground. \nThe blaze has grown so large that it is effectively creating its own weather. Intense wildfires, like Bootleg, move with such energy that they can create pyrocumulus clouds - also known as \"fire clouds\". These clouds are so hot and big they can create their own weather systems, like hurricane and lightning. \nOne resident near the town of Bly whose home was destroyed by the Bootleg Fire, Sayyid Bey, said he watched from afar as the blaze burned through the trees towards his property. \"It was red, like we were on Mars,\" he said.\nThe fire, which is burning 300 miles (480km) south-east of Portland, threatens to destroy thousands more properties as it continues to spread. \nTwo evacuation centres have been set up for residents in several cities, including Klamath Falls and Redmond.\nTemperatures are expected to be between 10 and 15 degrees Fahrenheit above normal and the region is also experiencing a drought, which could worsen in the days ahead. Thunder and lightning are also forecast, likely to spur further fires. \nWildfires have already torn through more than 1.2m acres of the country this year, mainly in western states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. It marks a heavier-than-normal start to the US wildfire season.\nMore than 4,000 blazes have been recorded by the organisation so far in 2021, which is almost double last year's total.\nIn California alone, five times as many acres have burned compared with the same period last year.\nFire seasons are becoming longer and more intense year over year, Nick Schuler, deputy chief of Cal Fire told the BBC. \n\"Ten years ago in California, people viewed wildfires as a rural problem,\" he said. \"Now no matter where you live in California, people are impacted by it. Every acre in California will burn at some point.\"\nThe rest of the country is not unaffected by the destruction. On Tuesday, the US east coast woke up to hazy skies and a bright-red sun caused by wildfire smoke. \nIn neighbouring Canada, more than 150 new fires started burning in this past weekend alone, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. More than 4,300 blazes have been recorded by the non-profit in 2021 so far.\nIn the province of British Columbia alone, crews are battling hundreds of fires, straining available accommodation for those who have been forced to flee. \nOn Tuesday, the province declared a state of emergency in response to the wildfires. \nCanada has also issued health warnings due to wildfire smoke spreading nearly 2,000km across the nation. The elderly, children and those with cardiovascular issues are advised to limit outdoor activities and drink extra water until the smoke passes.\n\"Winnipeg smells like a campfire right now,\" tweeted one reporter. \"I've never experienced smoke like this in my entire life.\"\nThere are nearly 800 wildfires currently burning in Canada, with no sign of rain in the forecast for the western provinces. \nExperts have told the BBC that due to a multi-year drought, the potential for a historic 2021 North American wildfire season is \"sky-high\"."

      "text": "US climate envoy John Kerry has called on China to increase the speed and depth of its efforts to cut carbon.\nWithout sufficient emissions reductions by China, Mr Kerry said, the global goal of keeping temperatures under 1.5C  was \"essentially impossible\".\nMr Kerry said he was convinced that China could do more and the US was willing to work closely to secure a reasonable climate future.\nEvery major economy must now commit to meaningful reductions by 2030, he said.\nMr Kerry was speaking at Kew Gardens in London, ahead of a G20 environment ministers meeting in Italy later this week. \nReferring to the key COP26 gathering in Glasgow in November, the former Secretary of State said that \"in little more than 100 days we can save the next 100 years\".\nDoing so would not be easy he said. Mr Kerry said that the promises made during and since the Paris climate agreement in 2015 would still see the world's temperature increase by 2.5-3C.\n\"We're already seeing dramatic consequences with 1.2C of warming,\" he said, referring to recent heatwaves in the US and Canada, and flooding in Europe.\n\"To contemplate doubling that is to invite catastrophe.\"\nHe castigated the efforts of some countries which are still building new coal-fired power stations. He was scornful of nations that are illegally cutting down the rainforest\n\"They're removing the lungs of the world, destroying irreplaceable biodiversity and destabilising the climate all at the same time.\"\nObservers say that the envoy was likely referring to Brazil and Indonesia.\nMr Kerry paid special attention to the efforts of China, saying the country was now \"the largest driver of climate change\".\nChina has promised to peak emissions by 2030 - but the US diplomat said that was not good enough.\n\"If China sticks with its current plant and does not peak its emissions until 2030, then the entire rest of the world must go to zero by 2040 or even 2035,\" he warned.\n\"There is simply no alternative because without sufficient reduction by China, the goal of 1.5C is essentially impossible. China's partnership and leadership on this issue of extraordinary international consequence is essential.\"\nMr Kerry said he was convinced that China could outperform the targets it had set itself and that despite their diplomatic differences, the US was keen to co-operate.\nHe also said all other major economies would have to step up, with more ambitious targets and plans for the next decade.\nMr Kerry's comments come as new research shows that G20 countries are continuing to support fossil fuels in ways that are incompatible with the goals of the Paris agreement.\nAccording to Bloomberg's Climate Policy Factbook, G20 nations collectively cut fossil fuel funding by 10% from 2015 to 2019. However, eight countries, including the US, Canada and Australia increased their financial support for oil, coal and gas in this period. \nLast week, Mr Kerry travelled to Moscow where both sides agreed that the climate issue is one of common interest. President Putin said that Moscow \"attaches great importance\" to achieving the goals of the Paris climate agreement. \nIn May, Mr Kerry was criticised by some scientists for rejecting the idea that Americans would have to change their consumption habits, for example, eating less meat. \nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."

      "text": "There were three deaths registered involving Covid in Wales in the latest week - the same as the previous week.\nDeaths from all causes were above normal levels, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nThe deaths involving Covid were in hospitals in Denbighshire and Wrexham and one in hospital in Rhondda Cynon Taf - the first in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg area for six weeks.\nOne of the deaths occurred back on 19 June, the others on 2 and 7 July. \nThere can be a lag in some deaths being registered.\nThere have been five deaths across Wales in the latest month up to 9 July.\nSo-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, have been below average for 16 of the past 19 weeks. But there were 84 deaths above the five-year average in the latest week. \nThe number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in a typical year is seen as a reliable measure of the pandemic.\nThe number of deaths from all causes in Wales rose to 639 in the week ending 9 July, with 0.5% mentioning Covid on the death certificate. \nDeaths from all causes were also above average in England and Scotland. Data has been delayed for Northern Ireland.\nDeaths involving Covid increased in all regions of England, especially the north west.\nWhen looking across the course of the pandemic so far, there have been 49,486 deaths from all causes in Wales, with 7,907 (16%) mentioning Covid-19 on the death certificate. \nThis was 4,979 deaths above the five-year average. \nThe number of patients testing positive for Covid has increased in Welsh hospitals to their highest point since early April.\nThere are also 20 patients in critical care or on invasive ventilation. This is the highest number since 26 March although 87% down on January's peak.\nThe figure for confirmed Covid patients in hospital beds has risen to an average of 87.\nOn Monday, admissions to hospitals of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases were running at a daily seven-day average of 12, the highest point since the start of June.\nCovid admissions now make up 1% of all hospital admissions.\nCase rates are rising but the numbers ending up in hospital were nearly five times higher at the same point during the second wave of the pandemic. \nThis shows the weakening link between positive tests and hospital cases, although any rise will be a worry for hospital doctors, already anticipating a seasonal rise in emergency cases.\nThe ambulance service has already issued a warning over increasing pressure.\nCase rates are still rising in Wales, with Denbighshire showing the highest numbers in Wales.\nThere have been 127 positive tests in Rhyl in the past week, and more in communities including Prestatyn and Denbigh.\nAcross Wales, average daily cases are running at 837 a day.\nThe \"doubling time\" - the time it takes for the number of cases to double in size - is now 16 days, which suggests the rate of growth is slowing down.\nThe under 30s make up 52% of all positive tests for the latest day, which is less than we have been seeing in the past few weeks.\nPublic Health Wales reported no further deaths on Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, Care Inspectorate Wales (CIW) said there has been a \"steady increase\" in Covid cases in staff and residents at care homes since the start of June. \nForty homes had notified the organisation of at least one case in the past seven days. Only three local authority areas had no cases. Carmarthenshire and Denbighshire each had five homes reporting cases.\nBut there have been no deaths involving residents, according to the figures published by CIW. \nLatest figures show 72.4% of Wales' total population have had first vaccine doses, 61.3% have had second doses.\nThe past two days have seen the two lowest number of daily first doses, with Monday the lowest on 582. Second doses are now 92% of all vaccinations.\nThere are still nearly 126,000 (26.2%) of 18 to 29-year-olds yet to have a first dose. They made up about two-thirds of the first doses given out on Monday."

      "text": "Stolen cars being sent freewheeling down a residential hill during a riot were already a \"known danger\" to authorities, it has been claimed.\nFather-of-two Adam Romain had to flee his house after it was targeted in the riots in Swansea in May when he tried to stop youths setting fire to his car.\nHe claimed he warned police and Swansea council in February after a car was sent down his road in Mayhill.\nThe council said it was \"isolated\" and there was a \"bigger discussion\".\nIt comes after a joint review was announced to understand why rioting broke out in the Waun Wen Road area of Mayhill where \"yobs\" torched cars and threw bricks at houses on 20 May. \nSeven police officers were injured in the violence - involving about \"100 lads\" according to witnesses - which was condemned by First Minister Mark Drakeford as \"completely unacceptable\" and Home Secretary Priti Patel as \"disgraceful\".\nPolice have since made about 30 arrests, and now an independent panel of experts, including South Wales Police, its Police and Crime Commissioner and Swansea council, will investigate why the disturbance happened.\nMr Romain was targeted after he tried to stop rioters attacking his car - but the delivery driver had to flee his home after they started throwing missiles at his house.\nBut he has claimed he warned the authorities about possible unrest on the Mayhill estate.\n\"Back in February we had an incident which was about 02:00,\" he recalled.\n\"A vehicle was taken from the top of the hill and basically freewheeled down.\"\nHe said it came \"flying down\" and smashed \"through this barrier\" put half-way down the steep Waun Wen Road near the house he has lived in for four years.\n\"It hit both and landed in that diagonal way across the road,\" said Mr Romain.\n\"The police and the council would have known now because of this event that there is a danger and the bollards were not going to protect very much.\n\"It was a known danger already, we did request some concrete bollards, it would be interesting to know how we can improve the response towards the communities issues.\"\nMr Romain's mother Christina added: \"This is an extreme inaction, failing and people should be made accountable.\"\nThe leader of the council insisted there were plans in place to prevent anti-social behaviour on the road - but they had not yet been introduced.\n\"That issue, as far as I'm aware, was isolated,\" said councillor Rob Stewart, who had previously called the violence \"disgusting behaviour by yobs\".\n\"There was a much bigger discussion going on around motorcycles, about people being able to cycle fast up and down the hill.\n\"That meant we were looking at a much different solution to just putting a bollard in.\n\"We are looking at a park and play area, a re-greening of the whole area - a complete break in the area between this road and that road.\n\"The solution being worked up was one that was a much better solution for the community.\n\"I don't hold to the premise even putting these in would have prevented somebody trying to roll a car down if they were criminal and intent on criminal activity on that evening.\"\nFamilies spoke of being trapped in houses, with police being \"pelted with rocks\" as they tried to break up the riot.\nSouth Wales Police's response has been criticised by some residents after a vigil for 19-year-old Ethan Powell, who had recently died, turned into violence.\n\"I can fully appreciate that for the people living on Waun Wen Road, and the surrounding areas, this would have been a terrifying experience for them,\" said Chief Supt Jo Maal.\n\"In terms of the response, we will look at all of these aspects. What calls were made to us and over what period of time we responded. But that will become apparent in due course.\"\nMr Romain, for example, said he dialled 999 on three occasions after coming back to his home after a frantic call from his partner.\n\"It felt like I was driving into a war zone,\" Mr Romain told BBC Wales Investigates.\n\"They gave some explanations but nothing was satisfactory. Nothing that they said to me was 'ok, I understand completely'.\n\"There were some individual officers [who] apologised. They accept that there was a failing on that side.\"\nThere are plans to regenerate that area of Swansea, collectively known as \"the hill\", which overlooks the city and Swansea Bay.\n\"There will be and there has been significant investment in Mayhill, Townhill and Gors,\" said Mr Stewart.\n\"About \u00a350m has gone into housing on the hill. That investment has gone in but we're on a journey to try and shore up the community, to support it as we come out of the Covid pandemic.\"\nBBC Wales Investigates: Mayhill Riot.

      "tags": "Nightclubs,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People attending nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather in England will need to be fully vaccinated from the end of September, the government says. \nLatest figures show 35% of 18 to 30-year-olds have not had their first jab. \nCurrently nightclubs and other crowded venues are only encouraged to ask clubbers to show proof of vaccination, a negative test result or immunity.\nBut Boris Johnson said he was concerned by the continuing risk of transmission.\nThe announcement came on the day nightclubs in England were allowed to reopen after 16 months of closure. \nThe prime minister told a press conference on Monday: \"I don't want to have to close nightclubs again as they have elsewhere. But it does mean nightclubs need to do the socially responsible thing.\n\"As we said last week, we do reserve the right to mandate certification at any point if it's necessary to reduce transmission.\n\"And I should serve notice now that by the end of September, when all over 18s have had their chance to be double jabbed we're planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather.\"\nChief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said nightclubs and other such venues could be \"potential super spreading events\" because of crowds in close contact.\n\"I would expect that with opening of nightclubs, we'll continue to see an increase in cases, and we will see outbreaks related to specific nightclubs as well,\" he said.\nHow have you been affected by issues covered in this story?\nNightclubs are still closed in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe Welsh government said it would never mandate the use of vaccination certificates but that businesses would be free to ask for them.\nAcross the UK, 39,950 cases were recorded on Monday alongside another 19 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nIt's easy to understand how a loud and busy nightclub could be the perfect stomping ground for Covid. \nHaving lots of people packed closely together, snogging, singing and shouting in a confined space with relatively poor ventilation creates ideal conditions for a virus carried in our spit to spread. \nAdd in the fact that many of those attending may not have had two or even one dose of a vaccine that helps protect against catching and transmitting the virus, and you could have a super-spreading event on your hands. \nThe Netherlands recently tried reopening its clubs and quickly decided to close them again amid rising infection rates. Its government said most of the new infections occurred in nightlife settings and parties with large numbers of people. \nFor now, it is asking its citizens to use their common sense and act responsibly; keeping gatherings small and manageable. Time will tell if the UK might go the same way. \nMany nightclubs have shut down during the pandemic and the industry reacted angrily to the prime minister's announcement.\n\"So, 'freedom day' for nightclubs lasted around 17 hours then,\" said Michael Kill, boss of the Night Time Industries Association. \n\"Leaving aside the fact that this is yet another chaotic U-turn that will leave nightclubs who have been planning for reopening for months having to make more changes to the way they operate - this is still a bad idea. \n\"80% of nightclubs have said they do not want to implement Covid passports, worrying about difficulties with enforcing the system and a reduction in spontaneous consumers, as well as being put at a competitive disadvantage with pubs and bars that aren't subject to the same restrictions and yet provide similar environments.\"\nBoss of UK Hospitality Kate Nicholls called the announcement \"a hammer blow\" for a struggling industry trying to rebuild. \nOne major nightclub firm, Rekom UK, which owns 42 venues including chains Pryzm, Bar&Beyond, and Fiction, said clubs had become a political football. \nBoss Peter Marks said: \"Mandatory Covid passports may make sense one day once the entire adult population has been offered vaccines, but does government really think this threat will entice the 'vaccine wary' to take the vaccine? They will just stay later in the pubs and hold their parties in their houses.\"\nMark Harper MP, who chairs the Covid Recovery Group of Conservative backbenchers, also criticised the plans, saying the government was \"effectively moving to compulsory vaccination.\"\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, he called on the government to bring forward the evidence for the policy in September ahead of any vote, saying he didn't think the evidence from pilot schemes supported the idea. \nVaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi MP promised to share the evidence with the Commons, \"working with the nightclub industry or at-risk large scale events that are indoors\"."

      "text": "Video conferencing firm Zoom has struck a multibillion dollar deal to buy a cloud-based call centre operator in a bet on the future of hybrid working.\nThe firm announced the $14.7bn (\u00a310.7bn) acquisition of Five9 in a blog post on Sunday.\nZoom boss Eric Yuan said the deal would allow its customers to \"reimagine the way they do business\".\nIt marks the firm's biggest takeover, and comes even though staff are beginning to return to the office.\nInvestors have been watching for clues as to how the firm would fare as social distancing restrictions lift and more people are vaccinated.\nThe pandemic, which prompted an abrupt shift to remote work for many businesses around the world, transformed Zoom into a household name practically overnight.\nZoom has said it does not expect growth to continue at the pace it enjoyed last year, but so far business remains strong.\nThe company expects sales to rise more than 40% this year, reaching more than $3.7bn (\u00a32.66bn).\nIn the last three months of 2020, sales were up 370% compared to the same period in 2019, hitting $882.5m, it said in March. \nThe firm, which charges businesses for its remote meeting software in addition to more limited free use for the general public, said the acquisition of Five9 marked a shift in strategy. It is now prioritising its cloud-calling product Zoom Phone and conference-hosting product Zoom Rooms.\n\"This acquisition is... positioning us to accelerate Zoom's growth and play an even stronger role in driving the digital future, bringing companies and their customers closer together,\" its founder Eric Yuan said.\nFive9's call centre software is used by more than 2,000 clients such as Under Armour, Lululemon and Olympus, and the deal is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022 having been approved by the boards of both companies.\n\"This is a high-priced deal which appears to attempt to build out the Zoom Phone offering,\" said Neil Campling, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities. \nBut he added: \"Paying such a high price for a non-differentiated offering smacks of attempts to move into adjacent markets as Zoom fatigue sets in.\"\nA question mark has been raised over the future of hybrid working, although other tech firms such as Google and Microsoft have invested in their video-conferencing offer during the pandemic.\nBut others such as global workspace provider IWG have said that they expect working from home some of the time will become the norm - especially as firms will be looking to save money and be more environmentally-friendly by using less office space."

      "text": "Billionaire Jeff Bezos has made a short journey to space, in the first crewed flight of his rocket ship, New Shepard.\nHe was accompanied by Mark Bezos, his brother, Wally Funk, an 82-year-old pioneer of the space race, and an 18-year-old student.\nThey travelled in a capsule with the biggest windows flown in space, offering stunning views of the Earth.\nWhen the capsule touched back down after the 10-minute, 10-second flight, Jeff Bezos exclaimed: \"Best day ever!\"\nNew Shepard, built by Bezos' company Blue Origin, is designed to serve the burgeoning market for space tourism.\nAmazon founder Mr Bezos - and other participants in the \"billionaire space race\" - have been criticised for offering what some see as joy rides for the super-wealthy. Critics say the money could be spent on pay rises for employees or fighting climate change.\nHowever, Mr Bezos insists he has an environmental vision: \"We need to take all heavy industry, all polluting industry and move it into space, and keep Earth as this beautiful gem of a planet that it is,\" he told MSNBC.\n\"It's going to take decades and decades to achieve, but you have to start, and big things start with small steps... that's what this sub-orbital tourism mission allows us to do, it allows us to practice over and over.\"\nOn this flight was the oldest person who has been to space - Ms Funk - and the youngest, student Oliver Daemen.\nThe spacecraft lifted off at 14:12 BST (09:12 EDT) from a private launch site near Van Horn, Texas. \nAt a post-launch news briefing, Jeff Bezos said: \"My expectations were high and they were dramatically exceeded.\"\nTwo minutes into the flight, the capsule separated from its rocket and continued upwards towards the Karman Line - the most widely recognised boundary of space, that lies 100km up. The newly minted-astronauts shouted \"wow!\" and cheered.\nThe post-flight briefing was shown video of the occupants performing somersaults and tumbles during four minutes of weightlessness. Stunning views of the Earth could be seen outside.\nJeff Bezos said he was surprised by the sensation of microgravity: \"It felt so normal,\" he explained.\nMs Funk added: \"It was great, I loved it, I can hardly wait to go again.\"\nIn the 1960s, Ms Funk was one member of a group of women called the Mercury 13. They underwent the same screening tests as male astronauts, but never got to fly under the US national space programme.\nMr Bezos told CBS News on Monday: \"Wally can outrun all of us. During the Mercury 13, she was better than all the men and I can guarantee that's still true today.\"\nBezos' brother Mark, 53, is a senior vice president at Robin Hood, a New York-based charity.\nOliver Daemen is the son of a Dutch financier. He had originally secured a seat on the second flight, but was drafted in to replaced the anonymous winner of a public auction who had to pull out from the trip with Bezos.\nThe capsule reached a maximum altitude of around 107km (351,210ft) before starting its descent, parachuting down to a soft landing in the West Texas desert.\nOn the way down, Jeff Bezos told mission control: \"You have a very happy crew up here.\"\nMark revealed that iconic items from aviation history were brought along on the flight. These included a piece of canvas used on the Wright brothers' first plane, a medallion made from the vehicle that performed the first hot air balloon flight in 1783 and a pair of goggles used by pilot Amelia Earhart.\nJeff Bezos recently resigned as chief executive of Amazon, the e-commerce giant he founded, in order to concentrate on his other ventures, including Blue Origin.\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Boris Johnson",
      "text": "Everyone knows Dominic Cummings's name, and usually not for flattering reasons.\nHaving covered politics for nearly 20 years, it is at the heart of my job to get to know senior figures in all the political parties, and advisers in government and in opposition. \nBut I have never known a backroom figure who has caused such rage, or who has enjoyed stirring up his opponents quite as much.\nIt's no secret that he has fallen out with Boris Johnson in spectacular style. It's hard to think of a bust-up and betrayal that's been as vicious and sustained. \nMr Cummings has written thousands of words about what he sees as Mr Johnson's flaws already. \nHe gave seven hours of brutally unrelenting evidence to MPs about the many things that he believes went wrong during the government's handling of the pandemic. \nThe former aide is an important witness to recent history but has his own agenda, and has been accused of trying to rewrite that history to give himself a more flattering role.  \nMr Cummings has never before though agreed to sit down and account for his own role in the pandemic, and also be questioned about his own efforts helping Mr Johnson in office, securing a Brexit deal and a huge election victory, or his time as boss of the Vote Leave campaign.\nIndeed, the first time that he promised he would do an interview, one day, was after the referendum in 2016, when we asked if he would answer questions about how he ran that campaign, how it behaved, and how it won. \nIn the five years that followed so much has happened that has changed the UK. \nCummings's detractors would say he is responsible for much of the political trauma. He became a household name because of the public outrage at his journey out of lockdown. \nNo-one was closer to the prime minister in government for more than a year. \nAside from Mr Johnson himself, perhaps no one else's decisions and judgements counted as much over a crucial period.\nArguably, no one other political campaigner's view of the world made such a difference to the country in recent times.\nAnd certainly, no one other political adviser has inspired such venom, attracted such conspiracy theories, and launched thousands of memes. \nThere are many people in the Conservative Party who believe his credibility is shot because of how he has explicitly tried to attack Mr Johnson in recent months.\nMPs have already expressed frustration that, in their view, he hasn't provided overwhelming evidence of the explosive claims he's already made.\nGiven his own reputation for provocation and playing with reality as a campaigner, it's not unreasonable to wonder if he can be believed now.\nHis arguments at times can seem contradictory, even though it feels like he has clear scripts in his head that he wants to follow. \nMr Cummings styles himself as someone who only wants to do what he thinks is the right thing, whatever it takes, and doesn't care very much what anyone else thinks. \nDespite his normal sartorial choices - crumpled shirts, beanie hats and tracksuit bottoms while in No 10 - he cared enough when we sat down this month to wear a new shirt for our interview, fresh with creases from the packet. \nHe arrived wearing a baseball cap along with his face mask, to avoid being spotted, and pages of scrawled notes in preparation. \nAnd rather than slink off into infamy, five years after he first said he would talk, we sat down and spoke for hours with the cameras rolling.\nThe interview might make you want to throw rocks at the TV. He might provoke you, in the way that winding his opponents up became his political trademark. His picture of what went on in Downing Street might alarm you too. \nBut his claims are very much his version of events.\nThey might help you understand more, for better or worse, what has really gone in in the last few years and what his extraordinary fallout with Mr Johnson was really about.  \nWhatever you think of Dominic Cummings, when big things happened, he was in the room.

      "tags": "Companies,HMV,Retailing,UK High Streets,Music",
      "text": "Music and entertainment retailer HMV has said it is looking to open 10 new stores this year as it continues to put its faith in High Street stores.\nThe plans include a search for a new London flagship site.\nIts former London landmark store on Oxford Street closed along with many others after HMV fell into administration more than two years ago. \nIt was bought by Canadian music retail executive Doug Putman, who says he still thinks stores have a future.\n\"People obviously love going out shopping, they like touching and feeling and that's something that online is not going to replace,\" he told the BBC.\n\"I do believe... you're going to get more people trying to open up different stores and have different ideas.\n\"I'm still very optimistic on the [HMV] business and business as a whole on the High Street. I still think the High Street is just something so special.\"\nThe new store plans were announced as HMV commemorates opening its first store on London's Oxford Street 100 years ago. \nHe said he could not give any details as to where the replacement flagship store in London would be as they were still taking a \"very hard look\" trying to find the best site. \nHowever, Mr Putman added that the long-term viability of the new stores was dependent on what the government did about business rates, which are currently being levied at a reduced rate until April next year.\nHMV would not be signing \"any long-term deals\" for the new stores, he said, given the level of uncertainty in the retail sector. \nAn HMV spokesman added: \"We're continuing to expand with new sites, looking at a combination of factors before making a decision. The upcoming business rates review will no doubt have an impact, not only on HMV, but on the wider British High Street. In some locations, even with good deals from landlords, rates make stores unviable.\"\nMr Putman said HMV's online business had done well throughout the pandemic, helping to offset the loss of sales in stores.\n\"Our online business - very similar to most retailers - doubled, tripled throughout the pandemic... [but] it still doesn't obviously make up for the loss of 100-plus stores.\"\nMusic stores have been particularly affected by the shift to digital over the years. The challenges from music downloading and streaming have added to the general shift to online sales affecting most retailers.\nEarlier this month, supermarket giant Sainsbury's said it had stopped selling CDs and DVDs as its customers increasingly went for music and films online.\nCD sales have shrunk in the past decade but were still worth \u00a3115m last year and vinyl sales continue to enjoy a revival of fortunes. \nThere aren't many companies that have continued to trade on our High Streets for a century. That HMV survives may surprise many who wonder how a bricks-and-mortar retailer of physical media survives in a world of downloads and streaming. \nThe venerable brand has focused on staying relevant to pop culture fans. The company's Canadian owner appears to have continued faith in the UK High Street at a time when it's undergoing a change just as challenging as any in HMV's history.  New stores are planned just as some people have questioned the purpose of the High Street post-pandemic. \nUK retailers have been through a deeply painful period of forced temporary closure, plunging sales and an accelerated shift to online shopping. Despite financial support from the government, some businesses have not survived the pandemic and the pain may not be over.\nThere are dire predictions of thousands of more High Street closures to come, as firms are weighed down by lockdown loans. The profound changes taking place in retail cannot be stopped, but businesses say they need the government to act. \nA radical change to the business rates regime is top of most retailers' list of requests. Ministers are already conducting a fundamental review of the rates system and the outcome should be published in the autumn. Confidence is also key at a time when many shoppers are anxious about the ending of the legal requirement to wear a face covering in England. "

      "text": "Travellers to England from green and amber list countries may no longer face Covid checks on arrival - according to a union representing border staff.\nOfficers will no longer routinely verify arrivals have tested negative before departure or completed a passenger locator form, the ISU said.\nThe Guardian first reported the change and said it aimed to reduce queues.\nThe government said carriers were checking all necessary requirements including forms and test bookings.\nA spokesperson added: \"This legal requirement on carriers is underpinned by a robust compliance regime, which is overseen by regulators.\n\"Compliance with these rules is essential in order to protect the population from new variants of Covid-19, and so there will be tough fines for those who do not follow the rules.\"\nAirlines UK, which represents easyJet, Tui and British Airways among others, said: \"Carriers are committed to working with Border Force on these requirements, which is why compliance has remained consistently extremely high.\"\nBut Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds accused the government of \"yet more staggering incompetence\" and added: \"They must - urgently - get a grip.\"\nFrom Monday, carriers were asked to begin checking vaccine status certification. They were already legally required to ensure passengers have completed necessary requirements before travelling.\nThe Guardian said it had seen a leaked memo that told border staff they no longer had to search for a passenger locator form when the computer system failed to find one.\nThe memo also reportedly confirmed that electronic border gates \"will no longer refer passengers to in-person checks by Border Force officers if a passenger locator form is not found\".\nThe memo, which the Guardian said became operational on Monday as other restrictions eased in England, has not been seen by the BBC.\nBorder Force officers were previously instructed to check 100% of passenger Covid documentation at the border - a direction blamed by some for contributing to queues of up to six hours. \nPreviously about 10% of passenger Covid documentation had been checked.\nBut Lucy Moreton, of the ISU trade union, confirmed the reported memo was accurate.\n\"Ultimately this is a political decision,\" Ms Moreton said.\n\"Certainly, it will reduce queue times significantly and hopefully also the level of verbal abuse to which Border Force staff are subject.  \n\"That is welcome to us. The impact on the UK's Covid security is ultimately a scientific determination.\"\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps has warned of continuing disruption to travel, saying passengers should expect much of that to be focused at check-in and before travel, rather than at the border.\nAll arrivals regardless of where they are coming from abroad are required to test negative before departure and have valid proof of their test status.\nThey are also required to conduct another test two days after their arrival, and prove this is organised pre-departure.\nAll travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form with basic details including an address.\nThose arriving from amber list countries, who are not fully vaccinated, must also complete a further test on day eight and quarantine at an address listed on the form. \nPeople who have been fully vaccinated are no longer required to carry out home quarantine when arriving from an amber list country.\nArrivals from red list countries must quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days, at a cost of at least \u00a31,750 per adult.\nAdditional reporting by George Bowden."

      "text": "The foreign secretary has accused the EU of seeking \"to undermine the UK's sovereignty over Gibraltar\". \nDominic Raab said he was \"disappointed\" by EU proposals for a post-Brexit deal over the British overseas territory.\nMr Raab said a draft mandate from the European Commission \"directly conflicts\" with a framework deal agreed by the UK, Gibraltar and Spain last December. \nEU leaders must sign off on the EU's mandate before negotiations can begin.\nGibraltar's sovereignty is disputed by Spain and Britain. The territory was not included in the trade agreement settled between the EU and the UK last year and a separate deal has to be agreed.\nIt is thought that British objections to the EU plans centre on the nature of proposed new border arrangements in Gibraltar.\nLast December's political deal between the UK, Gibraltar and Spain gave a prominent role to the EU's border agency Frontex but the Commission's mandate appears to give greater responsibility to Spanish officials. \nIn a statement, the foreign secretary said: \"We have consistently showed pragmatism and flexibility in the search for arrangements that work for all sides, and we are disappointed that this has not been reciprocated. We urge the EU to think again.\"\nThe European Commission said the proposed negotiating directives \"put forward solutions to remove physical checks and controls on persons and goods\" at the border between Spain and Gibraltar.\n\"It is without prejudice to the issues of sovereignty and jurisdiction, and focuses on cooperation in the region,\" the bloc added.\nThe mandate includes rules for establishing responsibility for asylum, visas, residence permits and police cooperation and information exchange.\nThe EU's post-Brexit negotiator, Maros Sefcovic, said its proposals seek to make a \"positive impact\" on those living either side of the border with Spain while protecting the single market.\n\"By putting forward this draft mandate, we are honouring the political commitment we made to Spain to start the negotiations of a separate agreement between the EU and the UK on Gibraltar.\n\"This is a detailed mandate, which aims to have a positive impact for those living and working on either side of the border between Spain and Gibraltar, while protecting the integrity of the Schengen Area and the single market.\"\nIn March the Foreign Secretary, and Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo agreed a joint approach to the negotiations on a new Gibraltar treaty between the EU and the UK."

      "text": "An NHS Wales nurse who started a petition seeking a 15% pay rise for health and social care staff has gathered almost 800,000 names.\nMatthew Tovey, from Merthyr Tydfil, said NHS staff had been hailed as heroes during the Covid-19 pandemic and deserved to be rewarded.\nThe Welsh government said it was considering findings before making any decision on pay rises.\nThe UK government is due to publish its long-awaited NHS pay report soon.\n\"We've been all been hailed as heroes and angels who were working in unimaginable conditions,\" hospital nurse Mr Tovey told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\n\"We had limited resources, scarce PPE. It was a terrifying experience.\"\nMr Tovey said staff morale was \"on the floor\", and that colleagues were \"leaving the profession in droves\".\n\"We're already heading into a third wave, and it's sort of impossible to recruit new nurses,\" he added.\n\"A 15% pay raise would draw staff into the vacant posts and shows our true worth.\"\nThe petition is due to be delivered to Number 10 Downing Street on Tuesday.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has defended plans to give some NHS staff in England a 1% pay rise, prompting threats of industrial action.\nPay review bodies covering most NHS workers have made recommendations which have not yet been published.\nThe Welsh government will make a decision based on the review's recommendations as health is a devolved issue in Wales.\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \"We haven't set an arbitrary cap on pay in our evidence to the pay review bodies and we are considering findings before we make an informed decision.\"\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"Throughout the pandemic the UK government has always ensured Wales is getting the right support - with \u00a38.6bn of additional spending.\"\nLast month, nine trade unions signed an open letter to the Welsh government saying an \"urgent and significant pay rise\" was vital for NHS workers to reward staff and stop them leaving jobs.\nThe Royal College of Nurses (RCN) said the Welsh government should commit to a 12.5% increase for all staff.\nA bonus of \u00a3735 each was given to 222,000 Welsh NHS staff earlier this year - amounting to about \u00a3500 after tax is deducted."

      "text": "Some fully vaccinated people in critical roles in England will be able to continue working even if told to self-isolate after being in close contact with someone who has Covid.\nInstead those eligible - including NHS and care staff - will be able to take daily tests, the government said.\nA list of critical workers is due to be published, but the PM said it included food, utility and border staff.\nIt follows mounting criticism of the impact of self-isolation on industry.\nThose eligible will be specifically named on a letter from a government department. \"This is not a blanket exemption for any sector or role,\" a government spokesman said.\nThe new rule is limited to those without Covid symptoms and was announced as most remaining curbs in England ended on Monday, including face mask laws.\nMeanwhile, a further 39,950 cases were recorded on Monday alongside another 19 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson told a news conference that test, trace and isolate was still an \"essential\" part of the government's Covid response.\nHe said close contacts of positive cases were five times more likely to contract Covid and that a \"continuing sacrifice\" would be required.\nSpeaking while isolating at his country residence, Mr Johnson said workers involved in the supply of food, water and electricity, as well as staff on the border and on the railways, would be among those exempt from self-isolation.\nBut he said this would be for work purposes only and involve a \"very, very small number of named critical workers\" with employers contacted by letter.\nHe added that the government did not want to \"extend it too widely because this is one of the few shots we've got left in our locker to stop the chain reaction of the spread of Covid\".\nAlthough it was unclear exactly which jobs would be eligible, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi earlier confirmed the change would apply to health and social care workers in England.\nIn Scotland, NHS staff will shortly receive similar guidance on self-isolation, deputy chief medical officer Dr Dave Caesar said.\nIt came as Mr Zahawi confirmed a limited group of children, many with underlying conditions, would be eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as soon as possible in England.\nHe also confirmed that proof of full vaccination would be required in \"large crowded settings\" such as nightclubs from the end of September in England - after all over-18s have had the chance to receive both vaccine doses.\nUnder current self-isolation rules in England, anyone who is traced as a close contact of a confirmed positive case must isolate for 10 days, whether or not they have received both doses of a vaccine.\nAn upcoming change from 16 August will mean people who are fully vaccinated will be able to skip isolation by taking a daily Covid test.\nUnder-18s will also no longer be required to self-isolate from 16 August if they are contact traced.\nSimilar rules are due to come into force in Scotland from 9 August - and in Wales from 7 August.\nMr Johnson, along with Chancellor Rishi Sunak, is self-isolating after being in close contact with Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who tested positive over the weekend after feeling unwell on Friday evening.\nThe PM appeared at Monday's news conference via video call from Buckinghamshire, alongside England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam and the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance in Downing Street.\nAmid a surge in infections linked to the Delta virus variant, a BBC analysis previously showed more than 4.5 million people could be asked to self-isolate between 7 July and 16 August.\nFigures last week showed more than 530,000 contact tracing alerts were sent from the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales between 1 July and 7 July.\nPeople can also be told to self-isolate through a separate process run by NHS Test and Trace backed by laws.\nPub chains, supermarkets and other businesses have warned of the crippling effect blanket stay-at-home orders for close contacts were having on their operations.\nTheatre impresario Andrew Lloyd-Webber said on Monday that self-isolation rules had forced the cancellation of performances of his new West End show Cinderella.\nEach UK nation is in charge of its own coronavirus regulations. England ended most of its remaining restrictions on Monday, while Scotland also eased some curbs as it moved to level zero.\nSome restrictions were lifted in Wales on Saturday, bringing an end to social-distancing outside. In Northern Ireland, a new Covid-19 certificate app is being prepared for launch next week amid a \"final push\" to get younger people vaccinated.\nThe number of daily Covid cases is often lower at the beginning of the week due to reporting delays and a \"weekend effect\". \nThe number of patients admitted to hospital with Covid in the last seven days was 39.5% higher than the previous week, government data showed, with 4,317 admissions over the latest period.\nThe number of deaths in the last seven days was 48% higher than the previous week, with 296 recorded."

Electoral observers, including the Organisation of American States, have also said they have found no irregularities.\nAhead of Monday night's announcement, Ms Fujimori said she would accept the result.\n\"The truth will come out anyway,\" she added. \"We are all going to work together to re-establish legitimacy in our country.\"\nMs Fujimori is the daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori, who is in jail serving a 25-year sentence for crimes including corruption and human rights abuses.\nMs Fujimori herself is being investigated for alleged corruption and money laundering, claims she says are politically motivated. Her failure to become president means prosecutors can now proceed with the charges against her. \nYou might also be interested in:\nHow communities come together to replace an Inca rope bridge."

      "text": "People with Covid in Northern Ireland can now stop self-isolating after five full days, if they have have two negative tests. \nThese rules are also in place in England, where the prime minister has said that there will \"soon be a time\" when self-isolation is not required.\nThe self-isolation period for anyone who develops symptoms or tests positive for Covid is five full days. \nThe day symptoms begin - or you test positive - is day zero. The next day is day one of self-isolation.\nYou can leave self-isolation after five full days if you have two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart.\nYou can take the first on day five. If it's negative, you can take another test 24 hours later on day six. If this is also negative - and you don't have a temperature - you can immediately end isolation. \nThe rules apply whether or not you are vaccinated.  \nThe current self-isolation regulations run out on 24 March.\nThe prime minister has told MPs he does not expect to renew the rules and said they could end sooner - if Covid data allows.\nHe said that \"as Covid becomes endemic\" (in other words, constantly present) the government will \"replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others\". \nThis would be similar to advice for other infectious diseases such as flu. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid also said he was \"optimistic\" the government would shortly be able to \"remove all restrictions around Covid\".\nIt is not clear whether the rest of the UK would follow suit. \nIn Scotland and Wales you must self-isolate for at least seven days as soon as symptoms appear.\nPeople without symptoms who have a positive LFT result should also self-isolate immediately. They don't need to take a PCR test, although clinically vulnerable people in Wales are advised to do so.\nYou can end self-isolation after two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart - the first no earlier than day six. If you don't have a temperature, you can stop self-isolating after the second negative test, on day seven.\nIf the day six test is positive, you can take two further tests on subsequent days.\nThe guidance applies whatever your vaccination status.\nAnyone leaving self-isolation is \"strongly advised\" to limit close contact with people in crowded or poorly-ventilated spaces. \nThey should work from home and minimise contact with people at higher risk from Covid.\nThe rules about self-isolation after contact with someone with Covid are broadly similar across the UK. \nIf you are fully vaccinated (two doses - three in Scotland), you don't have to self-isolate, but should take daily LFTs for seven days (or until 10 days since your last contact, if this is earlier). \nThis also applies to under-18s (18 years and four months in Scotland; 18 years and six months in England).\nIf any of the LFTs are positive, you must self-isolate from the date of the test.\nClose contacts of positive cases who are not fully vaccinated still have to self-isolate for the full 10 days. \nIn Scotland, they are advised to take one PCR test and continue isolating even if the result is negative. \nIn Wales, unvaccinated contacts are advised to take LFTs on days two and eight, even if they have no symptoms.\nAnyone who develops Covid symptoms during self-isolation should take a PCR test. \nSelf-isolation means staying at home and not going out.\nAdults shouldn't go to work and children shouldn't go to school. \nYou should order online groceries, or ask friends or family to deliver supplies.\nNo-one from outside your household should come inside, unless to deliver essential care.\nIf you have symptoms or test positive, you should: \nPeople on a low income who are told to isolate may be entitled to some financial help:"

      "tags": "Consumer behaviour,Personal finance,Online shopping,Delivery services",
      "text": "A plan to crack down on online rip-offs including making it illegal for people to write or host fake reviews has been outlined by the government.\nThe proposals would see bigger fines for firms that trick consumers into spending more than they want to online. \nBusinesses offering subscriptions would also be required to make clear exactly what consumers are signing up for and allow them to cancel easily.\nConsumer champion Which? said the plans should be \"swiftly implemented\".\nRocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said the pandemic had highlighted weaknesses in consumer protections that allowed \"unscrupulous businesses to exploit customers\".\nUnder the government's proposals, regulators would receive help to stamp out tactics used to manipulate people browsing for goods and services online.\nThis includes punishing businesses that trick consumers into spending more than they want to, and \"negative nudges\" - when businesses pay to have their product feature highly on a trader's website while hiding the fact they paid for it.\nThe government said it would also get tough on prepayment schemes such as Christmas savings clubs - where customers choose Christmas hampers and vouchers months in advance, and then make regular payments towards the goods over the course of the year.\nUnder the plans such schemes would have to safeguard customers' money in future. The aim is to prevent scandals such as Farepak, which saw tens of thousands of people lose all they had saved for Christmas when the company went bust in 2006.\nFor the used car and home improvement sectors where consumers often make big one-off purchases, the government will make it mandatory for businesses to take part in arbitration or mediation where disputes arise over a transaction, so that consumer gripes are not dragged through the courts.\nFor many of us it's become almost second nature to check a review site before buying or booking everything from restaurants, to holiday accommodation or trades people. Reviews matter, and that's why a whole industry has been spawned paying people to churn out fake positive reviews. \nThe regulator has been making noises about trying to clamp down for a while, but now the government wants to tighten up the rules and make it illegal to pay someone to write or host a fake review. Hitting the host sites as well as the company being reviewed is the easier and potentially more effective way of trying to tackle the problem, rather than playing whack-a-mole with individual reviews that emerge.\nThe difficulty, as ever, is going to be enforcement because regulators are always playing catch-up. New teeth for the Competition and Markets Authority will help but can never provide full protection for consumers. \nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government was \"giving businesses confidence that they're competing on fair terms, and the public confidence they're getting a good deal\".\nConsumer and small business minister Paul Scully added: \"When consumers part with their hard-earned cash, they've got every right to expect they'll get their money's worth. Cowboy builders aren't welcome in 21st century Britain.\"\nThe government's proposals are part of a new consultation on reforming competition and consumer policy to give the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) enhanced powers to tackle consumer rip-offs and bad business practices.\nThe government said there would be tougher penalties for those who break the law, with new powers for the CMA to issue fines of up to 10% of a firm's global turnover.\nOther punishments which the CMA could enforce include disqualifying company directors who make false declarations to the regulator and being able to block so-called \"killer acquisitions\", where big businesses snap up prospective rivals before they can launch new services or products.\nThe CMA will be able to enforce consumer law directly, rather than having to go through a court process, the government said.\nThe watchdog will also be required produce regular \"state of competition\" reports under the plans to look at the vibrancy of competition in the UK's markets."

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing,Rishi Sunak,Reality Check,Self-isolation",
      "text": "Labour has accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak of trying to \"dodge\" self-isolation rules.\nAfter they were named as close contacts of someone who had tested positive at the weekend, Downing Street first said they would participate in a Covid testing pilot - rather than self-isolating - before reversing this decision within hours.\nLabour's accusation comes as more than half a million contacts of Covid-positive people are told to stay at home in a single week, with growing criticism about the effect on the economy and public services.\nOn Saturday, 17 July, Health Secretary Sajid Javid posted a video on Twitter, saying he had tested positive for coronavirus after feeling \"groggy\" on Friday night. \nHe had used a rapid lateral flow swab test so then took a more accurate lab-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which also came back positive. \nMr Javid confirmed this on Twitter on Saturday evening.\nAnd at 08:00 on Sunday, Downing Street said NHS Test and Trace had contacted Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak \"as contacts of someone who has tested positive for Covid\" but they would be participating in a \"daily contact-testing pilot to allow them to continue to work from Downing Street\". \nThis drew criticism, including from Labour leader Keir Starmer, who said the prime minister was giving himself and the chancellor \"preferential treatment\". \n\"It can't be one rule for the Conservatives and another for everyone else,\" he added.\nThen, speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick defended the prime minister, claiming the scheme \"is a well known and long standing one, it's not just available for politicians\".\nBut within three hours of its first statement, Downing Street put out another, saying Mr Johnson would not be participating in the pilot scheme and would instead be self-isolating at Chequers, his official country residence.\nAnd Mr Sunak confirmed he would be doing the same.\nOn Sunday afternoon, Mr Johnson posted a video, in which he said he had been \"pinged\". \n\"We did look briefly at the idea of us taking part in the pilot scheme which allows people to test daily,\" he said. \n\"But I think it's far more important that everybody sticks to the same rules. \n\"And that's why I'm going to be self-isolating until 26 July.\"\nThere has been some confusion over which scheme was being referred to by the prime minister and others. \nThere is a pilot involving 40,000 people in England, recruited through NHS Test and Trace, to find out what happens if contacts of a positive case test every day and self-isolate only if one of them is positive.\nParticipants are randomly assigned to either:\nBut the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) told BBC News there was another, workplace-based scheme, which had not been publicly announced. \nThis pilot involves 20 organisations, including the offices of the prime minister, and is being led by NHS Test and Trace. \nIf someone at one of the participating workplaces is told someone they were in close contact with has Covid, instead of self-isolating they will need to take a test every day for a week (or at least five out of the seven days). \nThey can continue to come into work as long as they don't test positive, but will be asked to isolate on the days they are not working.  \nThe scheme had launched in December, with Downing Street joining in May - and the results were expected later in the summer.\nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove had taken part in June, the DHSC said, after being contacted by Test and Trace on his return from the 29 May Champions' League final in Portugal.  \nAt the time, it was reported he was participating in the 40,000-strong daily contact testing study - and a quote from his representative appeared to confirm this. \nBut now, the DHSC has made clear he was taking part in the same workplace scheme in which Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak were intending to participate.\nThe government says other participants include Transport for London (TfL), at just two of its sites, Network Rail, Heathrow Airport, Border Force and a series of private companies it has not disclosed.\nTFL had first said it was waiting for \"formal notification\" from government that it would be part of a trial enabling daily tests to replace the need for self-isolation. \nAn official later clarified this was about a larger national trial but two of its sites were already part of a \"limited\" trial of daily testing. \nThe ISU union, which represents the UK's border guards, told BBC News that staff had avoided self-isolation by testing at sites in Dover and Manchester, as part of a pilot scheme. \nBorder guards pinged by the NHS Covid-19 app could drive to a test site before returning to work, as an alternative to self-isolating at home for 10 days on full pay. \nBut on Friday, the union said staff had been told the scheme was closing down because of low participation.  \nWe contacted the Home Office which says the scheme is continuing. \nMeanwhile, from Monday 19 July, fully vaccinated front-line staff in the NHS and in the care sector in England who are told to self-isolate will still be permitted to work \"in exceptional circumstances\" with \"testing mitigations\", to ease pressure on the health service. \nThe government has said it will extend this exemption to other \"critical workers\" such as air traffic controllers and train signallers.\nWhat claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

      "tags": "France,Home Office,English Channel,Europe migrant crisis,Migration",
      "text": "France will double the number of police patrolling its beaches as part of a deal with the UK to stem the number of migrants crossing the English Channel.\nIt comes as the number of people crossing the Channel this year has now overtaken 2020's total.\nThe UK will pay more than \u00a354m as part of the deal, which will also improve intelligence sharing.\nBut Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont suggested it would not have an impact as the French coastline is too big.\nHe told the Today programme: \"The fact is, we've seen it before. Having more money, having more police officers, having more controls, will not prevent people to succeed in these crossing attempts.\n\"We have too many kilometres of shore to monitor.\"\nThe funding will also be used for better technology to target those who organise the crossings, the Home Office said. \nA group of migrants was seen arriving at Dover on Wednesday morning, bringing the total number this year to more than the 8,461 who made the crossing in 2020. \nOn Monday at least 430 migrants crossed the Channel - a record for one day. The previous daily high of 416 was set in September last year. \nThe Home Office said on Tuesday 287 people had landed in the UK.\nUK Home Secretary Priti Patel and French interior minister Gerald Darmanin have agreed to \"strengthen co-operation\" over the crossings.\nThe Home Office said UK support last year helped France double the number of officers deployed daily on the beaches of its northern coast.\nIt said this resulted in France preventing twice as many crossings so far this year compared with the same period in 2020.\nHowever, it said the people who facilitated the crossings had now changed their tactics and had moved further up the French coast, \"forcing migrants to take even longer, riskier journeys\".\nMr Dumont added that the French are not supposed to intervene at sea - yet former Border Force chief Tony Smith has called for joint patrols. \nMr Smith said: \"That seems to be a step too far for the French at the moment. The French position is they are not prepared to intervene on the high seas, only on land.\"\nThe new support announced by the UK would enable France \"to respond by posting more security forces further up the coast, installing and utilising the latest surveillance equipment throughout northern France\", the Home Office said.\nHome Office minister Victoria Atkins insisted that a \u00a328m deal between the UK and France last November, to double police patrols on French beaches, had made a difference, saying it had prevented some 7,500 people crossing the Channel.\nMs Atkins told Today it was an \"incredibly complicated\" situation and that the UK was trying to work with other countries to make sure \"when people arrive in a safe country, they remain there and do not try to make that hazardous journey\". She said the government wanted \"safe routes for legal migrants\" and to crack down on the gangs bringing people over.  \nAnalysis by Simon Jones, BBC reporter, in Dover\nFrom the famous White Cliffs of Dover, we watched this morning as another group of migrants was brought to shore by the Border Force, having been picked up in the Channel. \nConditions at sea are once again incredibly calm and the sun is shining, so these are unlikely to be the only arrivals today. \nAlmost 1,000 people have reached the UK by boat in the past three days, putting pressure on the home secretary to act. \nPriti Patel is now pledging more money to the French authorities to try to prevent the crossings. But the deal struck last night is very similar to one agreed between Britain and France last November - which has failed to stem the numbers arriving, though the Home Office points out the number of crossings being prevented by the French authorities has doubled.\nThe government here accepts there is no quick and easy fix to problems with the asylum system, but there's no doubt the home secretary will want to see swift results in return for the increased investment in northern France.\nMs Patel has previously pledged to make Channel crossings \"unviable\", with new legislation that will make it a crime to knowingly arrive in the UK without permission.\nThe Nationality and Borders Bill, which is currently being considered by MPs, will mean migrants entering without permission could face up to four years in prison.\nThe government hopes the overhaul of asylum rules will deter migrants from making the crossing.\nBut the plans have been criticised by charities including Refugee Action, which has called them \"extreme and nasty\". \nDan O'Mahoney, Clandestine Channel Threat Commander for the Home Office, said: \"There is an unacceptable rise in dangerous small boat crossings across the Channel because of a surge in illegal migration across Europe.\n\"People should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach and not risk their lives making these dangerous crossings. We are continuing to pursue the criminals behind these illegal crossings.\"\nHe added that the Nationality and Borders Bill would \"protect lives and break this cycle of illegal crossings\" and the government was continuing to return those with no legal right to remain in the UK. \nBut Amnesty International's Steve Valdez-Symonds told the BBC the new legislation was an \"extremely reckless and dangerous response\" to the issue and would not tackle the problem of people smugglers. \nInstead, he said it was likely to drive desperate people to avoid the authorities, leaving them vulnerable to further exploitation and slavery. \nLabour shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the Home Office announcement was \"yet more empty words from the Conservatives about agreeing a deal with France to address trafficking gangs\".\nHe said ministers promised a plan with France in August 2020, \"yet almost a year later they are still making empty promises, letting down victims, and allowing criminals to continue their evil trade\"."

      "text": "Ben & Jerry's has said it will stop selling its ice cream in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.\nThe US company said sales \"in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT)\" were \"inconsistent with our values\".\nIsraeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the move was \"morally wrong\" and would prove to be \"financially wrong\".\nThe West Bank and East Jerusalem have been under Israeli control since the 1967 Middle East war.\nMore than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements there. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. \nIn a statement shared to its Twitter and Instagram pages on Monday, Ben & Jerry's said its decision reflected the concerns of \"fans and trusted partners\".\nThe changes would be made by allowing current licensing arrangements to expire at the end of next year, it added. \n\"We have a longstanding partnership with our licensee, who manufactures Ben & Jerry's ice cream in Israel and distributes it in the region,\" the statement said.\n\"We have been working to change this, and so we have informed our licensee that we will not renew the license agreement when it expires at the end of next year.\"\nBen & Jerry's also runs two \"scoop shops\" in Israel and said it would distribute its goods in Israel through a different agreement, the details of which would be announced \"when we're ready\".\nUK firm Unilever, which has owned Ben & Jerry's since 2000, says the decision was taken and announced by Ben & Jerry's and its independent board, but it remained \"fully committed\" to maintaining a presence in Israel.\nBen & Jerry's Israeli licensee was quoted by the Haaretz newspaper as saying: \"Global Ben & Jerry's decided not to renew the agreement with us in another year and a half in light of our refusal [to comply] with their demand and stop selling throughout Israel.\"\n\"We call on the Israeli government and consumers not to permit a boycott of Israel... Ice cream is not part of politics.\"\nIsraeli politicians reacted furiously to the announcement. \n\"The boycott of Israel - a democracy surrounded by islands of terror - reflects a complete loss of bearings. The boycott does not work and will not work, and we will fight it with all our might,\" Mr Bennett said.\nForeign Minister Yair Lapid called Ben & Jerry's move a \"disgraceful capitulation\" to anti-Semitism and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for a complete boycott of Israel over its treatment of the Palestinians.\n\"Over 30 states in the United States have passed anti-BDS legislation in recent years. I plan on asking each of them to enforce these laws against Ben & Jerry's,\" he said.\nA spokesman for BDS, Mahmoud Nawajaa, it welcomed Ben & Jerry's decision and called on the company \"to end all its procedures with the apartheid Israel\".\nBen & Jerry's  - which was founded in 1978 by best friends Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield - has a track record of campaigning on social issues such as LGBTQ+ rights and climate change.

      "text": "Asian stock markets fell on Tuesday, tracking sharp declines seen in Europe and the US on Monday that were triggered by fears that rising Covid cases will hamper economic recovery.\nJapan's Nikkei 225 index fell 1% to hit its lowest level in six months, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng also lost 1%.\nOn Monday, both the UK's FTSE 100 index and the US Dow Jones Industrial Average had tumbled by more than 2%.\nBut shares in London and the rest of Europe started stronger on Tuesday.\nThe FTSE 100 index rebounded 1%, while other major European indexes saw similar rises.\nMonday's sharp falls came as investors became increasingly jittery about the rise in the number of Covid cases in some countries, fuelled by the Delta variant.\nJapanese shares have now fallen for five sessions in a row over concerns about the spread of the variant and that the Tokyo Olympics could worsen the health crisis.\n\"Investors are concerned that the rapid spread of the Delta variant will derail the trajectory of the global recovery, notably in Asia which still has relatively low vaccination rates and where some widely used vaccines do not appear overly effective against it,\" Jeff Halley, senior market analyst, from Oanda told the BBC.\n\"I believe we are in for a messy week ahead, with markets being driven around by sentiment and not data, as the international economic calendar is very quiet.\"\nMeanwhile, businesses in the UK have described how they are cutting opening hours, closing shops or may have to reduce production as employees are forced to self-isolate after being alerted by the NHS Covid-19 app.\n\"Optimism which had been on the horizon just a few weeks ago has again been obscured by dark clouds, especially with the snap decision to enforce a 10-day quarantine for arrivals from France,\" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, on Monday.\n\"With some scientists warning that infections could reach 200,000 a day by September, there is now a feeling that the UK could be staring at a fresh autumn lockdown,\" she added.\nAt a media briefing, US President Joe Biden urged Americans to get vaccinated in order to ensure the economy can remain open.\nCovid infections linked to the Delta variant have been increasing, but concerns among US investors spiked after Los Angeles imposed an indoor mask mandate again over the weekend.\nOn Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.1% in its worst session of 2021. \nCommenting on how markets performed on Monday, President Biden said: \"That's not how I judge economic growth.\"\nHis comments came after data published last week showed prices in the US spiked again in June, driven higher by the cost of used cars and food increasing.\nMr Biden said that the increase in inflation was expected to be temporary, but he understood that unchecked inflation over the long term would pose a \"real challenge\" to the economy."

But it does mean nightclubs need to do the socially responsible thing.\n\"As we said last week, we do reserve the right to mandate certification at any point if it's necessary to reduce transmission.\"\nMr Lord said the industry had been taken by surprise by the latest announcement. \n\"I am not a scientist or a doctor, but I am deeply concerned by the discriminatory nature for those who either can't have the vaccine for medical reasons or age, or who do not want to,\" he said.\n\"With this one move, the Government appears to have wiped out live gigs for a whole generation.\"\nHe added: \"How will nightclubs now compete against pubs and bars down the road where these restrictions aren't needed, or attract punters who can just as easily have a house party without these enforcements in place.\n\"I have been in the nightlife and events industry for over 25 years, but I cannot see any reason why anyone would now want to enter this sector with such financially damaging restrictions in place.\"\nEarlier, he told BBC Breakfast hospitality businesses remain \"on a cliff edge\" \nHe said over the last 18 months businesses had seen how the government \"has really not understood\" their needs and how they operate.\nHe added: \"The ten o'clock curfew is a perfect example, pushing hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets at exactly the same time. That did far worse than good.\n\"We saw ridiculous substantial meal rules - the Scotch egg rule.\n\"I took them to the High Court to compel them to drop that, which saved many businesses and jobs across the whole of the UK. \n\"So time and time again, we have seen so many mistakes.\"\n A government spokesperson said: \"We appreciate the significant impact the pandemic has had on the hospitality industry - including the night-time economy.\n\"[This] is why, on top of our unprecedented \u00a3352bn package of business support, just last week we launched our hospitality strategy to help the sector recover as well as boost resilience long-term.\"\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

But they can make an informed decision,\" he replied.\n\"I don't want to have to mandate people and tell people what to do as government any longer than I really have to. \n\"But they do have a responsibility to themselves, to their families and to their communities. It's by doing the right thing that we can keep Covid at bay.\"\nEarlier, he told Times Radio that self-isolating after being told to by the app was a decision for individuals and employers.\n\"It's important to understand the rules,\" he said. \"You have to legally isolate if you are... contacted by Test and Trace, or if you're trying to claim isolation payments. The app is there to allow you to make informed decisions.\"\nThe Times is also reporting that ministers have written to major manufacturers emphasising that staff are not legally obliged to isolate if \"pinged\". Investment minister Lord Grimstone told one large employer the app was only an \"advisory tool\" and that people were not under any \"legal duty\", the paper said.\nFollowing the ministers' comments, Downing Street attempted to clarify the government's position, insisting isolation remained the \"most important action\" people can take to stop the spread of the virus.\n\"Given the risk of having and spreading the virus when people have been in contact with someone with Covid, it is crucial people isolate when they are told to do so, either by NHS Test and Trace or by the NHS Covid app,\" a No 10 spokeswoman said.\n\"Businesses should be supporting employees to isolate, they should not be encouraging them to break isolation.\"\nNow that legal restrictions have been lifted in England, cases of coronavirus will undoubtedly rise further. \nBut a significant number of adults are not yet fully vaccinated. \nIn the meantime, the test and trace system remains the only way the government can contain the virus to a level it deems acceptable. \nSo the message on how closely people should follow the advice to isolate if \"pinged\" by the app is crucial. \nAlthough it's not a legal requirement to do so (only if contacted directly by test and trace) any suggestion that it's up to you, optional, or a judgement call risks undermining the government's entire approach. \nThat's why we saw a junior minister's choice of words was quickly corrected by Downing Street this morning. \nThe rules change next month, allowing double jabbed adults to avoid isolation. \nUntil then the government will have to hope it can keep the public's confidence in the app and its instructions to isolate. \nJohn Edmunds, professor of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, said contact tracing and self-isolation should be maintained \"as stringently as we can\".\n\"We have one of the highest rates of cases in the world right now. The NHS has been under strain for a long time and they are busy trying to catch up on operations and are very, very busy. So to put them under more pressure now is going to be awkward,\" he told Times Radio. \nJustin Madders, Labour's shadow health minister, accused the government of \"making it up as they go along\".  \n\"Yet again there is more confusion and incompetence from the heart of government at the expense of public health. They need to get a grip,\" he said. \nWhile the Covid app can only advise people to self-isolate, anyone in England who is called, texted or emailed by NHS Test and Trace must isolate for 10 days.\nFailure to self-isolate for the full time period can result in a fine, starting from \u00a31,000.\nIn other developments:"

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "text": "Twelve people have died after record-breaking rainfall flooded underground railway tunnels in China, leaving passengers trapped in rising waters.\nVideo shared on social media shows evening commuters just managing to keep their heads above water. Water is seen rushing onto platforms.\nMore than 500 people were eventually rescued from the tunnels in Henan province, officials said.\nDays of rain have caused widespread damage and led to 200,000 evacuations.\nAbove ground, roads have been turned into rivers, with cars and debris swept along in fast moving currents. A number of pedestrians have had to be rescued.\nIn total, 25 people have died in Henan province and more than a dozen cities are affected. President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that there had been \"significant loss of life and damage to property\". \nSeveral dams and reservoirs have breached warning levels, and soldiers have been mobilised to divert rivers which have burst their banks. Flights and trains in many parts of Henan have also been suspended.\nIn the provincial capital  Zhengzhou, the equivalent of a year's average rainfall has fallen in just three days. \nOn Tuesday, some of the city's flood defences were overwhelmed and water began flowing down into the railway tunnels.\nSurvivors have described how water leaked through the doors, rising slowly from \"our ankles to our knees to our necks\". \"All of us who could, stood on the subway seats,\" one woman wrote on Chinese social network site Weibo. \nChildren were lifted out of the water by their parents, while others threw off anything which might hold them down.\nAfter about half an hour, one passenger said it became \"hard to breathe\".\nAn order to shut down the line came at 18:10 local time (10:10 GMT) so the evacuation could begin, Zhengzhou government officials said in a statement. Five people are being treated for injuries, with 12 having died.\nElsewhere in the central Chinese city, children had to be rescued from a flooded nursery school.\nState media aired footage of them being floated out in plastic tubs by rescuers.\nThe First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou Hospital also briefly lost power on Tuesday night, though this has now been restored, said a statement on Weibo by the Zhengzhou Municipal Party Committee. \nIt added that 600 critically ill patients had been transferred to another location. \nAnother resident, identified as Mr Liu, 27, told BBC Chinese he had had \"no water, no electricity, and no internet\".\n\"Never in my life had I seen so much rain,\" Mr Liu added. \"There was one hour where the rain was just pouring down on us from the heavens, and everything went completely white.\"\nBut the rising waters were not just confined to Zhengzhou. \nA 20-metre (65ft) breach has emerged in the dam in Luoyang city after it was damaged by storms, officials said. Soldiers have been deployed to the area and a statement from the army warned it could \"collapse at any time\".\nAnother user said that residents in Sishui town were stuck on rooftops. \"We don't know how to swim\u2026 the whole village is about to be washed away,\" the person wrote.\nHenan has experienced \"rare and severe rainfall\" since Saturday, China's meteorological authority said on Wednesday.\nZhengzhou saw 624mm of rainfall on Tuesday, with a third of that amount falling between 16:00 and 17:00 alone, which \"smashed historical records\".\nIt forecasted that parts of the region would continue to see \"severe or extremely severe storms\" and that the heavy rain was likely to end only on Thursday.\nMany factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely.\nPart of the Yellow River basin in China, Henan has several major river systems running through the province which are prone to flooding. \nZhengzhou, which has a population of 12 million, sits on the banks of the Yellow River itself.\nScientists have warned that widespread dam construction has exacerbated climate change problems in China's flood zone, says the BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell.\nConnections between rivers and lakes have been cut and disrupted flood plains which once absorbed much of the region's annual summer downpours."

Investment minister Lord Grimstone told one large employer the app was only an \"advisory tool\" and that people were not under any \"legal duty\", the paper said.\nFollowing the ministers' comments, Downing Street attempted to clarify the government's position, insisting isolation remained the \"most important action\" people can take to stop the spread of the virus.\n\"Given the risk of having and spreading the virus when people have been in contact with someone with Covid, it is crucial people isolate when they are told to do so, either by NHS Test and Trace or by the NHS Covid app,\" a No 10 spokeswoman said.\n\"Businesses should be supporting employees to isolate, they should not be encouraging them to break isolation.\"\nNow that legal restrictions have been lifted in England, cases of coronavirus will undoubtedly rise further. \nBut a significant number of adults are not yet fully vaccinated. \nIn the meantime, the test and trace system remains the only way the government can contain the virus to a level it deems acceptable. \nSo the message on how closely people should follow the advice to isolate if \"pinged\" by the app is crucial. \nAlthough it's not a legal requirement to do so (only if contacted directly by test and trace) any suggestion that it's up to you, optional, or a judgement call risks undermining the government's entire approach. \nThat's why we saw a junior minister's choice of words was quickly corrected by Downing Street this morning. \nThe rules change next month, allowing double jabbed adults to avoid isolation. \nUntil then the government will have to hope it can keep the public's confidence in the app and its instructions to isolate. \nJohn Edmunds, professor of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, said contact tracing and self-isolation should be maintained \"as stringently as we can\".\n\"We have one of the highest rates of cases in the world right now. The NHS has been under strain for a long time and they are busy trying to catch up on operations and are very, very busy. So to put them under more pressure now is going to be awkward,\" he told Times Radio. \nJustin Madders, Labour's shadow health minister, accused the government of \"making it up as they go along\".  \n\"Yet again there is more confusion and incompetence from the heart of government at the expense of public health. They need to get a grip,\" he said. \nWhile the Covid app can only advise people to self-isolate, anyone in England who is called, texted or emailed by NHS Test and Trace must isolate for 10 days.\nFailure to self-isolate for the full time period can result in a fine, starting from \u00a31,000.\nIn other developments:"

      "text": "Industry bodies have reacted with dismay at the government's plan for firms to apply for staff to be exempt from coronavirus self-isolation rules.\nThe government has said there will be no list of critical workers exempt from isolating rules and exemptions will be \"considered on a case-by-case basis\".\nKaren Dee, chief executive of the airport operators association, said the scheme was \"simply unworkable\".\nThe food supply industry called for clarity on how the scheme would work.\nThe new policy comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that fully-vaccinated people in critical roles in England would be able to continue working even if told to self-isolate after being in close contact with someone who has Covid. The new rule is limited to those without Covid symptoms.\nIndividual businesses will have to contact their relevant government department to apply for any exemption.\nThose deemed eligible, which includes NHS and care staff, will be able to take daily tests instead.\nDowning Street said that the first exemptions around self-isolation have been given in some critical sectors.\nThe number of exceptions outside of the NHS is expected to be relatively small, and not reach the high tens of thousands.\nThere are ongoing discussions with companies in critical industries.\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said: \"A number of those exemptions are in process of being granted or have been granted.\"\n'Pingdemic'\nFirms have warned of increasing staff shortages caused by people being forced to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app. Iceland and Greene King said on Monday they had had to shut shops and pubs as a result.\nBusiness lobby group the CBI has warned that the problem could hamper the economic recovery.\nRod McKenzie, of the Road Haulage Association, said the plan felt like it had been \"thought up on the hoof without proper organisation or thought\".\n\"Truckers were classed as essential workers at the start of the pandemic; now they may be or may not be,\" he said.\n\"It's too confusing. The criteria isn't clear and it risks being both unfair and devastating to an already creaking supply chain.\"\nMs Dee, of the airport operators association, said the government \"must reconsider and exempt categories of workers\", such as airport security staff  and air traffic controllers from the requirement to self-isolate.\n\"As 24-hour operations, we need clear rules that are workable and easy to implement or there is a risk of unnecessary temporary closures,\" she said.\n\"Applying for each individual for an exemption from self-quarantine if they are 'pinged' is simply unworkable.\"\nShane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, said: \"What is the application process for businesses to use this? Who will qualify? Do you have to prove you are severely affected? How long will it take? \n\"If it's not simple and quick, it will not help and most businesses will have to ignore it.  \nHe said the number of people absent in the food sector due to isolation requests was \"growing exponentially across the food supply chain\".\nAndrew Selley is the chief executive of food wholesaler Bidfood, which has about 5,000 employees across the UK and 24 depots.\nHe said the number of staff who were self-isolating changed on a day-to-day basis, but added the company had \"well over 100 people\" off at the moment.\nThe firm, which has large contracts with schools, hospitals and prisons, recently had half a shift off at one depot due to staff being told to isolate.\nMr Selley said it was a \"little ridiculous\" to expect individual companies to seek exemptions for staff who had been told to self-isolate.\nHe added entire sectors, such as food supply, should be exempted and the government's scheme should work in the \"same way it did for key workers\" at the beginning of the pandemic.\nThe government has said it is \"crucial\" for people to quarantine after being \"pinged\" by the NHS Covid-19 app.\nIts message comes after business minister Paul Scully said it was a decision for individuals and employers whether they should isolate after a \"ping\" from the app.\nThe Times reported that another minister in the business department, Lord Grimstone of Boscobel, stressed in a letter to one large employer that the app was only an \"advisory tool\" and that people were not under any \"legal duty\".\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said \"business-critical areas\" would be able to apply to be exempt from isolating.\n\"It's not a blanket exemption and my understanding is we're not going to be producing a list covering individual sectors,\" he said.\n\"It's important that anyone who feels they're in a critical industry or wants to raise potential issues because of isolation are able to contact departments and get advice and where necessary get exemptions.\"\nAsked specifically about supermarket workers, the spokesman said: \"We're not seeking to draw lines specifically around who or who is not exempt. \n\"What's important is to make sure critical services are able to function and get that balance right between requiring people to isolate... but also making sure critical services can function.\""

      "text": "Irish and British horse-racing authorities have condemned footage that revealed evidence of a UK abattoir breaking welfare rules when slaughtering former racehorses.\nHorse Racing Ireland said the footage - which featured in a BBC Panorama investigation - was abhorrent.  \nThe British Horseracing Authority (BHA) met welfare experts earlier to discuss the issue \"as a matter of urgency\".\nThe abattoir told the BBC it did not accept any form of animal abuse.\nThe covert footage, recorded by the anti-horse racing campaign group Animal Aid, showed horses being killed in front of each other and being shot from a distance at Drury and Sons - one of the UK's biggest abattoirs and one of the few licensed to slaughter horses.\nVeterinary experts said these actions broke guidelines, causing extra pain and trauma for the horses involved. \nBHA welfare director James Given said: \"We're all clear that the transporting of horses from Ireland to be euthanised in Britain must stop. \n\"So too should those practices in the abattoir featured in the programme, which appeared to cause distress to horses.\"\nThe BHA said a new welfare strategy, published in 2020, specifically sought to address the care of horses after their racing days were over.   \nHorse Racing Ireland chief executive Brian Kavanagh said: \"The images we saw last night were abhorrent to all within Irish racing and in no way reflect the care and attention given to the overwhelming majority of horses in Ireland.\" \nFreedom of Information requests have revealed that 4,000 former racehorses have been slaughtered in Britain and Ireland since the beginning of 2019. \nThe vast majority were trained in Ireland, and some were once owned and trained by some of the biggest names in racing.    \nThe Panorama film also included claims that attempts were being made to get contaminated horse meat into the human food chain by falsifying paperwork and tampering with horse microchips. \nHorse meat is not popular in the UK, but there is a sizeable export market for it in Europe. Horse passports and matching microchips are important as they show which animals have been treated with medicines that could be harmful to humans, such as the painkiller Bute.\nHorse Racing Ireland said it had contacted the Irish police about one attempt to tamper with a horse's microchip, as revealed in the Panorama investigation.  At the time, an on-site Foods Standards Agency vet spotted the problem and the horse was not sold for meat. \nIn response to the Panorama investigation, the UK government's Food Standards Agency (FSA), which regulates abattoirs, said: \"Upholding animal welfare and the safety and authenticity of the food we eat is a top priority for the government.\" \nIt said it worked closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \"to ensure that animal welfare is maintained at all stages of food production and that all our food is correctly labelled and safe to eat\".  \nThe BHA and Horse Racing Ireland said they would support an investigation by UK authorities. \nThe abattoir, Drury and Sons, told Panorama they \"take great care to maintain high welfare conditions and do not accept any form of animal abuse\". \nThey said all horses are \"humanely destroyed',' and that on occasions where issues do occur, they take ''swift action to review and rectify them\". \nWatch the full investigation, Panorama: The Dark Side of Horse Racing, on BBC iPlayer."

      "tags": "English Channel,Dungeness,Dover,Calais,Migration",
      "text": "At least 430 migrants crossed the English Channel to the UK on Monday - a new record for a single day - the Home Office has said. \nThe department said it was taking \"substantial steps to tackle the unacceptable problem of illegal migration\". \nAround 50 people were seen landing on the beach at Dungeness in Kent after crossing in one dinghy. \nThe group included women and young children. \nIt comes after eight boats carrying 241 migrants reached the UK on Sunday. \nOn Tuesday, there were further beach landings at Dungeness and Dover, further along the coast.\nAlready this year, nearly 8,000 people have reached the UK in about 345 boats.\nThe previous daily high of 416 was set in September 2020.  \nHome Secretary Priti Patel has pledged to make Channel crossings \"unviable\", with new legislation that will make it a crime to knowingly arrive in the UK without permission.\nThe Nationality and Borders Bill, which is currently being considered by MPs, will mean migrants entering without permission could face up to four years in prison.\nThe government hopes the overhaul of asylum rules will deter migrants making the crossing.\nBut the plans have been criticised by charities including Refugee Action, which has called them \"extreme and nasty\". \nThe home secretary's proposals to change the asylum system are back in Parliament today - and Ms Patel will tell MPs that the British people have had enough of what she calls open borders and uncontrolled migration. \nExcluding the pandemic period, the UK consistently receives far fewer asylum applications than comparable nations. In 2019, some 45,000 sought asylum in the UK. That's about a third of the number in France - and 1% of the total number of refugees marooned in Turkey following the war in Syria. \nThe current rate of small-boat arrivals isn't even a record in UK asylum terms. They average out at 39 a day and, on 2019's figures, are about a third of all asylum applicants. \nBut more importantly, the total is seven times lower than the records seen during the Tony Blair years.\nWhat is however costing an awful lot of money are the well-documented and worsening delays in the Home Office's \u00a31bn asylum system. \nParliamentary data shows that the total number of asylum seekers who are in limbo waiting for a decision on their futures, or removal after a rejection, has doubled since 2014. \nDan O'Mahoney, clandestine channel threat commander, said: \"There is an unacceptable rise in dangerous small boat crossings across the channel because of a surge in illegal migration across Europe.\n\"People should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach and not risk their lives making these dangerous crossings. We are continuing to pursue the criminals behind these illegal crossings.\"\nHe added that the Nationality and Borders Bill would \"protect lives and break this cycle of illegal crossings\" and the government was continuing to return those with no legal right to remain in the UK. \nBut Amnesty International's Steve Valdez-Symonds told the BBC the new legislation was an \"extremely reckless and dangerous response\" to the issue and would not tackle the problem of people smugglers. \nInstead, he said it was likely to drive desperate people to avoid the authorities, leaving them vulnerable to further exploitation and slavery.

England ended most of its remaining restrictions on Monday, while Scotland also eased some curbs as it moved to level zero.\nSome restrictions were lifted in Wales on Saturday, bringing an end to social-distancing outside. In Northern Ireland, a new Covid-19 certificate app is being prepared for launch next week amid a \"final push\" to get younger people vaccinated.\nThe number of daily Covid cases is often lower at the beginning of the week due to reporting delays and a \"weekend effect\". \nThe number of patients admitted to hospital with Covid in the last seven days was 39.5% higher than the previous week, government data showed, with 4,317 admissions over the latest period.\nThe number of deaths in the last seven days was 48% higher than the previous week, with 296 recorded."

      "text": "Production at some of Nike's largest plants in Vietnam has been disrupted as Covid has spread through factories. \nThe company refused to comment on whether store supplies would see shortages as a result of the outbreak.\nAbout half of Nike's shoes were manufactured in Vietnam in the last financial year, so this will mean challenges for its supply chain. \nVietnam has seen a record rise in cases since last April with many infection clusters in its industrial provinces. \nApple, Samsung and Puma could also be affected by the surge in cases recorded at suppliers' factories in the country. \n\"The health and safety of our teammates, as well as that of our suppliers, remains our top priority,\" a statement from Nike said. \nNike said the company would continue to work with its suppliers to support them in response to the rise in Covid cases. \n\"We are confident in Nike's ability to navigate these near-term dynamics, and we remain prudent in our planning,\" the statement added. \nOne of Nike's worst affected suppliers in the region, Pou Chen Corp, also makes footwear for Adidas and is the world's largest manufacturer of branded trainers.\nIt suspended operations at its plant in Ho Chi Minh City on Wednesday due to the outbreak in infections. \nIn a statement, the country's health ministry said Pou Chen's Pouyuen Vietnam factory would be suspended for 10 days. \nThe factory is Ho Chi Minh City's largest employer, with a total of 56,000 workers. But it was unable to stay open and arrange for its workers to sleep at the factory, as was required by authorities to limit the spread of infections, according to the health ministry. \nNike employs over 450,000 workers in the country, 80 % of whom are women. \nSimilar challenges could also be faced for Puma, whose footwear is also manufactured in the country. Apple and Samsung also have large suppliers in the worst affected factories in the northern region of Vietnam. \nApple did not give a comment on whether the outbreak will mean item shortages in shops, while Adidas, Puma and Samsung did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. \nSamsung makes around half of its phones in Vietnam and has had to stop work at three factories in Ho Chin Minh City. According to the health ministry's website, Samsung Electronics is planning for workers to sleep at the plants and has currently cut its staffing to 3,000 from 7,000. \nMany firms had begun to move their production from China to countries such as Vietnam as a result of challenges from tariffs over the course of the pandemic. \nDr Patsy Perry, senior lecturer in fashion business at Manchester Metropolitan University, told the BBC these problems are compounded by the Covid-related surge in demand for athletic wear as people have been spending more time at home. \n\"This shows the risk of overreliance on a particular sourcing region,\" she explained. \nBu, Dr Perry said that Nike's manufacturing map means it could potentially move production the other countries, depending how agile its supply chain relationships are.\n\"Costs might increase in the short term if it needs to move production into more expensive areas, but it's more important to service demand than risking a stock-out situation,\" Dr Perry added. \nDr Steve New, professor of operations management at the University of Oxford's Sa\u00efd Business School, told the BBC that previously, because Vietnam has been effective at containing Covid, it has been able to respond rapidly with short local shutdowns. But he said that as the situation worsens, \"it will be much harder to pursue this approach without much more significant disruption to the supply chain.\"\nVietnam has vaccinated around 4% of its 100 million population. Its capital Hanoi has stopped all non-essential services due to new clusters of Covid infections and on Sunday urged its citizens to stay at home. \nThe government added factory workers to its vaccine priority list after the rise in cases in late April forced manufacturing areas in the north of the country to close.

      "text": "Government officials were too slow to tell many women they would be affected by the rising state pension age, the Parliamentary Ombudsman has ruled.\nThe finding brings the prospect of compensation closer for thousands of women born in the 1950s who have long been furious about the issue.\nIt marks a significant victory for the Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) campaign.\nHowever, the ombudsman has no power to refund \"lost\" pensions.\nIt is also unable to recommend that anyone receive their state pension any earlier than the current law allows.\nAngela Madden, who chairs the Waspi campaign, said: \"The findings reinforce what we, unfortunately, knew all along; that the DWP failed to adequately inform 3.8 million 1950s-born women that their state pension age would be increasing.\n\"These women have been waiting for many years for compensation. We cannot wait any longer. We are calling on the government to agree fair and adequate compensation rather than allow what has become a vicious cycle of government inaction to continue.\"\nThe age at which people receive the state pension has been increasing as people live longer, and currently stands at 66 for men and women.\nThe increases have been controversial. Campaigners claim women born in the 1950s have been treated unfairly by rapid changes and the way they were communicated to those affected.\nMany thousands said they had no idea they would have to wait longer to receive their state pension, and had suffered financial and emotional distress as a result.\nThe ombudsman's initial finding of maladministration by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) centres on a delay in providing direct information to this group of women.\nWhile some women were aware of the general policy change, they did not know it would affect them personally.\nThe ombudsman said that letters should have been sent directly to these women more than two years earlier than they were. For some, the delay was much longer.\n\"We have found that DWP failed to act quickly enough once it knew a significant proportion of women were not aware of changes to their state pension age,\" said Amanda Amroliwala, chief executive of the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. \n\"It should have written to the women affected at least 28 months earlier than it did. We will now consider the impact of these failings, and what action should be taken to address them.\" \nMs Madden, from Waspi, said the DWP's own research showed that women were not sufficiently aware of the changes \"yet they failed to act\". \n\"This inaction had devastating and life-altering impacts on women across the country,\" she said.\nThe ombudsman considered six sample cases, but said the DWP should apply any subsequent recommendations to all of those affected.\nWhereas Waspi has called for bridging payments, the separate Backto60 group has campaigned for the state pension age for women affected to be returned to 60, and for these women to be refunded the pensions they had \"lost\" owing to the changes.\nThe ombudsman has no power to do so, but it can recommend compensation is paid to those affected by the DWP's maladministration.\nThere is no timeline for the remainder of its investigations, but it is planning to move as quickly as possible.\nIt is unable to recommend any change in policy, which could have brought much larger sums in compensation. A series of court decisions found in favour of the government in terms of the changing pension age itself.\nA DWP spokesman said: \"Both the High Court and Court of Appeal have supported the actions of the DWP, under successive governments dating back to 1995, and the Supreme Court refused the claimants permission to appeal.\n\"In a move towards gender equality, it was decided more than 25 years ago to make the state pension age the same for men and women.\""

As I said to the committee, I accept that communications of this nature should be done in future through only the most formal of channels.\n\"I agree that the guidance on how former ministers engage with government could be updated and was pleased to provide some suggestions on this to the committee.\"\nA Treasury spokesman said: \"This report is clear that the Treasury was right to consider Greensill's proposals, right to ultimately reject their proposals, and concludes that the Treasury behaved with absolute integrity throughout the process.\"\nDeputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said Mr Cameron being cleared of breaking any rules \"proves that the rules that are supposed to regulate lobbying are completely unfit for purpose\".

      "text": "China has denied allegations that it carried out a major cyber-attack against tech giant Microsoft.\nThe US and other Western countries on Monday accused China of hacking Microsoft Exchange - a popular email platform used by companies worldwide.\nThey said it was part of a broader pattern of \"reckless\" behaviour that threatened global security.\nChina says it opposes all forms of cyber-crime, and has called the claims \"fabricated\".\nChina's foreign ministry spokesman said the US had got its allies to make \"unreasonable criticisms\" against China.\nThe UK, EU, New Zealand, Australia and others joined the US to accuse Chinese state-sponsored hackers.\nMicrosoft's Exchange system powers the email of huge corporations small businesses and public bodies. The hack affected at least 30,000 organisations around the world.\nMicrosoft blamed a Chinese cyber-espionage group for targeting a weakness in Microsoft Exchange, which allowed hackers to get into email inboxes.\nIt said the group, known as Hafnium, was state-sponsored and based in China.\nWestern security sources believe Hafnium knew Microsoft had planned to deal with the weakness, and so shared it with other China-based hackers.\nThe sources say the hack seems to signal a shift from a targeted espionage campaign to a smash-and-grab raid, leading to concerns that Chinese cyber-behaviour is escalating.\nThe UK Foreign Office said the Chinese government had \"ignored repeated calls to end its reckless campaign, instead allowing state-backed actors to increase the scale of their attacks\".\nUS President Joe Biden said the Chinese government may not have been carrying out the attacks itself, but was \"protecting those who are doing it. And maybe even accommodating them being able to do it\".\nThe US Department of Justice on Monday announced criminal charges against four hackers linked to China's Ministry of State Security. It said they were connected to a long-term campaign targeting foreign governments and entities in key sectors in a least a dozen countries."

      "text": "Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser has said he is concerned about the uptake of vaccination. \nProf Ian Young said about 18% of adults have still not come forward for their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.\nIt comes as Health Minister Robin Swann said first doses of the vaccine will end at Northern Ireland's mass vaccination centres on 31 July.\nMr Swann said the vaccination programme would not be available indefinitely. \nVaccination centres are sited at the SSE Arena in Belfast, as well as the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, Foyle Arena in Londonderry, Omagh Leisure Centre, Lakeland Forum, South Lake Craigavon and the Seven Towers in Ballymena.\nA total of 2,175,663 Covid-19 vaccines had been administered in Northern Ireland as of Tuesday afternoon.\nOf those, 1,187,005 were first doses and 988,658 were second doses.\nNorthern Ireland's rate is the lowest in the UK.\nReferring to those who had not come forward for vaccines, Prof Young said: \"That means 18% who are just as susceptible to the most severe effects of Covid as they were earlier in the epidemic.\"\nHe said he was also very concerned about the rise in cases and hospital admissions in Northern Ireland. \n\"Pressures on our hospitals have been very significant all through the summer for multiple reasons,\" he said. \n\"Certainly adding a significantly increased number of Covid admissions on top of that is going to bring considerable pressures to bear and I know our hospitals are thinking carefully about how they can best manage and cope with that as we go through the next six to eight weeks.\n\"Unfortunately I think that there will be some increases in deaths, which is inevitable as a result of a very large number of cases leading to quite a large number of hospitalisations and patients in critical care.\n\"But the number of deaths, the proportion of deaths from Covid, will be much less than in previous waves of the epidemic as a result of the impacts of vaccination and of improved treatments, which have gradually come into place during the last 18 months.\"\nAnother 1,138 positive cases were reported by the Department of Health on Tuesday. This includes samples taken in recent days, not necessarily in the last 24 hours.\nThe Department of Health is continuing to operate a number of walk-in Covid-19 vaccine clinics across Northern Ireland this week.\nThe appointment-free pop-ups were established as part of a \"final push\" to get younger people vaccinated.\nChief medical officer Sir Michael McBride said young people presenting for first doses in Northern Ireland is lower than other areas of the United Kingdom. \nSpeaking to the BBC's Nolan Show on Tuesday, he said: \"Unfortunately, over the past number of weeks, the number of people presenting to get a first dose of the vaccine has slowed quite significantly, particularly in the younger age groups.\"\nHe added: \"There is 6% more people in England, eight percent in Scotland and 10% more in Wales.\"\nSir Michael also discouraged young people from believing false vaccine rumours circulating on social media.\nHe estimated, based on current modelling, that by the end of this month Northern Ireland may exceed \"over 2,000 Covid-19 cases a day\" and \"by the middle of August that could be anywhere between 3,000 - 4,000 cases\". \nHe said if Northern Ireland could increase the number of people getting their first doses by 5% it could could reduce the number of new cases by half.\nThe chief medical officer said that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has provided interim advice on a booster vaccination programme in Northern Ireland.\nHe said it could be rolled out for over-50s and clinically vulnerable people from September.\nPatricia Donnelly, the head of Northern Ireland's vaccination campaign, said \"if you want to return to normality, do your part and come forward for vaccination\". \n\"Overall we've been very pleased, until we've reached this younger age group. It's our under 30s who have given us that lower overall up-take level,\" she said. \nThe health minister, Mr Swann, said there was a \"new surge in Covid cases\" and now was the right time to get vaccinated.\n\"A new surge in Covid cases is under way and getting your jab will protect you and others. It will also help our health service cope, by pushing down infection numbers and hospital admissions.\"\nHe said that aspects of the programme will have to be stood down in the coming weeks. \n\"We will maintain some provision for people who belatedly change their minds and decide they want a jab after all. But it won't be as convenient or as widely accessible as it is currently.\n\"We will have to start standing down the mass vaccination centres in August, with first doses there ending on 31 July. \n\"This will allow us to redeploy much-needed staff back into the health service. Also, the SSE Arena and the leisure centres that we've been using can't be commandeered for vaccination use forever.\"\nMr Swann said that GPs' role in the vaccination programme had shifted from first and second doses to preparing for the vaccine booster dose.\n\"It is simply not possible to maintain a mass vaccination programme of this nature as a permanent feature of our health service. That is an unavoidable fact,\" the minister said.\nOn Monday, it was confirmed that some children and young people aged over 12 in Northern Ireland are to be offered a Covid vaccine.\nOfficials say those with specific underlying health conditions and who are at risk of serious illness from the virus can now receive the Pfizer/BioNtech jab.\nTeenagers within three months of their 18th birthday can also get a jab.\nAt present health officials are not recommending routine universal vaccination of under-18s. \nThe list of eligibility currently includes those with severe neuro-disabilities, Down's Syndrome, underlying conditions resulting in immunosuppression, and those with profound and multiple learning disabilities, severe learning disabilities or who are on the learning disability register.  \nIn England, face coverings are no longer required by law and nightclubs have been allowed to reopen.\nDUP MP Sammy Wilson said Northern Ireland \"should quickly be moving to that situation\".\n\"We're not seeing the increase in deaths that was hanging over us when the discussions took the place - we're seeing impact vaccines has had in dealing with cases,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\nHe said he did not think teenagers should be given the vaccine.\n\"When you look that risk that children have from Covid, it's very low,\" he added."
