      "text": "Northern Ireland's health service is \"about to topple over\" if immediate action is not taken, the deputy first minister has said.\nMichelle O'Neill said staff were \"facing into a very difficult winter\" under current pressures.\nShe met staff at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast on Tuesday along with First Minister Paul Givan.\nThey both said they wanted to avoid any further lockdowns or \"circuit breakers\".\nSinn F\u00e9in vice-president Ms O'Neill said the healthcare system was facing increased staff absences with workers feeling \"burnt out\".\n\"They're begging for our support. They are physically and mentally exhausted,\" she said.\nMr Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said the Northern Ireland Executive would take a \"measured approach\" when ministers meet on Thursday to discuss future Covid-19 plans.\nHe said ministers would take into consideration the current transmission rates and hospitalisation.\nHe said politicians needed to be honest with people \"about the realities in what we're facing\".\nHe added that he was concerned about other issues linked to lockdowns, saying: \"People are presenting with severe mental health issues as a result of the lockdown and delayed treatments and some couldn't access services.\"\nMr Givan said healthcare staff were working \"more hours than they've worked before\" and there was \"a need for us all to take the personal responsibility very seriously, whether that's through regulation or through guidance\".\nMs O'Neill said she \"would not rule out anything\" and would \"keep everything on the table - it's the prudent and honest way to proceed\".\n\"We need a very cautious approach in the time ahead.\"\nShe added that Health Minister Robin Swann would bring forward a winter surge plan for the health service in due course and that further details for how the executive would respond to winter pressures should be announced on Thursday afternoon.\nFrom the 11 of November, anyone working or volunteering in a care home in England will need to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus, unless they are exempt. \nThere is also a consultation on whether it should be made mandatory for all frontline workers in health and care settings.\nVisiting professor of public health at Bristol University, Gabriel Scally, said while he did not like the thought of compulsory vaccinations there was a \"particular duty of care\" in health care settings.\n\"People in hospitals or care homes are already ill and the burden of infectious disease really can be avoided largely by vaccination so I think I am in favour of it,\" he told BBC News NI's Talkback programme.\nBut professor of social policy at Ulster University, Deirdre Heenan, told the programme she was opposed to vaccines becoming compulsory for health and social care staff in Northern Ireland.\n\"We have to take account of the needs of health care workers and it's important to see both sides,\" she told Talkback.\n\"When we are talking about social care workers I'm not comfortable with forcing people to have vaccinations, in fact scapegoating the lowest paid part of the social care workforce, often young women who have real issue about vaccination,\" she said.\n\"I would rather we have a programme of talking to people and understanding why people are vaccine hesitant.\"\nFive more deaths and 1,020 cases of coronavirus were reported on Northern Ireland on Monday.\nThere were 379 patients with Covid-19 in hospitals on Monday, compared to 419 on Friday.\nThere were 33 patients with Covid-19 in hospital intensive care units on Monday, down from 38 on Friday."

      "text": "Many UK households could face a \"very difficult winter\", with fuel prices surging and the \u00a320-a-week uplift in universal credit ending, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has warned.\nBut he told BBC Breakfast the energy price cap was staying in place, despite a global spike in prices.\nThe temporary universal credit rise, brought in earlier in the pandemic, is due to end in October.\nLabour has called for it to remain in place to help hard-pressed households.\nUniversal credit is a benefit for working-age people which replaces six former payments, including income support, housing benefit and income-based jobseeker's allowance.\nAsked about the end to the uplift, Mr Kwarteng said: \"It's a difficult situation. It could be a very difficult winter.\n\"That's why, as energy minister, I'm very focused on helping people that are fuel poor. Universal credit... is an issue for the chancellor and the work and pensions secretary, I'm speaking to them a great deal about it.\"\nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an anti-poverty think tank, has warned of a \"perfect storm\" for consumers this autumn, as problems with global supply chains also increase food prices.\nWorkers also face a rise in National Insurance payments from next April, to help fund higher costs for the NHS and social care.\nLabour is to hold a debate in the Commons on Tuesday, calling on the government to halt the proposed cut to the universal credit top-up.\nThe party's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, said the combination of price rises and falling incomes wasn't \"a freak event\".\n\"Instead of changing direction and taking action, [the government] have created an avoidable and unacceptable burden on working people, making the squeeze on household finances worse by putting up taxes for working people and cutting universal credit,\" she said.\nSpeaking on BBC Two's Newsnight programme on Monday, the Conservative former Brexit Secretary, David Davis, warned there was a risk of a \"cost of living crisis\" for new Tory voters such as \"the plumber, the bricklayer, the lorry driver\".\nHe said his advice to Chancellor Rishi Sunak would be: \"You think hard about the ordinary family's take-home pay and what they have to buy with it, because that will be a dictator of how people feel going in to the new year.\" \nWhile Mr Kwarteng said the rise in National Insurance payments was \"not strictly a winter issue\", he did add that there was more immediately a \"global energy spike in terms of prices\".\nSeveral small energy companies have warned they will go out of business unless they are able to pass on costs to customers.\nMr Kwarteng said he was \"very clear\" that the price cap - introduced in January 2019 for standard variable or default tariffs, which are typically the most expensive - would remain, \"so we're protecting customers there\".\nHe added that the warm home discount - a one-off payment for those most in need - and winter fuel payments, \"focused on the most vulnerable customers\" were also staying.\nAnd defending the end of the universal credit \u00a320 a week top-up, he said the government had spent a \"huge\" amount of money during the pandemic, supporting workers and the economy, adding: \"There was a debate about how long we could afford this.\""

      "title": "Failing energy firms may mean higher bills, warns regulator",
      "tags": "Companies,Ofgem,Energy industry,Kwasi Kwarteng,CO\u2082 shortage",
      "text": "The cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills, the boss of the energy regulator Ofgem has told the BBC.\nIt comes as energy firm Green said it was on the brink of collapse due to soaring wholesale gas prices.\n\"As underlying costs rise, pressure on bills does go up\", Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem chief executive said.\nThe government has said it is looking at lending money to bigger firms to help them take on stranded customers.\nIf an energy firm collapses, customers are automatically switched to a tariff provided by the new supplier. This is a tariff agreed with the regulator Ofgem, but it may well be more expensive than the deal they had with the former company which went bust.\nMr Brearley said protecting customers of failed energy firms was the regulator's \"number one priority\".\nHowever, he said it was too early to predict how expensive it would be to ensure that they were transferred to other suppliers in an orderly way.\nPeter McGirr, founder and chief executive of Green, told the BBC it had appointed a restructuring firm in an attempt to survive the current crisis.\nMr McGirr said the firm was in \"deep, deep trouble and our heads are unlikely to bob back to the surface\".\nGreen has 180 staff based in Newcastle upon Tyne and has 250,000 UK customers.\nMr McGirr said the appointment of Alvarez and Marsal was currently on an \"advisory and restructuring\" basis, but admitted Green could fall into administration within weeks.\n\"We need to try to hold on long enough to get some support\", he added.\nThe company has been in discussions with the government and energy regulator Ofgem, but has not been offered any support.\nMr McGirr said he believed the larger energy suppliers had too much influence in the crisis talks being held with government and said the big companies had an interest in more of the smaller suppliers going to the wall.\nAsked whether these costs would be met by the taxpayer, or spread across all energy customers' bills, he said: \"We have to first of all make sure that customers are transferred and looked after and then as we see the market evolve we will understand better the cost implications.\"\nCustomers on some tariffs are protected from sudden hikes in wholesale gas prices through the energy price cap, which limits how much firms can charge per unit of gas.\nThe price cap covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland.\nMr Brearley said it was too early to predict how much the energy price cap would rise next year.\nSo far, four energy firms have gone to the wall, including People's Energy and Utility Point, and four more are expected to follow in the coming days.\nIndustry sources fear there may be as few as 10 energy suppliers left by the end of the year, down from 70 in January.\nBut Mr Brearley predicted that a number of small suppliers would survive the current crisis, as well as larger ones, maintaining a diverse market with plenty of choice for consumers. \nWhen asked if Ofgem was \"asleep at the wheel\" and should have prevented suppliers from making promises to customers which they wouldn't be able to keep if prices rose, Mr Brearley replied: \"No - we have always protected customers interests and we work very closely with the companies.  \n\"We work closely with all companies to assess their financial position. And if they need to exit the market we have well-rehearsed systems and processes to manage that.\" \nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng earlier denied that failed energy companies would get government bailouts, saying: \"I do not think it's the right thing for taxpayers' money to be injected into companies that have been badly run.\"\nHowever, he said the government was exploring the possibility of lending money to bigger energy firms to help them absorb the cost of taking on new customers from companies that had gone bust.\n\"If we do have this policy, they will be expected to pay back the loans,\" he added.\nMr Kwarteng also warned many UK households could face a \"very difficult winter\", with fuel prices surging and the \u00a320-a-week temporary uplift in universal credit due to end in October.  \nThe government and Ofgem have both dismissed suggestions that the cap on energy prices would be lifted ahead of an agreed 12% rise in October, saying that keeping it was the \"clear and agreed position\". \nThe price cap is reviewed twice a year. It applies only to standard variable or default tariffs. These types of tariff are typically the most expensive plan that a supplier offers. \nWhen fixed energy deals expire, as they generally do after one or two years, customers are likely to be put on these tariffs.\nRead more about the next best steps to take here.\nMr Brearley said the industry had seen \"an unprecedented rise in gas prices\".\n\"They are almost four times what they normally are and that would put any industry under strain,\" he added.\nThe government and Ofgem say the UK does not have gas supply problems because of a diverse range of sources \"that can more than meet demand\".\nHowever, energy bills are facing particular pressures in Great Britain because of a dip in renewable energy supplies due to low wind, as well as the outage of a power cable supplying electricity from France.\nThe International Energy Agency has called on Russia to supply more gas to Europe, saying \"it could do more to increase gas availability to Europe and ensure storage is filled to adequate levels\", in preparation for the winter.\nIt added: \"Based on the available information, Russia is fulfilling its long-term contracts with European counterparts - but its exports to Europe are down from their 2019 level.\n\"This is also an opportunity for Russia to underscore its credentials as a reliable supplier to the European market.\"\nStacey Stothard followed all the advice. Aware that energy prices were rising, she shopped around to find a decent fixed deal for her gas and electricity.\nShe saved \u00a3300 - or so she thought. \nHer new energy supplier went bust and now she will be switched automatically to another one, and she is facing much higher bills, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds more a year.\n\"It is just like watching the meter go up and up,\" she says. \"I did the right thing - not going for the cheapest deal, but choosing a company with a decent customer service record.\""

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,COP26,Climate change,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Joe Biden has played down the chances of a post-Brexit free trade deal between the US and UK, as he held talks with Boris Johnson at the White House.\nThe US president said he would discuss the issue \"a little bit\" with the UK prime minister, adding: \"We're going to have to work that through.\"\nDowning Street said a direct deal with the US remained the \"priority\".\nBut UK ministers are pondering joining an existing North American trade pact instead, the BBC understands.\nMr Biden and Mr Johnson also discussed Northern Ireland, climate change and Afghanistan during the 90-minute meeting.\nThe UK is keen to strike free trade deals around the world in the wake of leaving the European Union's single market - including with the US, with which annual trade was worth an estimated $273bn (\u00a3200bn) in 2019.\nA deal would encourage more business between the two countries by making it cheaper, usually by reducing or eliminating taxes called tariffs.\nBut Mr Johnson, echoing Mr Biden, downplayed chances of securing agreement with the US before the next general election, saying: \"The Americans do negotiate very hard.\"\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice told Sky News: \"We still very much hope to be able to put together an agreement with the United States. We are not putting timescales on it.\"\n\"It's just not a priority for the US administration,\" he added.\nMr Johnson highlighted the decision to lift the ban on British beef, and Downing Street is increasingly confident that there could soon be a favourable decision lifting the export ban on lamb.\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office before the talks, Mr Biden said: \"We're going to talk a little bit about trade today and we're going to have to work that through.\"\nHe did not counter the assertion from his predecessor Barack Obama that the UK would have to join \"the back of the queue\" in seeking a trade deal after Brexit.\nIt's really clear from both sides that there is no rapid path to a trade deal - the opportunity that used to be lauded by Brexiteers and by President Trump. \nMr Johnson hinted at that realism in his curtain-raiser conversations on his way over here. \nAnd the president pretty much confirmed that in the meeting in the Oval Office. \nThe UK seems no longer to want to believe, or pretend, that doing business in a major deal is top of their list. \nInstead, while the government is still officially pursuing a stand-alone deal with the US there's a twin track with a more incremental approach - there have already been changes to whisky tariffs and British beef. But No 10 is now hopeful that the Americans are seriously considering changing tack on British lamb. \nRead more from Laura here.\nA source familiar with the government's thinking told the BBC the UK could negotiate entry into an existing trade arrangement between the US, Canada and Mexico - the USMCA - set up after former US President Donald Trump tore up its predecessor, NAFTA.\n\"There are a variety of different ways to do this,\" the source said. \"The question is whether the US administration is ready. The ball is in the US's court. It takes two to tango.\"\nElsewhere, Downing Street said Mr Johnson and Mr Biden agreed all diplomatic and humanitarian methods must be used to stop conditions getting worse in Afghanistan.\nThe leaders said any international recognition of the Taliban must be contingent on the group respecting human rights.\nThis followed a request by the Taliban to address world leaders at the United Nations summit in New York this week.\nBrexit gave the UK the freedom to strike its own trade deals - and accounting for \u00a31 in every \u00a36 of British trade, a pact with the US was the ultimate prize.\nBut Whitehall officials have for months been scrabbling for an alternative after the Biden administration indicated it was in no hurry to resume talks.\nJoining the USMCA arrangement already agreed by the US, Canada and Mexico could give the UK deeper benefits on some goods and digital trade with North American economies. \nBut it has limited coverage of the UK's biggest strength when it comes to selling to America, namely services. Economists say the overall gains from joining USMCA may be very limited, perhaps less than 0.1% of GDP\nAmerica's price of admission may include a hurdle already encountered: standards surrounding food and agricultural goods. For President Biden is explicit that his priority is US workers, not least its farmers.\nHe is also clear that domestic issues take precedence. Even if the UK does want to sign up to USMCA, it may still be at the back of a queue - simply to get its application considered. \nBefore the meeting, Mr Biden also issued a fresh warning to the UK that peace in Northern Ireland must not be jeopardised as a result of complications caused by Brexit.\nHe made it clear he had concerns about the Irish border, amid continuing issues with Northern Ireland Protocol - the arrangement which helps prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nThe pair also discussed the new UK, US and Australia security pact in the Asia-Pacific region, with No 10 describing it as an example of \"shared values and approach to the world\". \nThe meeting, taking place on the sidelines of the UN summit, involved the traditional exchange of gifts.\nMr Biden gave the prime minister a framed photo of their first meeting in Cornwall at the G7 summit in June, and a White House-branded watch.\nMr Johnson presented the president with a signed copy of a book written by British astronaut Tim Peake, with an inscription expressing hopes that it \"provides a reminder of what we're fighting to save as our countries tackle climate change together\".\nThe prime minister's gift comes weeks ahead of the COP26 summit in Glasgow, which is seen as a crucial moment to bring climate change under control. \nEarlier, Mr Biden announced the US would double its climate finance pledge and increase funding for developing countries to $11.4bn (\u00a38.3bn) by 2024.\nMr Johnson said the US had \"stepped up to the plate\" with what he called a \"massive contribution\" towards the $100bn (\u00a373bn) goal for countries to raise."

      "text": "A former Marine's mission to bring rescue animals back to the UK as the Taliban took over Afghanistan is being examined by the Charity Commission.\nThe regulator has told the BBC it is looking into the funding arrangements of Operation Ark, which raised more than \u00a3200,000 from supporters in days.  \nOperation Ark was launched by Pen Farthing's charity Nowzad to evacuate staff members and their immediate families, plus the animals in its care.\nThe charity says it acted correctly.\nNowzad, which reported income of close to \u00a31m last year, told the BBC: \"The trustees are wholly confident that Nowzad's life-saving work in incredibly difficult circumstances was both the right and only thing to do and was absolutely in furtherance of the charity's purpose.\"\nThe Charity Commission has contacted Nowzad for further information after receiving reports around the governance and financial arrangements of Operation Ark.\nIt is examining the use of charity funds for the evacuation and whether it is in line with the charity's purpose. \n\"We will assess the information provided by the trustees to determine whether or not there is a role for the Commission,\" it said in a statement provided to the BBC. \nLeading charities lawyer Edwina Turner at Anthony Collins solicitors says this can be \"a crisis point\" in the life of a charity. \n\"It's very serious if the regulator gathers information from you. The charity will want to clear up any concerns,\" Mrs Turner said. \n\"One question they [Nowzad] would need an answer to is have they spent money raised in furtherance of their objects? Secondly, have they spent the money in the best way possible to achieve their charitable purposes. Thirdly, has the money raised through Operation Ark been spent in accordance with the terms of the fundraising campaign?\"\nNowzad operated an animal clinic, dog and cat shelter and donkey sanctuary in Afghanistan. It trained and employed local Afghans - including women - as vets. \nAs the Taliban takeover progressed last month it said its staff were in danger due to their work with foreign organisations, such as embassies, and \"the animals were at risk because the Taliban considers companion animals, particularly dogs, unclean.\"\nThe former Royal Marine and his supporters led a vociferous evacuation campaign which garnered a lot of public attention. It received huge public support but also came in for criticism, including from Defence Secretary Ben Wallace who complained it distracted from focusing on evacuating the most vulnerable.\nThe charity says an \"extremely fraught but ultimately successful\" evacuation ensued. \nIt says \"all staff and their families, including young children and two newborns, and 162 dogs and cats have been delivered to safety.\"\nNowzad confirmed the Charity Commission is asking for their trustees' comments on Operation Ark including, specifically, how it furthered the charity's purpose. \n\"The trustees of course recognise that it is entirely proper for the Commission to gather more information regarding this high-profile and unprecedented operation and are very happy to provide the information requested,\" it added.\nNowzad is a registered charity in England and Wales and is regulated by the Charity Commission.\nAt this stage, the Charity Commission has made clear they are gathering information and no findings have so far been made. \nAccording to Mrs Turner, the Charity Commission has a range of powers, including \"removing trustees, putting in an interim manager to run a charity or certain aspects of a charity\" or, in extreme circumstances, \"they can bring a charity to a close.\"\nMr Farthing, the founder of the animal shelter, who is originally from Dovercourt in Essex, is now working to find new homes in the UK for both his airlifted staff and rescued animals.\nHe is also considering expanding his charity's work abroad, in countries he deems safer than Afghanistan, though he does not rule out a return to Kabul if conditions one day improve."

      "tags": "Meat,Stockton-on-Tees,Food industry,Soft drinks,CO\u2082 shortage",
      "text": "The British food industry will be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with a US company to restart production in the UK.\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from \u00a3200 per tonne to \u00a31,000.\nThe government has agreed to pay out tens of millions of pounds to CF Industries to reopen a plant in the UK. \nThe closure had raised fears over food supplies and the nuclear industry.\nUS-owned CF Industries recently shut two UK sites that produce 60% of the country's commercial carbon dioxide supplies, because of a sharp rise in gas prices.\nFarms, food producers and supermarkets have warned that a shortage of carbon dioxide will lead to significant disruption to the manufacture and supply of fresh produce. \nThe Times also reported that ministers were concerned that the UK might have to close its six advanced gas-cooled nuclear reactors, which also use CO2. \nThe government announced late on Tuesday night that it would meet the full operating costs to run CF Industries' Billingham plant in Teesside for three weeks. The costs are expected to be in the \"low tens of millions\" and will be below \u00a350m.\nMr Eustice said that the deal with CF Industries \"will be not a loan, it will be a payment to underwrite some of their fixed costs\".\nAt the end of the three-week period, it is hoped that the price of carbon dioxide will have risen sufficiently to make it economically viable for CF Industries to keep production running. \nMr Eustice said the food industry would have to accept \"a big, sharp rise\" carbon dioxide prices from \u00a3200 to \u00a31,000 a tonne.\n\"The critical thing was to get the production up and running expeditiously. That's why we've needed this government intervention,\" he said.\n\"But we've had meetings with the food industry. They all recognise that the price of carbon dioxide is going to increase substantially and when that price increases, then the market signal will be then for these plants to continue producing.\"\nMr Eustice insisted that the rise in cost would not have a \"significant impact\" on food prices. \nHe said that while food prices were increasing \"due to global commodity prices, oil prices and also other factors such as labour shortages\", carbon dioxide was \"a tiny proportion\" of the industry's overall costs. \nCF Industries had halted two of its fertiliser factories - which produce carbon dioxide as a by-product - because of gas prices.\nCF Industries' Billingham plant will need up to three days to start producing new CO2. \nThe company told the BBC it had \"no estimate\" on when its second UK plant at Ince in Cheshire would  resume production. \nThe British Meat Processors Association said the deal to open CF Industries' Teesside plant was a \"huge relief\" and said it was now \"focused on re-establishing supplies before Friday this week, which is when around 25% of pork production was in danger of shutting down\".\nAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, welcomed the decision, but said the timetable to restart CF Industries' factory and begin producing carbon dioxide \"will still be tight\".\nHe told the BBC's Today programme: \"Our understanding is that provided that carbon dioxide starts to get through to food producers by the end of the week, then we can avert major and significant disruption in our stores.\"\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the \"exceptional short-term arrangement\" would ensure industries that rely on a stable supply of CO2 \"have the resources they require to avoid disruption\".\nHe said: \"With regards to the CO2 situation, it was abundant, it was very cheap and I think a lot of people were surprised at what happened.\" \nThe government intends to publish the letter from Mr Kwarteng to Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, which sets out the terms of the taxpayer support.\nCommenting on the three-week deal, Mr Kwarteng said: \"In a critical intervention you have to have a way of exiting the arrangement.\n\"It is not a case of just trying to nationalise it or supporting it indefinitely, and that is why in the critical period we needed to have a short term arrangement I am confident that we can get other sources of CO2 in that period. \nMr Eustice said that the shortage of carbon dioxide had been caused by a \"perfect storm\" of circumstances where CF Industries had shut its two plants because \"an increase in gas price means they are not profitable\", while two other providers had closed their sites for maintenance.\nBut the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said the current difficulties showed how exposed the UK is, because of its reliance on such a small number of carbon dioxide producers. \n\"Over many years, we have had a major consolidation of the industry resulting in sectors like food and drink, nuclear and health being reliant on a very small number of very large suppliers,\" the BMPA said.\n\"If a market-based solution is to be found, it will likely involve longer-term higher prices for CO2, which will be sustainable for some, but not all users of the gas.\"\nIan Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, also called on the government to support other fertiliser producers and help food producers to look for alternatives to CO2.\nMr Will, who flew from the US to the UK on Sunday to meet Mr Kwarteng, said: \"We look forward to working with Secretary Kwarteng and the UK government on developing a longer-term solution, including the development of alternative suppliers of CO2 for the UK market.\"\nThe BBC understands that the deal with CF Industries has been drafted so that other companies who stop production because of high commodity prices will not be able to ask the government for similar help. \nNorwegian firm Yara has also cut production at a number of European factories, including one in Hull.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson urged people not to worry about putting food on the table this winter, amid rising energy and food bills and a cut to universal credit.\nWholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January, with a 70% rise since August alone, leading to calls for support from the industry and the collapse of some smaller energy firms.\nMr Opie added that the government should also take action on other issues affecting food retailers in recent weeks, such as the shortage of HGV drivers, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and many drivers returning to the European Union after Brexit.\nThe government has been keen to stress that this is very much an emergency measure, time-limited, and with a cap on the amount it is prepared to pay. \nIt had to do something. Food producers were warning that shortages would become apparent within days, at a time when supply chains have already been disrupted by other issues, such as a lack of lorry drivers. \nBut the fact remains that it has agreed to give a large US-owned company tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, just to operate one of its own plants. That isn't a particularly good look - and it has cast a glaring spotlight on the vulnerability of a key part of the economy. \nNow there is a three-week window for government, supermarkets and food producers to come up with a \"sustainable market-based solution\". In practice, that's likely to mean users paying more for their CO2, a cost which will ultimately be borne by consumers. "

      "text": "Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has launched an investigation into a data breach involving the email addresses of dozens of Afghan interpreters who worked for British forces.\nMore than 250 people seeking relocation to the UK - many of whom are in hiding - were mistakenly copied into an email from the Ministry of Defence.\nTheir email addresses could be seen by all recipients, showing people's names and some associated profile pictures.\nThe MoD has apologised in a statement.\nThe email was sent to interpreters who remain in Afghanistan or have been able to get to other countries.\nConservative MP and former defence minister Johnny Mercer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The reality is we've left the vast, vast majority of our interpreters behind so this is going to have a profound impact on people who are still in the country.\"\nHe said he had spoken to the brother of one man, trained by the UK to serve in Afghan special forces, who had been executed after the evacuation by the US and UK and whose family is now on the run.\nFailings by the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office had led to Afghan allies being \"hunted ruthlessly by the Taliban\", he said.\nThe email was sent by the team in charge of the UK's Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap), which has been in contact with them since the Taliban took control of the country last month.\nThe team told the interpreters it was doing everything it could to help relocate them.\nIt also said they should not put themselves or their families at risk if it was not safe for them to leave their current location.\nBut one interpreter who received the email realised that more than 250 Afghans who worked with British forces had been copied into the email.\n\"This mistake could cost the life of interpreters, especially for those who are still in Afghanistan,\" they told the BBC.\n\"Some of the interpreters didn't notice the mistake and they replied to all the emails already and they explained their situation which is very dangerous. The email contains their profile pictures and contact details.\"\nThe MoD then sent another email 30 minutes later with the title \"Urgent - Arap case contact\" asking the recipients to delete the previous email and warning \"your email address may have been compromised\".\nIt recommended the interpreters change their email addresses.\nLabour shadow defence secretary John Healey said the data breach had \"needlessly put lives at risk\" and called on the government to urgently step up efforts to get the interpreters to the UK.\nAfter the BBC approached the Ministry of Defence, the defence secretary was angry enough to order an immediate inquiry.\nIt's likely this data breach was just human error, and the apology is certainly sincere, but there are obviously concerns if the email addresses, names and pictures fall into the wrong hands.\nWhile the military evacuation on the ground was rightly lauded, the failure to get all those who worked with British forces out has left hundreds stranded and in hiding. \nJust this week we spoke to the family of an eight-month-old British baby who is still stuck there, an interpreter who is on the run fearing for his life, and another interpreter who just does not know what to do. \nThis data breach just compounds their safety concerns.\nAn MoD spokeswoman said an investigation had been launched into what Mr Wallace called an \"unacceptable breach\". \n\"We apologise to everyone impacted by this breach and are working hard to ensure it does not happen again,\" she said.\nShe added that the MoD \"takes its information and data handling responsibilities very seriously\".\nTobias Ellwood MP, who chairs the defence select committee, welcomed the investigation but said it was more pressing to get the interpreters out of the country as soon as possible.\n\"Each day they remain in the country the risk of them not making it out increases,\" he said."

      "tags": "Keir Starmer,Momentum,Labour Party Conference,Sharon Graham,Labour Party,Unite,Jeremy Corbyn",
      "text": "Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has re-opened a bitter internal dispute just days ahead of his party's conference.\nHe has tried to convince trade unions to back a plan to scrap the leadership rules which enabled predecessor Jeremy Corbyn to get elected - but has so far failed to secure their support.\nCurrently grassroots members elect the leader - a system introduced by Ed Miliband.\nBut Sir Keir wants to return to an \"electoral college\", where ordinary Labour Party members would only account for a third of the votes in a future leadership contest.\nMPs would be given a further third of the vote - a move backed by \"moderate\" members of the party as they believe elected politicians more closely reflect the views of constituents and not just activists. \nThe unions would also be given a third of the vote.\nThat may, on the surface, seem to appeal to the unions, but Labour politics is never that simple.\nBetween them, the unions account for half the votes at Labour conference, so they will have huge influence over whether the leadership rules will change.\nThose under left-wing leadership see the proposed rule changes as an attempt to \"de-Corbynise\" the party - reintroducing rules which gave MPs too much say at the expense of the members.\nIn her first broadcast interview, Sharon Graham - the new leader of the influential Unite union - said Sir Keir had not floated the idea with her in advance and should \"think again\".\nShe told the BBC: \"People will remember that at their conference, Labour talked about rules not issues. That's a huge error for them.\n\"We are almost trying to save [the Labour leadership] from themselves. This is not the path to go down.\"\nMs Graham, who has written to Labour MPs urging them to oppose Sir Keir's position, argued: \"This proposal to reduce the membership to one third of the vote, while inflating the vote of Labour MPs, is unfair, undemocratic and a backwards step.\"\nLabour MP Sam Tarry, who serves in Sir Keir's frontbench team as a shadow transport minister, tweeted that he \"cannot support a regressive plan to dilute Labour members' votes and divide our movement\", adding: \"We are one party and should all have an equal say in choosing who leads any Labour government.\"\nThe left-wing group Momentum condemned the move. Vice chair Callum Bell said: \"These rule changes would mark the start of a civil war in the party. Starmer holds the membership in contempt.\"\nAnd former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, also on the left of Labour, criticised Sir Keir for concentrating on \"internal factional pursuits\" as the party meets in Brighton for its first face-to-face conference since Covid hit.\nBut Labour MP Neil Coyle urged left-wingers to back the changes so that the party can improve its chances of winning power in the future, and get on with tackling issues voters cared about. \n\"We need to pick someone who can actually win for us and not another loser on an epic scale, like we had before,\" the Bermondsey and Old Southwark MP told the BBC's Politics Live.\nEd Miliband - who introduced the system Sir Keir wants to overturn - said it was \"a leader's prerogative\" to make changes adding: \"I support his decision to do that.\"\n\"Keir Starmer's intention is to get the Labour Party in touch with voters - that is the key thing.\"\nOn Wednesday, Sir Keir argued his case directly to the unions which affiliate to Labour but I have been told there were \"no takers\" for his plan to change the rules. \nA source told me the meeting was \"cordial\" and the Labour leader was in \"listening mode\" but the unions urged him to delay his plans so they could discuss them more widely with their members.\nA joint statement from Labour and Mike Whelan - chair of the Trade Union and Labour Party Liaison Organisation - said the meeting was \"positive\" and that discussions \"will continue\". \nSir Keir added \"this was never a take it or leave it conversation... I am continuing to take suggestions and have discussions about how we do everything we need to in order to make the Labour Party the party of working people again.\"\nBut insiders tell me that very little preparation had been done, and that the Labour leader has no guaranteed support.\nFor his plan to succeed he would need to win over three big unions - the GMB, shopworkers' union Usdaw and public service union Unison.\nIf it is clear that too many unions are opposed to it, the proposal will not go to Labour's conference.\nIf, however, two of those unions back him and another agrees to abstain, the proposal would go to Labour's National Executive Committee on Friday and then on to the full conference at the weekend.\nThe proposals in some form will go to Labour's National Executive Committee (the party's ruling body) on Friday night - only then will a decision be taken on whether to risk a conference vote.\nSir Keir has so far been seen as a cautious leader, but this would be a high-wire act, because he could be defeated either before conference or on the conference floor.\nBut allies are praising him for leading from the front and hope his authority will be strengthened if he wins.\nI am told that he is willing to negotiate on the precise make-up of the electoral college and may be willing to give unions a bigger say in a leadership contest in order to get the proposal through.\nAhead of Wednesday's meeting with the unions, Sir Keir said the current rules \"focus us inwards to spend too much time talking to and about ourselves\".\n\"I know that this is difficult - change always is - but I think these changes are vital for our party's future.\"\nHe added: \"I have said I will make the Labour Party the party of working people. I am determined that the Labour Party I lead focuses on the country, on the concerns of voters, so we need party reforms that better connect us with working people.\"\nHe will also propose to make it more difficult for local parties to oust - or deselect - MPs."

      "tags": "Meat,Stockton-on-Tees,Food industry,Soft drinks,CO\u2082 shortage",
      "text": "The British food industry will be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with a US company to restart production in the UK.\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from \u00a3200 per tonne to \u00a31,000.\nThe government has agreed to pay out tens of millions of pounds to CF Industries to reopen a plant in the UK. \nThe closure had raised fears over food supplies and the nuclear industry.\nUS-owned CF Industries recently shut two UK sites that produce 60% of the country's commercial carbon dioxide supplies, because of a sharp rise in gas prices.\nFarms, food producers and supermarkets have warned that a shortage of carbon dioxide will lead to significant disruption to the manufacture and supply of fresh produce. \nThe Times also reported that ministers were concerned that the UK might have to close its six advanced gas-cooled nuclear reactors, which also use CO2. \nThe government announced late on Tuesday night that it would meet the full operating costs to run CF Industries' Billingham plant in Teesside for three weeks. The costs are expected to be in the \"low tens of millions\" and will be below \u00a350m.\nMr Eustice said that the deal with CF Industries \"will be not a loan, it will be a payment to underwrite some of their fixed costs\".\nAt the end of the three-week period, it is hoped that the price of carbon dioxide will have risen sufficiently to make it economically viable for CF Industries to keep production running. \nMr Eustice said the food industry would have to accept \"a big, sharp rise\" carbon dioxide prices from \u00a3200 to \u00a31,000 a tonne.\n\"The critical thing was to get the production up and running expeditiously. That's why we've needed this government intervention,\" he said.\n\"But we've had meetings with the food industry. They all recognise that the price of carbon dioxide is going to increase substantially and when that price increases, then the market signal will be then for these plants to continue producing.\"\nMr Eustice insisted that the rise in cost would not have a \"significant impact\" on food prices. \nHe said that while food prices were increasing \"due to global commodity prices, oil prices and also other factors such as labour shortages\", carbon dioxide was \"a tiny proportion\" of the industry's overall costs. \nCF Industries had halted two of its fertiliser factories - which produce carbon dioxide as a by-product - because of gas prices.\nCF Industries' Billingham plant will need up to three days to start producing new CO2. \nThe company told the BBC it had \"no estimate\" on when its second UK plant at Ince in Cheshire would  resume production. \nThe British Meat Processors Association said the deal to open CF Industries' Teesside plant was a \"huge relief\" and said it was now \"focused on re-establishing supplies before Friday this week, which is when around 25% of pork production was in danger of shutting down\".\nAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, welcomed the decision, but said the timetable to restart CF Industries' factory and begin producing carbon dioxide \"will still be tight\".\nHe told the BBC's Today programme: \"Our understanding is that provided that carbon dioxide starts to get through to food producers by the end of the week, then we can avert major and significant disruption in our stores.\"\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the \"exceptional short-term arrangement\" would ensure industries that rely on a stable supply of CO2 \"have the resources they require to avoid disruption\".\nHe said: \"With regards to the CO2 situation, it was abundant, it was very cheap and I think a lot of people were surprised at what happened.\" \nThe government intends to publish the letter from Mr Kwarteng to Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, which sets out the terms of the taxpayer support.\nCommenting on the three-week deal, Mr Kwarteng said: \"In a critical intervention you have to have a way of exiting the arrangement.\n\"It is not a case of just trying to nationalise it or supporting it indefinitely, and that is why in the critical period we needed to have a short term arrangement I am confident that we can get other sources of CO2 in that period. \nMr Eustice said that the shortage of carbon dioxide had been caused by a \"perfect storm\" of circumstances where CF Industries had shut its two plants because \"an increase in gas price means they are not profitable\", while two other providers had closed their sites for maintenance.\nBut the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said the current difficulties showed how exposed the UK is, because of its reliance on such a small number of carbon dioxide producers. \n\"Over many years, we have had a major consolidation of the industry resulting in sectors like food and drink, nuclear and health being reliant on a very small number of very large suppliers,\" the BMPA said.\n\"If a market-based solution is to be found, it will likely involve longer-term higher prices for CO2, which will be sustainable for some, but not all users of the gas.\"\nIan Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, also called on the government to support other fertiliser producers and help food producers to look for alternatives to CO2.\nMr Will, who flew from the US to the UK on Sunday to meet Mr Kwarteng, said: \"We look forward to working with Secretary Kwarteng and the UK government on developing a longer-term solution, including the development of alternative suppliers of CO2 for the UK market.\"\nThe BBC understands that the deal with CF Industries has been drafted so that other companies who stop production because of high commodity prices will not be able to ask the government for similar help. \nNorwegian firm Yara has also cut production at a number of European factories, including one in Hull.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson urged people not to worry about putting food on the table this winter, amid rising energy and food bills and a cut to universal credit.\nWholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January, with a 70% rise since August alone, leading to calls for support from the industry and the collapse of some smaller energy firms.\nMr Opie added that the government should also take action on other issues affecting food retailers in recent weeks, such as the shortage of HGV drivers, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and many drivers returning to the European Union after Brexit.\nThe government has been keen to stress that this is very much an emergency measure, time-limited, and with a cap on the amount it is prepared to pay. \nIt had to do something. Food producers were warning that shortages would become apparent within days, at a time when supply chains have already been disrupted by other issues, such as a lack of lorry drivers. \nBut the fact remains that it has agreed to give a large US-owned company tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, just to operate one of its own plants. That isn't a particularly good look - and it has cast a glaring spotlight on the vulnerability of a key part of the economy. \nNow there is a three-week window for government, supermarkets and food producers to come up with a \"sustainable market-based solution\". In practice, that's likely to mean users paying more for their CO2, a cost which will ultimately be borne by consumers. "

      "text": "A trip to a melting glacier will shape how the BBC's new climate editor, Justin Rowlatt, reports on the story of climate change.\nYou cannot help but be awed by the scale of Antarctica, the great white continent.   \nI visited just before the pandemic struck and it is impossible not to feel humbled in the presence of something that seems so much bigger and more powerful than you.   \nBut that sensation is an illusion.   \nWhen we finally flew over the front of the enormous glacier after weeks of travelling, I found myself staring down at an epic vision of shattered ice.   \nAs I wrote at the time, it felt like I'd reached the frontline of climate change; a place where the equilibrium that has held our world in balance for thousands of years was slipping and crashing.  \nSatellite monitoring shows that the overall rate of ice loss from West Antarctica has increased five-fold over a 25-year period. This one glacier - Thwaite's glacier - alone now accounts for 4% of global sea level rise.   \nNeedless to say, this acceleration is a result of us humans polluting the air with greenhouse gases. That fact explodes any impression that the ice is overwhelming. The opposite is true, we are overwhelming the ice.   \nI was surprised how moved I was by what I'd seen. In the weeks it took to travel home, I tried to process my emotions. \nI thought about the men and women who had set our camp, who flew the planes, cooked the meals, processed the rubbish and groomed the ice runways. And I thought about the scientists who have been studying the processes at work for decades. \nOur research trip was only possible because of a huge chain of human enterprise culminating with the hardworking people in the UK and US whose taxes paid for it all. \nAs I flew back to the UK, I reflected how it is often claimed that selfishness, greed and conflict are the hallmarks of humanity, but that is wrong. \nThe defining human characteristic is actually our ability to co-operate - our ability to solve problems together explains the dominance our species has achieved. \nFor the first time since I had been to the front of the glacier I began to feel the stir of something I was worried I'd lost entirely: a sense of purpose. \nI retell this story now because I want that sense that we can come together and take control of the processes driving climate change to underpin my reporting in my new role as climate editor.   \nOf course, the BBC has been reporting climate change for decades and we'll be keeping up that tradition, especially during a crucial UN climate conference in Glasgow in November, where nations will be asked to renew their commitments to cutting emissions. \nBut however ambitious the deal there is, we need to continue to report the latest science on climate change and the effect it is having on our world.  \nAnd use that science as a yardstick to judge the progress our societies are making to reduce emissions. \nThat means scrutinising what politicians, business people and - yes - all of us consumers are doing to try to reduce our impact on the climate.   \nI do not want to nag or hector. We all face the same dilemmas over how the choices we make in our lives affect the climate. \nAnd I am optimistic about what we can achieve.  \nWe humans are wary of change but we are actually extraordinarily adaptable - another key to our success as a species. And we have a vast capacity for innovation. \nThink of the huge offshore wind industry flourishing here in the UK, or the way our car industry is retooling as the ban on new petrol and diesel vehicles approaches. \nLook at the UK companies at the forefront of all sorts of exciting low-carbon technologies - from nuclear fusion to plant-based foods - and consider the fortunes to be made as these new markets go global. \nAnd look at the progress being made to mobilise international finance behind the effort to tackle climate change - an endeavour being led by the City of London.     \nBut I will not forget what I saw in Antarctica. It reminds us that climate change is a process that is likely to take centuries to play out, and tens of thousands of years to reverse. \nConsider this: the last time CO2 levels were this high is reckoned to have been around four million years ago and it is estimated that the sea level then could have been as much as 30-40 metres higher than it is now.   \nThat's a measure of how important the climate issue is and also explains why I'm so pleased to be given this opportunity to play a role in covering it for the BBC. \nTackling global warming will be the central project of the 21st Century and it is an incredible privilege to have been given a front row seat."

      "tags": "Ministry of Justice,Cheshire",
      "text": "A woman has told how her baby died during childbirth \"due to errors\" made after she went into labour in prison.\nLouise Powell, 31, said she begged for an ambulance before her baby, Brooke, died in a cell at HMP Styal in 2020.\nThe Prison Ombudsman is reviewing the death and is also due to publish its findings on another baby's death at HMP Bronzefield in Middlesex in 2019.\nThe Prison Service said it had already \"made significant improvements to support female offenders\".  \nMs Powell said she did not know she was pregnant when Brooke was delivered prematurely between 30 and 32 weeks, weighing 2.5lbs (1.1kg), but told BBC Newsnight her daughter's death could have been avoided \"if [her condition] was taken seriously enough\". \n\"Brooke was let down by the people who were meant to look after us,\" she said.  \nMs Powell, who was sentenced to eight months in March 2020 after admitting common assault, racially-aggravated harassment and criminal damage, said it was her first time in jail and she \"wasn't in a very good place\" after a relationship breakdown.\nOn her first day at HMP Styal, she told staff there was \"no chance\" she was pregnant.\nHowever, her lawyer Jane Ryan said prison staff were aware she had not had a period for four to five months and never followed it up.\nAt about 17:00 BST on 18 June, Ms Powell said she started feeling \"extreme\" pain.\nShe said her cellmate told staff she was bleeding and had severe cramps and had not had a period in months.\nA female prison officer then told her she looked six months pregnant, she said.\nMs Powell said she \"still didn't have a clue... but I felt like I was dying\", adding that the officer \"left me in the cell\". \nBBC Newsnight understands the prison officer contacted the on-site health care team about Ms Powell's condition and raised concerns about pregnancy, but it is claimed no medical professional went to see her.  \nMs Powell said she was bent over with pain and crying but managed to leave her cell and found a prison officer, telling them: \"I need an ambulance. I'm dying.\" \nShe said the officer told her to go back and lie down. \nBBC Newsnight understands the officer called the health care team again, but no medical professional was sent. \nAt about 21:00, Ms Powell said her cellmate pressed the emergency bell, as she felt the need to push. \nShe said her baby's legs \"came out\", because Brooke was breech, and it was then that a prison nurse arrived and helped with the delivery. \nMs Powell described the chaotic scenes which followed the birth, during which she said she went into shock and was given oxygen.\nShe said an officer \"told me I had a beautiful baby girl\", but when the officer returned, \"her face was different\".\nShe said she knew at that point her daughter \"wasn't OK\". \nBBC Newsnight understands staff tried to call for an ambulance, but the prison radio system failed.\nMs Powell said \"nobody tried to revive [Brooke]\", and when paramedics arrived, it was \"too late\" to save her baby.\n\"I don't blame anyone for not knowing I was pregnant... but nobody came to look at me,\" she said.\n\"I feel like a lot more could have been done.\"\nShe said Brooke was a \"perfect baby and she died due to error\".\n\"She should be here with me... and that's been taken away from me through no fault of my own. \n\"I never got listened to.\" \nShe added that the prison \"clearly can't look after people\" and treated inmates as \"a number, not a person\".\nMs Ryan said Brooke's death was \"a tragedy that should not have happened\" and she believed that in different circumstances Ms Powell's daughter might have survived.  \n\"[She] was premature but she was healthy,\" she said.\n\"Evidence shows [that] had Louise been properly assessed... then Brooke could have survived.\n\"That's devastating for Louise and also a matter of public concern that yet again this has happened.\"\nMs Ryan said the two baby deaths were a \"disgrace\" and a \"stain on all of us\".\n\"Prison is the punishment itself,\" she said.\n\"You still should be appropriately cared for and be able to access adequate healthcare.\"\nThe Prison Service said it was a \"deeply sad and distressing case\".\nA spokesman said the service had \"made significant improvements to support female offenders\" and inmates now had \"greater access to education, healthcare and employment\".\n\"We await the report and will respond accordingly to improve the care for pregnant women and mothers in prison,\" he added.\nSpectrum Community Health CIC, the prison's healthcare provider, said it \"extended its deepest condolences to Ms Powell\" and had \"fully co-operated\" with the ombudsman's investigation.\n\"As the investigation report has yet to be published, we are unable to provide any further comment,\" it added.\nYou can watch Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 on weekdays.

      "text": "The FBI has searched the Florida home of Brian Laundrie, the fianc\u00e9 of 22-year-old Gabby Petito, a missing woman now believed to be dead.\nAgents with a search warrant surrounded the property on Monday. Mr Laundrie's parents were removed from the home but have since been allowed back inside.\nOn 1 September, Mr Laundrie, 23, returned home alone after a cross-country road trip with Ms Petito.\nOn Sunday, remains matching Ms Petito's description were found in Wyoming.\nPolice consider Mr Laundrie a \"person of interest\" in the case but have not charged him with any crime. He declined to speak to police earlier this month, and has since gone missing. \nHis family has said they last saw him on 14 September.\nVideo from local media on Monday showed officers and FBI agents approaching the Laundrie home, some with guns drawn, cordoning it off with crime scene tape and placing Mr Laundries' parents in an unmarked van.\nAgents were then seen removing several boxes from the house. \nIn a tweet, the FBI confirmed it had secured a search warrant in court. \"No further details can be provided since this is an active and ongoing investigation,\" the agency said after the hours-long search. \nThe FBI is also set to conduct a full forensic investigation of the remains found on Sunday inside Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park, to determine whether the woman is Ms Petito.\nSince Mr Laundrie returned home, he had not spoken to authorities or to the Petito family. Mr Laundrie's parents reported him as missing last Tuesday. \nAuthorities had been looking for Mr Laundrie in a 24,000-acre nature reserve in North Port, Florida, this weekend with police dogs and drones. On Monday, police called off the search, said they had \"exhausted all avenues in searching\" the area.\nMs Petito was visiting the Grand Teton National Park with Mr Laundrie when she disappeared.\nThe young couple had set out on a cross-country campervan trip in July, documenting their adventures on social media.\nTwo weeks before Ms Petito went missing, on 12 August, police in the southern Utah town of Moab were called to a possible domestic violence incident involving the couple.\nPolice released bodycam footage which showed Ms Petito crying and complaining about her mental health to officers. She also said the couple had been arguing more frequently.\nThe officers recommended they spend the night apart but did not file any charges. It is not yet known what happened next."

      "text": "On 4 March 2018 emergency services received a phone call from members of the public in Salisbury who had seen an old man and a young woman ill on a bench. It was a call that would set in motion a chain of events leading to a major crisis with Russia. \nAfter the pair were taken to hospital, local police did an online search on the name of the man taken ill.\nThe result set off alarm bells. He was a former Russian spy.\nA call came into the duty officer at MI6 headquarters that Sunday evening. \nThe realisation that Sergei Skripal - a man who had provided MI6 with secrets from his time in Russian military intelligence - had been targeted sent shock waves through the building, challenging the very core of its work in recruiting agents to work with the organisation.\nA few hours later, the next call went to Porton Down, home to Britain's biological and chemical research establishment.\nA rapid-response team was quickly deployed. Samples analysed in labs on-site identified A234, a military-grade nerve agent from the Novichok family developed by the Soviet Union in the Cold War.\nThe revelation caused shock. Detective work by police would identify two officers from Russian military intelligence as the main suspects and a perfume bottle as the means of delivery of the nerve agent onto Mr Skripal's front door handle. \nA local woman, Dawn Sturgess would die months later when she came into contact with the Novichok after it had apparently been discarded.\nRussia denied any role - even putting the two accused men on TV to say they had visited Salisbury simply to see the cathedral spire - but London was convinced it knew who was behind the attack.\nWhen another former Russian intelligence officer, Alexander Litvinenko, was killed in 2006 (that time by radioactive polonium) the response was delayed and perceived as weak.\nLondon was determined to learn its lesson.\nEvery known Russian intelligence officer operating under diplomatic cover in the UK (apart from the declared liaison officer for each Russian intelligence service) was quickly expelled - 23 in total.\nMany other countries then followed suit, with 60 expulsions in the US. It seemed as if the Kremlin was taken by surprise by the strength of the reaction.\nBut two years on, the legacy of those events looks more uncertain.\nBritish officials believe they did real damage to Russian intelligence operations in the country but that damage is likely to have been short term as new spies were dispatched to replace them and as Russia continues a shift to rely on alternative means of espionage.\nIn the Cold War, spies under diplomatic cover and illegals were the primary way the Russians could recruit and run agents and steal secrets.\nNow there is cyber-espionage and the use of people travelling under different cover, as say businessmen, to operate. \nIn the wake of the attack, there was also considerable talk of a tougher line over Russian money and influence in London. But there has been relatively little public sign of action.\nThe failure to publish the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee's \"Russia Report\" about influence and subversion in British life before the election has only added to questions as to whether the appetite to deal with this broader issue remains strong.\nThere are also cracks in Western unity over a tough line on Russia, with President Emmanuel Macron of France pushing for trying to improve relations with the Kremlin and uncertainty over the position of the Trump administration in Washington.\nMr Skripal himself has not appeared in public since the poisoning.\nMI5 and the Home Office carried out a \"refresh\" to check on the level of protection for defectors like Mr Skirpal - something officials acknowledge was overdue.\nThe poisoning itself was a failure, several senior officials who served in British intelligence concede. \nA risk assessment was carried out when Mr Skripal was swapped out of a Russian prison in 2010 but the Russia of 2018 was very different from Russia then.\nRussia appears to have stepped up a long-standing campaign to track defectors from 2014, including in the US as well as UK.\nThat was also the point at which relations began to deteriorate rapidly over the crisis in Ukraine and Crimea and in which other alleged operations, like the deployment of online trolls to interfere in US politics increased.\nOne question western intelligence officials have been asking is whether Russia has been deterred from taking such action again by the Western response.\nNo one seems sure.

      "text": "Boris Johnson has said people should not worry about putting food on the table this winter, amid surging energy prices and a cut to universal credit.\nThe prime minister told BBC News: \"I don't believe people will be short of food - and wages are actually rising.\"\nIt comes after Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng warned some households face a \"very difficult winter\".\nEnergy and food bills are rising due to a spike in global gas prices - and many families face a \u00a320-a-week benefit cut.\nThe cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills, the boss of the energy regulator Ofgem has warned.\nSpeaking to the BBC in New York, where he has been meeting world leaders at the United Nations, Mr Johnson said the surge in energy prices was a \"short-term\" problem caused by \"the global economy coming back to life\" after the coronavirus pandemic. \n\"We are talking to the energy companies - doing what we can to keep prices low, to make sure that the supermarket shelves aren't empty,\" he said.\nHouseholds across England, Scotland and Wales are set to see their energy bills rise by an average of \u00a3139 a year in October.\nWorkers also face a rise in National Insurance payments from next April, to help fund higher costs for the NHS and social care.\nIn his BBC interview, Mr Johnson insisted the gas price increase was an \"interim\" issue and the global energy markets would \"rectify themselves\".\nIt showed that the UK was right to be moving to renewable energy, he added.\nThe government is hoping to limit further energy bill rises by keeping a price cap in place, and also plans to help bigger firms take on customers from small suppliers that have gone bust. \nSeparately, the government says it has taken action to prevent supermarket shortages with a deal to restart production at CF Industries, the UK's biggest producer of carbon dioxide.\nThe gas is widely used by the food industry to prolong shelf life.\nRestarting production at the carbon dioxide plants is set to cost taxpayers tens of millions of pounds, after the government agreed to meet the full operating costs for three weeks.\nEnergy price rises have been as dizzying as New York's skyscrapers - but Boris Johnson was reluctant to acknowledge the squeeze on supply was anything more than a short-term problem. \nThe government has managed to broker a deal on CO2, but the pressure points this autumn go beyond that. \nThere are real fears at home about household bills, food supplies, and rising prices. \nBut Mr Johnson blamed the pressures on the pandemic, saying the issues were just in the \"interim\".\nWhile he said the government would help where it could, he did not provide details of any further actions the government might take, placing his faith in the market to resolve the crunch and pointing to his energy \"ten-point plan\". \nA long-term Whitehall plan may not be that much comfort to those worrying about paying higher bills right here and now. \nRead more from Laura here.\nMr Johnson has again rejected calls from Labour and many Tory MPs to scrap the cut to the \u00a320 a week top-up to universal credit, which some MPs have warned will push many working families into poverty.\nInstead of keeping the top-up, which was brought in to help people through the pandemic, Mr Johnson said:  \"We think the best thing we can do is help people into high-skilled, high wage jobs, that is what is happening,\n\"Unemployment is falling very rapidly, jobs are being created, wages are rising.\n\"And rather than raising people's taxes to put more money into benefits, we want to see companies paying their workers more.\"\nLabour held a debate in the Commons, calling on the government to halt the proposed cut to the universal credit top-up.\nThe party's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, said working families faced a squeeze on living standards this winter \"on a scale not seen for a generation\" - and it was down to government decisions, not an \"unforeseeable series of unhappy accidents\".\n\"Incomes are coming down, prices are going up - especially energy prices - taxes are going up, rents are going up, childcare costs are going up, fuel costs are going up, rail fares are going up.\n\"And with empty shelves in too many shops, restaurants closing because of meat shortages, and now refrigerant shortages putting Christmas at risk, it isn't just that people can afford less, there is also less to afford,\" she told MPs.\nSpeaking on BBC Two's Newsnight programme on Monday, the Conservative former Brexit Secretary, David Davis, warned there was a risk of a \"cost of living crisis\" for new Tory voters such as \"the plumber, the bricklayer, the lorry driver\".\nHe said his advice to Chancellor Rishi Sunak would be: \"You think hard about the ordinary family's take-home pay and what they have to buy with it, because that will be a dictator of how people feel going in to the new year.\""

      "tags": "Abortion,Texas,US abortion debate,United States",
      "text": "A Texas doctor who admitted to breaking the state's new abortion legislation has been sued, in what could be a test of how lawful the mandate is.\nWriting for the Washington Post, Alan Braid said he had carried out a termination on a woman who was in the early stages of her pregnancy but \"beyond the state's new limit\".\nFormer lawyers in Arkansas and Illinois filed lawsuits against him on Monday.\nThe new legislation bans abortions from as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.\nThe law came into effect on 1 September, giving any individual - from Texas or elsewhere - the right to sue doctors who perform an abortion past the six-week point. However it does not allow the women who get the procedure to be sued.\nThe law bans terminations after the detection of what anti-abortion campaigners call a foetal heartbeat, something medical authorities say is misleading. \nDr Braid, who has been practising medicine for nearly 50 years, wrote in an opinion column published on the weekend: \"I acted because I had a duty of care to this patient, as I do for all patients, and because she has a fundamental right to receive this care.\n\"I fully understood that there could be legal consequences - but I wanted to make sure that Texas didn't get away with its bid to prevent this blatantly unconstitutional law from being tested,\" he wrote.\nOscar Stilley, a former lawyer in Arkansas who is serving a 15-year federal conviction for tax fraud in home confinement, said he had decided to file the lawsuit after reading Dr Braid's opinion piece. He said he was not opposed to abortion but sued to force a court to test the legality of the new legislation.\nIn an interview with Reuters news agency, he said the new restrictions violate women's constitutional rights.\nA second lawsuit was filed by Felipe Gomez, from Illinois, who described himself as a \"Pro Choice Plaintiff\" in the suit and claimed the law was \"illegal as written and as applied\".\nDr Braid has not commented on the lawsuits, the first known legal challenges to the law which is one of the most restrictive in the country. \nThe \"Heartbeat Act\" was signed into law by Republican Governor Greg Abbott in May. It took effect after the Supreme Court did not respond to an emergency appeal by abortion providers. \nEarlier this month, the US justice department filed an emergency motion, seeking to block enforcement of the law while it pursues legal action.\nAbortion providers say the law is at odds with the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v Wade, under which US women have the right to an abortion until a foetus is viable - that is, able to survive outside the womb. This is usually between 22 and 24 weeks into a pregnancy.\nThe law enforces its ban with an uncommon approach: it empowers any private citizen to sue anyone who \"aids and abets\" an illegal abortion.\nPeople who successfully sue under the Texas law will be awarded at least $10,000 (\u00a37,200), in addition to any legal fees incurred.\nCritics, like the American Civil Liberties Union, have said this leaves the responsibility for enforcing it on individuals, rather than local or state officials, and could give rise to abortion \"bounty hunters\"."

But there was nothing, nothing at all. \n\"We wanted a bit of debris: A hat? A jacket? Anything? But there was nothing to be found. \n\"We go out there. We save people, and that's what we do. But on this occasion, we hadn't done it. \n\"Everyone had gone out there and given their all.\""

      "title": "Covid: US opens up to fully vaccinated travellers",
      "tags": "Travel,European Union,United States,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The US is easing its coronavirus travel restrictions, reopening to passengers from the UK, EU and other nations. \nFrom November, foreign travellers will be allowed to fly into the US if they are fully vaccinated, and undergo testing and contact tracing. \nThe US has had tough restrictions on travel in place since early last year.\nThe move answers a major demand from European allies, and means that families and friends separated by the restrictions can be reunited. \n\"It's a happy day - Big Apple, here I come!\" French entrepreneur Stephane Le Breton told the Associated Press news agency, as he looked forward to a trip to New York City that had been put on hold because of the restrictions. \nWhite House Covid-19 co-ordinator Jeff Zients announced the new rules on Monday, saying: \"This is based on individuals rather than a country-based approach, so it's a stronger system.\"\n\"Most importantly, foreign nationals flying to the US will be required to be fully vaccinated,\" he said. \nUS restrictions were initially imposed on travellers from China in early 2020, and then extended to other countries. \nThe current rules bar entry to most non-US citizens who have been in the UK and a number of other European countries, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil within the last 14 days. \nUnder the new rules, foreign travellers will need to demonstrate proof of vaccination before flying, obtain a negative Covid-19 test result within three days of travelling, and provide their contact information. They will not be required to quarantine. \nOfficials said there would be some exceptions to the new policy, including for children who are not eligible to be vaccinated. \nIt was not immediately clear if the new rules applied only to US-approved vaccines, with Mr Zients saying this would be determined by the US Centers for Disease Control.\nA White House source told the BBC that the question of whether people who have had the AstraZeneca vaccine or 12- to 18-year-olds who have only had one jab would be allowed in under the new rules was a level of \"granular detail\" that was still being worked out, though this would affect millions. \nAmericans who are not fully vaccinated will still be able to enter, but they will need to be tested before their return to the US, and after they arrive home.\nMr Zients said the policy would come into effect in early November, but did not give an exact date. \nThe new rules do not apply to land borders, meaning that restrictions continue to apply to cross-border travel with Canada and Mexico. \nThe easing of travel rules came as a surprise to many, after the US government last week said it was not the right time to lift the restrictions. \nOne British official told the BBC on Monday that the decision had come completely out of the blue. \nFollowing the announcement, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"delighted\". \n\"It's a fantastic boost for business and trade, and great that family and friends on both sides of the pond can be reunited once again,\" he wrote on Twitter. \nGerman Vice-Chancellor Olaf Scholz also welcomed the change, saying it was \"great news for German and European investments, our exports and transatlantic relations\". \nFor months a joint working party has been looking at ways to relax the travel ban. The work, I'm told, has been detailed and assiduous. \nBut last Friday in Washington next to no one (not even in the Biden administration) was expecting today's announcement. So what's changed? \nThe Biden administration is aware of the growing disquiet among European allies about a range of issues - Afghanistan notably, but in recent days French fury over the Aukus submarine deal. And remember France is America's oldest ally. \nThis week Joe Biden will be meeting not only Boris Johnson, but a whole pile of EU leaders during the UN General Assembly in New York. And all had it on their dance cards to raise the travel ban. \nAccording to one diplomatic source, the US over the weekend just weighed the countervailing forces: annoy some Americans with a policy that could be characterised as being weak on Covid; or continue to alienate your European allies who are growing increasingly irritable. \nWith the data no longer supporting the ban, this weekend came a decision. Out of the blue in one way, but quite logical in another.\nAirline shares rose in response to the new travel rules, with British Airways owner IAG up as much as 10%.\nVirgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss called the move \"a major milestone\" for travel recovery. \nDoug Parker, chairman and CEO of American Airlines, said he welcomed the \"science-based approach\" to lifting travel restrictions.\n\"With the shared goals of health and safety always at the forefront, we're looking forward to welcoming more customers back to easy, seamless international trips for business, for leisure, and to reconnect with family and friends,\" he said. \nTravellers also celebrated the changes. \nPhil White, a British entrepreneur who lives in the US, said the decision would allow him to see his 23-year-old daughter who lives in London for the first time since the pandemic started.\n\"We haven't been able to see our daughter over this time. And that has been very, very, very difficult for us,\" he told AFP news agency.\nHe said he immediately booked a flight for her daughter after the news about the change was confirmed.  \"[A]s a family we're going to be together for Thanksgiving, which is amazing,\" he added.\nThe US has recorded more than 42 million coronavirus cases since the pandemic began, and over 670,000 deaths.\nIn an interview with BBC World News on Monday, White House coronavirus adviser Dr Anthony Fauci urged more Americans to get vaccinated.

      "text": "Kabul is a city still waiting for its new life to take shape - a lot depends on the will and whims of its new Taliban masters. But it is hunger that could become the worst of Afghanistan's many crises.\nFor the poor of the city, the majority, scraping together a few hundred Afghanis, a couple of dollars, to stave off starvation is the biggest challenge.\nMillions live in desperate poverty in a country that has received huge sums in foreign aid. The money left over that might help them, around $9bn in central bank reserves, is frozen by the Americans to keep it away from the Taliban. \nAt dawn, hundreds of construction workers gather in one of Kabul's open-air markets with their tools looking for a day's work. \nBig building projects in the city have stopped. The banks are closed. The foreign money tap has been turned off. What is left amounts to a few drips. \nA handful of the construction workers get picked up for work. The rest are getting angry. One of the men, Hayat Khan, raged about the fortunes stolen by a corrupt elite in the last 20 years. \n\"Wealthy people think about themselves, not the poor. I can't even buy bread. Believe me I cannot find a single dollar and the rest of the rich people put the aid dollars from the West in their pockets. \n\"No-one cares for the poor people. When aid comes from outside, the people in power made sure it went to their relatives, not to the poor.\" \nMohammed Anwar, lucky enough to have an office job, stopped to listen to my interviews with the building workers, and then chipped in, speaking English, accusing the Americans of theft. \n\"In the name of Allah, we call on America to give us the money they have taken from the Afghan government. It must be used to rebuild Afghanistan.\"\nAt that point a Taliban official, a forceful man with a bushy black beard intervened. He told us to leave the area, saying it was dangerous. \nI had not detected any sense of threat, but it was not the time and place to argue. He was shadowed by a Taliban bodyguard wearing wraparound sunglasses, in the US military style, and carrying a US-made assault rifle. \nThe movement's fighters are very visible in the centre of the capital of the republic they have renamed as an Islamic emirate. At the airport they are dressed in American uniforms. \nAcross the city they are more likely to wear much more familiar traditional dress like the shalwar kameez and dusty black turbans. All of them carry assault rifles.\nThe most common lament I heard in Kabul in the last week was about the price of food and the desperation of parents who are struggling to feed their children. Food prices are rocketing. Millions struggle to feed their families. \nThe World Food Programme (WFP) estimates 93% of Afghans are not getting enough food to eat. Before the Taliban seized control last month the number was 80%. \nMarkets have sprung up across the city, as people who had managed to accumulate a few trappings of prosperity in the old Afghanistan sell their possessions to raise a little cash, mostly for food. \nI saw carts arriving carrying the contents of peoples' homes, from valuable carpets or TVs to jumbles of crockery and cutlery. One man was selling a rubber plant. Many were selling and few were buying. There isn't the cash. The sprawling second-hand markets are full of despair. \nThreats to personal freedom, girls' education and the right of women to work have been condemned across the world. But the prospect of going to bed hungry has an urgency all of its own. \nCountries that want to help Afghans but reject the Taliban and all it stands for face a big dilemma. For people to be able to work to earn money, to live and to eat, the Taliban has to run a viable state in Afghanistan. \nBut many in the US, Britain and the other countries that fought the Taliban would find it hard to stomach anything that looked like a success for their old enemies. \nThe alternative might be worse; the prospect of more misery for the people, more refugees, more malnourished children, the risk that Afghanistan will once again become a failed state and a land of opportunity for jihadist extremists.\nA community high above the city carries the scars of 40 years of war. So do the families who live here. War punctuates all their stories. \nOne of the families has had enough. Their flat was almost empty, the possessions sold at the second-hand markets to raise money for them all to leave for Pakistan. \nThe mother, who I'm not going to name, was the only breadwinner, teaching students electrical engineering. They are all male, so the Taliban stopped her working, and also stopped her youngest daughter's education. \nShe was composed and determined, but her voice thickened with sobs when I asked her how hard it was to leave her home.  \n\"I am so sad. My heart has been burning since the day I made the decision to leave. How could I have done it - but what could I do? \n\"If we stay, I don't think they will let us work or allow us education. How can I feed my family? I can tolerate going hungry. But I can't watch my kids starve.\"  \nTheir dreams were always fragile in a state riddled with corruption, which could not survive the departure of its foreign backers. \nAfghanistan's newest crisis is about fundamentals of life - food, security and hope - and the despair and anger when they have gone.

      "text": "Householders in the UK will find out in the next few weeks how much their gas bills are likely to increase in the coming year.\nThe energy regulator is due to announce the new energy price cap - the maximum amount that suppliers can charge in Great Britain.\nIt's expected to rise steeply, because global wholesale prices have gone up so much.\nEvery six months, Ofgem, the energy regulator, reviews the maximum price that suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThis is called the energy price cap. \nAbout 15 million households saw their energy bills increase by 12% when it was last updated in October. \nThe next review is due at the beginning of February, and the new cap will come into effect in April. Industry predictions suggest gas prices could go up by as much as 50%.\nThere is a separate energy market in Northern Ireland, with two gas suppliers, and prices have risen sharply for consumers there too.\nThere's been a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies over the past year.\nAs a result, wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. At the end of December, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about \u00a32,000 next year.\nReasons for the increase include:\nThere are a number of technical and geopolitical issues at play as well, which mean many countries across Europe are grappling with the same problems.\nHowever, the UK is hit relatively hard-hit because it is one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas. Around 85% of homes have gas central heating, and it also generates a third of the country's electricity. \nStorage capacity in the UK is also lower than in some other European countries.\nSince wholesale gas prices started to spike, more than 20 retail energy suppliers have collapsed in the UK. \nThis is largely because the energy price cap prevented retailers from passing on higher wholesale prices to their customers.\nSeveral smaller companies, with fewer reserves, could not weather this.\nFailed firms include Bulb Energy, with 1.7 million customers. Because of its size, it was put into \"special administration\", and is now run by the government, through Ofgem.\nNearly four million customers have been affected. Many households saw their energy prices rise when their supplier went bust, and they were switched over to a more expensive deal with another supplier.\nThe government faces calls from energy companies, the opposition, and even some of its own MPs, to do more to prevent prices from rising too much.\nSuggestions include:\nIn the past, consumers have been encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise.\nBut at the moment better offers - including fixed deals - are simply not available.\nPeople already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, householders are being encouraged to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.\nThe Energy Saving Trust says that simple changes to our homes and habits could offset the current price rises.\nMany companies face a considerable rise in their bills. That could mean they have to: \nEnergy-intensive industries are particularly exposed, but the problem affects every company that has to pay energy bills - even if it is just to heat an office or shop."

      "tags": "Flexible working,UK economy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government is proposing to give all employees the right to request flexible working when they start new jobs, the BBC understands. \nA consultation is to be launched on the proposals this week. \nThe plan would allow all UK employees to request a flexible working arrangement from their first day at a new employer.\nAt the moment, workers have to wait until they have been in their role for six months. \nThe proposals would also see bosses have to respond to requests for flexible working more quickly than the current maximum of three months. It would also force firms to explain why any requests were refused.\nIt is understood that the consultation document will be published on Thursday by the Department for Business.\nIt started examining a range of flexible working options in 2019, including working different or condensed hours, job sharing and remote working.\nJane Hutton, chief executive of the job search website Evenbreak, a social enterprise run by disabled people, said she welcomed the news. \n\"For employers, offering flexible working means they can access so much more talent and that really benefits the business as well.\n\"Before the pandemic there was a huge resistance for people working from home but the reality is they are just as productive if not more so - it's just a pity it took a global pandemic for employers to trust their employees.\"\nExecutive coach and disability equality trainer Mary Doyle said the right to request flexibility would help more employees. \nPreviously she worked for 28 years in technology and working from home was not an option. \nBefore the pandemic, she said that when it became more acceptable to work from home at a corporate level it still wasn't the preferred option.\n\"For it to be right rather than a privilege would have made a huge difference to me earlier in my career,\" she said.\nStephen Warnham, head of content at UK jobs site Totaljobs.com, said the move pointed to \"a growth in a hybrid way of working\", where people are \"trusted to work in the way that best gets the job done\". \n\"If you consider the jobs market as it stands with all its vacancies, businesses listening to the needs and wants of employees is key.\" \nAs part of a survey of 200,000 staff worldwide, published in March this year, Totaljobs found that nine in 10 employees wanted partial flexibility to choose where they work. \n\"From a legislative perspective this is long overdue as a third of employers we speak to are already doing this anyway, so it is a really critical change,\" said Mr Warnham.\nTUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said that flexible working \"should be a right\" to everyone from their first day in the job.\n\"But these proposals won't be the game changer ministers claim, as employers can still turn down any or all requests for flexible working,\" she continued. \n\"The government should change the law so that workers have the legal right to flexible work from day one in the job - not just the right to ask for it.\"\nAnd Angela Rayner MP, Labour's Deputy Leader and Shadow Secretary of State for the Future of Work, said: \"Labour will give workers the right to flexible working - not just the right to request it - and give all workers full rights from day one on the job.\" \nGill McAteer, head of employment law at Citation, said that if an employee contract said the place of work was the office, employees have no legal right to work remotely.\n\"Until this becomes a reality, employees will have to accept their employer's back to work plan or face challenging it through the existing flexible working process,\" she said. \nHowever, Ms McAteer said that while it was \"relatively easy\" for employers to refuse a work from home request before the pandemic, now it is \"more challenging\" as employees can demonstrate they have \"effectively\" carried out their role from home during the crisis.\nThe potential repercussions of employers getting this wrong can be costly, Ms McAteer explained, referring to a recent tribunal decision to award \u00a3185,000 in damages to an estate agent who was denied a flexible working request to leave work earlier to collect her daughter from nursery.

      "text": "The cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills, the boss of the energy regulator Ofgem has told the BBC.\nIt comes as energy firm Green said it was on the brink of collapse due to soaring wholesale gas prices.\n\"As underlying costs rise, pressure on bills does go up\", Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem chief executive said.\nThe government has said it is looking at lending money to bigger firms to help them take on stranded customers.\nIf an energy firm collapses, customers are automatically switched to a tariff provided by the new supplier. This is a tariff agreed with the regulator Ofgem, but it may well be more expensive than the deal they had with the former company which went bust.\nMr Brearley said protecting customers of failed energy firms was the regulator's \"number one priority\".\nHowever, he said it was too early to predict how expensive it would be to ensure that they were transferred to other suppliers in an orderly way.\nPeter McGirr, founder and chief executive of Green, told the BBC it had appointed a restructuring firm in an attempt to survive the current crisis.\nMr McGirr said the firm was in \"deep, deep trouble and our heads are unlikely to bob back to the surface\".\nGreen has 180 staff based in Newcastle upon Tyne and has 250,000 UK customers.\nMr McGirr said the appointment of Alvarez and Marsal was currently on an \"advisory and restructuring\" basis, but admitted Green could fall into administration within weeks.\n\"We need to try to hold on long enough to get some support\", he added.\nThe company has been in discussions with the government and energy regulator Ofgem, but has not been offered any support.\nMr McGirr said he believed the larger energy suppliers had too much influence in the crisis talks being held with government and said the big companies had an interest in more of the smaller suppliers going to the wall.\nAsked whether these costs would be met by the taxpayer, or spread across all energy customers' bills, he said: \"We have to first of all make sure that customers are transferred and looked after and then as we see the market evolve we will understand better the cost implications.\"\nCustomers on some tariffs are protected from sudden hikes in wholesale gas prices through the energy price cap, which limits how much firms can charge per unit of gas.\nThe price cap covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland.\nMr Brearley said it was too early to predict how much the energy price cap would rise next year.\nSo far, four energy firms have gone to the wall, including People's Energy and Utility Point, and four more are expected to follow in the coming days.\nIndustry sources fear there may be as few as 10 energy suppliers left by the end of the year, down from 70 in January.\nBut Mr Brearley predicted that a number of small suppliers would survive the current crisis, as well as larger ones, maintaining a diverse market with plenty of choice for consumers. \nWhen asked if Ofgem was \"asleep at the wheel\" and should have prevented suppliers from making promises to customers which they wouldn't be able to keep if prices rose, Mr Brearley replied: \"No - we have always protected customers interests and we work very closely with the companies.  \n\"We work closely with all companies to assess their financial position. And if they need to exit the market we have well-rehearsed systems and processes to manage that.\" \nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng earlier denied that failed energy companies would get government bailouts, saying: \"I do not think it's the right thing for taxpayers' money to be injected into companies that have been badly run.\"\nHowever, he said the government was exploring the possibility of lending money to bigger energy firms to help them absorb the cost of taking on new customers from companies that had gone bust.\n\"If we do have this policy, they will be expected to pay back the loans,\" he added.\nMr Kwarteng also warned many UK households could face a \"very difficult winter\", with fuel prices surging and the \u00a320-a-week temporary uplift in universal credit due to end in October.  \nThe government and Ofgem have both dismissed suggestions that the cap on energy prices would be lifted ahead of an agreed 12% rise in October, saying that keeping it was the \"clear and agreed position\". \nThe price cap is reviewed twice a year. It applies only to standard variable or default tariffs. These types of tariff are typically the most expensive plan that a supplier offers. \nWhen fixed energy deals expire, as they generally do after one or two years, customers are likely to be put on these tariffs.\nRead more about the next best steps to take here.\nMr Brearley said the industry had seen \"an unprecedented rise in gas prices\".\n\"They are almost four times what they normally are and that would put any industry under strain,\" he added.\nThe government and Ofgem say the UK does not have gas supply problems because of a diverse range of sources \"that can more than meet demand\".\nHowever, energy bills are facing particular pressures in Great Britain because of a dip in renewable energy supplies due to low wind, as well as the outage of a power cable supplying electricity from France.\nThe International Energy Agency has called on Russia to supply more gas to Europe, saying \"it could do more to increase gas availability to Europe and ensure storage is filled to adequate levels\", in preparation for the winter.\nIt added: \"Based on the available information, Russia is fulfilling its long-term contracts with European counterparts - but its exports to Europe are down from their 2019 level.\n\"This is also an opportunity for Russia to underscore its credentials as a reliable supplier to the European market.\"\nStacey Stothard followed all the advice. Aware that energy prices were rising, she shopped around to find a decent fixed deal for her gas and electricity.\nShe saved \u00a3300 - or so she thought. \nHer new energy supplier went bust and now she will be switched automatically to another one, and she is facing much higher bills, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds more a year.\n\"It is just like watching the meter go up and up,\" she says. \"I did the right thing - not going for the cheapest deal, but choosing a company with a decent customer service record.\""

      "tags": "Media,Television,BBC,Tim Davie,Broadcasting",
      "text": "It is harder than ever for the BBC to maintain impartiality amid the \"culture wars\" and a polarisation of online views, its director general has said.\nThe corporation has \"done it pretty well for 99 years\" and still is, Tim Davie has told a committee of MPs.\n\"I just think it's tougher now, by the way,\" he said on Tuesday. \"I think the culture wars are raging, I think we've got a real battle on our hands.\n\"I walk a tightrope every day on this, but we've got to fight for it.\"\nImpartiality is \"sacrosanct\", said Mr Davie, whose headaches over the issue since taking over a year ago have ranged from ruling on whether Newsnight's Emily Maitlis should have shared a tweet from Piers Morgan about the government's response to the pandemic, to whether staff can attend Pride marches.\nThe BBC is \"nothing if it's not a good facilitator of proper open debate and diverse views\", he told the House of Commons media select committee.\n\"I think that's essential to us. It's mission critical. It's us, and it puts you in a very different place to where the rest of the world is heading in my view, which is a dangerous place around partial media.\n\"I and others feel very passionately about this. We're in a battle for this, and I think we need to really be clear that we're not perfect. We've got plenty of work to do to facilitate a space where we can properly debate these issues.\"\nHe said the BBC must hire people from across the political spectrum, even if they know they must leave their personal views at the door.\nThe hearing came after the appointment of former HuffPost UK editor Jess Brammar to a senior role in BBC News, despite a row over old tweets that were critical of Brexit and the government.\nBBC director of news Fran Unsworth announced her resignation shortly before Ms Brammar was appointed executive editor of BBC news channels, but Mr Davie said her decision to leave had \"nothing to do with the latest incident\".\nHe added: \"I just saw a senior hire in [BBC] online going to someone from The Daily Telegraph. We need to hire the best as the BBC and we need to hire across the political spectrum.\"\nReferring to the choice of Ms Brammar, he said: \"That is an incredibly important precedent and this affair is dangerous territory for us, not because of the process, but if people begin doubting our ability to hire people with [political] views into the BBC, and when they get here they leave them at the door.\"\nMr Davie also warned that the corporation was losing stars in a \"red hot\" battle with rivals and streaming services.\n\"We're in an incredibly inflationary market,\" he said. \"And we have lost people. Graham Norton has gone to Virgin Radio, and we've lost people to GB News, to LBC and other places. They're being poached.\"\nHe also referred to Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who signed an exclusive deal with Amazon Prime. Michaela Coel, however, has spoken about rejecting $1m (\u00a3730,000) from Netflix for her acclaimed drama I May Destroy You because the BBC offered her more creative control.\n\"Life is not just about money,\" Mr Davie said. \"It's also about the creative experience you get. It's about making Normal People, it's about making something wonderful in drama or some of the documentaries [and] that ability to actually be on BBC One and have a big audience.\n\"So I wouldn't be too depressed about it. Having said that, I think, over time, there will be increasing pressure on us.\"\nMr Davie was also asked about former BBC correspondent Martin Bashir, who was found to have acted \"deceitfully\" to gain his 1995 interview with Princess Diana.\nThat scandal has also put the spotlight on his other work, including an investigation into the 1986 murders of two girls. Michelle Hadaway, the mother of one of the victims, has said Bashir took her daughter Karen's clothes but did not do the promised DNA testing or return the clothing.\n\"We are extremely sorry for the distress this has caused Ms Hadaway,\" Mr Davie said. \"It's very distressing that we haven't been able to give her answers in terms of what happened to that clothing, and I'm appalled that that got lost. It's a very serious issue.\"\nA new attempt to find them has not yielded results, he said.\n\"With a slightly heavy heart, we're at a point where we are where we are, which is the clothing\u2026 and we have talked directly to Martin Bashir rather than through any agent.\n\"He doesn't know where the clothes are. I didn't speak to him\u2026 but he just doesn't know where the clothes are. Any other evidence coming to us, of course, we will proactively look at.\""

      "tags": "Scottish government,NHS Scotland,Scottish Ambulance Service,Humza Yousaf",
      "text": "Soldiers will be driving Scottish ambulances from this weekend as part of efforts to ease pressure on the service. \nThe Ministry of Defence said it was providing 114 personnel, including drivers and support staff, to carry out non-emergency driving work.\nAn additional 111 personnel will help to run mobile Covid testing units.\nFurther drivers will also be provided by the fire service, the British Red Cross and taxi firms.\nThe military support was announced following a request from the Scottish government.\nIt comes amid warnings from health professionals and opposition politicians of a crisis within the Scottish Ambulance Service in recent weeks, with reports of some patients facing extremely long waits for help to arrive. \nThey include a pensioner who died in Glasgow after having to wait 40 hours for an ambulance, and an 86-year-old woman who had to lie on her kitchen for eight hours after falling and breaking her hip.\nHealth Secretary Humza Yousaf told the Scottish Parliament that cases such as these were unacceptable, and apologised to families who had been let down. \nBut he said the ambulance service and wider NHS were facing unprecedented demand, largely because of Covid but also due to a range other factors including \"exceptionally busy emergency departments\". \nAmbulance crews in Scotland responded to 10,733 life-threatening incidents last month compared to just 5,788 in August 2018.\nWith winter approaching and the NHS preparing for its most challenging time of the year, Mr Yousaf confirmed an additional \u00a320m for the ambulance service to \"help improve response times, alleviate pressures and improve staff wellbeing\".\nHowever, he said the short-term pressures on the service would only be relieved \"through the wider public and voluntary sector standing up and supporting the service at this incredibly challenging time\". \nScottish government officials had been working since last Thursday to finalise a package of support from the military.\nMr Yousaf told parliament on Tuesday afternoon that the government had asked for 88 drivers and 15 support staff - a total of 103 military personnel. \nHowever, a short time later the MoD confirmed that it would provide provide 114 drivers and support staff, as well as the 111 personnel who will help run mobile testing units. \nIt said they would be deployed from 25 September and were expected to perform their role for a couple of months - primarily in the central belt. \nScottish Secretary Alister Jack said: \"Our fantastic British Armed Forces have played a key role in the fight against Covid-19 across the UK and it is admirable to see them once supporting crucial public services in Scotland in times of need. \n\"The dedication and professionalism of the 225 personnel being deployed will be invaluable for the Scottish Ambulance Service and Covid Mobile Testing Units. We are grateful for all their efforts to keep us safe.\"\nSpeaking ahead of the MoD announcement, Mr Yousaf said: \"My thanks to the army, as always, for their responsiveness. \n\"We have also reached out to the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, and I'm glad to say in typical fashion they have risen to a call. \n\"We have also brought support in from the British Red Cross as well as private contractors such as taxi companies to help with some of the ambulance service's work where no emergency ambulance is required.\"\nHe stressed that anyone in critical or life-threatening need would be taken to hospital in an ambulance if one is requested. \nThe health secretary also announced a range of other measures including: \nMr Yousaf had earlier been told off by the parliament's presiding officer after he revealed details of his plan to the Daily Record newspaper before formally announcing it in the Holyrood chamber.\nOpposition leaders were critical of the government's approach, saying action to ease pressure on the ambulance service should have been taken much sooner.\nScottish Conservative health spokesman Sandesh Gulhane accused the government of using the pandemic as an excuse for long-standing issues.\nAnd Labour's Jackie Baillie said accident and emergency waiting times were at an all-time high despite the best efforts of NHS staff.\nShe highlighted comments by John Thomson of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, who has told BBC Scotland that the NHS needs an additional 1,000 hospital beds to cope with the current crisis.\nOver 550 people waited more than 12 hours in an emergency department in the second week of September, a record high. Until this summer, the previous weekly high was in the depths of winter 2018, when the peak number waiting more than 12 hours was 463.\nMuch of the pressure comes from a scarcity of beds in other parts of the hospital, to allow people to continue their treatment away from A&E. If there is no room elsewhere, people have to sit on trollies, in cubicles, or in ambulances which cannot then be dispatched elsewhere.\nThere are numerous reasons why the NHS is under siege and Covid is only part of the picture. There are challenges in the community getting people out of hospital, and sometimes wards are closed to new admissions because of staff sickness or isolation.\nStaff report dealing with patients presenting with more advanced illnesses, who need to stay in hospital longer.\nMany of the problems the NHS is facing existed before the pandemic. Demand is ever-growing and being met with long-term staff vacancies and a reduction in hospital beds.\nHelp from the army and additional funds will be welcomed, but they won't solve the problem overnight. \nAccording to the latest figures from Public Health Scotland, there were 27,354 attendances at A&E services in Scotland in the week ending 12 September.\nOf these, 71.5% were seen and either admitted, discharged or transferred elsewhere within four hours - the lowest total for a number of years, and well below the target level of 95%.\nA total of 1,895 patients spent more than eight hours in an A&E department, while 551 of them were there for more than 12 hours.\nMr Yousaf said the government was having \"urgent\" discussions with local authorities and care providers about how to free up bed capacity, saying he would not dismiss the idea of field hospitals entirely.\nHe added: \"I have spoken to every health board and mentioned that the equipment we had for the Louisa Jordan is available for them to use. \n\"But it's not just a case of simply setting up beds, we have to have staff as well - we would have to pull the workforce out of extremely busy hospitals.\""

      "tags": "HM Treasury,Coronavirus lockdown measures,UK economy,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Government borrowing was higher than expected in August as debt interest payments rose due to higher inflation.\nBorrowing, which is the difference between tax income and spending, was \u00a320.5bn, official figures show - \u00a35.5bn lower than in August last year.\nHowever, it was still the second-highest figure for August since records began.\nEconomists had expected government borrowing to be about \u00a315bn.\nBorrowing has been at record levels, with billions being spent by the government on measures such as the furlough scheme to support the economy.\nThis high spending, combined with less money coming into the exchequer due to the pandemic and a fall in economic output, has pushed government debt up to more than \u00a32.2 trillion, or about 97.6% of GDP - a level not seen since the early 1960s.\nThe interest payments on government debt were \u00a36.3bn in August. That was \u00a32.9bn more than in August 2020, but lower than the monthly record of \u00a38.7bn in June 2021.\nDanni Hewson, a financial analyst at AJ Bell, said: \"Inflation is not just something that's making us wince when we get to the supermarket checkout, it's also taking its toll on the public purse.  \n\"Interest payments on all that debt shot up in August and September will be even more painful\".\nThe government borrowed a total of \u00a3325.1bn in the financial year to March, which amounts to 15.5% of GDP, the highest percentage since the end of World War Two.\nThe figure was an increase of \u00a327.1bn compared with the previous Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimate, which was largely due to the expected cost of \u00a320.9bn on guarantees on loans to firms that will not be able to pay back.\nIsabel Stockton, research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, noted that this estimate suggested that non-repayments would total just over a quarter of the \u00a380bn loaned out.\n\"This is a big number, but not as big as feared by the Office for Budget Responsibility whose Budget 2021 estimate was that \u00a327bn would not be recouped,\" she said.\nMs Stockton added that for the public spending figures, the precise size of last year's spike in borrowing \"is not all that important\".\n\"What matters more are the strength of the eventual recovery, whether current strength in tax receipts persists into future years and whether the large income tax, corporation tax, and National Insurance tax rises announced since March are actually implemented as planned.\"\nWhile borrowing this year is coming into land better than the gloomy forecasts of the OBR, in August it was still higher than expected, and the second highest on record.\nIt was the direct impact of rising inflation on borrowing costs that drove the figures.\nWhile the chancellor is still heading for some extra room for manoeuvre ahead of next month's Budget and Spending Review, there is also some room for reflection in the revision to last year's borrowing numbers.\nThe post war record for borrowing last year was revised up substantially to \u00a3325bn, driven by more than \u00a320bnn in expected losses on government-backed Covid contingency loans.\nThis is a significant sum, about a quarter of such loans, reflecting the hidden extent of corporate distress. Though this figure is lower than some original estimates of write-offs.\nThe ongoing economic recovery will also help ensure this figure does not rise further.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak is due to deliver a new Budget and growth forecasts on 27 October, as well as new multi-year spending limits for individual government departments.\nRuth Gregory, senior UK economist for Capital Economics, said: \"With the chancellor intent on signalling in his Budget on 27 October that the fiscal stimulus seen since the pandemic is now firmly at an end, the big fiscal boost to the economy last year will soon become a fiscal drag.\"\nShe said that while tax revenues of \u00a361.2bn were higher that last August's \u00a355.8bn, government spending was \"elevated\" in August, including \u00a31.1bn on the furlough scheme as well as \u00a32.1bn on the self-employment income support scheme.\nHowever, she added that the figures showed that \"the government's financial position isn't as bad as the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted back in March\"."

      "text": "Images which appear to show border agents on horseback driving migrants back to a river have sparked an investigation in the US.\nThe pictures widely shared on social media show riders allegedly using their reins against migrants and pushing them back towards the Rio Grande in Texas. \nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas says his department will investigate reports of alleged abuse.  \nHe said the officers were trying to manage the migrants crossing the river.\nSome 13,000 mainly Haitian migrants have gathered in a makeshift camp under a bridge connecting Del Rio to Mexico's Ciudad Acu\u00f1a on the US-Mexico border.\nWhite House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the footage was horrible to watch. \n\"I have seen some of the footage. I don't have the full context. I can't imagine what context would make that appropriate. But I don't have additional details and certainly I don't think anyone seeing that footage would think it was acceptable or appropriate.\"\nSome social media users said the pictures were reminiscent of the violence seen in slavery times in the US. \nThe pictures taken by AFP photographer Paul Ratje show Haitians going back and forth across the border to get food for their families, and finding themselves blocked by the horses.\n\"Some of the migrants started running to try to get around the horsemen, and one of the agents grabbed the Haitian in the picture by the shirt and he ended up swinging him around while the horse trotted in a circle,\" he said of a couple of particular photographs.\nRatje says he does not think the man was hurt; shortly after that, he said they \"kind of calmed down, and they started letting people in\".\nUS Border Patrol chief Raul Ortiz said the incident was being investigated to make sure there was not an \"unacceptable\" response by his officers, adding they operated in a difficult environment, trying to distinguish migrants from smugglers.\nThe UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, has said it is monitoring US expulsions to Haiti, adding it was imperative that people fearing persecution had access to asylum, Reuters news agency reports. \nThe US government has reported a surge of migrants arriving at the border with Mexico this year.\nThe number of people detained there in July exceeded 200,000 for the first time in 21 years, according to government data."

      "tags": "NHS Wales,NHS,Intensive care,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The pressure on intensive care staff is as high as it has been since the pandemic began, a leading consultant has said.\nDr Michael Martin, of Hywel Dda University Health Board, said patients with other conditions on top of Covid patients is making the situation worse.\nTen of about 24 critical care beds in its hospitals were occupied by Covid patients on Monday.\nStaff shortages have made him dread the winter months, the doctor said.\nCovid cases in the Hywel Dda area, which covers Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire, have been rising with planned surgery suspended in some hospitals due to Covid pressures.\nDr Martin said west Wales' infection rates compared to the rest of Wales were \"much lower\" in the first two waves.\n\"Now it's probably more than what we had throughout the period when it was difficult in the first two waves, especially for Glangwili hospital as we've tried to centralise things a bit more,\" he said, adding staff are \"burnt out\".\n\"Here, in Glangwili hospital, the emergency hospital for west Wales, it's a difficult scenario because we basically lose more than half of our intensive care beds.\nHe said Covid patients means \"a lot of work for everybody - they're difficult\", adding: \"You don't just cure them in a couple of days\".\nThe health board said about half of its 12 Covid-positive patients are vaccinated.\nWhile those that have been jabbed are seeing better treatment success rates, Dr Martin said he remains concerned about the number of patients coming into hospital already seriously ill with other conditions.\nThere are fears of a pent-up demand from people either reluctant to get help due to the pandemic or those who might have had difficulties being seen due to growing delays and waiting times.\nHe said cancer diagnoses are happening later, at end stage, when the patient is very unwell in intensive care. \n\"It never used to happen that way,\" he said.\nHe added that intensive care medicine is \"good at reversing acute things\" but \"patients are getting worse and worse because nobody has looked into them because the heath service has been busy [dealing with the virus]\".\nDr Martin thinks that despite a high take up of vaccinations, the pressure on his hospitals is likely to remain high throughout the winter.\nHe questioned how people will deal with Covid if it \"restarts\" in the winter \"because of all the patients we're seeing that the health service has not been able to deal with\".\n\"For me, personally, that is more emotionally difficult to deal with at the moment.\"\nNicky Hughes, associate director of the Royal College of Nursing in Wales, said some of her members were at \"breaking point\".\n\"Our nurses are telling us they are exhausted, they haven't had the chance to get over any of the last 18 months, they haven't had a let-up, every time they think there is a let-up, they are asked to do more and more,\" she told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\n\"We talk about resilience but how can you be resilient for two years at this level? It's just not going to work. \n\"Health boards need to make a decision on what services are priority and they need to priorities the safety of their staff,\" she said.\nDr Olwen Williams, who is vice president for Wales at the Royal College of Physicians, said Covid had exposed the lack of adequate staffing before the pandemic hit, and a mounting backlog of treatment and care.\n\"Health boards are being asked not only to upgrade their ability to reduce the backlog, but also try and tackle the rising cases of Covid, and keeping the two streams of work separate,\" she said.\n\"We really need some compassionate leadership here to ensure there is value for the NHS workforce, that they are getting the rest they need to face what could be an incredibly difficult winter, especially if we have a flu pandemic.\"\nOn the front line, for Dr Martin one of the biggest challenges he faces is having to deal with staff shortages. \nHe said burnt-out senior staff are choosing to leave intensive care for a \"better work-life balance\", causing him constant difficulty trying to fill rotas. \n\"After two Covid waves, a lot of doctors and nurses are trying to get out of intensive care. They simply don't want to do it anymore, they're burnt out, it's been emotionally draining.\"\nHe said very junior nursing staff are on ITU because of shortages and trying to convince junior doctors who are overworked to come in for extra shifts is \"more difficult than the clinical work\".\n\"At the moment, that is one of the most difficult aspects of the work.\" "

      "text": "Northern Ireland's health service is \"about to topple over\" if immediate action is not taken, the deputy first minister has said.\nMichelle O'Neill said staff were \"facing into a very difficult winter\" under current pressures.\nShe met staff at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast on Tuesday along with First Minister Paul Givan.\nThey both said they wanted to avoid any further lockdowns or \"circuit breakers\".\nSinn F\u00e9in vice-president Ms O'Neill said the healthcare system was facing increased staff absences with workers feeling \"burnt out\".\n\"They're begging for our support. They are physically and mentally exhausted,\" she said.\nMr Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said the Northern Ireland Executive would take a \"measured approach\" when ministers meet on Thursday to discuss future Covid-19 plans.\nHe said ministers would take into consideration the current transmission rates and hospitalisation.\nHe said politicians needed to be honest with people \"about the realities in what we're facing\".\nHe added that he was concerned about other issues linked to lockdowns, saying: \"People are presenting with severe mental health issues as a result of the lockdown and delayed treatments and some couldn't access services.\"\nMr Givan said healthcare staff were working \"more hours than they've worked before\" and there was \"a need for us all to take the personal responsibility very seriously, whether that's through regulation or through guidance\".\nMs O'Neill said she \"would not rule out anything\" and would \"keep everything on the table - it's the prudent and honest way to proceed\".\n\"We need a very cautious approach in the time ahead.\"\nShe added that Health Minister Robin Swann would bring forward a winter surge plan for the health service in due course and that further details for how the executive would respond to winter pressures should be announced on Thursday afternoon.\nFrom the 11 of November, anyone working or volunteering in a care home in England will need to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus, unless they are exempt. \nThere is also a consultation on whether it should be made mandatory for all frontline workers in health and care settings.\nVisiting professor of public health at Bristol University, Gabriel Scally, said while he did not like the thought of compulsory vaccinations there was a \"particular duty of care\" in health care settings.\n\"People in hospitals or care homes are already ill and the burden of infectious disease really can be avoided largely by vaccination so I think I am in favour of it,\" he told BBC News NI's Talkback programme.\nBut professor of social policy at Ulster University, Deirdre Heenan, told the programme she was opposed to vaccines becoming compulsory for health and social care staff in Northern Ireland.\n\"We have to take account of the needs of health care workers and it's important to see both sides,\" she told Talkback.\n\"When we are talking about social care workers I'm not comfortable with forcing people to have vaccinations, in fact scapegoating the lowest paid part of the social care workforce, often young women who have real issue about vaccination,\" she said.\n\"I would rather we have a programme of talking to people and understanding why people are vaccine hesitant.\"\nFive more deaths and 1,020 cases of coronavirus were reported on Northern Ireland on Monday.\nThere were 379 patients with Covid-19 in hospitals on Monday, compared to 419 on Friday.\nThere were 33 patients with Covid-19 in hospital intensive care units on Monday, down from 38 on Friday."

      "tags": "Canada election 2021,Justin Trudeau,Canada",
      "text": "Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party has narrowly won Canada's election, but it failed to secure a majority of seats.\nThis is Mr Trudeau's third federal election win, but his critics say the poll was a waste of time.\nThe Liberals are projected to win 158 seats, short of the 170 seats needed for the majority Mr Trudeau was seeking with his early election call. \nThe Conservatives have held onto their main opposition status and are expected to win about 122 seats. \n\"There are still votes to be counted but what we've seen tonight is millions of Canadians have chosen a progressive plan,\" Mr Trudeau told supporters in Montreal in the early hours of Tuesday morning. \n\"You elected a government that will fight for you and deliver for you,\" he said. \nThe election, which took place during a fourth pandemic wave in Canada, was the most expensive in the country's history, costing some C$600m ($470m; \u00a3344m). \nThe projected results suggest a parliament strikingly similar to the one elected just two years ago in 2019. \nThe snap election call, sending Canadians to the polls for the second time in two years, was widely seen as a bid by Mr Trudeau to secure a majority government and he struggled to explain why a campaign was necessary. Conservative leader Erin O'Toole suggested it was a waste of time and money. \n\"Canadians sent him back with another minority at a cost of $600m and deeper divisions in our great country\", he told reporters. \nMr Trudeau maintained that the election gave the incoming government a clear mandate in moving forward. \nBut over the course of the campaign, he struggled to convince voters of the need for an election, which also coincided with rising Covid-19 case loads due to the Delta variant. \nSeparately he was also heckled by anti-vaccine protesters on the campaign trail, with some shouting they would refuse the Covid jab.\nWhile questions will inevitably be raised about Mr Trudeau's political future, Liberal MP Pablo Rodriguez told journalists early in the evening that no matter the outcome, he had  \"100% confidence\" in him as Liberal Party leader.\n\"And all the members of the party do as well,\" he said. \nThe country's left-wing New Democrats (NDP), which ran on a \"tax the ultra-rich\" message with leader Jagmeet Singh trying to tap into progressive voters frustrated with the Liberals, looks to have picked up a small number of seats.\nVote counts will continue to trickle in over the coming days as elections officials tally the roughly one million mail-in ballots cast this election, and current seat tallies are still to be finalised.\nFor the Conservatives, the result is a disappointment for new party leader Erin O'Toole, who ran on a centrist message in a bid to expand the party's base of support. \nLike in 2019, the party is projected to have won the popular vote. But the first-past-the-post system - awarding victory to the candidate with most votes in any given constituency - means that has not translated to seats won.\nSpeaking to party faithful in Oshawa, Ontario, a defiant Mr O'Toole pitched his vision for a bigger Conservative tent, saying: \"Our party needed the courage to change because Canada has changed.\" \nHe urged supporters not to waiver from the commitment to grow the party's base, acknowledging that \"clearly there is more work for us to do\" in setting the stage for a better showing in the next campaign.\nConservative strategist Jason Lietaer told journalists at party headquarters that there's reason to keep  Mr O'Toole on as leader despite his failure to secure them a victory.  \n\"He's gone from unknown to contender in just a few weeks,\" Mr Lietaer said. \"O'Toole was a huge underdog. To be within a few points is something we're all proud of.\"\nWhile minority governments are common in Canada, coalitions are extremely rare and Mr Trudeau will need to compromise with opposition parties to pass legislation. \nThe NDP are likely to be kingmakers in this new parliament, and could help the Liberals to survive key confidence votes and get their policies through.\nMr Singh, the NDP leader, speaking in Burnaby, British Columbia, noted he had secured concessions from Mr Trudeau in the last parliament. \nHe said he had a laundry list of priorities this time around, and vowed to push for action on climate change, affordable housing, and healthcare. \n\"You can be sure if we work together we can build a better society,\" he said.  \nThe night saw setbacks for both the Green Party and the People's Party of Canada (PPC). \nNew Green leader Annamie Paul was badly defeated in her efforts to secure a seat in Toronto, after she struggled with internal party divisions that threatened her leadership. \n\"I am disappointed - it is hard to lose, no one likes to lose,\" Ms Paul said as she thanked supporters. \nStill, the party is still projected to send at least two members of parliament to Ottawa.  \nThe PPC failed to secure any seats despite a late surge as its populist leader tapped into a vein of anger among some Canadians over vaccine mandates and lockdown measures, but did increase its overall vote share."

      "text": "UK nationals and former interpreters stranded after British forces pulled out of Afghanistan have told the BBC they feel abandoned. Now hundreds are fearing for their safety following a UK government data breach. \nAhmad, not his real name, is in hiding in Afghanistan. He is one of more than 250 Afghan interpreters and local staff whose names and some profile pictures were mistakenly shared in a Ministry of Defence data breach.\nHe is eligible for relocation under the UK government's Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (Arap) but he is still in the country. \nWhen Ahmad received the MoD email he says he initially \"felt good\". \"I thought, they're still chasing our cases.\"\nThen he realised the error. The email addresses and names of all the recipients could be seen by everyone on the email. Many of those who got the email, like Ahmad, remain in hiding, fearful their lives could be in danger. \nThe government has apologised to those affected and an investigation has been launched. But Ahmad says the error could put him in danger.\n\"I'm sure that it will have a negative impact on our safety\", he says. \"We are already displaced from our home town.\"\nAhmad was shot by the Taliban while on patrol as an interpreter with British troops in Helmand, in 2011. \nBefore the airport in Kabul closed last month, officials told him to take his family there to be evacuated. But the crush to get on flights was too much for his baby daughter. \nLeft behind in Kabul, he now lives apart from his wife and child to try to keep them from danger. \"I feel betrayed and we feel left behind,\" he says. \"We were the people deserving to be relocated.\"\n\"I am living from place-to-place, going door-to-door. It is very difficult for me financially and from the security perspective - and also mentally.\"\n\"Just when you think it can't get worse than this, along comes [the email],\" he told the BBC.\nSince mid-August, when the Afghan government fell, the UK says more than 15,000 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan. \nThe BBC understands this includes more than 8,000 UK nationals, while a few hundred more have made it out under their own steam. Two flights out of Kabul to Doha in the past week have carried a further 26 British nationals and four Afghan spouses. \nOfficials will not say how many British citizens have still to make it out of the country but chat among the community left behind in Afghanistan gives a sense of the scale of the problem facing Liz Truss, the UK's new foreign secretary.\n\"There are loads of people waiting,\" says Ziad, who travelled from Newport to Afghanistan in July to visit his sick mother. His name has been changed to protect his identity. \n\"My cousin is also a British citizen, he's also waiting. Lots of my school mates are here as well. My driving instructor, he's stuck here as well. So imagine how many more would be here.\"\nThe government says it has advised against travel to Afghanistan for many years. But those who did make the trip and are now stuck feel abandoned.\n\"They are not serious about their citizens,\" Ziad says. \"Until now, I did not receive any help.\" He is not alone. \nEarlier this month, BBC News reported on a seven-month-old baby left behind in Afghanistan because of a delay in processing her passport.\nThree weeks later, her family in London say they are still waiting for news about what can be done to help them. \nZahra, not her real name, told the BBC about her fears for her family in Afghanistan whose details she had registered with the UK government for assistance. She says they still have not had any good news. Her family is now making plans to travel to a third country.\nSayyid, also not his real name, said he was worried about his brother who had previously worked for a British charity in Afghanistan because he had been threatened by the Taliban.\nThis week he updated the BBC to say that his brother remained in hiding.\nMujeeb Ashraf, a former interpreter for UK forces, might appear to be one of the lucky ones.\nAfter getting confirmation he was eligible for relocation under Arap, he managed to get himself on a commercial flight out of Kabul before the airport closed. He took the flight rather than wait for the UK to evacuate him. \nNow in Dubai, Mujeeb has sent repeated pleas to officials about what to do next but says he has so far not had any information about relocation to the UK.\n\"It seems they have no plan for third countries,\" he says. \"Every day I'm checking my email to have some good news from the UK government. I don't know what to do next and I have no idea where to go.\" \nWith only handouts from voluntary groups to get by, and having to pay around \u00a3300 a month in rent to share a small house with 21 people, Mujeeb fears for what will happen after his visa expires. \nHe pleaded with the UK government to \"help those people who helped you in your operations\".\nThe BBC asked the government how it intended to help evacuate people like Mujeeb who are stranded in third countries.\nA spokesperson said they could not comment on individual cases but work was under way to support the logistics of relocation of those accepted as eligible who are already in third countries. \nWhere possible, the government would contact those identified for relocation who are not yet in the UK, the spokesperson added.\nA government spokesperson said: \"The UK's evacuation operation helped over 15,000 people to safety including British nationals, Afghan interpreters, and other vulnerable people.\n\"Whilst the success of that operation exceeded our assumptions, we know that there are many left in difficult circumstances.\"\nThe spokesperson said the government's \"utmost priority is to continue to work with allies and partners in the region to ensure safe passage for those who want to leave Afghanistan\".  \nAdditional reporting by Chris Bell \nAre you a UK national in Afghanistan or eligible for relocation to the UK and unable to leave?

      "text": "The first time that Sally Thompson became pregnant, she says the circumstances were not ideal.\nShe had not been with her partner, Paul, for long and they were both living at home with their parents. \nDespite that, when the pregnancy ended in miscarriage at nine weeks, she felt a sense of sadness.\n\"It doesn't take long to get attached,\" she says.\n\"As soon as you kind of see the two lines or 'pregnant' on the test, you don't think of a ball of cells, you think of the baby that's going to come in nine months. \n\"That's what you think about and it is sad when it happens.\"\nShe says it was a confusing time, adding: \"It was lonely, because I didn't know anyone who had been through it. It was isolating because I didn't really know who to go to, to talk about it.\"\nSally is now 32 - she and Paul got married in 2017. She has been pregnant nine more times, but none of the pregnancies have gone to term.\nAfter each miscarriage, Sally took sick leave, as women who lose a baby before 24 weeks are entitled to do. \nWhile some of her employers were sympathetic, one was not and dismissed her following a lengthier absence.\n\"I have had kind of polar opposite experiences,\" she says.\n\"At that employer, miscarriage was not understood at all. It felt like they didn't care that I was coming to work and crying for 20 minutes before I even entered the building.\n\"My current employer is the complete opposite. I've had a miscarriage there and they could not have been kinder.\"\nSNP MP Angela Crawley is calling on the government to give women and their partners the legal right to take three days paid leave, if a pregnancy ends before 24 weeks.\nShe introduced a private members' bill to Parliament in June, and it is due to have its first full debate in December. \nShe says: \"I've received tonnes and tonnes of correspondence on this issue from fathers, from mothers and from families who have experienced miscarriage. \n\"They have outlined that, in most cases, there was a degree of stigma or shame to experiencing a miscarriage.\"\nMany mothers took unpaid leave or sick leave, she adds, and many fathers took unpaid time off because \"they didn't feel they could approach their employer and ask for paid leave\". \nThe government introduced paid parental leave for the loss of a baby after 24 weeks in April 2020.\nIt entitles a parent to two weeks' leave paid at \u00a3151.97 a week, or 90% of their average weekly earnings, whichever is lower. \nA government spokesperson told the BBC the entitlement to this pay \"is a floor not a ceiling, and we urge employers to show compassion and flexibility towards women who have suffered a miscarriage, and to respond sensitively to each individual's specific needs\".\nSpeaking in the Commons in July this year, Boris Johnson appeared to suggest he would not be in favour of extending parental leave to those who suffered the loss of a baby earlier in the pregnancy.\nHe said it entitled those who lost a child after 24 weeks of pregnancy to some payment. \nHe added: \"But of course, nothing I can say and no payment we could make would be any consolation to those who experience a miscarriage in that way.\"\nMr Johnson's wife, Carrie, announced on social media in August that the couple had experienced a miscarriage earlier in 2021.\nA policy of statutory paid leave would come at a cost.\nSome employers have already decided to introduce paid leave themselves.\nThe retailer John Lewis will offer two weeks' paid leave from November to staff who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy.\nNikki Humphrey, the company's executive director for people, says the business has weighed the cost and benefits.\n\"We know anyway that when someone experiences a loss of pregnancy they typically take time off for sick leave and so actually the bigger factor was about how do we provide the right support,\" she says. \n\"We clearly had to consider the financial aspect but importantly it was their whole wellbeing we considered.\"\nSally says she believes paid leave would have helped.\n\"For my early losses that may have been all the time that I would need.\n\"I think a lot of people, men included, would find that useful because it would give men time to be there with their partners who are going through a difficult experience.\"\nRhiannan, from Cheshire, has two sons, aged three and five.\nShe spoke to BBC 5 Live Breakfast's Nicky Campbell about her experience of many years of infertility, IVF and miscarriages.\n\"One of our miscarriages was triplets through IVF,\" she told him. \"They all reached a point just before 12 weeks and their hearts stopped.\"\nRhiannan said there needs to be \"a lot more sensitivity\" around the issue.\n\"It can affect everybody in very different ways, both mentally and physically,\" she added. \"It took my body the full nine months to get over the triplet loss.\n\"It can also sometimes make you a bit numb - you do physically shut yourself off from a lot of feelings to cope with it\".\nRhiannan said she would welcome Angela Crawley's proposed changes.\n\"Three days isn't necessarily enough but it's a good start and it definitely opens up the doors to it being more normal,\" she said.\nNick, in Guildford, told BBC Radio 5 Live his wife had a miscarriage on a Saturday in December, at the start of the second lockdown. \nHe then returned to work the following Monday.\n\"I went back to work a couple of days afterwards, but there was no way my wife could have,\" he said.\n\"You have to be there because they're the person going through it. You've got to get them out the other side, but you lose your baby at the same time.\n\"You have to somehow pull yourself together at the same time as you hold the person up as best you can.\"\nNick's manager was supportive and the company has subsequently brought in one-week of paid leave for early miscarriage.\n\"I had a good relationship with my manager at the time [so] I was able to tell her and she was able to help support me in that time,\" he said."

Here is excellence in Essex.\"\nThe gallery beat four other venues to the prestigious prize - Experience Barnsley, The Thackray Museum of Medicine in Leeds, Timespan in Helmsdale in the Scottish Highlands, and the Centre for Contemporary Art Derry-Londonderry. They each won \u00a315,000 for making the final.\nFirstsite's recent exhibitions include a summer show called Welcome to Essex by Michael Landy, while the lockdown art packs were put together by 50 artists including Mark Wallinger and downloaded by almost 100,000 people.\nShaw has previously said her art space is \"relentlessly inventive\".\n\"Everything should be constantly changing - it's an art gallery,\" she said. \"There's no rules. That goes from how we run our restaurant to the things that are in our shop to the difference we can make in a town like Colchester. It should be extraordinarily creative.\"\nSpeaking about the 8,500 free school meals they plated up, Shaw said that while \"it was bizarre for an art gallery to be doing that and part of me is really depressed by that... part of me is excited... because the people we meet now, many have never been to a gallery before\".\nFirstsite also showcased The Great Big Art Exhibition, which encouraged people to put their own art in their windows during lockdown; and Art for Life, an exhibition of work by frontline NHS workers.\nIn response to Black Lives Matter, the gallery commissioned Essex artist Elsa James to make a downloadable work titled We Stand With You. It also worked with clients of Refugee Action Colchester for a collection titled My Name Is Not Refugee.\nLast year, the Art Fund shared the prize money equally between five museums due to the challenges faced by the pandemic.\nThe Art Fund is the national fundraising charity for art, and provides millions of pounds every year to help museums to acquire and share works of art across the UK."

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has urged venues to use \"common sense\" when checking vaccine passports, as she set out details of where and when they will be required.\nMajor events and venues such as nightclubs will be expected to ensure that everyone present has had two doses of vaccine from the start of October.\nHowever spot-checks will be allowed at larger events, with organisers expected to do a \"reasonable number\" of checks.\nThe first minister said the scheme will help reduce transmission of the virus.\nAnd she said it could encourage uptake of vaccines and help keep venues like nightclubs open for business.\nSome business leaders voiced concerns that the scheme \"goes well beyond what was initially proposed\" and could impact on hotels, pubs and other hospitality venues.\nMs Sturgeon told MSPs that Covid-19 cases had fallen in Scotland in recent weeks, but warned that \"the position remains fragile\" with the NHS under \"sustained pressure\".\nThe government's vaccine certification scheme will come into force at 05:00 on 1 October, with people over the age of 18 required to show they have had both doses of vaccine before they will be allowed entry to:\nCertificates will be displayed via an app, which will be available for download from 30 September, while venue staff will either scan this using another app or visually check the QR code shown,\nThe government has drawn up a working definition of a \"nightclub\" as being a venue which is open between midnight and 05:00, serving alcohol, and which has a designated area for dancing and provides live or recorded music for this purpose.\nMs Sturgeon said detailed guidance would be published, but said venues should use \"common sense\" over the scheme.\nShe said a venue which has a dancefloor would not have to check people coming in for a pub lunch in the afternoon, but said \"it would be reasonable\" to check customers who arrive later in the evening.\nThe first minister added: \"A pragmatic approach will be encouraged, so that businesses can make sensible judgements.\"\nWhile clubs and smaller events will be expected to inspect the certificates of all customers, the organisers of larger events will have to carry out a \"reasonable number\" of checks.\nAberdeen nightclub owner and spokesman for the Night Time Industries Association Scotland, Gavin Stevenson, told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme the definition was still confusing.\n\"It is not a definition of just nightclubs because it includes about 2,000 pubs and bars across Scotland in addition to the 100 nightclubs that are actual nightclubs.\n\"It would be fair to say that it has not in any way been communicated well by the Scottish government with only nine days to go until this policy is implemented.\"\nHe added: \"Typically pubs would have opening hours up until about 01:00 and most of them would have some form of entertainment on at the weekends. This will also apply to lots of city centre circuit bars and to hotel function rooms with parties or events going on in them.\n\"These venues will now have to take on door staff to control entry when they would previously have had no requirement to do so under their existing licences. There is a critical shortage of door staff and it won't be possible to implement this by 1 October so we have raised our concerns with government on that basis that this is a fundamentally unworkable plan.\"\nFootball chiefs had said spot-checks would be \"the only practical reality\" when dealing with matches involving tens of thousands of fans, warning of lengthy queues and potential for disorder if every attendee was checked.\nMs Sturgeon said there had been talks with football clubs and licensed trade organisations, saying their feedback had been \"very helpful\".\nThe Scottish Chambers of Commerce was critical of the plans, with chief executive Liz Cameron claiming \"thousands\" of businesses would be caught up in the scheme.\nShe said: \"We have made it clear that the practical application of what is being asked is not workable in the timelines being proposed.\n\"Scotland's economy remains fragile, and many businesses remain in survival mode - there is no doubt that vaccine certifications will serve as an economic detriment.\"\nOpposition parties at Holyrood - which all voted against the plans but saw them approved by MSPs from the SNP-Green administration - also called for greater clarity about the plans.\nScottish Conservative health spokesman Sandesh Gulhane said: \"The SNP government vaccine passport scheme comes into force next week, and the first minister is still finalising guidance and businesses are worried about the impact it will have on them.\n\"Despite promises of a reset, it is clear that jobs and businesses are still not the priority of this government.\"\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said detail had been provided \"at long last\", but the government was still falling short.\nHe said: \"There are still big gaps in the detail, still limited engagement with businesses affected, and limited evidence published of the difference it will make.\"\nMr Sarwar added that it was \"at best disingenuous\" to suggest the scheme is the same as one being set up in Wales, where people will have to provide either proof of vaccination or a recent negative test.\nMs Sturgeon said the problem with the Welsh scheme was that it relied on self-reporting of test results, which she said was \"not the best approach\" and would not drive up the uptake rates of vaccines."

      "text": "Police are continuing to question a man over the deaths of three children and a mother at a house in Derbyshire. \nThe community of Killamarsh has rallied round after the bodies were found in Chandos Crescent on Sunday morning.\nFresh flowers have been placed near the house and a fundraiser for the families has raised more than \u00a316,000.\nA 31-year-old man, who was known to the family, was arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody, said Derbyshire Police.\nThe force also revealed the man was taken to hospital with self-inflicted minor injuries after being arrested at the property.\nOfficers were called to the house at 07:26 BST on Sunday after concerns were raised about the safety of a man. \nTerri Harris, 35, and her two children Lacey, 11, and John Paul, 13, were found dead alongside Connie Gent, also 11. \nIt is believed Connie, from Sheffield, was Lacey's friend and was visiting for a sleepover.\nThe grandmother of John Paul and Lacey has thanked everyone who has paid tribute to them and laid flowers.\nDiane Bennett who visited the scene again on Tuesday said: \"There are so many people bringing flowers, teddy bears.\n\"At the moment it's my son I'm worried about. I know we've lost somebody but he's lost even more.\n\"I just wish we could have done more. It's horrible.\"\nOutwood Academy City, where the three children studied, said their memories would \"live on forever\".\nIn a statement, the Sheffield school said: \"The children had bright futures ahead of them but sadly none of us will get to see this.\n\"Lacey and Connie had just embarked on their secondary school journey with us and already made a positive impression on everyone they came into contact with. \n\"John Paul was a popular and polite young man, well-liked by staff and with a close-knit group of friends.\"\nThe school said specialist support was available for those who need it.\nSpeaking to Sky News at the scene on Monday, Jason Bennett, father of Lacey and John Paul, said: \"I'm broken, I just want to kiss my babies.\n\"I just want to kiss them and hold them. TikTok Queen and my beautiful boy, they were beautiful.\"\nAbout 300 people from the Killamarsh community gathered at Baker Park near Chandos Crescent on Monday night for a vigil.\nThey left candles, flowers and teddies around a post in the centre of the children's playground.\nResidents have also continued to lay similar tributes under the street sign at Chandos Crescent, which remains closed while police investigations continue.\nA fundraiser for the families has raised more than \u00a316,000 in less than a day, with more than 1,200 people donating.\nOrganiser Cassie Perry, from Northampton, said she saw the news on Facebook and was \"devastated\" by what she read, so decided to set up the fund to help with costs.\n\"The last thing anyone wants to worry about at a time like this is finances,\" the 22-year-old said. \"No amount can take away the pain but we can at least try to help in any way we can.\"\nDerbyshire Police has set up an online portal for people to report information or send video footage which could help their investigation.\nDet Ch Insp Sally Blaiklock, who is leading the investigation, said: \"Myself and the team of the detectives are particularly keen to hear from anyone who was in Chandos Crescent between 18:00 on Saturday and 07:00 on Sunday, as well as anyone who may have video footage of the street.\n\"That can include dashcam, mobile phone, CCTV or video doorbell footage.\"\nShe said the road would remain closed and residents would see an increased number of officers in the area in the coming days. \nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "Boris Johnson is expected to urge US President Joe Biden to increase his country's climate commitments in a meeting at the White House.\nOn Monday, the PM had said he was \"frustrated\" that richer countries were failing to financially support poorer ones fighting climate change.\nThe two men are also likely to discuss the situation in Afghanistan.\nBut the PM played down the chances of progress on a UK-US trade deal, calling US negotiators \"pretty ruthless\". \nMr Johnson said he would \"rather get a deal that works for the UK than get a quick deal\", adding that the president had \"a lot of fish to fry\".\nThe prime minister has travelled to the US for a meeting of the UN's General Assembly, which is being attended by over 100 world leaders.\nAddressing a UN climate meeting on Monday, the prime minister said richer economies had done \"nowhere near enough\" to support those nations suffering the impact of global warming.\nIn 2009, developed countries agreed to provide $100bn (\u00a373bn) a year to poorer countries to fight climate change.\nBy 2019, the figure had reached just over $79bn that year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\nThe lead author of a UN-commissioned expert report into the pledge, Amar Bhattacharya, says within the G7 [a group of rich countries], Germany, Japan and France have been the leaders in terms of meeting the target.\nThe UK and Canada are slightly behind them while the United States and Italy are further behind.\nMr Johnson told UN delegates \"the gulf between what has been promised, what is actually being delivered, and what needs to happen\u2026 remains vast\".\nThe US's climate envoy John Kerry raised hopes that there could be progress towards the target, telling Sky News: \"I think we're going to get it done by COP [the climate conference to be held in Glasgow], and the US will do its part.\"\nAsked if Mr Biden would announce more funds this week, he added: \"I'm telling you to stay tuned into the president's speech, and we'll see where we are.\"  \nMr Johnson said it would \"send a massively powerful signal\" if the US did commit to more funding but insisted \"we are not counting our chickens\". \nOn Monday, the prime minister also met Amazon boss Jeff Bezos. A Downing Street spokesman said they \"discussed the upcoming COP26 Summit and agreed there was an urgent need to mobilise more public and private money to help developing countries protect biodiversity\".\nThe spokesman added that the PM \"raised the issue of taxation, and hoped progress could be in implementing the G7 agreement on tax\".\nThe meeting with the president in the Oval Office will be the first time Mr Biden and Mr Johnson have met face-to-face since a G7 summit held in Cornwall earlier this year.\nThe prime minister acknowledged that the US-UK relationship had experience some problems in recent years, referring to \"pebbles in the shoe\".\nBut, he pointed to negotiation successes citing the end of the ban on British beef, and suspension of US tariffs on Scotch whisky.\nSpeaking ahead of the meeting, Mr Johnson described his own relationship with Mr Biden as \"genuinely terrific - we see eye to eye on all sorts of things\" adding that the two men had bonded over trains.\n\"He's a bit of a train nut,\" he added."

They became known for their fusion of rock, R&B and funk, and their lavish stage outfits, including a set of spacesuits.\nThey opened for bands such as The Who before finding mainstream fame themselves.\nAfter LaBelle broke up in 1976, Dash embarked on a solo career and also sang on The Rolling Stones' 1989 album Steel Wheels and did session work for the O'Jays and Chic's Nile Rodgers."

      "tags": "Department for Work & Pensions,Money,Personal finance,Pensions,National Audit Office",
      "text": "Repeated human errors made for years were to blame for a scandal which led to more than \u00a31bn of state pensions not being paid, a report has concluded.\nThe National Audit Office (NAO) said 134,000 pensioners, mostly women, were underpaid pensions because outdated computer systems led to mistakes.\nAmong them was 74-year-old Irene Wise, who said women like her were \"short-changed\" for years.\nThe government said everyone would receive what they were owed.\nHowever, the report raises huge questions for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) over the way the state pension system functions and the mistakes that led to such a massive shortfall in payments.\nReacting to the report, Meg Hillier, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, said: \"This is not the first widespread error we have seen in the DWP in recent years. Correcting these errors comes at great cost to the taxpayer.\n\"The DWP must provide urgent redress to those affected and take real action to prevent similar errors in future.\"\nThe problem relates to the \"old\" state pension system where married women who had a poor pension in their own right could claim a 60% basic state pension based on their husband's record of contributions.\nA review is taking place to trace those affected by systemic failures to award these pension rises, stretching back to 1985. But only some women are being fully paid. Others will only be able to claim for 12 months of missed payments.\nThe DWP is expecting to pay the affected pensioners it can trace a total of \u00a31.05bn, at an average of \u00a38,900 per pensioner affected. That exercise will cost the taxpayer \u00a325m in staff costs and will not be completed until the end of 2023. An estimated 40,000 affected women have already died.\nGrandmother-of-four Mrs Wise, from Worcestershire, spent two years battling for her money.  The NAO report said that some pensioners who contacted the DWP may have been falsely reassured that their payments were correct.\nThe 74-year-old eventually received \u00a37,334 in back payments for eight years of missed pensions.\n\"When you think you have been short-changed for that many years, what a difference [the money] could have made in certain circumstances,\" she said.\nJan Tiernan, from Fife, is one of those affected by the wider problems caused by the errors. She too was initially told she was not owed any money.\n\"I told the DWP I should be getting another \u00a330 a week based on my husband's contributions. But they fobbed me off and said no. I didn't believe them due to the media coverage, so I started writing to them,\" she said.\nAfter nearly 100 pages of correspondence with the department, she received \u00a31,280. However, she believes she is still owed more than \u00a317,000 in missed payments.\n\"It makes me sad and angry. I've been on this campaign for two years now. It is not just for me but for all of these people who have been done out of this money. They should have got it,\" she said.\n\"At 81 years old, you get fed up with it. It is very wearing and it takes up all your energy.\"\nThe NAO report found that errors occurred because state pension rules were complex, computer systems outdated and many tasks still needed to be done manually.\n\"This makes some level of error in the processing of state pension claims almost inevitable,\" it said.\nIt also found the DWP did not have a means of reviewing individual complaints or errors, such as how many people were complaining about the same issues, to assess whether the errors had a systemic cause.\nAs a result, it concluded that it missed opportunities to detect, prevent or correct the errors.\nSir Steve Webb, partner at consultancy LCP and a former pensions minister, unearthed the problems.\nHe said the department had \"let down a generation of women\". He said officials should have been more curious about issues over many years.\nA DWP spokesperson said: \"We are fully committed to ensuring the historical errors that have been made by successive governments are corrected, and as this report acknowledges, we are dedicating significant resource to doing so. Anyone impacted will be contacted by us to ensure they receive all that they are owed. \n\"Since we became aware of this issue, we have introduced new quality control processes and improved training to help ensure this does not happen again.\"\nThe department is facing a heavy workload, with increased benefits claims during the pandemic, as well as a backlog in state pension applications which has meant thousands of newly-retired people have yet to receive their first state pension payments."

      "tags": "Inverie,Pubs,Mallaig",
      "text": "A community hoping to take over Britain's remotest mainland pub could know this week if it has the finances to make a bid for it.\nThe Old Forge in Inverie is on the Knoydart Peninsula in Lochaber.\nThe only way of reaching the village - and its pub - is by walking 18 miles (29km) or making a seven-mile (11km) sea crossing.\nSince it went up for sale earlier this year, a community group has been working to raise the funds to buy it.\nThe Old Forge is on sale for offers over \u00a3425,000. Private buyers are also potentially interested in the property.\nThe pub's Belgian owner Jean-Pierre Robinet told locals in January he was selling up after running the business for 10 years.\nSince January, the small community which has a population of just over 100 people, has held a consultation on a community buyout. Seventy residents took part, with almost all backing the idea.\nThe Old Forge Community Society was set up, and earlier this month it launched a community share offer. The rules mean 75% of the shares must be owned by locals, with a limited number owned by people living outside the area.\nIn just days, the shares offer was climbing towards its target of \u00a3240,000.\nThis week, the society hopes to learn if its application to the Scottish Land Fund for support has been successful. \nThe Scottish government-funded land fund provides grants of up to \u00a31m to support community and volunteer group-run projects.\nIn 2019, the Black Bull in Gartmore, near Stirling, was purchased by the community with financial support from the Scottish Land Fund.\nThe Old Forge Community Society has sought an undisclosed sum of money from the land fund to help cover renovation and other costs.\nSociety secretary Stephanie Harris said the community had always known there was a risk of losing out to a private buyer, but added that the determination of the community could not be underestimated.\nMs Harris told BBC Scotland: \"I have no doubt we will be able to raise the finance that we need. Time is the problem, and we are going as fast as we can.\"\nIsla Miller, who runs a pottery and a tea room with her sister in Inverie, is among those hoping to buy a share.\nShe said the pub was an important gathering place for the community, and welcomed the society's plan to keep the premises open all year round and not close it temporarily over winter as has happened previously.\nShe said the pub was a community hub, describing how local mothers returning home by ferry to the peninsula from hospital would often stop at The Old Forge with their newborn babies, adding: \"It is where you would meet new additions to Knoydart, and then everyone would head off.\"\nMr Robinet said he fell in love with Knoydart after visiting 25 years ago, and was later encouraged to buy the pub by his late father.\nWhile he said he had not done much to change to the look of The Old Forge, Mr Robinet said he had made food a priority of the business and used locally caught seafood and Scottish beef in its meals.\nHe said he made a commitment to run the premises for 10 years and after that spell \"as Britain's remotest mainland publican\" it was now the right time to move on.\nMr Robinet said: \"My father died last year and my mother, who is very brave, is suffering being by herself and having severe illness.\"\nHe said it was time for \"a different phase of life\" and to help his sister look after their mother.\nMr Robinet said the community bid for The Old Forge was a \"great idea\".\nKnoydart's coast and mountains have been described as mainland Britain's last wilderness.\nThe easiest route to Inverie is by boat from Mallaig. People who chose to walk from Kinlochhourn and Glenfinnan usually break the trip down to a journey of two to three days and are advised to contact the local ranger service for advice on the routes.\nIn the middle of the 19th Century, the land on Knoydart was cleared of crofters and turned over to sheep and deer.\nIn 1948, a group of crofters known as the Seven Men of Knoydart launched a \"land raid\" in a bid to seize back the land and live independently from the landlord system. They were unsuccessful, as the landowner obtained a court order to remove them. \nHowever, more than 20 years ago, the community achieved what the seven had set out to do when the Knoydart Foundation purchased 17,200 acres (6,960 ha) of estate land on the peninsula for \u00a3750,000."

      "tags": "Companies,Energy customer switching,Energy industry,CO\u2082 shortage",
      "text": "There is \"no question of the lights going out\" this winter as a result of huge rises in gas prices, the business secretary has said. \nKwasi Kwarteng said he does \"not expect supply emergencies\" and described warnings about shortages as \"alarmist\".\nHis statement comes as smaller energy providers battle to stay afloat due to gas price hikes making price promises to customers undeliverable.\nHigh demand for gas and reduced supply are behind a surge in wholesale prices.\nCustomers are protected from sudden hikes in wholesale gas prices through the energy price cap, which is the maximum price they can be charged on a standard tariff.\nHowever, the cap means energy firms are unable to pass on higher wholesale costs to their customers, which is forcing some - mostly smaller companies - to go out of business.\nSo far, four energy firms have gone to the wall, and four more are expected to follow in the coming days. On Sunday, the UK's sixth largest energy company, Bulb, announced it is seeking a bailout.\nThe government has said it is considering offering emergency state-backed loans to surviving energy companies to encourage them to take on customers from bust firms.\nMr Kwarteng said the government would \"not be bailing out failed companies\" and said the sector had seen a \"regular entry and exit\" over the past five to 10 years.\n\"The current global situation may see more suppliers than usual exiting the market but this is not something that should be any cause for alarm or panic,\" he said.\n\"The taxpayer should not be expected to prop up companies which have poor business models and are not resilient to fluctuations in price.\"\nThe business secretary said the government wanted to protect customers from \"price spikes\" and that the energy industry should not  return to the \"cosy oligopoly\" of years past where a few large suppliers \"dictated to customers conditions and pricing\".\nAt the beginning of 2021 there were 70 energy suppliers in the UK, but industry sources have said there may be as few as 10 left by the end of the year.\nMr Kwarteng added the UK benefited from having a \"diverse range of gas supply sources\" and had \"more than sufficient capacity, to meet demand\".\nShadow business secretary Ed Miliband warned that UK families were going to be hit by a \"triple whammy\" of tax rises, fuel costs and the end of the Universal Credit uplift this winter.\nIndustry group Oil & Gas UK has said wholesale prices for gas had increased by 250% since January - with a 70% rise since August.\nThe increase has been blamed on several factors, including a cold winter which left stocks lower than usual, high demand for liquefied natural gas from Asia, and lower supplies from other countries. Low winds meaning less renewable energy is being generated and outages at some nuclear stations have also contributed.\nIt has left some companies unable to provide their customers with the energy they have paid for. \nHowever, if a supplier fails, energy regulator Ofgem will ensure supplies continue for affected households, and they will not lose money owed to them. A new energy supplier would be responsible for taking on any credit balances a customer may have, but consumers may end up on more expensive tariffs when they are switched.\nAside from gas prices driving up energy bills, millions of households in England, Wales and Scotland are already facing a 12% rise in their energy bills from October when a higher price cap comes into force.\nSome of the largest energy companies have argued the current price cap on tariff - supported by both Labour and Conservative politicians - has helped trigger the current crisis.\n\"You can legislate to protect the consumer - but that can bankrupt the supplier,\" said one senior industry source. \nHowever, Mr Kwarteng said the energy price cap was \"not going anywhere\".\nOfgem will review the price cap in February. There has been speculation that the energy regulator could lift the cap between now and next year to allow firms to charge customers more to cope with rising wholesale gas prices. \nStacey Stothard followed all the advice. Aware that energy prices were rising, she shopped around to find a decent fixed deal for her gas and electricity.\nShe saved \u00a3300 - or so she thought. \nHer new energy supplier went bust and now she will be switched automatically to another one, and she is facing much higher bills, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds more a year.\n\"It is just like watching the meter go up and up,\" she says. \"I did the right thing - not going for the cheapest deal, but choosing a company with a decent customer service record.\"\nEarlier on Tuesday, several smaller energy firms wrote an open letter sent to the prime minister, chancellor, business secretary and Ofgem, which stated they felt there \"voice, as suppliers of all different sizes, has not been heard\".\nSigned by the likes of Green, AMPower, Neon Reef and Tru Energy, it called for a support package for all suppliers, a review of the price cap and for smaller firms to be included in future discussions on the future of the energy market.\nIt was critical of Ofgem, saying it was \"currently unfit to regulate an industry they have appeared to have a vested interest in or turning a blind eye to the market returning to a selective monopoly and a reduction in competition\".\nIn a joint statement on gas prices, Mr Kwarteng and Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley reiterated that the current crisis was \"not an issue of supply\".\nThe pair said there was a consensus among energy suppliers and consumer groups that the \"top priority\" must be support for customers, \"especially the elderly and vulnerable\".\n\"In the event an energy supplier fails, we are committed that consumers face the least amount of disruption possible - and there are clear and well-established processes in place to ensuring this is the case,\" they added.\nAs a result of gas prices booming, energy intensive fertiliser producers have shut down, which has created a shortage of the by-product of production, carbon dioxide.\nFood manufacturers and supermarkets have urged action because carbon dioxide is used to stun animals prior to slaughter and to keep food fresh for storage and transport. \nSupermarket Iceland's managing director Richard Walker told the BBC the carbon dioxide shortage must be prioritised to limit any potential disruption for supermarket supplies, which are also being affected due to a shortage in HGV drivers in the UK, partly caused by the pandemic and Brexit.\nSupermarket Ocado said it had \"limited stock\" of some frozen items due to gas shortages, while another supermarket told the BBC the situation was \"escalating quickly\".\nRead more about the next best steps to take here.\nHow will you be affected by this?

      "tags": "Russia,European Court of Human Rights",
      "text": "Russia was responsible for the killing of Alexander Litvinenko, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has found.\nLitvinenko, a former Russian spy who became a British citizen, was fatally poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 in London in 2006.\nA UK public inquiry conducted 10 years later concluded that the killing was \"probably approved\" by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nRussia has always denied any involvement in his murder.\nThe UK inquiry said former KGB bodyguard Andrei Lugovoi and another Russian, Dmitry Kovtun deliberately poisoned Mr Litvinenko, probably by putting the radioactive substance into his tea.\nLitvinenko's widow, Marina, took the case against Russia to the Strasbourg-based rights court, which has agreed with the UK inquiry's conclusion.\n\"The court found in particular that there was a strong prima facie case that, in poisoning Mr Litvinenko, Mr Lugovoi and Mr Kovtun had been acting as agents of the Russian state,\" the ECHR ruled. \nIt concluded that Russia's failure to refute claims that it had organised the killing further pointed towards the state's responsibility. \nBoth Mr Lugovoi and Mr Kovtun have denied any involvement in the killing. \nA year afterwards, Mr Lugovoi became a member of Russia's lower house of parliament for a right-wing nationalist party. He later condemned the UK public inquiry as a spectacle and an open lie.\nHowever, the Strasbourg rights court found it had established \"beyond reasonable doubt\" that the pair had carried out the poisoning, from the complex procurement of \"rare, deadly poison\", to the travel arrangements and the repeated and sustained attempts to poison Litvinenko.\nLitvinenko had fled Russia, where he had been an officer with the FSB security service. He became a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin and was in the pay of the UK's MI6 secret service, reportedly investigating Russian mafia links with Spain.\nHe met Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun for a cup of tea at a central London hotel on 1 November 2006. He soon fell ill and was admitted to hospital shortly afterwards. His condition worsened and he died on 23 November.\nThe ECHR found that if his murder had been a \"rogue operation\" then Russia would have been able to prove that. But the court said no serious attempt was made to disprove the findings of the UK authorities.\nAlthough it said Russia should pay Litvinenko's widow \u20ac122,500 (\u00a3105,000; $144,000) in costs and other damages, it rejected her claim for punitive damages.\nThe poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko broke a number of unwritten rules and taboos.\nIt was an unprecedented use of a radiological weapon - polonium-210 - on British soil, with the perpetrators leaving a trail of forensic clues wherever they went. \nThe assassination, again on British soil, of someone who had been helpful to MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service, was also highly unusual. But the cause of his death very nearly went undiscovered. \nPolonium-210 is a rare material, produced in a reactor that emits alpha rays, not gamma rays. These are too weak to penetrate the skin but if ingested they are lethal, breaking down the cell walls, causing multiple organ failure. \nIn Litvinenko's case it was only discovered, too late, in his urine and the precise source identified by nuclear scientists from the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston in Berkshire. \nThe ECHR's ruling that Russia was behind this murder will come as no surprise to those who have already investigated it."

      "text": "Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said it would be an understatement to say he was angered by a data breach involving the email addresses of dozens of Afghan interpreters who worked for UK forces.\nMore than 250 people seeking relocation to the UK - many of whom are in hiding - were mistakenly copied into an email.\nMr Wallace has apologised to them, and launched an investigation. One person has been suspended, he said.\nThe MoD has also referred itself to the Information Commissioner's Office.\nSpeaking in the Commons, Mr Wallace said: \"I apologise to those Afghans affected by this data breach and with Home (the Home Office) we are now working with them to provide security advice.\n\"It is an unacceptable level of service that has let down the thousands of members of the armed forces and veterans.\n\"On behalf of the Ministry of Defence, I apologise.\"\nHe added that armed forces minister James Heappey was in the region speaking to neighbouring states to see what more could be done.\nThe email was sent to interpreters who remain in Afghanistan or have been able to get to other countries.\nTheir email addresses could be seen by all recipients, showing people's names and some associated profile pictures.\nThe Information Commissioner (ICO), which has the power to issue enforcement notices and fines in the most serious cases, is already making enquiries with the MoD.\nA spokesperson for the watchdog said people rightly expected their personal information to be handled securely especially where its loss could have devastating consequences, including possible threat to life.\nConservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the defence select committee, warned that the Taliban had not changed.\n\"We must get these interpreters out or they'll be hunted and killed,\" he told MPs, and suggested using \"clandestine means\" to get them to safety, if usual methods were unavailable.\n\"All means will be explored,\" Mr Wallace replied.\nThe email was sent by the team in charge of the UK's Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap), which has been in contact with them since the Taliban took control of the country last month.\nThe team told the interpreters it was doing everything it could to help relocate them.\nIt also said they should not put themselves or their families at risk if it was not safe for them to leave their current location.\nBut one interpreter who received the email realised that more than 250 Afghans who worked with British forces had been copied into the email.\n\"This mistake could cost the life of interpreters, especially for those who are still in Afghanistan,\" they told the BBC.\n\"Some of the interpreters didn't notice the mistake and they replied to all the emails already and they explained their situation which is very dangerous. The email contains their profile pictures and contact details.\"\nThe MoD then sent another email 30 minutes later with the title \"Urgent - Arap case contact\" asking the recipients to delete the previous email and warning \"your email address may have been compromised\".\nIt recommended the interpreters change their email addresses.\nMr Wallace said the Ministry of Defence believed there were 900 \"credible cases\" for Arap resettlement still in Afghanistan beyond the 311 the government is currently speaking to.\nLabour shadow defence secretary John Healey welcomed the defence secretary's apology but told the Commons that action now mattered most.\nHe told MPs: \"These Afghan interpreters worked alongside our British forces and the government rightly pledged to protect them. Ministers must make good on those promises now.\"\nAhmad, not his real name, is one of the 250 or so whose names were mistakenly shared by the MoD. In 2011, he was shot by the Taliban while working as an interpreter with British troops in Helmand.\nHe's currently in hiding in Afghanistan, living apart from his wife and baby daughter for their own safety.\nHe told the BBC he was really shocked and disappointed when he spotted the MoD's mistake.\n\"Just when you think it can't get worse than this, along comes the Arap team and does something that proves you wrong. I didn't really expect this from them,\" he said.\n\"I'm 100% sure that it will have a negative impact on our safety because you know that we are already displaced from our home town. \n\"Now we have to change our locations again and we have to change our email addresses.\"\nAhmad added that he now doubted whether he would ever get to safety in the UK.\n\"I'm not very optimistic, because when I see their carelessness and their neglect, I don't think we're going to be in the UK in the near future.\"\nBut he said he was clinging to hope that the UK would \"finally do the right thing\".\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

      "text": "The FBI has confirmed that a body found inside a Wyoming national park on Sunday belongs to the missing \"van life\" blogger Gabby Petito. \nA coroner made an initial finding that her death was homicide but gave no indication as to how she died. \nMs Petito, 22, was visiting Grand Teton National Park with her fianc\u00e9, Brian Laundrie, 23.\nPolice are currently searching for Mr Laundrie, whose whereabouts are unknown.\nHe is considered a \"person of interest\" in the case, but has not been charged with any crime.\nNo details from the post-mortem have been released.\n\"Teton County Coroner Dr Brent Blue confirmed the remains are those of Gabrielle Venora Petito... Coroner Blue's initial determination for the manner of death is homicide,\" the FBI's Denver office tweeted. \nThe couple had been travelling for several weeks before Mr Laundrie returned home to Florida alone with their white van on 1 September. He did not contact police or the Petito family on his return. \nMs Petito's family reported her missing 10 days later. \nSeveral weeks earlier, police in the Utah town of Moab were called to a possible domestic violence incident. \nBodycam footage showed Ms Petito crying and complaining about her mental health. A police report later said Mr Laundrie claimed Ms Petito had struck him during an argument. \nNo charges were filed, with officers recommending that the couple spend the night apart. What happened next is unclear. \nMr Laundrie's family reported him missing over the weekend. They claim he left for a hike on 14 September and never returned. He had refused to speak with investigators before disappearing.\nThe search for Mr Laundrie has focused on a 24,000-acre nature reserve near his home in North Port, Florida. \nPolice are using dogs, drones, and all-terrain vehicles for the search, which officers say is complicated by difficult, swampy terrain. \nAdditionally, police are investigating hundreds of reported sightings of Mr Laundrie, including more than a dozen from Alabama, which borders Florida to the west. \nOn Monday, investigators searched the Laundrie family home. Agents were then seen removing several boxes from the house and towing away a silver Ford Mustang.\nThe case has captivated the public, with each new development becoming the focus of web sleuths on platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and Twitter.\nAs of Tuesday, the hashtag #GabbyPetito had received more than 650 million views on TikTok alone, according to the Associated Press."

      "tags": "Scottish government,NHS Scotland,Coronavirus pandemic,Humza Yousaf",
      "text": "A thousand extra hospital beds are needed to help relieve the \"unrelenting pressure\" facing Scotland's emergency departments, doctors have claimed.\nThe Royal College of Emergency Medicine said many A&E units were struggling because there are too few beds available elsewhere in hospitals.\nFigures for the week to 12 September show almost 30% of people attending A&E having to wait more than four hours.\nScottish ministers will later update Holyrood on plans to bolster the NHS.\nHealth Secretary Humza Yousaf said \u00a312m of extra funds had already been announced for non-Covid emergency care. \nAccording to the latest figures from Public Health Scotland, there were 27,354 attendances at A&E services in Scotland in the week ending 12 September.\nOf these, 71.5% were seen and either admitted, discharged or transferred elsewhere within four hours - the lowest total for a number of years, and well below the target level of 95%.\nA total of 1,895 patients spent more than eight hours in an A&E department, while 551 of them were there for more than 12 hours.\nIn a BBC interview, John Thomson, vice-president for the Royal College of Emergency Medicine in Scotland, and a consultant in emergency medicine, said there was currently an \"unrelenting pressure on our emergency departments\" but that Covid was only one part of the problem.\nHe said: \"We have patients who are waiting in emergency departments who should be receiving the next stage of their care elsewhere in the system.\n\"The college estimates that we're approximately 1,000 beds short nationally and that would certainly help alleviate some of the issues relating to what we call exit block, which are patients waiting to move from the emergency department when they no longer require care within the department. \n\"Emergency departments can be very busy and function very smoothly when we have no exit block. Conversely when we've seen significant exit block, and long wait for patients to move to beds, then we can have relatively few patients in A&E and struggle to provide the right level of care that we would want to.\"\nThe Scottish government has asked the MoD for military assistance for the under-pressure ambulance service and the health secretary is expected to give more details of the plan at Holyrood later. \nUnite convener Jamie McNamee questioned the value of army personnel driving vehicles \"without the ability to emergency respond\" or having the necessary clinical skills.\nAsked how much help they would be, he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"Whilst we welcome them on board they will be little or no help to the Scottish Ambulance Service in their emergency care provision.\"\nMr McNamee expects that the military will instead work in the non-emergency sector to free up capacity by, for example, providing non-emergency hospital transport.\nThe convener also said he fears for the winter as the current situation is the worst he has known in his 35-year career.\nMeanwhile, Mr Thomson said increasing the number of beds would go \"a long way\" to alleviating the problems facing the NHS. \nHe added: \"The sole reason ambulances have to await to offload is there is no space in the emergency departments for that patient to go.\"\nBefore the Covid pandemic, the average daily number of beds which were staffed and available for patients for acute specialties in Scotland was about 13,000.\nAccording to Public Health Scotland, the number has been going down for many years in line with evolving models of healthcare provision which aims to reduce the frequency and duration of hospital admissions.\nMr Yousaf said: \"We announced \u00a312m in additional funding to boards to support non-Covid emergency care and put measures in place to reduce waiting times for urgent or emergency treatment, with a focus on boosting available beds and supported by record NHS staffing levels. \n \"The Covid pandemic has inevitably affected A&E attendance and the pressure is being felt across the UK. Scotland's core A&E departments have outperformed those in the rest of the UK for more than six years. \n\"Weekly performance is impacted due to a range of challenges including high attendances, staffing pressures due to isolation and annual leave and the continued requirement for infection control precautions that is affecting the time people need to spend in A&E. This is combined with increased levels of people attending A&E who are much sicker and require higher levels of care.\"\nMr Yousaf will face questions from MSPs at Holyrood later, with the Scottish Conservatives calling the latest waiting times figures \"shocking and reprehensible\".\nPublic health spokeswoman Sue Webber said: \"Thousands of patients are waiting hours on end in A&E departments, despite the best efforts of our heroic frontline staff. \n\"The SNP's health secretary needs to accept the reality and admit there is a crisis in our NHS, for the sake of patients and - equally as important - staff wellbeing.\""

      "tags": "Meat,Food industry,CO\u2082 shortage",
      "text": "Pig farmers fear they may soon have to start killing their animals because of a carbon dioxide shortage at abattoirs caused by soaring gas prices.\nCO2 is widely used in the food and drinks industry, including for stunning animals at abattoirs before slaughter.\nBut some CO2 suppliers have halted production due to rising energy costs, creating a huge backlog of pigs that at some point will have to be killed.\nA food and drink trade body says the UK might need to subsidise CO2 production.\nFarmer Kate Morgan told the BBC on Monday \"thousands of pigs are backlogged on farms. If we can't kill our pigs in an abattoir, then unfortunately we will be resorting to killing them on farms\".\nCarbon dioxide used by the meat industry is a by-product of fertiliser production. The gas is also used to keep food fresh as well as in dry ice and fizzy drinks.\nCF Industries, the US-based business which produces about 60% of the UK's food grade CO2, has suspended production at two UK fertiliser plants. Norwegian firm Yara has also cut production at a number of European factories. \nMs Morgan, who runs a pig farm near Driffield, east Yorkshire, told BBC 5 Live's Wake up to Money programme the situation for the industry was already \"pretty dire\" because of labour shortages. Now, meat shortages at supermarkets are a real possibility, she said.\n\"Abattoirs have about a week's supply of gas. It's a chain: We have constantly got pigs coming out of the breeding herd that need to go in homes. Those homes need to be emptied.\" \nHer farm sends about 1,500 pigs each week to abattoirs.\nKilling her own animals is not something she can bear thinking about. \"I can't even begin to think how we would do it. I don't want to put people who work for us in that situation,\" Ms Morgan said. \nOn-farm killing means the meat is not something that would be able to enter the food supply chain. \"It would be wasted,\" she said.\nIt is estimated there are about 100,000 pigs left on farms that would otherwise have been sent for slaughter, with the backlog having started building up weeks ago because of staff shortages.\nAndrew Saunders, a director at the UK's biggest pig producer, Pilgrims Pride, said there is no alternative to stunning with CO2. \"It is an essential part of the process,\" he told the BBC.\nMr Saunders, also chairman of the British Meat Processor Association, said: \"80% of pigs in the UK are slaughtered in about 10 abattoirs, and those abattoirs all use CO2 stunning systems. We already face some challenges regarding keeping those abattoirs operational - some shortage of labour in those plants.\"\nHe said pigs can be kept on farms for only \"a very short period of time. They go beyond their target slaughter weight, they're then unsuitable for size of packets we have for our customers\".\nHe added: \"We hope the government can turn around to intervene to get these CO2 plants up and running again. The particular plants in question supply about 60% of all UK needs and something's required here to get this going pretty quickly.\"\nIt is not just the pig industry facing problems, however. On Monday, the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) warned the whole sector faces disruption.\nIn a letter to Environment Secretary George Eustice, the FDF's chief executive, Ian Wright, said: \"Important parts of the food and drink supply chain - already under significant pressure from the impacts of labour shortages, particularly HGV drivers - are now seriously compromised by disruptions in the supply of CO2.\n\"Across industry, there is a united view that the situation is worsening with little prospect of additional CO2 supply unless the UK government intervenes.\"\nIf ministers are considering financial help to support the energy sector, Mr Wright said then \"any subsidies made available must also be considered for the manufacturers of fertiliser to ensure there is no further deterioration across the UK food and drink supply, and production can be restored\".\nThere are worries that food and drink shortages are starting to appear on supermarket shelves, with the problem expected to worsen in the run-up to Christmas without action.\nRichard Walker, managing director of Iceland, said his supermarket is building up stocks and while there is no immediate shortage problem, he told the BBC the CO2 situation needed to be sorted quickly.\n\"The thing that has shocked me is that 60% of [CO2] production is concentrated in two factories which are both owned by a foreign business.\n\"This is something that's clearly critical to national security - not just food but also healthcare as well. So it seems quite perplexing that it's at the whim of a private enterprise in terms of whether it's profitable or not and therefore whether they produce the stuff or not.\"\nThe British Soft Drinks Association said if manufacturers could not get hold of CO2 supplies, \"after their reserves have run out, production of certain products will have to cease\".\nTony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, has held talks with the government over production at its two fertiliser plants, but the outcome is not clear.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng tweeted that he had met Mr Will and \"discussed the pressures the business is facing and explored possible ways forward to secure vital supplies, including to our food and energy industries\".\nWholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January, with a 70% rise since August alone, leading to calls for support from the industry and the collapse of some smaller energy firms.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson, who is in New York for a UN General Assembly meeting, said the problem with wholesale prices was \"temporary\".\nHe added that he was \"very confident\" in the UK's supply chains and that market forces should be \"very, very swift\" in fixing the issues but that government would help where it could.\nA statement from the government said: \"We continue to monitor supplies across critical sectors and are in regular contact with industry on their CO2 supplies.\n\"The UK benefits from having a diverse range of gas supply sources and we have sufficient capacity to more than meet demand. We do not expect gas supply emergencies this winter.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nNetwork Rail says just 20% of rail passengers are still wearing masks at major stations in England now it is no longer compulsory. Before restrictions in England lifted on 19 July, that figure was 80%. Passengers still have to wear masks to get on board buses and Tubes in London - it is meant to be a condition of carriage, such as paying for a ticket. But some unions representing transport workers say there has been a reduction in mask-wearing on Transport for London services too. Mike Lynch, of the RMT union, warned that \"as more people see others failing to comply, the situation will escalate quickly over the autumn\". Mick Whelan, of Aslef, wants more mask-wearing to protect passengers and staff from Covid.\nBoris Johnson has said people should not worry about putting food on the table this winter, amid surging energy prices and a cut to universal credit. Energy and food bills are rising due to a spike in global gas prices and many families face a \u00a320-a-week benefit cut. The prime minister has rejected calls from Labour MPs - and some members of his own party - to scrap the cut to the universal credit top-up, which had been introduced to help people through the pandemic. Instead, Mr Johnson said: \"We think the best thing we can do is help people into high-skilled, high wage jobs, that is what is happening.\" He added that the surge in energy prices was a \"short-term\" problem caused by \"the global economy coming back to life\" after the coronavirus pandemic.\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged venues to use \"common sense\" when checking vaccine passports, as she set out details of where and when they will be required. Major events and venues such as nightclubs will be expected to ensure that everyone present has had two doses of vaccine from the start of October. But spot-checks will be allowed at larger events, with organisers expected to do a \"reasonable number\" of checks. The scheme will help reduce transmission of the virus and could encourage vaccine uptake, the first minister said. But some business leaders are concerned the scheme \"goes well beyond what was initially proposed\" and could impact on hotels, pubs and other hospitality venues.\nThere's good news for staff at Cornwall's Eden Project - they're being given a fully paid week off as a \"thank you\" for their work during the pandemic. The site has faced staffing pressures and hosted major events over the past 18 months, including a visit from G7 world leaders and members of the Royal Family. David Harland, interim chief executive, said closing in November for a \"staff wellbeing week\" would recognise \"that the team has continued to work at an exceptionally high level\" throughout.\nPolice in New Zealand have charged two men with breaching the country's tough Covid-19 rules - after they were caught trying to enter Auckland with a car boot full of KFC food and tens of thousands of dollars. Under Auckland's strict Level 4 lockdown, all restaurants, including take-away services, remain closed. Police said the men, two alleged gang associates aged 23 and 30, had travelled from Hamilton, about 75 miles south of Auckland. It is unclear whether the men intended to sell the chicken or if they hoped to use it as a distraction if they were to be pulled over.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nCheck on the latest rules around international travel here.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

It's about workers' issues.\n\"If Labour doesn't talk about that agenda, people are quite rightly going to question why we are giving those additional funds.\"\nMs Graham also confirmed her union delegates would vote to oust Labour's most senior official, general secretary David Evans if - as expected - Labour conference votes on whether to endorse him this weekend.\nHe is carrying out a programme of voluntary redundancies at Labour's head office.\nShe said: \"David Evans engaged in all essence in a fire and rehire practice - any CEO who did that would not get our support.\"\nBut a Labour spokesperson rejected the criticism, saying the party was undertaking a \"voluntary severance scheme\", which was \"nothing like fire and rehire\".\nLegal and general\nUnite under Len McCluskey financed a range of legal challenges against Labour when the party tried to discipline or expel left-wing members.\nIf Ms Graham wanted to be involved in less intra-party wrangling, would that continue?\nShe said: \"I am doing a review of every single area of the union, including legal. The most important thing about our legal services is whether they support the members.\n\"I will make decisions with the [union] executive. I don't know all the details [of the legal actions].\n\"But on a broader level, my focus is jobs, pay and conditions of workers - therefore the resources of the union are going to be on that.\"\nMore generally, she would be reorganising the country's second largest union - bringing together members in each sector of industry.\nShe intended to go through the books of big companies \"forensically\" if they attempted to cut pay and conditions, to find out if they were genuinely struggling or if they were using the Covid crisis to reduce her members' rights.\nAnd she will draw up a \"workers' manifesto\" that she will push with whoever is in power.\nMs Graham said she resisted pressure on her to stand aside in the contest for her union's top job to give another left-winger a clear run.\nShe described some of that pressure as \"toxic\" and \"vile\".\nShe added: \"I have a 12-year-old son and I didn't think it was a good moral for him to capitulate. It made me more determined.\"\nAnd now that she has succeeded, she is clearly just as determined to do things differently."

      "tags": "Russian spy poisoning,Amesbury Novichok poisoning,Salisbury",
      "text": "Police say they have identified another suspect in the Salisbury Novichok attacks, which left three people critically ill and one dead.\nFormer Russian agent Sergei Skripal, his daughter Yulia and a police officer, Nick Bailey, were exposed to the substance in 2018. \nDawn Sturgess died after finding a perfume bottle with it in months later.\nSecurity sources now believe a senior Russian agent, Denis Sergeev, was the on-the-ground commander.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said that all three suspects \"should be handed over for justice\".\nDetectives had previously named two Russian intelligence officers as suspects.\nAnatoliy Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin have long been alleged to have smeared the military-grade nerve agent Novichok on the handle of former GRU officer Sergei Skripal's front door.\nThey believe the group belonged to a team from the GRU, Russia's military intelligence service. Sergeev has also been linked to other covert activity across Europe. \nBut Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the UK was using the case as \"a tool to put pressure on our country\", adding: \"We decisively reject all of London's attempt to blame Moscow for what happened in Salisbury.\"\nThe Crown Prosecution Service has now authorised charges, but the suspects cannot be formally charged unless they are arrested.\nAll three are thought to be in Russia.\nNick Price, head of the special crime and counter terrorism division at the CPS, said there was \"sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction\" and that it was in the public interest to charge Sergeev.\nProsecutors were working with police to bring the attackers to justice \"where possible\" but Russia has made clear it does not extradite its citizens, he said.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel told the House of Commons that if any of the suspects travelled outside Russia, the UK would \"take every possible step to detain and extradite them\" and would be \"relentless in the pursuit of justice\".\nShe said the poisoning was \"an appalling event that shook the entire country and united our allies in condemnation\", but said it was not the first time Russia had committed \"a brazen attack in the UK\" - referring to the European Court of Human Rights' judgement on the killing of Alexander Litvinenko.\nNone of the three suspects in Salisbury are likely to ever face a British court. Russia has consistently denied any involvement and says it does not extradite its citizens. \nThis was the same problem UK authorities faced after the killing of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. \nBut there are other reasons these investigations matter. The UK's government response after Litvinenko was seen as weak and falling to do enough to respond and deter Russia. \nIt now hopes public accusations backed by evidence will help build international pressure on Moscow and encourage other states to also carry out their own investigations. \nThis year, the revelations about the GRU's alleged role in a Czech explosion led to the expulsion of diplomats, who were thought to be undercover spies. \nThe UK and its allies also responded with expulsions after Salisbury and it hopes that exposure and retaliation will disrupt and deter Russia's ability to carry out such operations overseas.\nOn 2 March 2018, the alleged GRU hit team came to the UK. \nTwo men, using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, arrived in the afternoon at Gatwick airport. Police have now for the first time confirmed their real names as Anatoliy Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin. \nThe third man, Denis Sergeev, using the name Sergey Fedotov, had arrived at Heathrow airport earlier that day at 11:00 GMT. \nChepiga and Mishkin travelled to Salisbury on Sunday 4 March. \nSergei Skripal and his daughter fell seriously ill later that day, as did Nick Bailey, then a police officer.\nSergeev remained in London the whole time before leaving on a flight to Moscow at 13:45, having made a late change to his plans. The other two left on a later flight at 22:30.\nPolice say they now have evidence the men were operating as a team and that all three met on a number of occasions in London over that weekend. \nOn some occasions, this was indoors, on others it was in the open air - although the police will not specify exactly where.\nDawn Sturgess died in nearby Amesbury in July 2018. Her partner Charlie Rowley had found what he believed was a discarded bottle of perfume, and given it to her. But it contained Novichok.\nPre-inquest hearings into her death, presided over by former High Court judge Baroness Hallett, are due to resume this week. Charlie Rowley became seriously ill, but survived.\nThe role and identity of Sergeev had been previously disclosed by the investigative site Bellingcat in February 2019 and some of his movements and phone contacts were detailed in a joint investigation with the BBC, including his proximity to Paddington, Oxford Circus and Embankment. \nBut the police have been working on building up evidence of his role, a process described as \"challenging\" but which has eventually led to today's announcement.\n\"We remain as determined as ever to bring those responsible to justice,\" said Dean Haydon, assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan Police and senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing. \nThe charges authorised against the three men are conspiracy to murder, attempted murder, causing grievous bodily harm and use and possession of a chemical weapon.\nChepiga and Mishkin appeared on Russian TV after being identified in 2018 and said they had been to the city simply as tourists to see the cathedral. Russia has always denied any involvement.\nTraces of Novichok were found in Chepiga and Mishkin's hotel room, although none were found in that used by Sergeev. \nThe Novichok in the perfume bottle could potentially have killed thousands of people, police say. \nBut there remain significant gaps in the investigation, including how the Novichok came into the UK and where it was between its use in March and its discovery in the perfume bottle in June. \nThe police are asking the public to get in touch if they have any more details of Sergeev's movements in London or that of the perfume bottle. \nIf Sergeev and the other two suspects leave Russia, UK authorities will inform Interpol to seek their arrest.\n\"We now have the evidence that links them to the GRU,\" Mr Haydon said. \"All three are dangerous individuals.\"\nIntelligence also links Sergeev and the team to a trail of covert activities across Europe.\nSergeev is alleged to be a major general and senior member of Unit 29155 of the GRU, a team tasked with sabotage, subversion and assassination. He joined the team after serving in Russian special forces. \nBulgarian authorities say Sergeev and two other men from Unit 29155 checked into hotels in the capital Sofia in April 2015, insisting on rooms with a view of the underground car park. \nSurveillance of that car park released by a Bulgarian prosecutor shows one man approaching the cars of a Bulgarian arms dealer Emilian Gebrev, as well as his son and business partner. \nA toxic substance is believed to have been smeared on the handles - similar to the way Novichok was placed on the handle of Sergei Skripal's house. They would fall ill but survive.\nAlthough he had a return flight booked two days later, Sergeev left the country on 28 April - the day of the poisoning. He may be the man caught on CCTV in the car park.\nChepiga and Mishkin, meanwhile, have been linked to a blast that tore apart an ammunition storage depot used by Emilian Gebrev in a forest in the Czech Republic on 16 October 2014, killing two.\nOn 11 October 2014, the men used the same cover identities they used in Salisbury - Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander Petrov - to arrive at Prague airport before staying near the depot and then leaving on the day of the explosion.\nThe accusation by Czech authorities this summer led to a major diplomatic row with Russia and the expulsion of diplomats from a number of countries.\nIt followed investigative work by European security services who, since Salisbury, have tracked the travel of the three suspects as well as others from the unit to see if they can link it with covert activity. \nFor Sergeev, this includes visits to Spain, France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria as well as other countries. \nHe is also believed to have been in touch with members of the GRU unit involved in a planned coup in Montenegro in 2016.\nUK police also say they believe the three all travelled to the UK before March 2018. They say they continue to investigate other suspects.\nAdditional reporting by Joseph Lee."

      "tags": "Pakistan,Imran Khan,Afghanistan,Women's rights in Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has said preventing women from accessing education in neighbouring Afghanistan would be un-Islamic.\nIn an interview with the BBC, Mr Khan laid out the conditions that would need to be met for Pakistan to formally recognise the new Taliban government.\nHe called for the leadership to be inclusive and to respect human rights.\nMr Khan also said Afghanistan should not be used to house terrorists who could threaten Pakistan's security.\nLast week, the Taliban excluded girls from secondary schools with only boys and male teachers allowed back. But Pakistan's leader said he believed girls would soon be able to attend.\n\"The statements they have made since they came to power have been very encouraging,\" he told the BBC's John Simpson.\n\"I think they will allow women to go to schools,\" he said. \"The idea that women should not be educated is just not Islamic. It has nothing to do with religion.\"\nSince the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in August, fears have grown over a return to the regime of the 1990s when the hardline Islamists severely restricted women's rights.\nIts leadership maintains that the rights of women will be respected \"within the framework of Islamic law\".\nThe decision to exclude girls from returning to school last week prompted an international outcry, with a Taliban spokesman later saying they would return to the classroom \"as soon as possible\".\nBut it is not yet clear when girls will be able to return or what form of education will be provided if they do.\nWhen pressed on whether the Taliban would realistically meet his criteria for formal recognition, Mr Khan repeatedly called on the international community to give the group more time. \n\"It's just too early to say anything,\" he said, adding that he expected Afghan women to eventually \"assert their rights\".\nPakistan has not been seen by all as a firm ally in the battle against jihadist terrorism. It has long been accused by many in the United States and elsewhere of providing support for the Taliban, something it denies.\nAfter the 9/11 attacks that were planned in Afghanistan, Pakistan positioned itself as an ally of the US in the so-called \"war on terror\". But at the same time, parts of the country's military and intelligence establishment maintained links with Islamist groups like the Taliban.\nMr Khan said that Pakistan would make a decision on whether to formally recognise the Taliban government alongside other neighbouring states.\n\"All neighbours will get together and see how they progress,\" he said. \"Whether to recognise them or not will be a collective decision.\"\nMr Khan also called on the hardline group to form an inclusive government, warning that a failure to do so could see the country descend into civil war.\n\"If they do not include all the factions, sooner or later they will have a civil war,\" he said. \"That would mean an unstable, chaotic, Afghanistan and an ideal place for terrorists. That is a worry\".\nOn Tuesday, a Taliban spokesman announced the remaining members of Afghanistan's all-male government.\nThe additions included a doctor as health minister, but analysts say the government is predominantly made up of loyalists with little minority representation."

      "text": "Journalists in Afghanistan say that they have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests. \nPhotos circulating online show two journalists from Etilaatroz newspaper with welts and bruises after their arrest in the capital Kabul. \nOne of them, Taqi Daryabi, told the BBC he had been taken to a district police station where he was kicked and beaten. \nOn Wednesday, the BBC's team were also prevented from filming. \nMr Daryabi, alongside Etilaatroz's photographer Nematullah Naqdi, had been covering a women's protest in Kabul on Wednesday. \nAfterwards, they were taken to a police station, where they say they were beaten with batons, electrical cables and whips. A few hours later, they were released by the Taliban, without explanation. \n\"They took me to another room and handcuffed my hands behind me,\" he told the BBC's Secunder Kermani in Kabul. \"I decided not to defend myself because I thought they would just beat me even worse, so I lay down on floor in a position to protect the front of my body. \n\"Eight of them came and they started beating me... Using sticks, police sticks, rubber - whatever they had in their hands. The scar on my face is from shoes where they kicked me in face.\n\"I was unconscious after that so they stopped. They took me to another building where there were cells and left me.\"\nMr Daryabi said he had fallen unconscious after the beating, and that after about two hours he had been released. \n\"I could barely walk but they were telling us to walk quickly. I was in very bad pain.\"\nNematullah Naqdi said Taliban fighters had tried to take away his camera as soon as he started taking photographs of the protest.\n\"One of the Taliban put his foot on my head, crushed my face against the concrete. They kicked me in the head... I thought they were going to kill me,\" Mr Naqdi told AFP news agency.\nHe asked why he was being beaten, only to be told: \"You are lucky you weren't beheaded.\"\nAfghanistan's Tolo news agency reported that its cameraman had been arrested and held by the Taliban for nearly three hours.\nThe CPJ, an international non-governmental organisation, said at least 14 journalists had been detained and then released over the past two days. \n\"The Taliban is quickly proving that earlier promises to allow Afghanistan's independent media to continue operating freely and safely are worthless,\" said Steven Butler, CPJ's Asia programme co-ordinator. \n\"We urge the Taliban to live up to those earlier promises, to stop beating and detaining reporters doing their job, and allow the media to work freely without fear of reprisal.\"\nEarlier this week, the Taliban, which seized control of Afghanistan in a sweeping offensive more than three weeks ago, announced the formation of an all-male interim government to rule the country.\nSince then, they have effectively banned protests, declaring them illegal unless permission is sought from the ministry of justice."

      "text": "Asian stocks were mixed on Tuesday as concerns persisted over Chinese property group Evergrande and its impact on the global markets. \nJapan's Nikkei 225 index closed 2.2% lower, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng index regained earlier losses to end up 0.5%.\nThere are concerns that Evergrande - a major Chinese property developer - is struggling to meet interest payments on more than $300bn of debts.\nRegulators have warned it could affect the country's financial system.\nInvestors fear that this could hit big banks exposed to Evergrande and companies like it, causing contagion in global markets.\nThe jitters among the markets also come as the global economy is still recovering from the impact of the coronavirus.\nOn Monday, the Dow Jones index in the US ended 1.8% lower. That followed similar falls in Europe, with Germany's Dax index losing 2.3%, and the Cac 40 in France down 1.7%.\nMajor stock exchanges in mainland China were closed on Monday and Tuesday for the annual mid-Autumn festival.\nDespite the recent falls, Japan's Nikkei is up by almost 30% compared to a year ago.\n\"The fear of an Evergrande bankruptcy appears to be leading to concern about China's very own Lehman [Brothers] moment, and a big overspill across the region,\" said Michael Hewson of CMC Markets. \nInvestors are also nervous that the US Federal Reserve, which meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, will confirm plans to cut back support for the US economy this year. \nGlobal stocks have rallied as economies reopen and central banks have provided trillions of dollars in support to boost growth. \nBut there are concerns of a decline if support is taken away at a time when the Delta variant of coronavirus continues to drag on recovery.\nStrategists at Morgan Stanley said they expected a 10% correction in America's S&P 500 index as the Fed starts to unwind its support. \nThey added that signs of a stalling recovery could deepen that slide to 20%.\nHowever, other analysts played down fears of a rout, noting that September is typically a bad months for stocks. \n\"Overall, September continues to live up to its bad reputation as historically the weakest month of the year. But that doesn't mean it can't rebound,\" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.\nAnd Lindsey Bell of Ally Invest said any pullback may be short-lived. \n\"Much of investing is about sorting through what's signal and what's noise,\" she said. \"While there is concern about the Evergrande situation infecting global markets, for the long-term investor, this situation may just be noise.\""

      "tags": "Spotify,Streaming,Music",
      "text": "Abba star Bjorn Ulvaeus has launched a campaign to ensure musicians don't miss out on millions of pounds in royalties.\nCalled Credits Due, the scheme aims to ensure all songwriters and musicians are correctly identified when a song is recorded.\nAt present, missing and incomplete data means that about \u00a3500m is unallocated or misallocated globally every year.\n\"It happens frequently,\" Ulvaeus told the BBC. \"Which means that streaming services don't know who to pay.\"\nThe scheme will also ensure fans see the correct credits for songs - from the writers and producers to the session musicians and engineers.\n\"We want to get back to that experience we had when we opened a double-sleeved LP and listened to the songs while reading the liner notes,\" Ulvaeus explained. \"I think that's a very valuable experience that young listeners today are missing.\"\nThe scheme will ensure that every person who is involved in the creation of a song will be \"clickable in the digital liner notes\", allowing you to look up every other record they have worked on.\n\"Every new person that walks into the recording studio will be registered,\" Ulvaeus said. \"So, even in a symphony orchestra, every member will be clickable.\"\nThe Abba star launched the scheme at Tuesday's Ivor Novello Awards in London - which recognise the contribution of songwriters. Among the attendees, there was widespread support for the idea.\n\"I think it's really important because there's lots of people behind the scenes that don't get the credit they deserve,\" said singer Emeli Sande.\n\"You've got musicians that have practised and refined their art for their whole lives - so yeah, I'm very happy to support Bjorn.\"\nSongwriter MNEK, who has penned hits for Little Mix and Beyonc\u00e9 and scored his own number one single last year with Head and Heart, said: \"I think it highlights that more that goes into making music, than just being a pop star.\"\nThe Credits Due campaign tackles one of the most boring, broken, complex and crucial problems facing the music industry: metadata. \nWhen a song is released, either on CD and vinyl or on a streaming service like Spotify, it includes a huge amount of underlying information, including titles, alternative titles, featured artists, songwriter and producer names, publishers, and much more. \nThat information needs to be synchronised with databases around the world to make sure the right people get paid when a song is streamed, bought or played.\nOften, that doesn't happen - and with 60,000 new songs uploaded to Spotify every day, the problem is growing. \"Can you imagine what a mess it is?\" asked Ulvaeus.\nThe new scheme is backed by The Ivors Academy for songwriters and The Music Rights Awareness Foundation, which Ulvaeus founded with songwriters Max Martin and Niclas Molinder in 2016.\nTogether they are launching an app to help songwriters, producers and record labels gather all the necessary data before a song is released.\n\"It's in the interest of all these people to get it right,\" said Ulvaeus. \"Today, in 2021, there's really no excuse.\"\nThe star was speaking three weeks after Abba unveiled their comeback - with a new album and a virtual tour that will launch in the UK next May.\nTheir return, after a 39-year break, was met with a rapturous reception around the world. Two new singles, Don't Shut Me Down and I Still Have Faith In You, entered the UK top 20, while the Abba Voyage album broke pre-sale records.\n\"I didn't anticipate it being so global,\" said Ulvaeus. \"How that happened, I don't know. But I'm very grateful.\"\nHe explained that the concert will feature a mixture of live music and pre-recorded elements, with a live band augmenting the \"Abba avatars\" on stage.\nSome of the songs may sound different - singers Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad now sing \"one tone lower than they used to\" - but he said the group \"laughed all the time\" during rehearsals.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Meat processors are in talks with the government over a shortage of carbon dioxide that could hit meat production.\nPoultry producers said the shortage \"threatens national food security\".\nThe gas is used to stun pigs and chickens prior to slaughtering, and also in the packaging process.\nThe carbon dioxide used by the meat industry is a by-product of fertiliser production, but fertiliser factories have been halting production due to soaring natural gas prices.\nThe government said it was monitoring the situation \"closely\".\nIt has been holding emergency talks with industry groups and meat processors, as first reported by the Financial Times.\nFertiliser producers have been struggling with natural gas prices that are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis.\nIn the UK, lower winds have meant less renewable energy is generated, there have been outages at some nuclear stations, and there have been lower flows into the UK of natural gas from Norway, pushing up the price of natural gas.\nThis week, two large UK fertiliser factories owned by US firm CF Industries Holdings suspended operations due to soaring gas prices, and on Friday Norwegian firm Yara said it would also cut production at a number of its European plants.\nNick Allen, the chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA), attended emergency talks with the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) on Friday to discuss the issue.\n\"This crisis highlights the fact that the British food supply chain is at the mercy of a small number of major fertiliser producers - four or five companies - spread across northern Europe. We rely on a by-product from their production process to keep Britain's food chain moving,\" Mr Allen said.\nAbout 20 million birds per week are slaughtered, but abattoirs only hold a limited stock of carbon dioxide, British Poultry Council chief executive Richard Griffiths said.\n\"With fewer than 100 days to go until Christmas, and already facing mounting labour shortages, the last thing British poultry production needs is more pressure.\n\"If CO2 supplies become tighter and more unpredictable then supply chains will have to slow down. Ultimately, no CO2 means no throughput.\"\nHe said the industry group's members \"are on a knife-edge situation at the moment\".\nMeat processors are working with government to \"mitigate any major impact on a sustainable supply of food\", he added.\n\"This is incredibly serious,\" one supermarket executive told the BBC. \"Some suppliers are telling us they could run out of CO2 in less than two weeks.\"\nIndustry groups and processors also had a meeting with the government on Thursday.\nMeat processors have already been struggling with a shortage of lorry drivers and recruitment problems at abattoirs exacerbated by EU nationals leaving the UK after Brexit.\nCarbon dioxide is used when slaughtering pigs and chickens to stun them, and it is used during the packaging process for all meat to prolong shelf life.\nIt is widely used throughout the food industry, including in brewing.\nHowever, the closure of the two CF Industries plants has cut 60% of the UK's food-grade carbon dioxide supply, the BMPA spokesperson said.\nIt unclear how much carbon dioxide abattoirs and other food factories have stored.\nThe remaining UK carbon dioxide production is being prioritised for the NHS for medical uses, and for the nuclear industry, which uses it as a coolant.\nWithout carbon dioxide, the slaughtering process of pigs and chickens cannot go ahead, the spokesperson said.\nThe Cucumber Growers Association also warned of the effect of high natural gas prices on crops.\nGas is used to heat greenhouses and provide carbon dioxide \"which are both critical factors in growing and achieving the yields required to survive in the modern industry\", it said in an open letter.\nThe \"extreme rise\" in wholesale gas prices has piled costs on growers, it added.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We are monitoring this situation closely and are in regular contact with the food and farming organisations and industry, to help them manage the current situation.\""

      "text": "A major change to organ donation rules in Northern Ireland has passed its second reading at Stormont. \nAssembly members approved the bill by 69 votes to six, and it will now go before the health committee.\nIf passed, the legislation would mean people automatically become organ donors unless they specifically opt out.\nNorthern Ireland is currently the only part of the UK where an opt-out system for organ donation is not in place.\n\"One of the things this bill has allowed us to do is to start to have that conversation as to what organ donation means,\" said Health Minister Robin Swann during the debate.\nUntil June, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had blocked attempts to pass a bill.\nFollowing talks between First Minister Paul Givan, Robin Swann, who proposed the legislation, and campaigners, Mr Givan announced he had given approval for the legislation to proceed to the assembly.\nThe lack of opposition would allow for such a bill to become law before the assembly is dissolved ahead of the election due in May.\nHowever, campaigners have raised concerns that the bill might never become law due to the DUP's threat to collapse Stormont over the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nEarlier this month, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party may quit Stormont \"within weeks\" if its demands over the protocol are not met,\nThere are currently about 115 people waiting for an organ transplant in Northern Ireland.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said the bill had been \"long-awaited by all who are involved in the organ donation process.\"\nHe told the assembly the move would increase the number of donors \"and ultimately the number of life-saving organs available for transplantation\".\nThe minister outlined how the bill had taken on board lessons from legislation in other parts of the UK.\n\"This bill will mean that adults in Northern Ireland will be considered potential donors unless they choose to opt out or are excluded,\" he added.\nM\u00e1irt\u00edn MacGabhann, whose four-year-old son D\u00e1ith\u00ed has been waiting for a new heart for three years said the proposals would be \"a massive step\" forward for D\u00e1ith\u00ed and others on the waiting list.\n\"A transplant is used when all other options have been exhausted, it's the last hope for them,\" he said.\n\"There is something that our politicians can achieve to increase your loved ones' chances of receiving the vital organ.\"\nHe encouraged those in power to keep the political institutions \"up and running, so important issues like soft opt out organ donation have a chance of going through\".\n\"I'm just pleading with those politicians to please give these important pieces of legislation a fighting chance because they can change our society so much,\" he said.\nHe said if Stormont were to collapse over the issue he would be \"absolutely heartbroken\".\n\"We have come so far and gathered so much support politically and it would be an absolute travesty if the likes of soft opt-out organ donation was not to come into law because of the collapse of Stormont,\" Mr MacGabhann said.\nFearghal McKinney, from the British Heart Foundation, told BBC NI's Sunday Politics programme campaigners would get back up to fight for the legislation if power-sharing were to dissolve before it could pass.\n\"The gift of life is in the hands of our politicians right now,\" he said. \nIn the first year after England introduced an opt-out system, the organs of 296 people were donated.\nThis accounted for 29% of all donors in the 12-month period and resulted in a total of 714 organs being transplanted.\nTransplant surgeon Dr Tim Brown said he did not believe opt-out legislation was the \"way to achieve\" change.\nHe said he would like to get to a position where organ donation registration lists were \"unnecessary\".\n\"I would like that the norm in society, that if somebody does find themselves in the tragic position of being an organ donor, I would like it to be normal for them to go and donate without any need for them to be on a list,\" he said.\nHe said he had difficulty with \"the removal of autonomy from an induvial\" in the opt-out plans.\n\"I think education and support around donation is the way to achieve that, legislation is a further step that I don't think is necessary,\" he added."

      "text": "At Balkh airfield in Mazar-i-Sharif, northern Afghanistan, Taliban fighters excitedly snap photos of a Russian-made MI-17 helicopter touching down.\nOn board are senior Taliban officials. Sitting in the cockpit are their former enemies: pilots from the old Afghan air force. \nMaulvi Abdullah Mansour, the Taliban commander in charge of the airfield, shows me round the fleet he now controls. It includes attack helicopters and fighter planes, gifted to the previous government by international forces.\nUnder the old government, the aircraft were often used to target the group. It's not clear how they will be used now that the war is over. \"If we ever need them in the future, they are here,\" Mansour says.\nAs the Taliban advanced across Afghanistan ahead of its August victory, dozens of pilots fled the country in fear of their lives, taking their aircraft with them. But others stayed on and now work under the leadership of the Taliban, reassured, it appears, by assurances of an amnesty. \nI ask Maulvi Mansour how it feels to now be working alongside men he was once fighting against. \"We always knew in our hearts that we would conquer and liberate the country,\" he says, \"but we also knew that one morning we would sit down and work together because they are our countrymen.\" \nSitting next to him is Gul Rahman, a helicopter pilot. He appears cautious in his answers, insisting that once he heard about the Taliban's amnesty he was never afraid of returning to work. \n\"It was inevitable this would happen one day,\" he says, \"we never thought we could continue on our separate paths forever \u2026 We will leave the politics to the politicians and work together to develop the country.\"  \nYounger Taliban fighters mill around us in the hangar, looking on with curiosity at two MD-530 helicopters. Signs of a degree of underlying tension are visible as one of the Talibs quizzes a mechanic about his qualifications. \"You all got these jobs through personal connections, not because you're properly qualified,\" he says in an accusing tone. Nevertheless, overall the atmosphere seems amicable.\nElsewhere, the transition from old to new regime is going less smoothly. The country is facing an economic crisis, with foreign reserves frozen as the international community decides how to help Afghans but not the Taliban. There are restrictions on cash withdrawals and long queues at banks. Second-hand markets have sprung up in cities across the country, with desperate Afghans trying to sell their possessions just to be able to afford enough to eat. \nOne woman, Shagufta, is sat on the roadside, rifling through the clothes she's brought to sell. \"Life has become an insult now, we are dying slowly,\" she tells us tearfully. She's weak because she didn't have any food for breakfast, or for dinner the night before. \"Everything I had I gave to my children,\" she says, \"now I am selling their finest clothes, what they used to wear to weddings \u2026 If I get a good price I will buy oil, rice and flour.\" \nHer story epitomises the deep-rooted inequalities in the country. Her husband retired from the police six years ago, but barely ever received his pension under the previous government. The family was just about able to cope as Shagufta worked washing and stitching clothes in her neighbourhood. With increased financial pressure though, even that work dried up. \"The Islamic Emirate is good, there's no theft or crime anymore,\" she says. \"We just have one problem, there's no work and no money.\" \nThe second-hand market in Mazar-i-Sharif is teeming. Many of those we meet are government employees. Most public sector workers haven't received their salaries for at least two months now. The problem began under the previous government, but now they have no idea when or if they will be paid again. \nOne teacher has already sold everything she can. \"I became a shopkeeper in my own house and sold all my belongings \u2026 Whatever I earned I am using to buy food now. Whenever I come here and see the condition of the people I go home and cry.\" Nonetheless, she says she's still turning up to work every day. \nAcross the road is Mazar-i-Sharif's main hospital. It's now run by a Taliban official, but his deputy is continuing in the same position he held under the previous government. Staff haven't been paid since the Taliban takeover, with uncertainty over how the ministry of health will be funded, while the current reserve stock of medicine will only last for another month.\nThe transition of power in Afghanistan ended up being much less violent and bloody than many had feared, but around half the country were already in dire need, and for many now the struggle to survive is getting even harder. \nBack in Kabul, we meet a former policeman trying to make ends meet. \"It makes no difference to me who's in the government,\" he says. \nHe is now selling Taliban flags by the side of the road.\n\"There's no work around,\" he says. \"What else can I do?\" \nAdditional reporting by Malik Mudasir and Shams Ahmadzai."

It completes an average of more than 100,000 service jobs for central London homeowners and businesses each year.\nFrom starting the plumbing business with a second-hand van and a box of tools, Mullins said he had received approaches from a number of buyers after hiring advisers from Cavendish Corporate Finance. \n\"We had various people who wanted to buy the business, and interest from all over the world, including France, America, and somewhere in the Middle East,\" Mullins told the BBC.\nThe businessman often speaks publicly on economic matters and was an opponent of Brexit.\nHe said the firm had experienced a strong year despite the coronavirus pandemic, with both in and out-of-hours calls increasing, as well as emergency call outs. \n\"Covid helped to lift the company to another level,\" he said, pointing to an increase to 2,000 to 3,000 jobs a week. \"It now needs to go international.\"\nHe added: \"The business will always be something I will cherish. It has been a lifetime of work, and what it has achieved is remarkable. Neighborly will take that to the next level.\"\nMr Mullins plans to use some of the income from the sale to back other ventures in music promotion and overseas property.\nNeighborly, founded in 1981, is a home services provider, serving more than 10 million residential and commercial customers. As well as plumbing, it provides pest control, cleaning, and home inspection services.\nThe acquisition allows Neighborly to extend its international reach. Neighborly was bought by KKR from investment firm Harvest Partners just two months ago. \nMike Bidwell, president of Neighborly, said: \"We are thrilled to be growing our global footprint with the addition of Pimlico as the next subsidiary brand to join our global family of home service professionals.\n\"Pimlico's wide array of trade services as well as its exceptional customer care perfectly align with Neighborly's purpose, which is to build an extensive service community known for providing excellent experiences.\""

      "text": "The parents of Harry Dunn have reached a \"resolution\" in a civil claim for damages with the woman alleged to have killed him, the family's spokesman has said.\nMr Dunn, 19, died when his motorbike was hit by a car driven by US citizen Anne Sacoolas near RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, in 2019.\nShe later left the country, claiming diplomatic immunity.\nDunn family spokesman Radd Seiger said the outcome was \"a real milestone\".\nDetails of the agreement reached between the parties involved in the civil case have not been disclosed.\nMrs Sacoolas's car collided with the teenager's motorbike moments after she left the US base, where her husband Jonathan worked for a US intelligence agency.\nThe teenager's parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, brought the civil claim against Mrs Sacoolas in the US state of Virginia.\nHarry Dunn's family began the damages case against Anne Sacoolas to force her to give evidence about what happened, because it appeared to be the only way to get her into court. \nBut that was before the Biden administration assured London that it would not stand in the way of some kind of alternative process of achieving justice for Harry, providing Ms Sacoolas and British prosecutors could agree. \nThe Crown Prosecution Service is not downplaying what it says are the \"challenges and complexity\" of that proposal  - but nor is it suggesting that it's hopeless. \n\"Restorative justice\", in which someone accounts for their actions, is a feature of both the British and American criminal justice systems. \nWe don't know what prosecutors are considering - but Harry Dunn's family are clear: justice and truth must lie at the heart of whatever happens.\nThe Alexandria District Court in Virginia heard Mr and Mrs Sacoolas' work in intelligence was a \"factor\" in their departure from the UK, as they left for \"security reasons\".\nMrs Sacoolas, 44, and her husband were due to give evidence last month but it was postponed.\nMr Seiger said Mr Dunn's parents would now be able to \"put this part of the campaign behind them\".\nHe said: \"The family's courage and determination to see this through has been incredible.\"\nIn December 2020, the Crown Prosecution Service authorised Northamptonshire Police to charge Mrs Sacoolas with causing death by dangerous driving.\nAn extradition request for Mrs Sacoolas to be brought to the UK was rejected by the US government.\nHowever, the UK authorities are continuing to press for her to return to the UK to face the criminal charge.\nMr Seiger said the family would now turn its \"attention to the criminal case and the long-awaited inquest into Harry's death which will follow the criminal case\".\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss raised Mr Dunn's case with the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during the United Nations General Assembly on Monday.\nSpeaking on the train to Washington where she will meet with Joe Biden, Ms Truss said the resolution of the civil case was \"absolutely not\" the end of efforts to get Mrs Sacoolas to return to the UK.\n\"We continue to press for justice for Harry,\" she said.\nLegal representatives for Mrs Sacoolas have been approached for comment.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Donald Trump,Joe Biden",
      "text": "\"When it goes wrong, it really does go wrong - one wrong move, one throwaway comment and months of planning and international diplomacy are in the bin.\"\nNo stress then! As one former Downing Street senior staff member recalls, visits to the White House are about as high pressure as it gets.\nBritish prime ministers always lavish praise on the importance of the relationship with the US. So when it's time for an invite to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue the pressure is really on.\nIn the run up to the big event, warm words are the order of the day.\nToday is no exception. Boris Johnson told the travelling press pack that the relationship between the two countries is as \"good as it has been for decades\", claiming his relationship with President Biden is \"genuinely terrific\", and joking the two have bonded over their love of rail - \"he's a train nut\".\nThere's bonhomie, and - having witnessed the two at the G7 in Cornwall - it is visible.\nThe UK camp is encouraged at the American removal of travel restrictions on UK citizens in November. And there's a sense that the president might be ready to make extra commitments on climate finance which would thrill Downing Street. But nothing is that straightforward.\nThey'll have to confront tensions over the handling of the withdrawal of forces in Afghanistan. And the UK doesn't expect much progress on trade either, saying American negotiators are \"ruthless\", playing down expectations of things moving forward. \nBut first and foremost both sides will want Tuesday's big meeting to go smoothly. No gaffes, no misunderstandings, no embarrassments.\nWhatever the personal friendships or frictions between the two main protagonists, it matters because, as one No 10 insider told me, \"the relationship matters for the mutual benefit of our people\".\nThe current Downing Street team don't seem to be nervous about the meeting on Tuesday, at least outwardly, but they are conscious of how much it matters, and how previously things have gone awry.\nWho could forget the last time a British prime minister held talks in the Oval Office? The press conference back in 2017 was quite the experience.\nWhat you might not know was that Theresa May's team was worried about the menu - because the ribs on offer at the getting-to-know-you lunch might plaster barbecue sauce all over the then prime minster's face during the huge TV moment. They discovered the meat was \"neatly chopped\" after all.\nOr that former President Trump anti-bacced his hands after shaking hands with Theresa May's team - one of them now jokes \"he was ahead of his time\".\nOr indeed, that \"May bossed her foreign secretary around on the plane on the way, talking down to him in front of others, and yet he is the man now in charge\". Ouch!\nFor David Cameron's team there were similar stresses, and frankly high farce. After \"endless discussions about photo ops\", one member of his team remembers, the two men took Air Force One to a college basketball game, putting David Cameron under unfamiliar pressure when he had to give a half-time interview about the match on a \"subject he knew nothing about\".\nMoney couldn't buy these kind of images for a British prime minister - putting them on the spot over alley-oops or a 5-out motion, less desirable altogether.\nAnd that's before you factor in the British reaction back then to the mere name of the White House protocol supremo, Randy Bumgardner, to the bemusement of the Americans. Two nations divided perhaps not just by a common language, but by different senses of humour too.\nSo, there is a lot at stake - the risk of misunderstanding, disagreement on policy, a clash of political personality, or just blunders that cause blushes. As one of those who felt it go wrong to their cost told me, \"it's important to be on best behaviour\".\nMr Johnson has been to the White House before, as foreign secretary in 2019. But so much has changed then, on this side of the Atlantic and at home. A very different prime minister. A very different president. A very different set of challenges for the world.\nAnd British prime ministers' visits to the White House are, as occasions in themselves, about as momentous as it gets."

      "text": "Boris Johnson has said people should not worry about putting food on the table this winter, amid surging energy prices and a cut to universal credit.\nThe prime minister told BBC News: \"I don't believe people will be short of food - and wages are actually rising.\"\nIt comes after Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng warned some households face a \"very difficult winter\".\nEnergy and food bills are rising due to a spike in global gas prices - and many families face a \u00a320-a-week benefit cut.\nThe cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills, the boss of the energy regulator Ofgem has warned.\nSpeaking to the BBC in New York, where he has been meeting world leaders at the United Nations, Mr Johnson said the surge in energy prices was a \"short-term\" problem caused by \"the global economy coming back to life\" after the coronavirus pandemic. \n\"We are talking to the energy companies - doing what we can to keep prices low, to make sure that the supermarket shelves aren't empty,\" he said.\nHouseholds across England, Scotland and Wales are set to see their energy bills rise by an average of \u00a3139 a year in October.\nWorkers also face a rise in National Insurance payments from next April, to help fund higher costs for the NHS and social care.\nIn his BBC interview, Mr Johnson insisted the gas price increase was an \"interim\" issue and the global energy markets would \"rectify themselves\".\nIt showed that the UK was right to be moving to renewable energy, he added.\nThe government is hoping to limit further energy bill rises by keeping a price cap in place, and also plans to help bigger firms take on customers from small suppliers that have gone bust. \nSeparately, the government says it has taken action to prevent supermarket shortages with a deal to restart production at CF Industries, the UK's biggest producer of carbon dioxide.\nThe gas is widely used by the food industry to prolong shelf life.\nRestarting production at the carbon dioxide plants is set to cost taxpayers tens of millions of pounds, after the government agreed to meet the full operating costs for three weeks.\nEnergy price rises have been as dizzying as New York's skyscrapers - but Boris Johnson was reluctant to acknowledge the squeeze on supply was anything more than a short-term problem. \nThe government has managed to broker a deal on CO2, but the pressure points this autumn go beyond that. \nThere are real fears at home about household bills, food supplies, and rising prices. \nBut Mr Johnson blamed the pressures on the pandemic, saying the issues were just in the \"interim\".\nWhile he said the government would help where it could, he did not provide details of any further actions the government might take, placing his faith in the market to resolve the crunch and pointing to his energy \"ten-point plan\". \nA long-term Whitehall plan may not be that much comfort to those worrying about paying higher bills right here and now. \nRead more from Laura here.\nMr Johnson has again rejected calls from Labour and many Tory MPs to scrap the cut to the \u00a320 a week top-up to universal credit, which some MPs have warned will push many working families into poverty.\nInstead of keeping the top-up, which was brought in to help people through the pandemic, Mr Johnson said:  \"We think the best thing we can do is help people into high-skilled, high wage jobs, that is what is happening,\n\"Unemployment is falling very rapidly, jobs are being created, wages are rising.\n\"And rather than raising people's taxes to put more money into benefits, we want to see companies paying their workers more.\"\nLabour held a debate in the Commons, calling on the government to halt the proposed cut to the universal credit top-up.\nThe party's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, said working families faced a squeeze on living standards this winter \"on a scale not seen for a generation\" - and it was down to government decisions, not an \"unforeseeable series of unhappy accidents\".\n\"Incomes are coming down, prices are going up - especially energy prices - taxes are going up, rents are going up, childcare costs are going up, fuel costs are going up, rail fares are going up.\n\"And with empty shelves in too many shops, restaurants closing because of meat shortages, and now refrigerant shortages putting Christmas at risk, it isn't just that people can afford less, there is also less to afford,\" she told MPs.\nSpeaking on BBC Two's Newsnight programme on Monday, the Conservative former Brexit Secretary, David Davis, warned there was a risk of a \"cost of living crisis\" for new Tory voters such as \"the plumber, the bricklayer, the lorry driver\".\nHe said his advice to Chancellor Rishi Sunak would be: \"You think hard about the ordinary family's take-home pay and what they have to buy with it, because that will be a dictator of how people feel going in to the new year.\""

      "text": "Many patients are being prescribed unnecessary and even harmful treatments, a report warns.\nThe review, in England, suggests one-tenth of items dispensed by primary care are inappropriate or could be changed. \nAround 15% of people take five or more medicines a day - some are to deal with the side-effects of the others. \nThe government is appointing a prescribing tsar to help with the issue and stop waste.\nThe more medicines a person takes, the higher the chance that one or more of them will have an unwanted or harmful effect.\nOverprescribing can happen when:\nChief pharmaceutical officer for England, Dr Keith Ridge, said: \"Medicines do people a lot of good and this report is absolutely not about taking treatment or services away from people where they are effective. But medicines can also cause harm and can be wasted.\"\nThe number of items dispensed by GPs and other primary care providers has doubled in recent years, from an average of 10 per person in 1996 to around 20 per person now, according to the report. \nRepeat prescriptions make up around three-quarters of all prescription items.\nAnd around 6.5% of hospital admissions are caused by adverse effects of medicines. This rises to up to 20% in the over-65 age group. \nImproved patient records and handovers between hospitals and GP surgeries are among the recommendations made in the report. \nClinical pharmacists working with GPs to review medication and a move to more personalised care is already helping, say experts.\nProf Martin Marshall, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: \"Prescribing is a core skill for GPs and many of our nurse and pharmacist colleagues in primary care and doing whatever we can to prescribe the most appropriate medicine for our patients, in an evidence-based way is something we strive to do on a daily basis - and in the vast majority of cases, this review shows this is happening.\n\"With our growing and ageing population, with more patients living with multiple, chronic conditions, many people are taking several medications in order to manage their various health illnesses, and the interaction between various medicines is something prescribers will take into account.\n\"In most cases, these medicines are necessary, appropriate and of benefit for the patient - but the aspiration to reduce the number of medications a patient is taking, where safe and possible, is a good one. \n\"GPs will only ever prescribe medication to patients in conversation with them,and after a frank discussion about the risks and benefits of the treatment - and when alternative options have been explored. \n\"What GPs and other members of the practice team often need, however, is better access for their patients to alternative, non-pharmacological treatments, which can be patchy across the country.\""

      "text": "There is \"no clear end in sight\" to HS2 costs and delays, MPs on the Public Accounts Committee have said.\nThe committee is \"increasingly alarmed\" about key parts of the project, including a lack of progress at Euston Station.\nWithout a government decision on the station, the project \"will literally run out of time\", the committee fears.\nThe Department for Transport (DfT) said it was making significant progress delivering HS2.\nEuston Station is an important part of the first phase of the rail project, both as a London terminus and as a link to other infrastructure such as the London Underground.\nBut the DfT \"is yet to make key decisions on the design and approach to construction there\" despite having the necessary planning consents.\nThis could \"lead to yet more costs, delays and uncertainty over the promised benefits of the programme\", the committee said.\nDame Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said: \"HS2 is already one of the single most expensive taxpayer-funded programmes in the UK but there's actually no clear end in sight in terms of the final cost, or even the final route.\n\"The project was plagued by a lack of planning and transparency from the start and there are many difficulties ahead.  \n\"This project cannot simply keep sinking more taxpayer funds without greater clarity on the later phases. The development of Euston is a real challenge that must be resolved swiftly now.\"\nThe current estimated cost of completing HS2 is between \u00a372bn and \u00a398bn at 2019 prices, compared with an original budget of \u00a355.7bn in 2015 at 2015 prices.\nThe DfT said: \"We are making significant progress delivering HS2, a key part of our promise to build back better from Covid-19.\n\"We will continue to rigorously control pressures, and as our latest update to Parliament confirmed, Phase One remains within budget and schedule.\"\nThe Integrated Rail Plan would soon outline how major rail projects, including HS2 Phase 2b, would work together to \"deliver the reliable train services that passengers across the North and Midlands need and deserve\", it added.\nHS2 Ltd, the firm behind the project, said: \"HS2 Phases One and 2a have received parliamentary approval and have very clear cost ranges.\n\"Although there have been challenges - particularly relating to the pandemic - the project remains on budget.\"\nThe company said the HS2 was supporting more than 20,000 jobs.\nThe Public Accounts Committee has been critical of the rail project in the past, and in May 2020 said HS2 was \"badly off course\" and that bosses had been \"blindsided by contact with reality\".\nThe committee accused HS2 Ltd and the DfT of lacking transparency and undermining public confidence.\nFollowing this criticism, the government was now providing \"a clearer explanation of costs than we have previously seen in its reporting to Parliament\", the MPs said on Wednesday.\nAs tunnelling machines bore into the earth below the Chilterns, intense scrutiny of HS2 continues above ground.  \nHS2's huge budget, environmental impact and community disruption are making lots of MPs and their constituents angry. But last week the government's high speed minister recommitted to the project \"going full steam ahead\". \nBut there is still a major political issue for the government on HS2 - will it all get built? \nThe prime minister still hasn't confirmed if the Eastern leg from the West Midlands to Leeds will happen, and Northern politicians are starting to express their frustration. \nConservative and Labour MPs in Yorkshire see it as crucial for \"levelling-up\" the region, alongside other major rail investment they want too. \nBut the government's cheque book is under pressure after a huge year of Covid spending. And with inflation rising and costs growing, we wait to see if the chancellor and prime minister push the button for it in full - or if HS2 will be slimmed down."

      "text": "The family of two children, who were found dead along with their mother and another child at a house in Derbyshire, have paid tribute to them.\nJason Bennett said he was heartbroken at the loss of daughter Lacey, 11, and son John Paul, 13, as he laid flowers at Chandos Crescent, Killamarsh.\nA 31-year-old man from Killamarsh, who was known to the family, has been arrested on suspicion of murder.\nThe third child has been named as Connie Gent, 11, from Sheffield.\nIt is believed she was Lacey's friend and had been in the house for a sleepover.\nDerbyshire Police said they were called to the house at 07:26 BST on Sunday after concerns were raised about the safety of a man.\nThey found the bodies of the three children, along with that of 35-year-old Terri Harris, who was Lacey and John Paul's mother.\nAt the scene today, Mr Bennett told Sky News: \"I'm broken, I just want to kiss my babies.\n\"I just want to kiss them and hold them. TikTok Queen and my beautiful boy, they were beautiful.\" \nIn a message posted on Facebook earlier, he said \"life will never be the same\".\nThe children's grandparents, Debbie and Trevor Bennett, also arrived at the scene to leave flowers.\nMrs Bennett said: \"They were beautiful, well mannered kids. Terri was a beautiful and wonderful mother.\n\"Their dad was on holiday in Devon. He had to drive home knowing he has lost his children.\n\"I don't know how he's going to come through this.\"\nMr Bennett added: \"He's going to need a lot of help and our strength for him.\n\"I've only spoken to him on the phone and it breaks my heart to hear him like that.\"\nMrs Bennett said Lacey was a West Ham fan and John Paul liked TikTok and computers.\nThe Outwood Academy City school in Sheffield confirmed it was closed following the \"tragic incident\" involving three of its students.\nIn a statement on Twitter, the school said: \"It is with great sadness that the academy will be closed today.\n\"A tragic incident has taken place in the community involving 3 of our students. We will however be open to any students who need our support.\n\"Our thoughts are with all those affected by this sad news.\"\nKillamarsh is a community in mourning and disbelief, according to the Rev Canon Helen Guest, rector at St Giles Church.\n\"We can't believe this tragedy has happened in our community and it's literally a stone's throw from where I live,\" she said.\nThe church opened this morning so that people could write in a book of condolences and light candles to remember the woman and three children who have been killed.\n\"So far we've had a gentle flow of people who are coming in,\" said the rector.\nMany of those arriving to pay their respects had young children themselves. One of the mothers had tears in her eyes after lighting a candle. \n\"My thoughts just go out to the whole family,\" she said.\n\"It's such a close knit community I think it has affected everybody. I have three children and it was a very anxious time yesterday, not knowing what was happening.\"\nDerbyshire Police's chief constable Rachel Swann said the deaths were an \"understandably shocking event that has deeply affected the local community in Killamarsh, as well as colleagues, family and friends in Sheffield.\"\nShe thanked the officers who arrived to the scene \"in such a difficult situation\" and added: \"While understandably worrying and upsetting, this is believed to be an isolated incident in which those involved were known to one another and nobody else is being sought in connection with the deaths.\"\nShe said officers were particularly keen to speak to anyone who was in Chandos Crescent between 21:30 BST on Saturday and 07:30 BST on Sunday, and had any information that could help with their investigation. \nHundreds of people from the Killamarsh community gathered at Baker Park near Chandos Crescent on Monday night for a vigil.\nJenny Eells from BBC Radio Sheffield said people arrived to lay candles, flowers and teddies around a post in the centre of the children's playground.\n\"The commemoration lasted around 20 or so minutes with people of all ages, many standing in silence\u2026 some with their arms round each other and visibly upset,\" she said.\nOrganiser David Taylor, who is a local pastor from Church on the Street, said it was \"a dark day in the place I call home\".\n\"Each one of you is here to remember four people who are no longer with us,\" he said.\n\"And it is a day that we'll all remember because this doesn't happen in Killamarsh. But it has.\n\"Some of you know the family, some of you know the children, some of you will have never seen them before. But you're all here to show your respect.\"\nFollowing the vigil he told the BBC: \"Many of them wanted to be able to come and show their feelings for one another, for the community and to be there to support one another.\n\"I met the father this morning and as you can imagine he's in a really bad way and all I could do is comfort him and pray with him, and he appreciated that.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook,  Twitter, or Instagram.

      "title": "President Biden urges unity in first UN speech amid tensions with allies",
      "tags": "UN General Assembly,United Nations,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "In his first address to the United Nations, US President Joe Biden has urged global cooperation through \"a decisive decade for our world\".\nHis calls for unity come amid tensions with allies over the US' Afghanistan withdrawal and a major diplomatic row with France over a submarine deal.\nThe US also announced it was doubling its climate finance pledge by 2024.\nReaffirming his support for democracy and diplomacy, Mr Biden said: \"We must work together like never before.\"\nThe 76th General Assembly in New York City takes place against the backdrop of a climate crisis and a once-in-a-century pandemic, both of which have sharpened global divides.\nMr Biden pushed for cooperation on these fronts, saying: \"Whether we choose to fight for our shared future or not will reverberate for generations to come. Simply put, we stand, in my view, at an inflection point in history.\"\nMr Biden on Tuesday stressed that the US is \"not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs\". \nThe US, he said, \"is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to shared challenges, even if we have intense disagreements in other areas\".\nThe remark appeared to be a response to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who this weekend warned the US and China were headed for \"a Cold War that would be different from the past one, and probably more dangerous and more difficult to manage\". \nThe president also touted the pullout from Afghanistan, which has been criticised by allies at home and abroad, saying the US was ending a \"period of relentless war\" for a \"new era of relentless diplomacy\".\nMr Biden offered a key pledge on climate finance as well, saying the US will increase funding for developing countries to $11.4bn (\u00a38.3bn) by 2024. This means the US will offer just over half of the European Union's pledge to help poorer nations cope with climate change.\nThe developed world had pledged to provide these countries $100bn a year by 2020 but this has still not been achieved. \nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who is meeting with Mr Biden later on Tuesday - praised the \"massive contribution\" and said the US had \"stepped up to the plate\".\nAt the end of his first address, Mr Biden promised that the US would lead \"with our allies\".\n\"We will lead on all the greatest challenges of our time, from Covid to climate, human dignity and human rights, but we will not go it alone,\" he said.\nWorld leaders at odds with former President Donald Trump had hoped for a more stable and reliable America under his successor's leadership - but Mr Biden's most recent foreign policy moves have made some uneasy.\nThe US' lack of coordination during the Afghanistan exit after two decades of war rankled allies and led to an international scramble to evacuate. The Nato mission at the time of the withdrawal comprised troops from 36 countries, three-quarters of whom were non-American.\nLast week, a trilateral US-UK deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines infuriated the French, who had their own five-year-old contract to build conventional submarines for the Australians. French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described the agreement as \"a stab in the back\", and the top French diplomats in both countries were recalled.\nThe Biden administration has also seen international criticism over alleged US hoarding of Covid-19 vaccines and non-reciprocal travel restrictions, as well as frugality with climate aid.\nAfter four years of America First and Donald Trump's isolationist nationalism, this was a speech the leaders of the liberal democracies wanted to cheer. But Joe Biden's first appearance before the UN General Assembly will be treated with a good deal of scepticism after America's shambolic departure from Afghanistan. \nThat said, the US president was determined to push his more outward looking view of the world. And turning a page, he was able to say this was the first time in 20 years that America wasn't at war.\nBritish diplomats will have cheered his pledge to double to $11.4bn the money to tackle climate change by 2024 - something they have been lobbying the White House relentlessly on. \nOne issue that enjoys bipartisan support in Washington is the threat posed by China - the driving force behind the new security partnership with Britain and Australia. He didn't mention the world's other superpower by name, but it's clear who he was talking about.\nThe US president has had a torrid, horrid summer. This speech was an attempt to reassure America's international allies - and to put flesh on the bones of his claim that \"America is back\"."

      "text": "The UK has named two Russian nationals suspected of the attempted murder of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.\nPrime Minister Theresa May said the suspects entered the UK  on Russian passports using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. Moscow denies any involvement in the attack.\nIn an interview with Russia's state-run international broadcaster, RT, on 13 September, the two men said they were in the UK to visit the \"wonderful town\" of Salisbury and see its \"famous\" cathedral.\nInvestigative website Bellingcat has since claimed Mr Boshirov is actually an intelligence officer by the name of Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga.\nMr Skripal and his daughter were discovered unconscious on a bench in the Wiltshire city of Salisbury on 4 March. A second poisoning incident in nearby Amesbury in July is believed to be linked to the attack.\nThe British government says a military-grade Novichok nerve agent was used.\nHere's what we know so far about the movements of the Skripals and the Russian suspects on 2, 3 and 4 March.\n15:00 GMT\nTwo suspects using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov arrive at London Gatwick Airport from Moscow on Aeroflot flight SU2588.\nPolice say the men are thought to be officers from Russia's military intelligence service. \nThe men say they work in the sports nutrition business and were in the UK on holiday.\nRussian officials have denied claims by the Bellingcat website that Mr Boshirov is Col Chepiga - who is reported to have been working undercover for the past nine years after serving with a special forces unit under the command of the GRU - Russia's military intelligence service.\n17:40 GMT\nThey travel to London's Victoria station before heading to Waterloo for about 18:00 GMT. They then make their way to the City Stay Hotel in Bow, east London, for the first of their two-night stay.\nTraces of Novichok, below the levels that would cause health concerns, were later found in their room.\n14:25 GMT\nThe Russian suspects arrive in Salisbury from Waterloo on what police believe was a reconnaissance mission.\n14:40 GMT\nSergei Skripal's 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, flies into London's Heathrow Airport on a flight from Russia. It is believed she was picked up by a family friend.\n16:11 GMT\nThe Russian suspects return from Salisbury to London by train.\n08:05 GMT\nThe Russian suspects again take the London Underground from Bow to Waterloo, before continuing their journey by train to Salisbury.\n09:15 GMT \nMr Skripal's red BMW is seen in Salisbury in the area of London Road, Churchill Way North and Wilton Road.\nLondon Road is home to Salisbury's cemetery, where Mr Skripal's wife Liudmila and son Alexander are buried.\n11:48 GMT\nThe suspects arrive at Salisbury station. They are about a mile from Mr Skripal's home.\n11:58 GMT\nThe men are filmed on CCTV at a Shell petrol station on Wilton Road, not far from Christie Miller Road, where Mr Skripal lives. Police believe this was moments before the Novichok was sprayed on the door handle of Mr Skripal's house.\n13:05 and 13:08 GMT\nThe Russians are seen on CCTV on Fisherton Street, possibly on their way to the train station. They pass close to where the Skripals would later spend the afternoon having a drink and a meal together in the centre of Salisbury.\n13:30 GMT\nMr Skripal's car is seen driving down Devizes Road, towards the town centre.\n13:40 GMT\n1) Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter arrive at the Sainsbury's upper level car park at the Maltings shopping precinct. \n2) They then head to the Mill pub.\n13:50 GMT\nThe two Russian suspects return to London by train, arriving in the capital at approximately 16:45 GMT. \n14:20 GMT\n3) The Skripals dine at Zizzi restaurant and stay until 15:35 GMT.\nTraces of a military-grade nerve agent are later found at the Mill and Zizzi.\n16:15 GMT\n4) Emergency services receive the first report of an incident. Police find the Skripals on a bench in an \"extremely serious condition\".\nThey are taken to hospital along with police officer Det Sgt Nick Bailey, attending the incident. All three were later discharged.\n18:30 GMT \nThe suspects board the London Underground to London Heathrow Airport.\n19:28 GMT\nThe men are caught on CCTV going through passport control at Heathrow.\n22:30 GMT\nThe pair depart on Aeroflot flight SU2585 to Moscow.\nPolice note: all times approximate.\nA massive clean-up operation was launched to decontaminate nine sites known, or thought, to be contaminated with the nerve agent.\nUK authorities said the highest concentration of Novichok was found at Mr Skripal's house, but the operation involving more than 200 personnel, included eight other sites.\nWiltshire and Novichok again hit the headlines in July, when another couple fell ill in suspicious circumstances, in Amesbury, only a few miles from the Skripal investigation.\n09:15 BST\nParamedics are called twice to a flat in Muggleton Road, Amesbury, after Dawn Sturgess, 44, collapses.\nA friend of the couple, Sam Hobson, said Ms Sturgess appeared to have had a fit and was \"foaming at the mouth\".\n17:20 BST\nParamedics return to same address after Ms Sturgess's friend Charlie Rowley also falls ill.\nPolice initially think the two had been using heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs, however they declare a major incident after Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley need treatment for suspected exposure \"to an unknown substance\".\nTests at the UK's military research lab, Porton Down, find the pair had been exposed to the nerve agent Novichok.\nFive areas the victims are believed to have visited prior to falling ill are cordoned off: in Amesbury they are Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church, while in Salisbury and John Baker House in Rolleston Street and Queen Elizabeth Gardens.\nMs Sturgess dies in hospital on 8 July. Mr Rowley remains in a critical condition.\nPolice later confirm the Novichok that poisoned Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley came from a small bottle found during searches of Charlie Rowley's house on Muggleton Road.\nThe counterfeit Nina Ricci perfume bottle, with a specially-adapted applicator, had been picked up by Mr Rowley from a charity bin on 27 June.\nHe told police he got some of the contents on himself while he was putting the bottle parts together. Ms Sturgess applied some of the substance to her wrist before feeling unwell.\nThe working assumption of police is that the bottle was a container discarded after the Skripals' poisoning, according to BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nChildren struggling with their mental health since the pandemic hit have been facing \"agonisingly\" long waits for treatment, with data from half of England's specialist services showing one in five youngsters waiting longer than 12 weeks. Some under-18s are turning up at A&E for help and one doctor tells us hospitals have no option but to admit them to wards, even though no specialist support is available.\nA leading consultant says the pressure on intensive care staff in his area is as high as it has been since the pandemic began. Dr Michael Martin, of Hywel Dda University Health Board, in west Wales, says at least 11 of 22 critical care beds in its hospitals are occupied by Covid patients and that admission of people with other conditions is making the situation worse. In Scotland, the Royal College of Emergency Medicine says thousands of extra acute care beds are needed to help relieve the \"unrelenting pressure\".\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service says it's again seeking support from the military, as it faces increasing pressure from Covid cases. The service's chief executive says the request - which follows similar moves in Scotland and parts of England - will give them a \"head-start\" ahead of a predicted \"tough winter\". \nNorthern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says she contemplated going to hospital after being \"absolutely floored\" by coronavirus. The Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president, who returned to Stormont on Monday after announcing she had contracted the virus on 31 August, tells us she's \"so grateful\" for her vaccination.\nIn April, India - the world's largest vaccine producer - halted exports of coronavirus jabs, as distressing footage of desperate Indians trying to source oxygen for sick loved ones was beamed around the world. Five months on, the Delhi government says it will soon be ready to export again. India's manufacturers \"are expected to produce more than 300 million doses\" in October for the domestic vaccination drive and surplus supplies will be sent abroad, it says\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nCheck on the latest rules around international travel.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

Lol\".\nMs Spencer has admitted some charges, but denies urinating on the child's toothbrush, among other allegations.\nShe also denied urinating on a young person's boxer shorts, providing cutlery which she had rubbed on her genitals and adding laxatives to the food of one or more young people.\nShe has admitted to taking and sending pictures of one or more young people without authorisation, as well as sending a text message referring to her use of recreational drugs. \nShe has also admitted failing to disclose her previous work history.\nThe alleged offences took place early last year, before she was suspended from the care home, which provides therapeutic services for children and young people who present with sexually harmful behaviours, as well as those with mild to moderate learning difficulties, in April 2020.\nThe panel heard she worked at a home which provides therapeutic services for children and young people who have mild to moderate learning difficulties. \nOne text read: \"These kids are doing my head in. There is no escape.\"\nIn evidence about some of the alleged acts mentioned in the messages, Ms Jones said Ms Spencer had also discussed the acts.\nMs Spencer claimed Ms Jones had edited messages, and hacked into her social media, which Ms Jones denied.\nDelme Griffiths, presenting officer for Social Care Wales, said they were \"appalling\" messages and while there were no witnesses to the alleged acts, he said they would be \"bizarre things to make up\".\nHe added she had been caught because she had been \"bragging\" about them.\nThe hearing, which is scheduled to last five days, continues.

      "tags": "Scottish government,NHS Scotland,Coronavirus pandemic,Humza Yousaf",
      "text": "A thousand extra hospital beds are needed to help relieve the \"unrelenting pressure\" facing Scotland's emergency departments, doctors have claimed.\nThe Royal College of Emergency Medicine said many A&E units were struggling because there are too few beds available elsewhere in hospitals.\nFigures for the week to 12 September show almost 30% of people attending A&E having to wait more than four hours.\nScottish ministers will later update Holyrood on plans to bolster the NHS.\nHealth Secretary Humza Yousaf said \u00a312m of extra funds had already been announced for non-Covid emergency care. \nAccording to the latest figures from Public Health Scotland, there were 27,354 attendances at A&E services in Scotland in the week ending 12 September.\nOf these, 71.5% were seen and either admitted, discharged or transferred elsewhere within four hours - the lowest total for a number of years, and well below the target level of 95%.\nA total of 1,895 patients spent more than eight hours in an A&E department, while 551 of them were there for more than 12 hours.\nIn a BBC interview, John Thomson, vice-president for the Royal College of Emergency Medicine in Scotland, and a consultant in emergency medicine, said there was currently an \"unrelenting pressure on our emergency departments\" but that Covid was only one part of the problem.\nHe said: \"We have patients who are waiting in emergency departments who should be receiving the next stage of their care elsewhere in the system.\n\"The college estimates that we're approximately 1,000 beds short nationally and that would certainly help alleviate some of the issues relating to what we call exit block, which are patients waiting to move from the emergency department when they no longer require care within the department. \n\"Emergency departments can be very busy and function very smoothly when we have no exit block. Conversely when we've seen significant exit block, and long wait for patients to move to beds, then we can have relatively few patients in A&E and struggle to provide the right level of care that we would want to.\"\nThe Scottish government has asked the MoD for military assistance for the under-pressure ambulance service and the health secretary is expected to give more details of the plan at Holyrood later. \nUnite convener Jamie McNamee questioned the value of army personnel driving vehicles \"without the ability to emergency respond\" or having the necessary clinical skills.\nAsked how much help they would be, he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"Whilst we welcome them on board they will be little or no help to the Scottish Ambulance Service in their emergency care provision.\"\nMr McNamee expects that the military will instead work in the non-emergency sector to free up capacity by, for example, providing non-emergency hospital transport.\nThe convener also said he fears for the winter as the current situation is the worst he has known in his 35-year career.\nMeanwhile, Mr Thomson said increasing the number of beds would go \"a long way\" to alleviating the problems facing the NHS. \nHe added: \"The sole reason ambulances have to await to offload is there is no space in the emergency departments for that patient to go.\"\nBefore the Covid pandemic, the average daily number of beds which were staffed and available for patients for acute specialties in Scotland was about 13,000.\nAccording to Public Health Scotland, the number has been going down for many years in line with evolving models of healthcare provision which aims to reduce the frequency and duration of hospital admissions.\nMr Yousaf said: \"We announced \u00a312m in additional funding to boards to support non-Covid emergency care and put measures in place to reduce waiting times for urgent or emergency treatment, with a focus on boosting available beds and supported by record NHS staffing levels. \n \"The Covid pandemic has inevitably affected A&E attendance and the pressure is being felt across the UK. Scotland's core A&E departments have outperformed those in the rest of the UK for more than six years. \n\"Weekly performance is impacted due to a range of challenges including high attendances, staffing pressures due to isolation and annual leave and the continued requirement for infection control precautions that is affecting the time people need to spend in A&E. This is combined with increased levels of people attending A&E who are much sicker and require higher levels of care.\"\nMr Yousaf will face questions from MSPs at Holyrood later, with the Scottish Conservatives calling the latest waiting times figures \"shocking and reprehensible\".\nPublic health spokeswoman Sue Webber said: \"Thousands of patients are waiting hours on end in A&E departments, despite the best efforts of our heroic frontline staff. \n\"The SNP's health secretary needs to accept the reality and admit there is a crisis in our NHS, for the sake of patients and - equally as important - staff wellbeing.\""

      "tags": "HM Treasury,Coronavirus lockdown measures,UK economy,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Government borrowing was higher than expected in August as debt interest payments rose due to higher inflation.\nBorrowing, which is the difference between tax income and spending, was \u00a320.5bn, official figures show - \u00a35.5bn lower than in August last year.\nHowever, it was still the second-highest figure for August since records began.\nEconomists had expected government borrowing to be about \u00a315bn.\nBorrowing has been at record levels, with billions being spent by the government on measures such as the furlough scheme to support the economy.\nThis high spending, combined with less money coming into the exchequer due to the pandemic and a fall in economic output, has pushed government debt up to more than \u00a32.2 trillion, or about 97.6% of GDP - a level not seen since the early 1960s.\nThe interest payments on government debt were \u00a36.3bn in August. That was \u00a32.9bn more than in August 2020, but lower than the monthly record of \u00a38.7bn in June 2021.\nDanni Hewson, a financial analyst at AJ Bell, said: \"Inflation is not just something that's making us wince when we get to the supermarket checkout, it's also taking its toll on the public purse.  \n\"Interest payments on all that debt shot up in August and September will be even more painful\".\nThe government borrowed a total of \u00a3325.1bn in the financial year to March, which amounts to 15.5% of GDP, the highest percentage since the end of World War Two.\nThe figure was an increase of \u00a327.1bn compared with the previous Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimate, which was largely due to the expected cost of \u00a320.9bn on guarantees on loans to firms that will not be able to pay back.\nIsabel Stockton, research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, noted that this estimate suggested that non-repayments would total just over a quarter of the \u00a380bn loaned out.\n\"This is a big number, but not as big as feared by the Office for Budget Responsibility whose Budget 2021 estimate was that \u00a327bn would not be recouped,\" she said.\nMs Stockton added that for the public spending figures, the precise size of last year's spike in borrowing \"is not all that important\".\n\"What matters more are the strength of the eventual recovery, whether current strength in tax receipts persists into future years and whether the large income tax, corporation tax, and National Insurance tax rises announced since March are actually implemented as planned.\"\nWhile borrowing this year is coming into land better than the gloomy forecasts of the OBR, in August it was still higher than expected, and the second highest on record.\nIt was the direct impact of rising inflation on borrowing costs that drove the figures.\nWhile the chancellor is still heading for some extra room for manoeuvre ahead of next month's Budget and Spending Review, there is also some room for reflection in the revision to last year's borrowing numbers.\nThe post war record for borrowing last year was revised up substantially to \u00a3325bn, driven by more than \u00a320bnn in expected losses on government-backed Covid contingency loans.\nThis is a significant sum, about a quarter of such loans, reflecting the hidden extent of corporate distress. Though this figure is lower than some original estimates of write-offs.\nThe ongoing economic recovery will also help ensure this figure does not rise further.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak is due to deliver a new Budget and growth forecasts on 27 October, as well as new multi-year spending limits for individual government departments.\nRuth Gregory, senior UK economist for Capital Economics, said: \"With the chancellor intent on signalling in his Budget on 27 October that the fiscal stimulus seen since the pandemic is now firmly at an end, the big fiscal boost to the economy last year will soon become a fiscal drag.\"\nShe said that while tax revenues of \u00a361.2bn were higher that last August's \u00a355.8bn, government spending was \"elevated\" in August, including \u00a31.1bn on the furlough scheme as well as \u00a32.1bn on the self-employment income support scheme.\nHowever, she added that the figures showed that \"the government's financial position isn't as bad as the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted back in March\"."

      "text": "The pressure on intensive care staff is as high as it has been since the pandemic began, a leading consultant has said.\nDr Michael Martin, of Hywel Dda University Health Board, said patients with other conditions on top of Covid patients is making the situation worse.\nTen of about 24 critical care beds in its hospitals were occupied by Covid patients on Monday.\nStaff shortages have made him dread the winter months, the doctor said.\nCovid cases in the Hywel Dda area, which covers Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire, have been rising with planned surgery suspended in some hospitals due to Covid pressures.\nDr Martin said west Wales' infection rates compared to the rest of Wales were \"much lower\" in the first two waves.\n\"Now it's probably more than what we had throughout the period when it was difficult in the first two waves, especially for Glangwili hospital as we've tried to centralise things a bit more,\" he said, adding staff are \"burnt out\".\n\"Here, in Glangwili hospital, the emergency hospital for west Wales, it's a difficult scenario because we basically lose more than half of our intensive care beds.\nHe said Covid patients means \"a lot of work for everybody - they're difficult\", adding: \"You don't just cure them in a couple of days\".\nThe health board said about half of its 12 Covid-positive patients are vaccinated.\nWhile those that have been jabbed are seeing better treatment success rates, Dr Martin said he remains concerned about the number of patients coming into hospital already seriously ill with other conditions.\nThere are fears of a pent-up demand from people either reluctant to get help due to the pandemic or those who might have had difficulties being seen due to growing delays and waiting times.\nHe said cancer diagnoses are happening later, at end stage, when the patient is very unwell in intensive care. \n\"It never used to happen that way,\" he said.\nHe added that intensive care medicine is \"good at reversing acute things\" but \"patients are getting worse and worse because nobody has looked into them because the heath service has been busy [dealing with the virus]\".\nDr Martin thinks that despite a high take up of vaccinations, the pressure on his hospitals is likely to remain high throughout the winter.\nHe questioned how people will deal with Covid if it \"restarts\" in the winter \"because of all the patients we're seeing that the health service has not been able to deal with\".\n\"For me, personally, that is more emotionally difficult to deal with at the moment.\"\nNicky Hughes, associate director of the Royal College of Nursing in Wales, said some of her members were at \"breaking point\".\n\"Our nurses are telling us they are exhausted, they haven't had the chance to get over any of the last 18 months, they haven't had a let-up, every time they think there is a let-up, they are asked to do more and more,\" she told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\n\"We talk about resilience but how can you be resilient for two years at this level? It's just not going to work. \n\"Health boards need to make a decision on what services are priority and they need to priorities the safety of their staff,\" she said.\nDr Olwen Williams, who is vice president for Wales at the Royal College of Physicians, said Covid had exposed the lack of adequate staffing before the pandemic hit, and a mounting backlog of treatment and care.\n\"Health boards are being asked not only to upgrade their ability to reduce the backlog, but also try and tackle the rising cases of Covid, and keeping the two streams of work separate,\" she said.\n\"We really need some compassionate leadership here to ensure there is value for the NHS workforce, that they are getting the rest they need to face what could be an incredibly difficult winter, especially if we have a flu pandemic.\"\nOn the front line, for Dr Martin one of the biggest challenges he faces is having to deal with staff shortages. \nHe said burnt-out senior staff are choosing to leave intensive care for a \"better work-life balance\", causing him constant difficulty trying to fill rotas. \n\"After two Covid waves, a lot of doctors and nurses are trying to get out of intensive care. They simply don't want to do it anymore, they're burnt out, it's been emotionally draining.\"\nHe said very junior nursing staff are on ITU because of shortages and trying to convince junior doctors who are overworked to come in for extra shifts is \"more difficult than the clinical work\".\n\"At the moment, that is one of the most difficult aspects of the work.\" "

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Young people,Mental health,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Children struggling with mental health problems during the pandemic are facing \"agonisingly\" long waits for treatment, a BBC investigation has found.\nData from half of England's services found one in five seen in the past year waited over 12 weeks for care.\nThe situation has got so bad that parents and head teachers told the BBC they had lost faith in the system.\nAnd doctors reported distressed children were ending up at A&E as they had no where else to go.\nDr Catherine Hayhurst, from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said in many cases hospitals have been left with no option but to admit youngsters on to general wards, even though they cannot be provided with specialist mental health support there.\n\"Children are distressed and agitated. It's difficult to manage on the wards,\" she said.\nNHS England acknowledged the pandemic had been very difficult for children and young people, but it said it was in the process of significantly expanding access to services to ensure they received quick access to care.\nSue Peacock's teenage daughter suffers from severe anxiety and has self-harmed.\nShe has been waiting for treatment since before the pandemic began.\nMs Peacock said the situation has made her daughter feel depressed and start to become violent.\n\"We don't know how long it's going to be before she receives help. \n\"That feeling of helplessness, I can't even describe how awful as a parent it is to see that. \n\"You're waiting for a service that you know can help your child.\"\nSpecialist care is provided by a network known as Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).\nThese teams include psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and social workers who support children with conditions ranging from anxiety and depression to schizophrenia.\nDuring 2020-21, they saw 420,000 children and young people - although an estimated 1.5 million under-18s are thought to have a mental health disorder.\nThe waits they faced are not routinely published. \nBut the BBC obtained data under the Freedom of Information Act from 46 of England's services, half of the total, covering just over 250,000 under 18s.\nThe figures from April 2020 to March 2021 showed:\nA third of the trusts also provided data on youngsters still waiting for treatment, with the numbers doubling since the end of the first lockdown in June 2020.\nThere are signs that waiting times have improved since before the pandemic.\nBut this is likely to be down to a drop in people coming forward for help in the first lockdown, helping services tackle the backlog in those waiting for treatment.\nThe BBC has also been told some services closed their waiting lists altogether, meaning the true extent of the waits may be undercounted.\nHead teacher Michelle Catterson has lost faith with child mental health services because of the waits. She runs Moon Hall School in Surrey, which teaches children aged seven to 16 with dyslexia.\n\"The pandemic has been really difficult for children. But the support is just not there when they need it,\" Ms Catterson said.\n\"Services are completely overwhelmed as things stand currently. \n\"When I have parents that are in a really desperate situation, I'm often reluctant to refer them because I know the length of time that they'll have to wait, and sometimes there just isn't that opportunity to wait. \n\"You need that support right there, right then, to try and help the child and the family.\"\nEmma Thomas, chief executive of the YoungMinds charity, said it was clear the waits young people were facing were \"agonising\".\n\"We have seen a big rise in referrals to mental health services and, as this data shows, it's clear they have been struggling to cope. The pandemic has had a huge impact on young people's mental health, exacerbating existing pressures and creating new ones.\n\"The young people we work with have told us that they have struggled with isolation, loneliness and concerns about the future, whilst those that experienced trauma during the lockdowns, or were already experiencing inequalities, are likely to be disproportionately affected,\" she said.  \nNHS England said it was investing in services, which by 2023 would help support another 345,000 children and young people - on top of the 420,000 being seen currently.\nThis includes the rollout of school mental health teams which are designed to provide earlier support to children than CAMHS services.\nA spokeswoman for NHS England said: \"There is no doubt that the pandemic has turned children and young people's lives upside down.\" \nFOI research by Patrick Cowling"

      "tags": "Cryptocurrency",
      "text": "French firm Sorare, which sells football trading cards in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has raised $680m (\u00a3498m).\nThe NFT-based cards are used by fans to create fantasy football teams which can then \"play\" each other.\nThe funding was led by tech investor Softbank, with ex-England international Rio Ferdinand also putting in money.\nNFTs are controversial, with concerns over financial risk and environmental impact.\nAn NFT is a \"one-of-a-kind\" digital asset that can be bought and sold like any other piece of property.\nAs with crypto-currency, a record of who owns what is stored on a shared ledger known as the blockchain and maintained by thousands of computers around the world.\nPlayers can buy cards from Sorare at auctions, or fans can also auction cards they own to other players.\nSorare claims $150m worth of cards have been traded on the platform since January. The latest investment puts its value at $4.3bn (\u00a33.15bn).\nAs NFTs, the cards can also be sold on platforms such as OpenSea and Rarible. \nSorare says it has partnerships with more than 180 football clubs and has 600,000 registered users.\nA number of players including Spain's Gerard Pique and France's Antoine Griezmann also invested in the company.\nThe firm recently announced a deal with Spain's La Liga and told the Telegraph it hoped to have \"something to announce\" about the Premier League.\nSome journalists, charities and fan organisations have begun to question if crypto-assets and sports mix.\nSorare isn't the only business to have deals with clubs featuring crypto-based assets.\nClubs such as Barcelona, Juventus, Manchester City and Paris St-Germain already have arrangements with a firm called Socios to sell crypto-currency-based fan-tokens.\nThe firm promotes tokens on its website as a way to \"influence decisions of your favourite teams, unlock VIP rewards and access to exclusive promotions, games, chat & a superfan recognition\".\nBut because the tokens can be traded, some fan organisations worry clubs are encouraging speculation in crypto-currencies. \nLeeds United Supporters' Trust, for example, was critical of the club's decision to reach an agreement with Socios saying fans would be entering a \"crypto-currency ecosystem, something which many may have very little knowledge of\".\n\"If football chooses to bring unregulated crypto-currency into the game, we believe that clubs also need to provide education and guidance on the purpose and risks associated.\"\nNFTs are also controversial.\nDepending on the technology used, maintaining a blockchain requires considerable computing power with a sizeable carbon footprint.\nAs in traditional investing, financial impropriety and crime are a risk, but the protections for consumers are generally less robust.\nThere are also concerns about a lack of regulation.\nRecently OpenSea, the largest digital collectable marketplace, revealed an employee used inside knowledge to buy NFTs before they were promoted on the website.\nCEO Devin Finzer said the incident was \"incredibly disappointing\" and did not represent the team's values.\nInsider trading - where individuals use non-public knowledge about a company for financial advantage - is illegal in most regulated markets.\nBut the NFT market does not have such restrictions."

      "text": "The UK government should be keeping PCR tests for returning international travellers, Wales' first minister has said.\nSignificant changes to the travel regime in England are due to come into force in October.\nWales has not decided whether to follow suit - Mark Drakeford said his ministers face a \"difficult decision\".\nEnding day two PCR tests was a \"step away\" from the UK government's duty to people's health, he said.\nHe said the tests allow scientists to detect new variants of the virus.\nUnder the changes the international travel system for England will be simplified with a single red list, with the amber list of countries scrapped.\nFrom 4 October fully vaccinated travellers will no longer have to take a pre-departure test, or a day eight test on their return.\nLater that month no PCR test will be required on day two, replaced instead by a lateral flow test.\nThe announcement prompted concern in Scotland, which has backed simplifying the lists but may keep the testing regime.\nWales did agree to remove eight countries from the red list, including Turkey and Egypt.\nMr Drakeford told the Senedd that while there was no objection to the decision to merge the green and amber list of countries, reducing the red list was \"more concerning\".\nBut the \"most concerning\" decision was moving away from PCR tests on day two, \"because that was the strongest defence against the re-importation of viruses from elsewhere in the world\", he said.\n\"In Wales we genomic sequence a higher proportion of tests than any other part of the United Kingdom and it is that sequencing that allows the very skilled scientists who do it to identify new variations in coronavirus.\"\nHowever the fact that many Welsh travellers travel to the UK via English ports made it a \"difficult decision\", with English ports not keen to communicate differences in rules.\nMr Drakeford, who was responding to a question from Caerphilly MS Hefin David, said ministers would come to a decision \"shortly\".\n\"The real answer should have been to have retained the day two PCR tests across the United Kingdom, and the failure to do so, I think really is a step away from the duty that the UK government owes to the health of people in this country.\""
