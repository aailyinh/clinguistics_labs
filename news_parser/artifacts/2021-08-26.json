      "tags": "Germany,Leopards",
      "text": "A 36-year-old model has been mauled by a leopard during a photoshoot that went wrong at a retirement home for show animals in eastern Germany.\nThe woman, described as an animal lover as well as a photo model, suffered serious head injuries inside an enclosure that is home to two leopards, Troy and Paris.\nPolice said she was taken to hospital on Tuesday with serious injuries.\nA mobile alert that the leopard had then run away turned out to be false.\nBurgenland authorities said there was no danger to the wider population and an investigation was taking place into what happened at the animal home in Nebra in the state of Saxony-Anhalt.\nGerman tabloid Bild named the victim as Jessica Leidolph. It is unclear what she was being filmed for and who had organised the shoot. According to her website, Ms Leidolph has her own horse, cats, pigeons and parrots.\nThe owner of the site has refused to comment, but according to her website, residents of the home for retired show animals have featured in film, TV and advertising, from Game of Thrones to BMW. Troy and Paris are said to have been used in a commercial for plasma TVs.\nThe animals' living conditions, behaviour and the site's security were checked by local vets only this month, district authorities say.\nAnimal rights group Peta responded to the attack by calling for big cats to be kept only in recognised rescue centres where they could not be exploited for commercial gain."

      "tags": "Kabul,War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "President Joe Biden has promised to hunt down the jihadists behind an attack in Kabul which killed at least 90 people - including 13 US troops.\nMr Biden warned the US would \"not forgive\" the perpetrators. \nThe twin blasts, claimed by a local branch of Islamic State (IS), tore through crowds of men, women and children outside Kabul airport. \nThey were hoping to join the 100,000 people airlifted out of Afghanistan since it fell to Taliban militants.\nThere had been repeated warnings that an attack was likely, but it either did not reach or did not deter those waiting. \nUS troops in control of Kabul international airport have been facilitating the evacuation of foreign nationals and Afghans who had been working with foreign missions.\nThey have been aiming to complete this within a 31 August deadline for US forces to leave under an agreement with the Taliban.\nA number of European countries have already announced the end of their evacuation plans. The UK said on Friday it would not be processing any more applications, acknowledging it was leaving people behind.\nSpeaking hours after Thursday's attack, Mr Biden vowed to complete the evacuation mission, adding \"we will not be deterred by terrorists\". \nHe said the US military had been ordered to attack the leadership, assets and facilities of the group known as Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), active in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nThe group is part of the global IS network, but has local links - even to the Taliban. However, IS-K have accused the Taliban of abandoning the battlefield in favour of a negotiated peace settlement. \nThe attack at the airport - which began at about 18:00 local time (13:30 GMT) - targeted \"translators and collaborators with the American army\", the jihadist group said.\nThe first blast happened near the Abbey Gate, where US and British forces have been checking people entering the airport, followed by a second minutes later  at a hotel which was used by British officials to process Afghans hoping to travel to the UK.\nSurvivors described the horror in the wake of the attack, with one saying they saw \"bodies and body parts flying in the air like a tornado blowing plastic bags\". \nAnother recounted how they tried to take an injured baby to safety, only for the child to die in their arms. \nPictures being shared on social media suggest families have lost several members.\nHospitals were quickly overwhelmed with the injured. Alberto Zanin, the medical director of one facility run by Italian NGO Emergency, described on Twitter how the victims \"could not speak, many were terrified, their eyes totally lost in emptiness, their gaze blank\". \nThirteen US troops were among those killed - the first US military casualties in Afghanistan since February 2020.\nMr Biden said the troops who had died \"were heroes who were on a selfless mission to save the lives of others\". \nThe head of US Central Command, Gen Frank McKenzie, said the threat from IS-K remained high and US forces were working with Taliban to try to stop further attacks and that the Taliban had already prevented many.\nBut the attack is likely to significantly complicate the evacuation effort ahead of the deadline.\nThere are currently 5,800 US troops on the ground at Kabul airport with a further 1,000 UK troops also there. \nTo date, 104,000 civilians have been transferred from Afghanistan, including 66,000 by the US and 37,000 by allies and partners.\nAbout 5,000 people are waiting at the airport and many more are still trying to get through the perimeter checkpoints.\nA number of countries, including Canada, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Denmark had already stopped their operations. \nTurkey has announced that its troops, who had been providing security at the airport for six years, were withdrawing."

      "tags": "Companies,NHS",
      "text": "NHS England has admitted that a shortage of vials used for blood tests will worsen over the next few weeks and will last until mid-September.\nIt said supplies remain constrained and are forecast \"to become even more constrained over the coming weeks\". \nWhile the NHS expects the position to improve by the middle of next month, \"overall supply is likely to remain challenging for a significant period.\"\nDoctors had been told to stagger some blood tests due to the shortage.\nThey are warning that patient care will suffer due to delays.\nIt comes after Becton Dickinson, a company that makes vials for the health service, said it is experiencing serious supply chain issues.\nDue to the shortage, the NHS has temporarily stopped some blood testing for fertility, pre-diabetes, allergies and certain blood disorders.\nNHS England issued guidance urging doctors to delay regular blood tests if clinically safe and NHS Wales issued similar guidance.\nIn its guidance, NHS England said \"alternative products are being sought to alleviate these constraints,\" as a result of the global shortages of blood tube products.\nDr Farah Jameel, a GP based in north London and a representative from the British Medical Association trade body said she was having \"difficult conversations\" with patients about rationing the vials \"among the very sickest\".\nShe said there has been \"very unclear messaging from NHS England on how quickly we're going to run short and what the impact will be on patient care.\"\n\"The NHS needs to communicate clearly with the public and with the profession so there is a clear understanding of the problems which will help us manage expectations,\" Dr Jameel said. \n\"These tests are a fundamental part of patient care, giving us essential insights into different conditions, warning signs and overall health.\"\nDoctor Gavin Jamie, an GP based in Swindon agreed that preventative care is going to be slower, in addition to screening delays cause by the pandemic which he said he's still trying to catch up on. \n\"We've not seen the full effect yet but it looks like it could carry on for at least a few months from the time scale NHS England have been giving us,\" he added. \nGPs across the country have tweeted about the difficulties the shortage is causing, while patients have tweeted texts from their surgeries which have said their blood tests have been cancelled. \nAlison Webb, from Wales, told the BBC she was told that she can't have her yearly thyroid and cholesterol checked due to the blood tube shortages. She has a condition which means the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones and said her blood tests are currently overdue by four months. \n\"Now I've been told to ring again in a month's time. Terrible,\" she said. \nThe medical device company, Becton Dickinson, which partly manufactures its tubes in the US, said the need to test Covid-19 patients in addition to routine testing for procedures which were delayed due to the pandemic had increased demand.\nResponding to the new NHS guidance, the British Medical Association said that healthcare staff were \"still no closer to understanding how this situation was able to develop and why there wasn't a contingency plan\".\n\"Today's guidance does not explain what will happen if hospitals or GP surgeries do run out of stock, and this must be addressed as a matter of urgency,\" said Dr David Wrigley, deputy chair of BMA council.\n\"No doctor wants the consequence of delayed diagnosis for patients due to these shortages, and they also need to know they are protected from any possible negligence claims,\" he added. \nLike many other industries, Becton Dickinson said in addition to increased demand, it was experiencing \"continued transportation challenges\", which included port and transport capacity, air freight capacity and UK border challenges. \n\"Suppliers are also challenged to meet increased demand for raw materials and components,\" the firm told the BBC.\n\"We are balancing the frequency of preventive maintenance leading to plant shutdown to provide continuing supply of products, and we are working closely with our raw material suppliers, transport agencies and other necessary third parties to minimize supply disruptions,\" a spokesperson added.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Health and Social Care told the BBC: \"Patient safety and continuity of care is our priority and we are working to ensure there is minimal possible impact on patient care. \n\"The health and care system is working closely with Becton Dickinson to put mitigations in place to resolve any problems if they arise,\" they added. \nDiabetes UK expressed concerns for the 13.6 million people in the country at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes can develop more slowly than those for type 1. \nNikki Joule, policy manager at the charity, said the supply issues would make the condition \"harder to spot\" and said it's \"very important\" that those at risk \"do not fall through the cracks due to a logistical issue.\" \nGwenda Burns, chief executive of Fertility Network UK agrees that the logistical issue is \"extremely worrying\" for those awaiting fertility tests.

This figure was much lower during previous waves when vaccines were less widespread. \nIn Wales a total of 2,347,000 (74%) people have received one dose, and 2,171,499 (68%) people have been fully vaccinated."

      "text": "A former paramedic who served in Afghanistan has described seeing her interpreter and his family arrive safely in the UK as \"very emotional\".\nRachel Pompa, from Swansea, was based in Helmand province in 2006 and 2007, treating casualties during the war.\nOne of the people she worked most closely with during that time was her Afghan interpreter.\nShe remained friends with Mohammad - not his real name, and they have kept in touch for the past 15 years.\nShe said: \"Our contact built more recently, from the end of 2020, as he was part of a bigger process to try to move to America or the UK, but as things have escalated so fast and they were in extreme danger, he's managed to make it to the UK.\"\nMohammad arrived in the UK a few days ago with his wife and five children.\nThey are currently in quarantine at a hotel in England and waiting to find out where in the UK they will be able to live.\nSpeaking via video call from his hotel room, Mohammad told Ms Pompa: \"The last couple of weeks was very difficult and no-one was expecting this.\n\"To get to the airport for us was very, very difficult. The Taliban was beating people but finally we get here. Unfortunately, there are still some friends stuck in Kabul. \n\"Getting to the British forces inside the airport is very difficult. There are like six, seven [Taliban] check points before you get there.\"\nMohammad also said he knew of another interpreter friend who managed to make it into the airport, but his wife was still stuck outside.\nMs Pompa said much of her work as a paramedic in Afghanistan would not have been possible without the help of Afghan interpreters.\n\"We had a couple of interpreters attached to us and they were with us throughout, sleeping in our tents, coming on every mission, they were with us 24/7,\" she said.\n\"We couldn't have done our jobs without them, especially given the casualties we were picking up at the time weren't just British soldiers.\n\"They were sometimes Afghan nationals, French, as well as Taliban. We needed their linguistic skills to be able to interpret for us - they were absolutely vital,\" she said.\nMs Pompa recalls a particular incident she experienced alongside Mohammad when they came under fire from the Taliban as they arrived in an area with 24 casualties.\nShe said they managed to evacuate them all and return them safely to the field hospital.\n\"I can't thank everyone enough really. From the Chinook pilots, the crew and the Afghan interpreters who risked their lives to help us,\" she said.\nReflecting on her time in Afghanistan and seeing the Taliban tighten its grip on the country once again, she added: \"It saddens me that 20 years ago we started making a difference.\n\"I think we did make a difference.\n\"I'm proud to have served in Afghanistan and proud to have helped.\n\"We did save lives. The country was in a better position for our work there and now it's just really sad and frightening about what could happen next and sad to think of the families that are there.\n\"The Afghan people are lovely, lovely people and no country should face what they're currently facing.\"\nMohammad told Ms Pompa he feels very safe now he is in the UK with his family.\nHe said: \"I feel like I am with my own people.\"\nMs Pompa has already paid a short visit to see him, stopping by the hotel where Mohammad and his family remain in quarantine to drop off donations of clothes and toiletries.\nAfter posting on Facebook about the arrival of Afghan refugees in the UK, she said she has been \"overwhelmed\" by the number of donations from friends and others in the local area.\nShe added Mohammad hopes it might be possible to move his family to Wales in the future.\n\"I did see them at the weekend to drop off some donations. I managed to see them from their hotel balcony for five minutes and it was very, very emotional. I don't think any of us could believe it's actually happened.\n\"We hope to meet up as families and help his children settle here. It's heart-warming. He has five children and I have two and they are similar ages. My girls want to help his children settle in this country if they can. It makes me proud.\""

      "text": "A shortage of UK workers is hitting supermarket shelves in Wales. \nAvara Foods, which employs 350 at its turkey processing plant in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, said a combination of Covid and Brexit meant many of its EU national workers had returned home. \nLogistics UK has said there are 90,000 HGV driver vacancies in the UK and a family butcher has warned there are no young people to replace those retiring.\nThe UK government said it was working to attract UK domestic workers.\nEarlier this week, the IHS Markit/CIPS Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for August hit a six-month low, prompting a warning staff and supply shortages have taken their toll on the UK's economic recovery.\nAvara Foods, which supply major retailers across the UK and restaurants, said EU nationals once made up half of its workforce because of a shortage of UK workers.\nJim Roberts from the company said: \"The UK labour simply wasn't there, so we would supplement it with non-UK workers that were either already in the country or traveling from overseas.\"  \nHe said the company was now looking for workers but not finding them. \nUsually, the company would be getting about 80 job applications a month, but now they are getting between 20 and 30, he said.   \n\"It looks to us like it's primarily Brexit-related although probably not in isolation - Covid undoubtedly has played a part, but it's certainly not Covid on its own.\n\"We track who is absent because of Covid on a daily basis and the numbers are very, very low. It looks much more like it's a reduced labour pool and that's primarily caused by non-UK workers returning back home.\"\nAvara wants the seasonal workers scheme to be extended to help with the Christmas rush. \nMr Roberts said they needed staff for \"a number of skilled roles, particularly butchery\". \nA third-generation family butchers may seem a world away from a processing plant with hundreds of staff but the pressures are the same. \nChris George's grandfather took over WJ George butchers in Talgarth in Powys from his uncle. \nIn recent years they have had up to six skilled butchers working there but now there are just two.\n\"As people have retired there's been nobody coming behind to replace them, so as they reach retirement age there's just no youngsters coming forward to take over the sort of skills you need for butchery,\" he said.\n\"And how serious is that shortage of skills? Quite serious really.\n\"You can't just put anybody in to do it, it takes years of practice to get it right.\" \nHe said young people were not interested in butchery: \"They just don't want to do it,\" he said.\n\"It's not a hospitable place to work, it's not glamorous, it just doesn't appeal to a lot of young - I think a lot actually just like to be in front of a keyboard and just push buttons and it's more appealing.\" \nCK Stores has 31 stores across Wales. \nSpeaking from its distribution centre in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, company owner Chris Chris Kiley said: \"We have got a lot of shortages going on.\n\"There is no one product, there is no range of products, its just across the board\n\"I think its the driver shortage that's the biggest problem.\" \nAndy Richardson who chairs the Welsh Government Food and Drink Board, agreed: \"We can't deny that there may be some manufacturers issues but the biggest issue is haulage. \n\"The lack of drivers because EU citizens went back home and because of problems at HGV testing centres during Covid lockdowns. \n\"We call upon government to look at all the possible short-term solutions as well as long-term strategic issues of driver shortages which have been highlighted by industry to government for months.\" \nAt Avara, Mr Roberts said there were \"oversights\" that can be easily corrected to ease the situation. \n\"The shortage occupation list doesn't currently include skilled roles that are necessary in food production, so butchers and HGV drivers could easily join an archaeologist, web designers and nurses [who are] on that list.\" \nHe also called for the seasonal workers scheme to include the Christmas season, saying: \"Again that's an oversight that could be quickly corrected.\"\nThe UK government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: \"In 2021 and beyond, food and farming businesses will continue to be able to rely on EU nationals living in the UK with settled or pre-settled status. \n\"We are working with other departments to encourage and support the sector to attract UK domestic workers though offering training, careers options, wage increases and to invest in increased automation technology.\""

      "tags": "Afghanistan,Taliban,Islamic State group",
      "text": "A local branch of the Islamic State group in Afghanistan has vowed to continue attacks now that Taliban militants are in control.\nSo who are these IS militants?\nIS-K - Islamic State Khorasan Province - is the regional affiliate of the Islamic State group.\nIt is the most extreme and violent of all the jihadist militant groups in Afghanistan.\nIS-K was set up in January 2015 at the height of IS's power in Iraq and Syria, before its self-declared caliphate was defeated and dismantled by a US-led coalition. \nIt recruits both Afghan and Pakistani jihadists, especially defecting members of the Afghan Taliban who don't see their own organisation as extreme enough.\n\"Khorasan\" refers to a historical region covering parts of modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. The group initially included Pakistan until a separate Pakistan section was declared in May 2019.\nAt its height the group numbered about 3,000 fighters.\nHowever, it has suffered significant casualties in clashes with both the US and Afghan security forces, and also with the Taliban.\nIS-K has targeted Afghan security forces, Afghan politicians and ministries, the Taliban, religious minorities, including Shia Muslims and Sikhs, US and Nato forces, and international agencies, including aid organisations.\nIS-K have been blamed for some of the worst atrocities in recent years, targeting girls' schools, hospitals and even a maternity ward, where they reportedly shot dead pregnant women and nurses. \nUnlike the Taliban, whose interest is confined to Afghanistan, IS-K are part of the global IS network that seeks to carry out attacks on Western, international and humanitarian targets wherever they can reach them.\nIS-K are based in the eastern province of Nangarhar, close to drug and people-smuggling routes in and out of Pakistan. \nWhile most of its activities have been in Nangahar and Kabul, it has also claimed attacks in the provinces of Kunar, Jowzjan, Paktia, Kunduz and Herat.\nPeripherally yes, via a third party, the Haqqani network. \nAccording to researchers, there are strong links between IS-K and the Haqqani network, which in turn is closely linked to the Taliban.\nThe man now in charge of security in Kabul is Khalil Haqqani who has had a $5m (\u00a33.6m) bounty on his head. \nDr Sajjan Gohel from the Asia Pacific Foundation has been monitoring the militant networks in Afghanistan for years. \nHe says \"several major attacks between 2019 and 2021 involved collaboration between IS-K, the Taliban's Haqqani network and other terror groups based in Pakistan\".\nWhen the Taliban took over in Kabul on 15 August, the group released large numbers of prisoners from Pul-e-Charki jail, reportedly including IS and al-Qaeda militants. These people are now at large.\nBut IS-K have major differences with the Taliban, accusing them of abandoning Jihad and the battlefield in favour of a negotiated peace settlement hammered out in \"posh hotels\" in Doha, Qatar.\nIS-K considers Taliban militants \"apostates\", making their killing lawful under their interpretation of Islamic law.\nIS militants now represent a major security challenge for the incoming Taliban government, something the Taliban leadership shares in common with Western intelligence agencies."

      "title": "NHS blood test tube shortage set to worsen",
      "tags": "Companies,NHS",
      "text": "NHS England has admitted that a shortage of vials used for blood tests will worsen over the next few weeks and will last until mid-September.\nIt said supplies remain constrained and are forecast \"to become even more constrained over the coming weeks\". \nWhile the NHS expects the position to improve by the middle of next month, \"overall supply is likely to remain challenging for a significant period.\"\nDoctors had been told to stagger some blood tests due to the shortage.\nThey are warning that patient care will suffer due to delays.\nIt comes after Becton Dickinson, a company that makes vials for the health service, said it is experiencing serious supply chain issues.\nDue to the shortage, the NHS has temporarily stopped some blood testing for fertility, pre-diabetes, allergies and certain blood disorders.\nNHS England issued guidance urging doctors to delay regular blood tests if clinically safe and NHS Wales issued similar guidance.\nIn its guidance, NHS England said \"alternative products are being sought to alleviate these constraints,\" as a result of the global shortages of blood tube products.\nDr Farah Jameel, a GP based in north London and a representative from the British Medical Association trade body said she was having \"difficult conversations\" with patients about rationing the vials \"among the very sickest\".\nShe said there has been \"very unclear messaging from NHS England on how quickly we're going to run short and what the impact will be on patient care.\"\n\"The NHS needs to communicate clearly with the public and with the profession so there is a clear understanding of the problems which will help us manage expectations,\" Dr Jameel said. \n\"These tests are a fundamental part of patient care, giving us essential insights into different conditions, warning signs and overall health.\"\nDoctor Gavin Jamie, an GP based in Swindon agreed that preventative care is going to be slower, in addition to screening delays cause by the pandemic which he said he's still trying to catch up on. \n\"We've not seen the full effect yet but it looks like it could carry on for at least a few months from the time scale NHS England have been giving us,\" he added. \nGPs across the country have tweeted about the difficulties the shortage is causing, while patients have tweeted texts from their surgeries which have said their blood tests have been cancelled. \nAlison Webb, from Wales, told the BBC she was told that she can't have her yearly thyroid and cholesterol checked due to the blood tube shortages. She has a condition which means the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones and said her blood tests are currently overdue by four months. \n\"Now I've been told to ring again in a month's time. Terrible,\" she said. \nThe medical device company, Becton Dickinson, which partly manufactures its tubes in the US, said the need to test Covid-19 patients in addition to routine testing for procedures which were delayed due to the pandemic had increased demand.\nResponding to the new NHS guidance, the British Medical Association said that healthcare staff were \"still no closer to understanding how this situation was able to develop and why there wasn't a contingency plan\".\n\"Today's guidance does not explain what will happen if hospitals or GP surgeries do run out of stock, and this must be addressed as a matter of urgency,\" said Dr David Wrigley, deputy chair of BMA council.\n\"No doctor wants the consequence of delayed diagnosis for patients due to these shortages, and they also need to know they are protected from any possible negligence claims,\" he added. \nLike many other industries, Becton Dickinson said in addition to increased demand, it was experiencing \"continued transportation challenges\", which included port and transport capacity, air freight capacity and UK border challenges. \n\"Suppliers are also challenged to meet increased demand for raw materials and components,\" the firm told the BBC.\n\"We are balancing the frequency of preventive maintenance leading to plant shutdown to provide continuing supply of products, and we are working closely with our raw material suppliers, transport agencies and other necessary third parties to minimize supply disruptions,\" a spokesperson added.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Health and Social Care told the BBC: \"Patient safety and continuity of care is our priority and we are working to ensure there is minimal possible impact on patient care. \n\"The health and care system is working closely with Becton Dickinson to put mitigations in place to resolve any problems if they arise,\" they added. \nDiabetes UK expressed concerns for the 13.6 million people in the country at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes can develop more slowly than those for type 1. \nNikki Joule, policy manager at the charity, said the supply issues would make the condition \"harder to spot\" and said it's \"very important\" that those at risk \"do not fall through the cracks due to a logistical issue.\" \nGwenda Burns, chief executive of Fertility Network UK agrees that the logistical issue is \"extremely worrying\" for those awaiting fertility tests.

      "title": "Make universal credit top-up permanent - Tory MPs",
      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Rishi Sunak,Universal Credit,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Two Conservative MPs have written to Boris Johnson, urging him not to press on with plans to cut universal credit payments from October. \nPeter Aldous and John Stevenson said the \u00a320-per-week increase, brought in as a response to the pandemic, should be made permanent. \nThe letter comes amid warnings from two charities that cutting the top-up will push millions of families into debt. \nBut ministers have said the increase was only ever a temporary measure.\nAnd Boris Johnson said that the key focus for the government was on coming out of the pandemic with \"a jobs-led recovery\", saying he was proud to see the living wage had risen.\n\"I'm very pleased to see the way the unemployment numbers have been falling, employment numbers have been rising and also wages have been rising,\" the prime minister said.\nHe added: \"My strong preference is for people to see their wages rise through their efforts rather than through taxation of other people put into their pay packets, rather than welfare.\"\nIn the letter, the MPs, who represent constituencies in Suffolk and Carlisle and not so-called \"red wall\" former Labour strongholds, said they did \"not take this step lightly\".\nBut they told the prime minister they had \"very serious concerns\" about the ability of low income families to make ends meet if the top-up is removed. \nAnd they said they were \"alarmed to see the government unwilling to heed the widespread warnings that are coming from all quarters\" about the impact on living standards.\nThe letter read: \"Our central promise at the last election, that you articulated so well, was to level up. \n\"Infrastructure is a crucial part of this agenda, but with the emphasis solely on eye-catching projects we are at risk of forgetting the importance of investment in people in these communities, without whom this vision cannot be realised.\"\nThey told Mr Johnson that the majority of people impacted by the cut \"are in fact already in work\" and  \"low paid, hardworking families will see up to \u00a31,040 slashed from their income\". \nThe \u00a320-a-week boost is \"one of our best legacies from the pandemic\" and the investment must continue, they added. \nSpeaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Aldous said the feedback he is getting in his constituency is \"that this is going to cause an awful lot of problems to a lot of people, both in work and looking for work\".\nHe said that over the past 10 years, universal credit had \"not had the funding that it needed\" and there was \"an element of catch up\" that the extra \u00a320-a-week was helping to address. \nThe MPs' intervention comes amid increased warnings from campaigners as the change looms. \nThe charity Citizens Advice has warned that a third of people on universal credit, or at least 2.3 million people, will end up in debt when the extra payment is removed in October. \nIt said the average shortfall for people would be between \u00a351 and \u00a355 a month.\nIts chief executive, Dame Clare Moriarty, said: \"A cut to universal credit this autumn will be a hammer blow to millions of people.\n\"It undermines our chance of a more equal recovery by tipping families into the red and taking money from the communities most in need.\n\"The government must listen to the growing consensus that it should reverse course and keep this vital lifeline.\"\nIn a separate breakdown of the figures, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which campaigns against poverty, said a third of working age families would be affected in more than 400 constituencies across Britain. \nDeputy director of policy at the charity, Katie Schmuecker, said with warnings coming from all sides, \"now is the time for all MPs to step up and oppose this cut to their constituents' living standards\". \nShe added: \"Plunging low-income families into deeper poverty and debt as well as sucking billions of pounds out of local economies is no way to level up.\n\"It's not too late for the prime minister and chancellor to listen to the huge opposition to this damaging cut and change course.\"\nSpeaking on the Today programme, one universal credit claimant, Karen, said the extra \u00a320 a week had meant \"everything\" to her.\nShe went on to the benefit after being unable to return to work after a car accident, and has had notification that her payment will revert to the old rate after her September instalment. \nShe said: \"I've found everything is so much more expensive now especially with lots of shortages in the shops. \n\"You can't make a choice and budget like you used to be able to do. \n\"Everything still has to be paid, the electricity bill still has to be paid.\"\nThe universal credit uplift was designed to be a temporary measure to help people through the pandemic. \nAnd the number of people on the benefit has doubled over the course of the crisis - so the extra money costs a lot at a time when the Treasury is trying to bring spending under control.\nBut charities and opposition parties argue removing the extra \u00a320 a week will have a devastating impact on individuals and families already struggling to make ends meet. \nThere was a debate in government over ending the uplift - the Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey argued for it to stay. \nAnd several Conservatives are nervous about the impending change - with this letter a sign of how unhappy some backbenchers are. \nThe question is whether more will speak out in the coming weeks, and how much pressure they will put on No 10 and 11 to have a rethink.\nLabour also criticised the cut, saying it would hit the lowest paid hardest and damage the country's economic recovery.\nShadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said: \"Time is running out for the Conservatives to see sense, back struggling families and cancel their cut to universal credit. \n\"Labour would maintain the uplift until we can replace universal credit with a fairer social security system.\"\nSpeaking in July, Chancellor Rishi Sunak confirmed the uplift would be scrapped \"as it was always intended to be a temporary measure\". \nHe said like the furlough scheme, the top-up was part of the policies put in place to deal with the crisis and would have to come to an end. \nAnd he said ministers thought the best approach going forward to support people was to \"help them into work and make sure those jobs are well paid\".\nA government spokesman said: \"The temporary uplift to universal credit was designed to help claimants through the economic shock and financial disruption of the toughest stages of the pandemic, and it has done so. \n\"Universal credit will continue to provide a vital safety net and with record vacancies available, alongside the successful vaccination rollout, it's right that we now focus on our Plan for Jobs, helping claimants to increase their earnings by boosting their skills and getting into work, progressing in work or increasing their hours.\""

      "title": "UK loses 83% of department stores since BHS collapsed",
      "text": "The UK has lost 83% of its main department stores in the five years since the collapse of the BHS chain.\nThe figure highlights the extent of the upheaval in the High Street as the Covid pandemic sped up changes in shopping habits. \nThe data, compiled by commercial property information firm CoStar Group, also reveals that more than two-thirds of these shops remain unoccupied.\nSome 237 big stores have yet to be taken over by a new business.\n\"The data undoubtedly highlights the acceleration of change in the retail sector in recent years, which the pandemic has only exacerbated,\" said CoStar Group's head of analytics, Mark Stansfield.  \nCoStar tracked the UK's largest chains, from BHS and Beales to Debenhams and House of Fraser, from 2016 to the present day.\nFive years ago, they had 467 stores between them. Now, however, only 79 are left.\nCoStar Group also examined what had happened to the 388 that had closed.  \nAlthough 237 are currently sitting empty, 52 already have either firm plans in place or early planning approval for a change of use or repurposing. The research was done in July. \nMr Stansfield told the BBC he believed the pace of change would soon step up.\n\"We are increasingly seeing forward-thinking real estate owners getting ahead of the problem and reshaping what are key assets in our town centres to provide a focal point for regeneration,\" he said.\n\"I think we'll see many more plans come to light in the coming months. With these store closures come new opportunities.\" \nDepartment stores have long been the cornerstone of UK shopping areas. Many are in purpose-built shopping centres, while some occupy historic buildings. \nFiguring out what to do with all this redundant space is one of the biggest challenges for landlords, as well as for the town centres that host those properties.  \nBHS is a good illustration of why there is no quick fix for the problem. Five years after the retailer ceased trading, a quarter of its former outlets have still failed to attract new tenants.\nIn 2016, the BBC visited the old BHS store on Edinburgh's Princes Street, one of the biggest in the chain. The owners already had new ideas for the site - and crucially, they decided to turn it into a building with a mix of different uses. \nIts six floors, once riddled with asbestos, have slowly been transformed. The old staff locker rooms and half of the building have been turned into hotel bedrooms by Premier Inn.\nThey're also putting the finishing touches to a state-of the art office right at the top, while the basement will hopefully become a bowling alley. There will also eventually be retail, just a lot less than before. \n\"It costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time to turn these large format spaces into new uses,\" says the architect behind the project, Frank Hinds of CDA. \n\"In development terms, we did this in a relatively short space of time.\" \nWhen it comes to repurposing, says Mr Hinds, the stumbling blocks are often financial. Investors have to be able to make a return to justify the huge investment. Luckily for this BHS, it's on a world-class street.  \n\"The viability comes from the location and the desire that people have to be in that location,\" he adds. \nFor Premier Inn, the hotelier involved, it was an opportunity too good to miss. \"Buildings like this don't come along very often with beautiful views across to the castle,\" says Valerie Graham, regional operations director.  \n\"Seeing so many people get use of the space is just fantastic. And the demand is there. We're creating jobs too.\" \nEdinburgh has lost four of its main department stores in the past few years, but, fortunately, there are solutions under way for all of them. \nFor instance, the former House of Fraser store at the other end of Princes Street is about to open its doors as the Johnnie Walker Whisky Experience. \nFilling the gaps in smaller towns is a much greater challenge. In Dumfries, the old Debenhams store is still vacant.\nIt's the biggest retail unit in the town, with no takers so far for the space.\n\"It comes down to money,\" says Scott Mackay, who runs the Midsteeple Quarter, a local company founded to benefit the community. \nThrough crowdfunding, donations and public money, it's buying old, empty, shops and bringing them back to life with new tenants. \n\"This is a small rural town historically and there isn't the amount of money to be invested in Dumfries compared with our bigger cities. We stand or fall on our own two feet,\" he says.\nWould he like to take on the former Debenhams site as well? \"If we had the funding, absolutely we would take on a building like this,\" he says. \n\"I think it would make a great small boutique cinema or food court on the ground floor, with potentially residential on the upper floors.\" \nSome of form of intervention is needed, he believes, to avoid the store sitting empty for years. \nDebenhams is a more recent casualty of the changing High Street environment than BHS, having shut its last stores in May this year.\nIn all, 149 former Debenhams stores are currently vacant, as the data from CoStar Group shows.\nCoStar Group's team has been scouring planning applications and talking to property agents on the ground as well as big landlords for this research, which is the most comprehensive picture to date on the huge structural changes to have hit this part of British retail. \nThe appetite for quality shop space hasn't completely diminished. For instance, Next has already taken space in Debenhams stores for its new beauty concept, while Mike Ashley is redeveloping or re-letting space for his Flannels brand. \nBut if BHS is anything to go by, reviving many of these these vast sites will take time, as well as some radical thinking.

      "tags": "Tourism,Travel,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Canada and Denmark are among seven countries moving to the green list in the latest changes to Covid restrictions.\nThailand and Montenegro are being added to the UK government's red list - meaning they are considered to be among the highest-risk destinations.\nFinland, the Azores, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Lithuania are also moving to the green list.\nThe changes will come into force at 04:00 BST on Monday. \nTravellers coming from green list countries do not have to quarantine when they come back to the UK - whether or not they have had two doses of a coronavirus vaccine. They still have to be tested before their return to the UK however, and book a test for day two after their return, and fill in a passenger location form. \nBut while Canada is on the green list, it currently has a ban on British nationals entering the country. \nOnly UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents, are allowed in to the UK if they have been to red list countries. They then have to pay to self-isolate in a government-approved quarantine hotel. \nThe Department for Transport said the changes were being made to the red list to reflect \"the increased case rates in these countries and the higher risk that travel from these countries poses to UK public health\". \nTravel lists are currently updated every three weeks. Most countries are on the amber list - fully-vaccinated adults do not have to quarantine on their return from these locations, but do have to have tests before returning and two days after they get back. Those who have not had both vaccines have to isolate at home for 10 days, as well as having the Covid tests.\nAirlines UK, which represents UK-registered carriers, said the \"small number of green destinations\" was making international travel \"more expensive, burdensome and uncertain compared to other countries\". \nA spokesman said: \"Too many families are having to look over their shoulders for rule changes and pay through the nose for tests, with no sign from government that this will change.\n\"As has already happened across Europe, it's time for a more proportionate system where tests are dropped for the fully-vaccinated and from destinations where Covid risks are low, with tougher measures targeted at a small number of high risk countries.\"\nSean Doyle, British Airways' chairman and CEO, reacted to the travel changes by saying \"the UK's economic recovery remains far behind our more pragmatic European neighbours\". He added: \"We also need to urgently end the uncertainty caused by the constant threat of changes to countries' traffic light status.\n\"Our green list is much smaller than that of the US and EU, despite no new variants being transported into the UK.\"\nCharlie Cornish, chief executive of Manchester Airports Group which operates Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports, said the changes to the travel traffic light system will make \"little difference\" to the recovery of the travel industry and called on the government to \"overhaul\" it.\nHe said unless the government removed the need for fully-vaccinated people to take tests, it would \"continue to squander the advantage our world-leading vaccination programme was supposed to deliver\".\nShadow transport secretary Jim McMahon warned \"any loosening of restrictions carries with it risks, particularly from variants that could undermine the progress we have made on vaccines\".\nScotland's Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the changes were \"welcome for Scots with loved ones in Canada but once again show that international travel remains challenging\".

      "tags": "Companies,Freight transport,Haulage",
      "text": "A company which supplies food to care homes and restaurants says it is taking \"drastic action\" to try to get round the shortage of UK lorry drivers. \nThe boss of Country Range said the group was buying smaller vans in the face of \"significant\" problems caused by a lack of qualified HGV drivers. \nManaging director Coral Rose said the issue was \"going to get worse\" as schools and offices return to normal. \nIndustry warnings about the impact of driver shortages have been increasing.  \nOn Wednesday, both Tesco and Iceland said there could be some shortages on the shelves in the run up to the key Christmas trading period. \nA combination of Covid, Brexit and other factors has meant there are not enough drivers to meet demand.  \nThe Road Haulage Association estimates there is now a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, out of a pre-pandemic total of about 600,000. \nThat number included tens of thousands of drivers from EU member states who were living and working in the UK. Even before Covid, the estimated shortage was about 60,000 drivers. \nCountry Range is a group of 12 wholesalers supplying food and non-food items to schools, care homes, hotels, restaurants and small shops. \nMs Rose said the shortage of drivers had affected both the supply of products from manufacturers to its warehouses and also from its warehouses to its customers. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Rose said Country Range was \"taking drastic action such as buying smaller delivery vehicles to make sure that we don't have to have people with specific HGV licences to drive them\".\nThere was \"going to be increased pressure as schools reopen, people continue to holiday in the UK, people return back to their offices, so staff feeding may reopen again, so the issue is going to get worse and we would like government intervention\", she added.\nOne short-term fix the government could take would be to a temporary visa scheme \"to encourage EU workers to come back\", she said.\nBut she wants the government to give support for people with training and apprenticeships in the longer term \"because this is not a quick fix, it's a long-term issue\".\nMs Rose also said: \"There's lot of drivers who are able to drive but can't go on the road at the moment because they couldn't take their tests or refresher course and training through the last year because of Covid, so there's potential to release a lot more drivers. There could be some increased resource in that area as well and that would help.\"\nOn Wednesday, the government said there was a \"highly resilient\" food supply chain and it was taking measures to tackle the driver shortage.\nLabour's shadow minister for business and consumers, Seema Malhotra, said: \"The chaos hitting supply chains is of the Conservatives' making. Their failure to keep their promise to cut red tape for businesses, which are struggling with more paperwork and higher costs, combined with worker shortages, has created a perfect storm.\"\nThe government said it had \"well-established ways of working with the food sector to address food supply chain disruptions\". \nA spokesperson added the government had announced measures to tackle driver shortages, which included streamlining and increasing tests.\n\"Most of the solutions are likely to be driven by industry, with progress already being made in testing and hiring, and a big push towards improving pay, working conditions and diversity,\" they added. \n\"We want to see employers make long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad.\"\nThe motor industry has already reported that van sales have hit near record levels in 2021 as a result of a boom in home deliveries and the economy reopening. \nMs Rose admitted that a firm such as Country Range buying more small delivery vans would increase the number of vehicles on the roads. \"More vehicles and more staff required to do that, it's not an ideal scenario but it's something that we're trying to do to continue to supply our customers.\"\nShe said steps were needed in order to encourage people to take up driving jobs. \"We need to make this an attractive profession and a recognised profession, not just with food service but within the whole of the UK. \n\"The average age of the drivers is over 55 - there isn't a lot of new blood coming into the industry because it takes time and money to train and people don't necessarily have that.\" \nStaff shortages in the food industry are extending beyond drivers.\nBolton-based Greenhalgh's Craft Bakery has a chain of shops in Greater Manchester and Lancashire, and delivers wholesale nationally. \nSix members of the firm's management team have been taking turns to do shifts driving the delivery vans.\nBoss David Smart told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"It's a bit of a perfect storm really. We are short of drivers but it isn't just drivers, we're actually short of quite a few people throughout the business from bakers to bakery operatives to shop colleagues to drivers to office staff.\n\"It's the August bank holiday, everybody wants to go everywhere and because we're a food service industry we try to supply all those areas. We're extremely busy. However, we are very, very busy with too few hands.\""

It looks much more like it's a reduced labour pool and that's primarily caused by non-UK workers returning back home.\"\nAvara wants the seasonal workers scheme to be extended to help with the Christmas rush. \nMr Roberts said they needed staff for \"a number of skilled roles, particularly butchery\". \nA third-generation family butchers may seem a world away from a processing plant with hundreds of staff but the pressures are the same. \nChris George's grandfather took over WJ George butchers in Talgarth in Powys from his uncle. \nIn recent years they have had up to six skilled butchers working there but now there are just two.\n\"As people have retired there's been nobody coming behind to replace them, so as they reach retirement age there's just no youngsters coming forward to take over the sort of skills you need for butchery,\" he said.\n\"And how serious is that shortage of skills? Quite serious really.\n\"You can't just put anybody in to do it, it takes years of practice to get it right.\" \nHe said young people were not interested in butchery: \"They just don't want to do it,\" he said.\n\"It's not a hospitable place to work, it's not glamorous, it just doesn't appeal to a lot of young - I think a lot actually just like to be in front of a keyboard and just push buttons and it's more appealing.\" \nCK Stores has 31 stores across Wales. \nSpeaking from its distribution centre in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, company owner Chris Chris Kiley said: \"We have got a lot of shortages going on.\n\"There is no one product, there is no range of products, its just across the board\n\"I think its the driver shortage that's the biggest problem.\" \nAndy Richardson who chairs the Welsh Government Food and Drink Board, agreed: \"We can't deny that there may be some manufacturers issues but the biggest issue is haulage. \n\"The lack of drivers because EU citizens went back home and because of problems at HGV testing centres during Covid lockdowns. \n\"We call upon government to look at all the possible short-term solutions as well as long-term strategic issues of driver shortages which have been highlighted by industry to government for months.\" \nAt Avara, Mr Roberts said there were \"oversights\" that can be easily corrected to ease the situation. \n\"The shortage occupation list doesn't currently include skilled roles that are necessary in food production, so butchers and HGV drivers could easily join an archaeologist, web designers and nurses [who are] on that list.\" \nHe also called for the seasonal workers scheme to include the Christmas season, saying: \"Again that's an oversight that could be quickly corrected.\"\nThe UK government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: \"In 2021 and beyond, food and farming businesses will continue to be able to rely on EU nationals living in the UK with settled or pre-settled status. \n\"We are working with other departments to encourage and support the sector to attract UK domestic workers though offering training, careers options, wage increases and to invest in increased automation technology.\""

      "tags": "NI Health",
      "text": "Health Minister Robin Swann has apologised for lengthy hospital waiting lists in Northern Ireland.\nMore than half of patients waiting for a first consultant appointment in Northern Ireland are still waiting longer than a year.\nMr Swann told BBC News that wait times were not \"where we want them to be\".\nThe Royal College of Surgeons has described the figures as \"devastating\" and said an urgent summit was needed to tackle the backlog.\nThe latest figures from the Department of Health cover April to June this year.\nThey show that 348,867 people are waiting for a first appointment - an increase of almost 14,000 on the previous quarter, and a rise of 38,946 compared with the same time last year.\nFifty-three percent (184,873) are waiting 52 weeks or more.\nIn this last quarter, the healthcare system was trying to restore services as coronavirus case numbers fell, before the Delta variant took hold.\nMore people were seen in the three months to June (82,788), compared with the previous quarter (71,404).\nThat is more than twice as many as were seen in the same period last year (34,645).\nThe ministerial target is that at least half of all those waiting should be seen within nine weeks.\nBut that target was breached for 285,937 patients (82%).\nThe picture is as bleak for the 112,915 people waiting for inpatient and day-case admission.\nMore than 91,000 have waited longer than the ministerial target of 13 weeks and 66,287 of those have been on a list for a year or more.\nMr Swann said there was a \"recognition\" in the Northern Ireland Executive that action was needed to address waiting lists.\n\"It's not where we want them to be - we don't want people waiting that long because it actually increases demand on our health service the longer people are waiting,\" he said.\nThe minister said the health system needed to be better resourced and said there were plans in place to train new staff to fill vacancies.\n\"This is about changing the direction of the underinvestment, not just in the health service but also in our workforce, so it takes time,\" he added.\nRising NHS waiting lists are now one of the main domestic policy challenges facing ministers in all of the UK's administrations.\nTrying to reduce backlogs of operations, caused by widespread postponements during the first and second peaks of Covid, is proving to be much tougher than expected.\nBut with more than 460,000 patients waiting to see a consultant or waiting to start hospital treatment - nearly a quarter of the population - Northern Ireland's problems are certainly more acute than those in the rest of the UK.\nWhile Covid has made things worse, the waiting list issue in Northern Ireland goes back several years before the pandemic.\nFailure to follow through on successive reform plans and political stalemate at times have been cited as factors holding back the health service.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann is well aware of the challenges and knows that radical action is needed.\nThe question now is whether he can persuade ministerial colleagues to make difficult decisions over funding and rationalisation.\nMark Taylor from the Royal College of Surgeons said that behind the statistics were \"patients waiting in pain, worry and in great distress\".\n\"It is heartbreaking as a clinician to tell patients that they may be waiting many more months, if not years for the treatment they need,\" he said.\nMary Anderson from south Belfast has arthritis and has been referred for an operation on her ankle and a scan on her shoulder.\nBut she said she had heard \"absolutely nothing\" about the treatments since April 2020.\n\"I can't do a full shop, for example,\" she told BBC News.\n\"I have to sit down regularly because the pain is just so bad and I was also advised very strongly by the surgeon to be very careful because the ankle, if I went over on it, could shatter, and that would be a major problematic surgery.\n\"So it affects every aspect of just moving about.\"\nMs Anderson said there had been \"no communication\" about her treatments and explained there was \"no support for us whilst we're on the long waiting lists\".\nOn top of the regular waiting lists, separate figures for cataract treatment show 13,306 people are waiting for a first consultant-led appointment.\nDiagnostic services are taking longer too.\nThe number of people on the list for tests is 145,301, up more than 8,000 on the previous quarter (5.9%) but down slightly on the same time last year (149,403).\nBut a third of them (48,543) are waiting longer than six months.\nThe ministerial targets state that at least 50% of first appointments should happen within nine weeks, 55% of inpatient and day case admissions should take place within 13 weeks, and overall no-one should wait longer than a year for a service.\nBut those targets are being breached for the majority of patients across the board.\nTo tackle the waiting times, the Royal College of Surgeons said recently-retired surgeons could work in \"Covid-light sites\".\n\"This stop-start approach to surgery is wreaking havoc on operating lists,\" said Mr Taylor\n\"We are urging system health leaders to do all that they can to bring about an expansion of Covid-light hospital sites and surgical hubs, to allow surgery to continue irrespective of the peaks and troughs of the pandemic.\n\"Our health service was in need of radical change before the pandemic, and the situation has only worsened over the last year.\""

      "text": "A powerful bomb blast struck the perimeter of Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport on Thursday, as civilians continued to seek to escape on flights from Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.\nAt least 95 people were killed and 150 others wounded. \nThe Pentagon confirmed 13 US service personnel were among those killed.\nThe bombing came hours after Western governments had warned their citizens to stay away from the airport, because of an imminent threat of an attack by IS-K, the Afghanistan branch of the Islamic State group.\nHere is what we know about what happened.\nThe explosion happened at about 18:00 local time (13:30 GMT), at the Abbey Gate to the airport.\nOn Thursday, the Pentagon said that there had been two explosions, the first at the Baron Hotel, near the airport's perimeter.\nBut on Friday it changed its account, saying that there had only been one. Information about the attack had been \"garbled\", according to a senior Pentagon official.\nUK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said a suicide bomber walked into the middle of families waiting outside the gate before carrying out the attack.\nHe told the BBC: \"We think it was a suicide vest and a smaller device. The individual got to the perimeter we had pushed out the day before in response to that threat.\n\"[The bomber] walked straight into the middle of those families waiting.\"\nReports say some victims were blown into  a sewage canal where Afghans were waiting to be processed.\nMany of the victims of the attack were rushed to Kabul's Emergency Hospital.\nUS and British troops had recently been deployed to guard the area around the Abbey Gate.\nAccording to one account, one attacker fired into a crowd of people, although reports also said Taliban guards had fired into the air.\nUS citizens who had gone to the area around the airport had been warned before the attack to \"leave immediately\".\nIt's believed some 95 people were killed and 150 injured.\nThe Pentagon said that 13 US military personnel, including US marines and a US Navy medic, were among the dead. A further US 15 troops were injured.\nOn Friday, the UK government confirmed that two British nationals and the child of a British national had been killed in the attack.\nImages taken at the scene showed the injured being taken away in wheelbarrows.\nHuge crowds had been gathering in the area, hoping to be accepted on to an evacuation flight.\nThe attack is likely to significantly complicate the final effort to airlift thousands of people out of Afghanistan ahead of 31 August.\nBefore the attack, a number of countries including Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, had announced that they could no longer conduct flights. \nTurkey also announced that its troops, who had been providing security at the airport for six years, were withdrawing.\nThe UK has confirmed that it will no longer be calling people forward to the airport for evacuation flights.\nGraphics by Prina Shah and Gerry Fletcher"

      "text": "Disadvantaged pupils in Wales ate less fruit and vegetables, did less exercise and had more takeaways during lockdown school closures, research has found. \nMost pupils stayed home from March to June 2020 and again at the start of 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nAcademics from Swansea University said school structure can have a big impact on a child's diet, as children prepare to return to the classroom. \nOne official who runs health sessions said their need is higher than ever.\nResearchers asked eight to 11-year-olds in Welsh primary schools to do an online survey about their health and wellbeing during the first lockdown period, from April to June 2020.\nIt found there were overall improvements in aspects of children's wellbeing, such as sleep and happiness with family, compared with similar surveys in the previous two years.\nHowever, children receiving free school meals ate fewer fruit and vegetables.  \nThe research found 45% of children who received free school meals said they had five or more portions of fruit and vegetables the previous day. \nThis is compared with 69% of children who did not receive free school meals - a bigger gap than in previous years.\nMore disadvantaged children also reported a reduction in physical activity, when the numbers between the pupils were similar in 2019.\nWhen schools closed in 2020, children who did not receive free school meals reported a big reduction in the number of takeaways eaten, while there was little change for pupils eligible for free school meals.\nLocal authority-run Food and Fun sessions have been held over the summer holidays, combining activities with an emphasis on healthy eating.\nThornwell Primary School in Chepstow is one of dozens of schools running the sessions.\nThe Wales-wide scheme, also known as the School Holiday Enrichment Programme, has been in place since 2016.\nHowever, Nathan Thomas, who has been in charge of the Food and Fun sessions at Thornwell Primary, said the impact of the pandemic has heightened the need to help children get active.\nHe said: \"They're receiving breakfast and lunch with us daily for the past four weeks\n\"We're teaching them some really important messages around nutrition but also a good opportunity, especially during Covid, to come back and have some physical activity, and also just having fun over the summer holidays before they go back to school\".\nDr Michaela James, a researcher for the Happen Network at Swansea University, said: \"Compared to those who were more affluent, there was less of a decrease in takeaway consumption during lockdown. \n\"We've been noticing that the kind of unhealthy eating behaviours and that lack of access to fresh fruit and vegetables, was really coming out in that story with those who were more deprived.\"\nThe Welsh government continued to provide funding for free school meals throughout the pandemic including in holiday periods but Dr James stressed the importance of the school setting.\n\"The fact that children have more of a routine - there is a set lunch time, set break times - I think that plays a really pivotal role in children's routines and day to day structure. \n\"I think that has a lot to do with underpinning why even though there was access to free school meals, they may not have been able to access them in the same way that they would have accessed them in school.\"\nThe Welsh government's Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales strategy said a quarter of children start school obese or overweight and childhood obesity is worse in more deprived areas.\nLatest figures showed 23% of pupils age five to 15 were eligible for free school meals in April 2021, up from 20% in January 2020.\nThe figure rises to 25% when including protection of provision for children eligible during the rollout of universal credit.\nAt Thornwell Primary School, Monmouthshire council leader Richard John said the Food and Fun scheme has been \"so beneficial for so many families.\"\n\"I think we now have a responsibility as local authorities and government to help families to take greater responsibility for their own mental and physical wellbeing so a scheme like this that encourages young people to learn more about healthy eating, the benefits of physical activity is going to be so beneficial to them in the long term\"."

      "text": "The boss of supermarket Iceland says the supply chain chaos is getting worse, just as retailers start planning for the key Christmas period.\nRichard Walker told the BBC he estimated the UK's shortage of lorry drivers was now about 100,000, with the company itself about 100 short.\nTesco boss John Allan said \"there may be some shortages\", but people should not \"over-dramatise\" and panic-buy.\n\"It's very easy to make a drama out of a modest crisis,\" he told the BBC.\nThe continuing shortage of HGV drivers is starting to make retailers nervous, as they are about to start planning for the key trading period.\nThe government said there was a \"highly resilient\" food supply chain and it was taking measures to tackle the driver shortage.\nBut Mr Walker said: \"The reason for sounding the alarm now is that we've already had one Christmas cancelled at the last minute. \n\"I'd hate this one to be problematic as well,\" he added. \"We start to stock-build from September onwards for what is a hugely important time of year,\" he added.\n\"We've got a lot of goods to transport between now and Christmas and a strong supply chain is vital for everyone.\"\n\"The driver shortage is impacting the food supply chain on a daily basis and leading to shortages on the shelves,\" Mr Walker said.\n\"We've had deliveries cancelled for the first time since the pandemic began, about 30 to 40 deliveries a day.\"\nThe simple solution he said, was for heavy goods vehicle drivers to be added to the UK's skilled workers list, to help get drivers recruited from overseas.\n\"These men and women, these HGV drivers, have kept the show on the road for 18 months during the pandemic and it's criminal that we're not viewing them as skilled workers,\" he told the BBC.\nAsked if Brexit is responsible for the supply chain problems, Mr Walker responded: \"I think so, but it's a 'self-inflicted wound' rather than an inevitable consequence of Brexit, caused by the government's failure to appreciate the importance of HGV drivers and the work they do for us.\"\nTesco chairman Mr Allan echoed the warnings, but felt the situation was unlikely to develop into a crisis. \"There may be some shortages at Christmas, but I wouldn't want to overdramatise the extent to which that would be the case.\"\nHe said that normally, the supermarket industry would start building stocks now in readiness for Christmas, but \"at the moment we're running very hard just to keep on top of the existing demand and there isn't the capacity to build stocks that we would like to see\". \nHe said Tesco, like all its rivals, was \"very short of drivers\".\nFirms from a number of sectors in the UK have been battling with a supply chain crisis due to a shortage of lorry drivers. \nSteve Murrells, chief executive of the Co-operative Group, warned that current food shortages were \"at a worse level than at any time I have seen\".\nHe told the Times that the Co-op had significantly reduced its range of some products to help serve customers.\nMr Murrells said the disruption to supply had been driven by \"Brexit and issues caused by Covid\" and the firm was retraining staff as lorry drivers to help fill vacant roles.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We have a highly resilient food supply chain. We have well-established ways of working with the food sector and are working closely with them to ensure businesses have the labour they need. \n\"We have put in place a package of measures to tackle the HGV driver shortage. Additionally, our Plan for Jobs is helping people across the country retrain, build new skills and get back into work. As part of this, we are streamlining the process for people to get their HGV licence.\"\nTesco has been offering lorry drivers a \u00a31,000 joining bonus amid a chronic shortage of drivers in the industry.\nOther companies are also understood to be offering similar incentives for HGV drivers after disruption to supply chains led to product shortages. Morrisons said it was working on schemes to train staff to become lorry drivers.\nOn Friday, Logistics UK, which represents freight firms, and the British Retail Consortium (BRC) wrote to the government to plead for new measures to alleviate the problem.\nProblems with shipping goods in from overseas could also hit Christmas, according to toy retailer boss Gary Grant. \nThe chairman of The Entertainer told the Mail Online that he had to contend with shortages of containers to bring goods in from Asia and a jump in shipping costs.\n\"What is unique to us is that Christmas is a fixed date, so we are under extreme pressure at the moment to move as much stock as we can, but are significantly behind with the shipment of products,\" he said. \n\"There's not a shortage of toys, but what will happen as when we get nearer to Christmas, the suppliers will not have back-up stock that we've previously relied upon. So the range of stock we have may be narrower.\" \nHe warned that popular toys such as Paw Patrol, Barbie and Rainbocorns could be in short supply. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A month ago, coronavirus cases were falling and the lifting of nearly all restrictions looked like it had been a success. \nBut just weeks later, infections levels are rising again, with more than 30,000 new cases being confirmed each day, and there is growing evidence immunity through vaccination is waning.\nImmunity through vaccination was always expected to wane.\nTwo studies - one based on data from the Zoe Covid Study app and another from Oxford University - suggest this may now be beginning several months after the second dose.\nAlthough it is also possible something else is at play here. The apparent drop in effectiveness could be related to the fact people are likely to be repeatedly exposed to the virus as time passes, increasing the opportunities for the virus to break through the immune system's defences.\nEither way this illustrates, once again, why we need to get used to Covid circulating.\nExperts have been clear we should expect to be infected repeatedly over our lifetimes.\nBut each reinfection should be milder than the previous one.\nAnd, for most, even those early infections will be milder than they would have been, because the vaccines remain highly effective at preventing serious illness.\nThe \"good news\", Prof Adam Finn, of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), says, is the vaccines, having effectively taken the edge off the virus by giving our immune system a head start, are still working very well.\nWhen infection rates started to fall in mid-July, scientists said we should not expect a continuous drop like we had seen during the lockdowns.\nInstead, the modellers predicted a period when infection levels would bob around - a series of mini-peaks. \nThat seems to be exactly what is happening now, with infection rates climbing but only gradually.\nExperts believe we have effectively reached an equilibrium whereby small changes - either in immunity across the population or behaviour and the number of contacts people have - can make the difference between infection levels rising or falling.\nThe national picture can mask what is happening locally. And parts of the country are seeing significant spikes in infections. In places such as Cumbria, Cornwall and Devon, tourism has been cited as a factor.\nAnd health chiefs are urging people to:\nBut there is also an acknowledgement our approach and attitude to Covid needs to change too. \nAbout 4,700 cases have been linked to a festival in Newquay, Cornwall. \nBut local councillor and emergency doctor Andy Virr says the Boardmasters festival was held in the knowledge this could happen and he is reassured the cases are not translating into serious illness. \nThere are \"no regrets\" about allowing the festival, he adds, as it brought people a lot of joy.\nBut this, of course, does not mean we should abandon all caution. \nThere are other reasons some areas are seeing a spike in cases. \nAnd in parts of Northern Ireland, with low vaccine uptake and high deprivation cited as factors, doctors say too many people remain at significant risk.\nOverall, the number of people dying remains very low compared with previous waves - showing just how effective the vaccines have been.\nAt this point in the winter wave, there were 10 times more Covid deaths than there are now.\nMore than 100 people a day on average are still dying with the virus. \nBut during a bad winter, 300 to 400 people a day can die from flu.\nThe big unknown - and the thing causing government scientists most concern - is what will happen in the autumn.\nProf Mike Tildesley, an infectious disease modeller at the University of Warwick, says September will be the crucial moment, when schools are back and people return to work. \n\"August is such an odd month,\" he says, \"it makes interpreting what is happening more difficult. \n\"In September, normal behaviour and contact levels return.\"\nAnd if the signs from Scotland are right - the holiday season has already ended and cases are rising sharply - there could be quite a jump.\n\"We are already at quite a high base level in terms of infection,\" Prof Tildesley says. \n\"So if they go up across the board from here and that translates to a rise in hospital cases, there could be problems.\"\nBut there are no guarantees that will happen - especially if we are truly close to an equilibrium whereby the levels of immunity in the population can keep the virus at bay. \n\"The truth is we just don't know,\" Prof Tildesley says.  \"And it will probably be the end of September before we can say with any certainty.\"  \nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "text": "The UK boss of Uber is to meet with the new leader of a trade union for the first time since a landmark court ruling on workers' rights.\nJamie Heywood and GMB's Gary Smith seek to end years of discord over the ride-hailing giant's business practices.\nUber recognised the union for the first time in May after the Supreme Court ruled its drivers should be classed as workers and entitled to better rights.\nThe bosses said \"the exploitation\" of all ride-hailing drivers must stop.\nIn a joint statement ahead of the meeting, Uber and GMB said an estimated 230,000 drivers were not receiving \"their legal rights\" from companies such as Bolt and Addison Lee.\nHowever, Addison Lee boss Liam Griffin rejected the claims, saying drivers were \"at the heart\" of his business.\n\"We guarantee the drivers that work with us get the London Living Wage level of earnings, as opposed to only the National Minimum Wage paid by Uber,\" he said.\n\"Drivers working with Addison Lee also get access to a pension and holiday pay.\"\nBolt said record numbers continued to earn through Bolt \"because they can take home more money\".\n\"We don't take business advice from competitors motivated by their own agenda,\" it added.\nSeparately, the former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, who spearheaded the Supreme Court case against Uber, accused the ride hailing giant of running a \"propaganda\" campaign. \nThe App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU) leaders accused the firm of failing to implement the court's ruling by not paying drivers for waiting time, which they said made up 40% of drivers' working hours.\nThe BBC has approached Uber for a comment.  \nUnder the May deal between Uber and GMB, the union will be able to represent up to 70,000 Uber drivers across the UK in discussions over earnings, pensions, benefits and their health and wellbeing.\nThe agreement came after Uber lost the third and final stage of a five-year legal battle with drivers who claimed it had wrongly classified their employment status.\nFor years, Uber resisted calls to recognise unions, which had criticised the firm for not granting drivers basic rights such as sick pay or a minimum wage.\nIt argued it was a third-party booking agent, and its drivers were self-employed, but the Supreme Court ruled its drivers were workers, a category that means they are entitled to minimum legal, holiday and pension rights.\nMr Smith, GMB's general secretary, said the deal with Uber was the \"first step towards a fairer working life for millions of people\".  \n\"It showed that when companies and trade unions work together, standards can be raised across these industries,\" he said\nHe said the Supreme Court ruling had set a precedent for all ride-hailing apps and urged others to follow.  \n\"GMB and Uber today take the next step in our commitment to ending the exploitation of hundreds of thousands of ride-hailing app drivers,\" Mr Smith said.\nJamie Heywood, Uber's regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe, said he hoped working with GMB would \"show the rest of the industry what can be achieved\".\n\"We may not seem like obvious allies, but together we made history by striking a recognition agreement to improve workers' protections and, crucially, give drivers a stronger say in how Uber operates,\" he added.\nMr Heywood told the BBC that UK employment law had been \"extremely ambiguous\" on issues such as who was an employee and who was self-employed. \nThe Supreme Court had now \"clarified\" the law and given Uber the \"mechanism\" that it needed to act, he said.\nWhen it was put to him that Uber had spent years exploiting that very ambiguity, he denied the charge, saying the firm was now able to \"keep the flexibility that workers value, but also provide them with the protection that they deserve\".\nOn the issue of whether Uber Eats riders would receive the same protection, Mr Heywood said he was \"committed to providing good flexible work across both our Eats and our rides business\".\nHowever, he said the law was different for people in the Eats business, since the Court of Appeal had ruled in June that Deliveroo riders were self-employed and not employees of the company.\nEmployment experts and unions have heralded Uber's deal with GMB as a big step forward for workers' rights that would be felt across the gig economy.\nHowever, the UK is the only country in which Uber has recognised a union, and it is still being challenged by drivers in other markets over similar issues.\nMr Griffin, chief executive of Addison Lee, said a decline in driver earnings and wellbeing across the industry was a \"product of Uber's operating practices and predatory pricing model\", which had led to a race to the bottom and threatened driver livelihoods.\nResponding to the comments, Uber said its drivers were making \"more than ever before driving with Uber, so the claim of a race to the bottom is totally untrue\".

      "tags": "Kabul,War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office",
      "text": "There could be an \"highly lethal\" terror attack at Kabul airport within hours, a minister has warned.\nArmed Forces minister James Heappey said there were \"very credible\" reports of a \"severe\" threat in the capital.\nThe Foreign Office last night issued new guidance telling anyone near the airport to \"move away to a safe location and await further advice\".  \nIt comes amid a race to airlift thousands from Afghanistan before foreign troops depart.\nThe US has set a deadline of 31 August for the withdrawal of its troops, with President Joe Biden rejecting calls from Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other allies for an extension.\nMr Heappey did not give a date for the last UK evacuation flights, but said it was likely that UK and other foreign troops would have to leave before the last American airlifts.\nOn Thursday, Mr Johnson said the \"overwhelming majority\" of eligible people had been evacuated from the country.\nHe added that about 15,000 had been flown out by the UK so far.\nKabul airport is currently being defended and run by the US, which has 5,800 troops on the ground - with the help of more than 1,000 UK troops.\nIn the update issued on Wednesday evening, the FCDO also warned that travelling by road was \"extremely dangerous\" with people alleged to have been \"mistreated\" on their way to the airport.\nThe US advised Americans in Afghanistan not to travel or gather at the airport \"because of security threats outside the gates\". Australia has also issued an alert, telling those outside the airport to leave immediately.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, Mr Heappey said: \"There is now very, very credible reporting of an imminent attack and hence why the Foreign Office advice was changed last night.\"\nHe later told BBC Breakfast: \"The credibility of the reporting has now reached the stage where we believe that there is a very imminent, highly lethal attack possible within Kabul.\"\nAsked by Sky News whether an attack could occur in the coming few hours, Mr Heappey replied: \"Yes.\"\nStressing the \"severe\" nature of the threat, he told the BBC that it had created an \"extraordinarily challenging situation, both on the ground and as a set of decisions to be taken in Whitehall\".\n\"People are desperate, people are fearing for their lives anyway, and so I think there's an appetite among many in the queue to take their chances,\" he said.\nHe said UK troops were doing their best to provide security for those queuing, but the \"reality\" was that they were only holding \"defined bits of ground\" at the airport and at the hotel where people were being processed, and would therefore be \"relying\" on the Taliban for security beyond that.\nCol Richard Kemp, former head of British forces in Afghanistan, said the risk of a terror attack had been present from the start of evacuation efforts.\nHe told BBC Breakfast: \"I have no doubt that our forces are fully aware of the threat and already, for days now, have been taking measures to try and mitigate it, to prevent something like that happening.\"\nMeanwhile, Mr Heappey added that nearly 2,000 people have been evacuated on eight RAF flights in the past 24 hours, with 11 more flights scheduled on Thursday.\nAsked about the estimate that nearly 2,000 people eligible for the UK government's relocation programme - the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (ARAP) - remained in Afghanistan, Mr Heappey said the actual number was \"potentially half\" of that.\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace told MPs that some Afghans wanting to flee to Britain may be better off trying to reach one of the country's borders and making their way to a third country.\nSpeaking in an online meeting, Mr Wallace is reported to have signalled there were few places left on evacuation flights and said \"not everyone is going to get out\". \nBut former Tory defence minister Tobias Ellwood, one of the MPs at the meeting, has said any land corridors would have to be agreed with the Taliban if the UK was to avoid the risk of putting people in harm's way.\nAnother Conservative MP, Julian Lewis, said he had raised the issue of 12 academics in Afghanistan who are at risk from the Taliban.\nMr Wallace told the MPs that all cases raised with him of people who are in serious danger would be considered by the teams processing urgent requests for evacuation.\nBy Secunder Kermani, BBC Pakistan and Afghanistan correspondent\nIt's incredible and very distressing to see huge numbers of people still turning up to the airport. \nWhole families, old women sitting in wheelbarrows because they are unable to walk, young children being carried by their parents. \nJust an endless stream walking through the filth, the dust, the heat. At times, they're facing gunshots.\nA large number of them have no realistic chance of boarding the evacuation flights because they just don't have the right paperwork, making it even more difficult for the handful that do have the right paperwork or are foreign citizens to push their way through the crowd.\nI was speaking to one elderly woman yesterday, her son was a former interpreter for the US Army. \nThey had all been told to go to the airport but they'd spent six days and six nights living in awful conditions in a kind of make-shift camp.\nI asked her, given all of this, isn't it worth just sticking it out in Afghanistan and seeing how things go? \nShe said: \"We just don't have that option. The Americans should shoot us or they should let us through - but we are not staying here.\"\nAny information about the threat from IS-K (a branch of the Islamic State group) or warnings about potential attacks from suicide bombers takes a long time to filter down to those people making their way to the airport - and they're so desperate that their priority is just to find some way out.\nLabour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the latest government advice was a \"further blow to desperate families who have been struggling to get to the airport\".\nShe said so many people who have worked with the UK government and military were now at grave risk.\nThe BBC's chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet said many Afghans would remain unaware of the Foreign Office advice and would continue to make their way to Kabul airport.\nSince the Taliban takeover, more than 82,000 people have been airlifted out of Kabul airport, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said.  \nMr Blinken said the Taliban had promised to allow foreigners and Afghans to leave beyond the end of August, adding that the US and its allies had \"a responsibility to hold [the Taliban] to that commitment\".

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nThe UK could join the likes of the US, Canada, France and the Netherlands, which are vaccinating children aged 12 and over against Covid-19. NHS organisations in England have been told to prepare for a possible rollout to all 12 to 15-year-olds as experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation look at whether to recommend this course of action. Some children in that age group can get the jab but only if they live with a vulnerable adult or have certain health conditions. But the Department of Health says no decisions have been made on a wider rollout, but it is planning for a range of scenarios.\nA shortage of collection tubes - or vials - have meant the NHS has temporarily stopped some blood tests for certain conditions like screening for pre-diabetes and allergies. Becton Dickinson, which makes the vials for the NHS, blames unprecedented demand driven by testing Covid patients and also the resumption of routine testing that was delayed due to the pandemic. NHS England is urging doctors to stagger regular blood tests if clinically safe. NHS Wales has also issued similar advice.\nThere is growing evidence immunity through vaccination is waning, but that was always expected to happen. Experts have been clear we should expect to be infected repeatedly over our lifetimes, but each reinfection should be milder. With infection rates rising again, how concerned should we be? Health correspondent Nick Triggle has taken a closer look.\nJapan has suspended the use of the Moderna vaccine after \"foreign materials\" were found in some doses. About 1.63 million of them will not be used after some doses in a batch of roughly 560,000 vials were contaminated. Takeda Pharmaceutical, which sells and distributes the vaccine in Japan, says Moderna had put three batches on hold \"out of an abundance of caution\", adding an issue at a manufacturing contract site in Spain was the likely cause.\n\"Let it go, let it go, can't hold it back anymore, let it go, let it go...\" That's the song you will have heard (time and time again) if you've watched Disney movie Frozen, and now the stage adaption is about to hit the West End. The cast has had extra time for rehearsals after the pandemic froze the theatre industry but will the stage musical recreate the film's magic?\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nWith evidence that immunity through vaccination wanes, what's the best way to top it up?

      "tags": "Royal Marines,Tokyo",
      "text": "BBC presenter JJ Chalmers has said he \"burst into tears\" when he realised the pilot flying him to the Tokyo Paralympics was the same man who flew him home injured from Afghanistan.\nChalmers was injured in a bomb blast while serving as a Royal Marine Commando in Afghanistan in 2011.\nWhile on the plane to Tokyo to cover the Paralympics for BBC Radio 5 Live, an air stewardess pulled him aside and said the pilot had recognised his name.\nChalmers said he felt \"overwhelmed\".\nChalmers - whose full name is Lance Corporal John James Chalmers - was flown home in an induced coma and had more than 30 operations after treading on an explosive device in Helmand Province.\nTen years later, he told 5 Live Breakfast he was on the plane to Tokyo - already \"so excited\" to be on the way to do his dream job of presenting at the Paralympics - when the air hostess came over.\n\"She sort of brought me to one side she said: 'Mr Chalmers am I right in saying you served in Afghanistan?' And I was like where is this going? What is going on here?\n\"And she said: 'Our pilot actually flew you back from Afghanistan, flew you back into the UK when you were injured 10 years ago, and he's noticed that and he'd like you to come this way, he's going to take the plane off and then he's going to come and have a word with you.'\n\"And I burst into tears, that was my reaction to that.\"\nChalmers said at first he felt some apprehension towards meeting the pilot. \n\"He's seen me unconscious, but like someone so profound and important in my life that you never think that you're going to meet, so I was overwhelmed by emotion,\" he said. \nAnd he said he was glad to be travelling with Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson, as \"I would've just been a blubbering mess otherwise.\"\nExplaining how the pilot realised he was onboard, Chalmers said: \"They get the passenger manifest three days before and he always takes a bit of a glance down and he said, particularly when you're working on something like this, you know there's going to be athletes and what not on board.\n\"He recognised my name, he googled it, and he found one of the first articles come up gave the specific date that I was injured, on 27 May 2011.\n\"So he took out his old RAF flying log, and he looked down it, and did the maths and figured out - yeah, right enough it was him that had brought me back and so he brought the log along with him.\n\"It was really nice... we were able to just talk like two veterans and it was really nice to, you know, pass the time talking to someone that sort of had a familiar background to what I did.\"\nChalmers said that when he got off the plane he told the pilot: \"I owe something that I'll never be able to repay to you, I'm unbelievably grateful for what you did for me - thank you - and in fairness his response was just perfect it was: 'We all had a job to do, that's what you did, that's what I did, that's what we all did.'\"\nAfter leaving the military, Chalmers won medals in non-amputee cycling in the Invictus Games and has since become a TV presenter, hosting coverage of the Paralympics. He also starred in Strictly Come Dancing last year."

      "text": "Mike Ashley's Frasers Group has offered the retail tycoon's future son-in-law a \u00a3100m bonus - but only if he can more than double the share price.\nThe Sports Direct owner has put forward the bonus plan for Michael Murray when he becomes chief executive in May 2022.\nHowever, he will only collect if its share price reaches \u00a315 for 30 trading days in a row before October 2025, up from its current level of about \u00a36.50.\nThe company described the target as \"challenging but achievable\".\nMr Murray, 31, engaged to be married to Mr Ashley's daughter Anna, is currently \"head of elevation\" at Frasers and is in charge of modernising stores and transforming the business.\nThe board of Frasers Group, which owns Sports Direct and House of Fraser, said it had also recommended \u00a31m a year salary for Mr Murray.\nShareholders are set to vote on the proposed bonus scheme at the group's annual general meeting on 29 September. \nMr Ashley is due to step down as chief executive when Mr Murray takes over, but will remain on the board as an executive director.\nMr Ashley founded Sports Direct in 1982 and retains 64% of the group.\nThe company listed its shares on the stock exchange in 2007, with shares priced at 300p. Prices surged to more than 900p in early 2014. \nWorries over corporate governance and working conditions, as well as the impact of Covid on retailers, have since hit the share price.\nThe group was renamed Frasers in December 2019, following its takeover of House of Fraser, but stores retained the Sports Direct brand.\nSports Direct promised in 2016 to end zero-hours contracts and offer its workers guaranteed hours, but unions have since accused the company of breaking that pledge.\nThe firm has attracted criticism for continuing to recruit workers on zero-hours contracts during the pandemic.\n\"The board believes that the significant increase in value of the shares to be achieved before Michael's share option award vests is suitably challenging but achievable and would be evidence of the success of the group's elevation strategy and Michael's leading role in this,\" the company said.\nMr Murray has been working for the group for several years, but his role at the company raised eyebrows after reports about him being paid millions of pounds in consultancy fees.\nMr Ashley was previously executive deputy chairman of the retail group - which changed its name from Sports Direct International to Frasers Group two years ago - until 2016, when long-serving chief executive Dave Forsey resigned.\nMr Ashley, 56, has been one of the High Street's most prominent and colourful figures since founding his business.

Those already outside the airport are advised to leave the area immediately.\nMore than 82,000 people have been airlifted from Kabul, which fell to the Taliban 10 days ago. \nCountries are rushing to evacuate people by a 31 August deadline. \nThousands of people are still waiting inside and outside the airport, hoping to fly out of the country. \nThe Taliban have opposed extending the deadline but also promised to allow foreigners and Afghans to leave the country beyond 31 August, according to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. \nOn Thursday, Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Marise Payne, said: \"There is an ongoing and very high threat of a terrorist attack\". \nIt comes hours after the US State Department told those waiting at the Abbey Gate, East Gate or North Gate to \"leave immediately\". \nThe UK issued similar advice asking people there to \"move away to a safe location and await further advice\". \nThe Foreign Office said that the security situation in Afghanistan \"remains volatile\" adding that there was \"an ongoing and high threat of a terrorist attack\". \nNone of the countries gave any further information on the security threat. \nIn a speech on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden said the US-controlled airlift would have to come to an end soon because of an increasing threat from the Islamic State group in Afghanistan. \nAbout 19,000 people have been evacuated on US-organised flights in the past 24 hours, Mr Blinken said on Wednesday, with airlifts stepped up in recent days amid scenes of chaos. \nHe said that the US was still on track to complete operations at Kabul airport by the end of the month. \n\"Only the United States could organise and execute a mission of this scale and this complexity,\" he told reporters in Washington.\n\"The Taliban have made public and private commitments to provide and permit safe passage for Americans, for third-country nationals and Afghans at risk past August 31st,\" he said.\nHe added that the US would help those who wanted to leave Afghanistan \"not just during the duration of our evacuation and relocation mission, but every day thereafter\".\nUp to 1,500 US nationals could still be in the country and the administration was making exhaustive efforts to trace them, the secretary of state said.\nThe CIA and the US military have been carrying out clandestine operations to extract Americans using helicopters and ground troops, US and other officials have told the Wall Street Journal.\nThe perilous operations have been both inside and outside of Kabul, the paper says.\nThe Pentagon has said 10,000 people are still waiting to be evacuated from Kabul airport by US aircraft. There are fears for thousands more Afghans who are desperate to leave but cannot reach the site.\nBBC correspondents say many of those being turned back by the Taliban at the airport gates appear to have travel papers.\nPresident Joe Biden tweeted that the US would \"do everything\" to \"provide safe evacuation\".\nThe UK said its evacuation operation was moving at \"significant pace\", with some 1,200 people flown out on Wednesday.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said his government would use \"every hour and day that we've got left\" to fly British nationals and eligible Afghans out.\nKabul airport is currently being defended by 5,800 US and 1,000 British troops."

an increase of almost 14,000 on the previous quarter, and a rise of 38,946 compared with the same time last year.\nFifty-three percent (184,873) are waiting 52 weeks or more.\nIn this last quarter, the healthcare system was trying to restore services as coronavirus case numbers fell, before the Delta variant took hold.\nMore people were seen in the three months to June (82,788), compared with the previous quarter (71,404).\nThat is more than twice as many as were seen in the same period last year (34,645).\nThe ministerial target is that at least half of all those waiting should be seen within nine weeks.\nBut that target was breached for 285,937 patients (82%).\nThe picture is as bleak for the 112,915 people waiting for inpatient and day-case admission.\nMore than 91,000 have waited longer than the ministerial target of 13 weeks and 66,287 of those have been on a list for a year or more.\nMr Swann said there was a \"recognition\" in the Northern Ireland Executive that action was needed to address waiting lists.\n\"It's not where we want them to be - we don't want people waiting that long because it actually increases demand on our health service the longer people are waiting,\" he said.\nThe minister said the health system needed to be better resourced and said there were plans in place to train new staff to fill vacancies.\n\"This is about changing the direction of the underinvestment, not just in the health service but also in our workforce, so it takes time,\" he added.\nRising NHS waiting lists are now one of the main domestic policy challenges facing ministers in all of the UK's administrations.\nTrying to reduce backlogs of operations, caused by widespread postponements during the first and second peaks of Covid, is proving to be much tougher than expected.\nBut with more than 460,000 patients waiting to see a consultant or waiting to start hospital treatment - nearly a quarter of the population - Northern Ireland's problems are certainly more acute than those in the rest of the UK.\nWhile Covid has made things worse, the waiting list issue in Northern Ireland goes back several years before the pandemic.\nFailure to follow through on successive reform plans and political stalemate at times have been cited as factors holding back the health service.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann is well aware of the challenges and knows that radical action is needed.\nThe question now is whether he can persuade ministerial colleagues to make difficult decisions over funding and rationalisation.\nMark Taylor from the Royal College of Surgeons said that behind the statistics were \"patients waiting in pain, worry and in great distress\".\n\"It is heartbreaking as a clinician to tell patients that they may be waiting many more months, if not years for the treatment they need,\" he said.\nMary Anderson from south Belfast has arthritis and has been referred for an operation on her ankle and a scan on her shoulder.\nBut she said she had heard \"absolutely nothing\" about the treatments since April 2020.\n\"I can't do a full shop, for example,\" she told BBC News.\n\"I have to sit down regularly because the pain is just so bad and I was also advised very strongly by the surgeon to be very careful because the ankle, if I went over on it, could shatter, and that would be a major problematic surgery.\n\"So it affects every aspect of just moving about.\"\nMs Anderson said there had been \"no communication\" about her treatments and explained there was \"no support for us whilst we're on the long waiting lists\".\nOn top of the regular waiting lists, separate figures for cataract treatment show 13,306 people are waiting for a first consultant-led appointment.\nDiagnostic services are taking longer too.\nThe number of people on the list for tests is 145,301, up more than 8,000 on the previous quarter (5.9%) but down slightly on the same time last year (149,403).\nBut a third of them (48,543) are waiting longer than six months.\nThe ministerial targets state that at least 50% of first appointments should happen within nine weeks, 55% of inpatient and day case admissions should take place within 13 weeks, and overall no-one should wait longer than a year for a service.\nBut those targets are being breached for the majority of patients across the board.\nTo tackle the waiting times, the Royal College of Surgeons said recently-retired surgeons could work in \"Covid-light sites\".\n\"This stop-start approach to surgery is wreaking havoc on operating lists,\" said Mr Taylor\n\"We are urging system health leaders to do all that they can to bring about an expansion of Covid-light hospital sites and surgical hubs, to allow surgery to continue irrespective of the peaks and troughs of the pandemic.\n\"Our health service was in need of radical change before the pandemic, and the situation has only worsened over the last year.\""

      "text": "Holiday travel bans should be considered for the unvaccinated if Covid-19 cases continue to rise in Wales, one GP has recommended.\nIt comes as no changes are made to Wales' Covid restrictions in the latest review, while Covid cases in Wales are currently the highest since January.\nWales' first minister has urged people to protect communities and get vaccinated to stop the virus spreading.\nDr Mair Williams said rules were needed to encourage people to get a Covid jab.\nThe Tories said they had expected no changes to the rules in Friday's three-week review. Plaid Cymru called on ministers to be \"upfront about what the data is telling them\" on how the vaccination programme has affected hospitalisation from Covid.\nAlmost all restrictions to daily life were lifted after Wales was placed under Alert Level Zero on 7 August, with official social distancing laws scrapped and limits on who can meet coming to an end.\nMark Drakeford confirmed on Friday that no significant changes would be made to restrictions, but warned the \"public health position is worse than it was three weeks ago\".\nHe said the case for vaccine certificates to enter \"higher risk settings\" - such as nightclubs - would be considered again when restrictions were reviewed on 16 September.\nWhile Wales' Covid case rate and numbers are the highest since January, Public Health Wales figures show deaths and hospital admissions remain much lower due to the vaccine rollout.\nAnd rising cases were anticipated with restrictions easing and people mixing more.\nSwansea and Neath Port Talbot have Wales' highest case rates and it comes after the local health board said 80 cases were tracked to people going out to a \"dozen pubs, nightclubs and celebration venues\".\nDr Williams, who works at a practice in Skewen, Neath Port Talbot, said people not getting vaccinated were \"the biggest problem\" and the only way to bring down case rates was to \"restrict\" what unvaccinated people do.\n\"They cannot go to pubs and restaurants with other people,\" said Dr Williams.\n\"And they cannot go on holiday because of the risk of infection and also maybe not go into the workplace as well - to work at home.\n\"I think you have to do that to stop this virus spreading any further.\"\nDr Williams said anti-vaccination conspiracy theories were causing issues, and while you could not make people have the jab, it was possible to convince them.\n\"Most people, when you do discuss it with them, actually have the vaccine,\" she said.\n\"I think the public messaging has been good enough but you're always going to have some doubters, that's the problem.\"\nWales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: \"We are concerned by the increasing rates but that fits in with the modelling that we had predicted and the comforting part of this is that we are not seeing those cases translate into hospitalisations at the rate we were seeing in December.\n\"At this point I think it is important that we hold our nerve, that people take precautions so we don't see it spreading further than necessary and that people stay outside if possible over the bank holiday weekend simply because we know that the virus is less likely to transmit outside.\"\nMs Morgan added that Wales was ready to see booster jabs introduced in September, if the JCVI recommends it.\nShe also pleaded with younger people to get their vaccine as more events take place over the summer.\nMore than 2.1 million people have had both doses of the Covid jab in Wales, however take up remains relatively low among young people.\nAlmost 370,000 18 to 29-year-olds have had their first jab - or 76.2%.\nAlmost 57% of 16 and 17 year-olds have now had their first jab, since invites began being sent out at the start of this month.\nSion Lingard, health protection consultant at Swansea Bay University Health Board, urged people to leave venues if they \"feel stuffy\" as they might not be well-ventilated and the virus could be circulating.\n\"Consider going somewhere else, or stay outside,\" they said.\nSo far, 74.3% of 18 to 29-year-olds in the Swansea Bay health board area have had a first dose of vaccine - leaving 15,563 in that age group who have not had it.\nAltogether, 43,335 adults in Swansea Bay had not taken up a vaccine (by last Sunday).\nWhile many rules in Wales have now been relaxed, the wearing of face coverings is still required by law on public transport and in shops, and health care settings.\nSocial distancing laws, and limits on who you can meet have also been removed, but measures remain in some places with businesses required to put measures in place to help keep staff and customers safe.\nAt their three weekly review of Covid restrictions, the Welsh government made small changes to rules were announced allowing brides and grooms, and guests, to remove masks for ceremonies.\nThe Welsh government said the small change helped to \"simplify and clarify existing rules\". \nHowever, with case rates continuing to rise, Mr Drakeford urged people to \"keep taking precautions to ensure the progress we have won is not lost\".\n\"Getting vaccinated remains one of the very best defences we have,\" he said.\n\"If you haven't already, then please take up the offer and join more than 2.1 million people in Wales who've had a full course to protect themselves and to protect others.\"\nMr Drakeford called on everyone to take \"everyday steps\", where possible, to keep each other safe, including meeting others outdoors instead of indoors, or keeping a distance from others when out. \n\"If you are with people indoors then opening a window to let fresh air into the room will mean the virus is less likely to spread,\" he said. \n\"We are still asking people to work from home wherever possible.\"\nA spokesperson for the Welsh Conservatives said they had expected no changes \"given the current public health situation\", adding: \"We have made great strides in the fight against coronavirus thanks to Britain's fantastic vaccination programme, which has severely weakened the link between infection and hospitalisation.\"\n\"The priority for all governments, of all colours, should be our recovery - in the economy, society, and public services - and maintaining the great progress we've made over the past few months,\" the spokesperson added.\nSian Gwenllian, Plaid Cymru's deputy leader in the Senedd said: \"All through the pandemic we've highlighted the importance of good, clear communication from the Welsh government. \n\"Now, at a time when cases are again on the rise, it is vitally important that the Welsh government is upfront about what the data is telling them - specifically on how the vaccination programme has impacted on the number of people requiring hospital treatment from Covid.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A month ago, coronavirus cases were falling and the lifting of nearly all restrictions looked like it had been a success. \nBut just weeks later, infections levels are rising again, with more than 30,000 new cases being confirmed each day, and there is growing evidence immunity through vaccination is waning.\nImmunity through vaccination was always expected to wane.\nTwo studies - one based on data from the Zoe Covid Study app and another from Oxford University - suggest this may now be beginning several months after the second dose.\nAlthough it is also possible something else is at play here. The apparent drop in effectiveness could be related to the fact people are likely to be repeatedly exposed to the virus as time passes, increasing the opportunities for the virus to break through the immune system's defences.\nEither way this illustrates, once again, why we need to get used to Covid circulating.\nExperts have been clear we should expect to be infected repeatedly over our lifetimes.\nBut each reinfection should be milder than the previous one.\nAnd, for most, even those early infections will be milder than they would have been, because the vaccines remain highly effective at preventing serious illness.\nThe \"good news\", Prof Adam Finn, of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), says, is the vaccines, having effectively taken the edge off the virus by giving our immune system a head start, are still working very well.\nWhen infection rates started to fall in mid-July, scientists said we should not expect a continuous drop like we had seen during the lockdowns.\nInstead, the modellers predicted a period when infection levels would bob around - a series of mini-peaks. \nThat seems to be exactly what is happening now, with infection rates climbing but only gradually.\nExperts believe we have effectively reached an equilibrium whereby small changes - either in immunity across the population or behaviour and the number of contacts people have - can make the difference between infection levels rising or falling.\nThe national picture can mask what is happening locally. And parts of the country are seeing significant spikes in infections. In places such as Cumbria, Cornwall and Devon, tourism has been cited as a factor.\nAnd health chiefs are urging people to:\nBut there is also an acknowledgement our approach and attitude to Covid needs to change too. \nAbout 4,700 cases have been linked to a festival in Newquay, Cornwall. \nBut local councillor and emergency doctor Andy Virr says the Boardmasters festival was held in the knowledge this could happen and he is reassured the cases are not translating into serious illness. \nThere are \"no regrets\" about allowing the festival, he adds, as it brought people a lot of joy.\nBut this, of course, does not mean we should abandon all caution. \nThere are other reasons some areas are seeing a spike in cases. \nAnd in parts of Northern Ireland, with low vaccine uptake and high deprivation cited as factors, doctors say too many people remain at significant risk.\nOverall, the number of people dying remains very low compared with previous waves - showing just how effective the vaccines have been.\nAt this point in the winter wave, there were 10 times more Covid deaths than there are now.\nMore than 100 people a day on average are still dying with the virus. \nBut during a bad winter, 300 to 400 people a day can die from flu.\nThe big unknown - and the thing causing government scientists most concern - is what will happen in the autumn.\nProf Mike Tildesley, an infectious disease modeller at the University of Warwick, says September will be the crucial moment, when schools are back and people return to work. \n\"August is such an odd month,\" he says, \"it makes interpreting what is happening more difficult. \n\"In September, normal behaviour and contact levels return.\"\nAnd if the signs from Scotland are right - the holiday season has already ended and cases are rising sharply - there could be quite a jump.\n\"We are already at quite a high base level in terms of infection,\" Prof Tildesley says. \n\"So if they go up across the board from here and that translates to a rise in hospital cases, there could be problems.\"\nBut there are no guarantees that will happen - especially if we are truly close to an equilibrium whereby the levels of immunity in the population can keep the virus at bay. \n\"The truth is we just don't know,\" Prof Tildesley says.  \"And it will probably be the end of September before we can say with any certainty.\"  \nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "text": "GPs in Scotland are warning against a rush back to more face-to-face consultations with patients as part of the government's NHS Recovery Plan.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the move will be one of the \"key actions\" for the next five years to reduce backlogs in healthcare.\nThe number of GPs will also be increased by 800 to try and tackle recruitment and retention problems.\nHowever, GPs insist the hybrid system for appointments should stay for now.\nThe Royal College of GPs in Scotland said it welcomed the government's recognition that general practice \"is going to be one of the ways out of this pandemic\".\nThe industry body also backed the announcement of increased investment to help in-person consultations eventually return to pre-Covid levels.\nBut it said a major shift back to face-to-face appointments should only be made when it is safe to do so.\nDavid Shackles, joint chair of the Royal College of GPs in Scotland, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that face-to-face consulting remained \"something that GPs and patients value\".\nHe said: \"It was only when we had the pandemic that there was this increased need for remote consulting.\n\"The model has served us very well throughout the pandemic.\n\"General practice is still open for face-to-face consultations when clinically necessary, and we see the likelihood of increasing face-to-face consultations as it becomes safe to do that. But we have got to make sure it is safe.\"\nDr Shackles pointed to the continued rise in Covid cases - with positives tests hitting a record high of 5,021 on Wednesday - as the main reason to be cautious.\nHe said \"With case numbers and hospitalisations rising, we've got to make sure that our vulnerable patients who do attend the surgery are not at risk of Covid because we are increasing the footfall too much.\"\nNicola Sturgeon has insisted that, overall, the recovery plan will both reform the NHS and increase its capacity.\nIts key actions will include:\nOpposition parties have described it as \"thin and flimsy\". The Conservatives said it contained \"a litany of recycled pledges and oversights\", while Scottish Labour said it was \"as underwhelming as it was overdue\".\nHowever, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said it set out a series of benefits for under-pressure healthcare workers.\nHe told Good Morning Scotland: \"They are right to raise concerns because staff, of course, have had the most difficult 18 months possible.\n\"They are, quite frankly, knackered.\n\"So that is why we are going to invest first and foremost in their mental health and wellbeing to make sure that what we are asking them to do, they are able to do without feeling undue pressure.\"\nMr Yousaf added: \"We are also increasing the number of medical graduates that we are going to take by 100 per annum.\n\"But we will also have to look at, and the BMA and the Royal College of GPs have made this point to me quite strongly, how we retain staff in the professions that they are currently in.\"\nThe Scottish Conservatives' health spokesman Craig Hoy said he feared the recovery plan would be \"too little, too late\".\nHe said: \"We should be acutely aware that the Scottish NHS had a capacity problem before we went into the Covid pandemic, and that problem has undoubtedly got much worse as a result.\"\nMr Hoy said the 28-page document was \"very thin on content, and in many senses rows back on previous commitments\".\nHe added: \"We would have wanted, for example, to see a real commitment to establishing Long Covid clinics.\n\"Clearly, that [Long Covid] is going to put stress on GPs' surgeries and this would also stop many patients presenting themselves at A&E clinics.\n\"There is also very little reference has to how A&E clinics are going to receive additional funding.\""

Black Panther is going to do what Black Panther does, but that's a man that lived for us. He did it for us, did it our nephews, our nieces, our kids.

      "text": "Taxi driver Chris is obsessively checking his phone for updates.\n\"I'm set to lose almost 2,500 euros (\u00a32,100) worth of cryptocurrency coins,\" he says.\nChris describes himself as \"a small crypto-holder from Austria\" and is one of many victims of a hack attack on cryptocurrency exchange Liquid Global last week.\nThe company has insisted it will pay all customers who lost out in the $100m (\u00a372.8m) attack.\nBut until they get the money back, many customers are worried. \nEvery time 38-year-old Chris picks up a customer in his ageing Volkswagen, he's reminded of what's at stake.\n\"My car is more than 20 years old and I could have bought a new used car with that money,\" says Chris. \"It's not catastrophic, but still quite a sum for me. I need at least one year to save that sum.\"\nIn Indonesia, 27-year-old Dina says she is in shock. \"I'm feeling so angry with the hackers, and I'm feeling stress for myself. I have around $30,000 and I need that money to live on. I'm just a housewife trying to make money from crypto.\"\nAt the other end of the scale, a 42-year-old Norwegian doctor says he is struggling to concentrate, because he could lose a fortune that he's watched grow over the years.\n\"My Liquid balance is 969,000 euros. It's extremely worrying to me and my stress is at eight out of 10. I'm always thinking about it.\"\nIn Sydney, James describes the stress the hack has put on his parents, who managed to cash out at a loss before the company blocked transactions. \n\"My mum and dad had one Bitcoin on there, so about 70,000 Australian dollars (\u00a337,000). It was, and is, a lot of money to them. \n\"There's obviously stress created. At first they had no idea what was happening, then they felt they were basically forced to sell in a panic and withdraw which means they lost about A$10,000.\" \nLiquid Global was hacked last week, with the money unlikely to be recovered.\nThe Japanese firm said on Wednesday that it is carrying out a robust security review and wants to \"reassure users that they will not suffer any loss due to the incident\".\nMany customers have complained that they were not informed directly about the hack and wouldn't have known about it unless they saw the company's tweets or read the news.\nExchanges like Liquid are a vital part of the growing world of cryptocurrency. They are the websites that allow people to buy and sell digital coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and a place where many people leave their coins for safekeeping.\nHowever, the safety of exchanges is questionable. \nEarlier this month, another crypto platform called Poly Network was also hacked, and lost $610m of its customers' funds. \nDozens of other hacks against cryptocurrency platforms have seen at least \u00a31.6bn stolen by hackers since 2014.\nIncidents involving tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions, of dollars are happening almost every few months and, because these platforms are largely unregulated, there's no guarantee that customers get their money back.\nThere have been cases of customers losing every digital penny or only being partially refunded - affectionately known as 'taking a hair cut'.\n\"There will be zero hair cuts,\" Seth Melamed, chief operating officer of Liquid Global, tweeted on Tuesday.\nFinancial commentator Frances Coppola says cryptocurrency systems are not learning lessons about security fast enough. \n\"The standard banking system is incredibly protective about security and it is regulated to death about it,\" she said.\n\"Banks are actually suffering hacking attacks all the time. They're just better defended, and also they have responsibility to reimburse their customers, which cryptocurrency platforms don't have.\"\nShe says it's individual users who are more likely to be hacked or defrauded in traditional banking systems, which is happening all the time and costing millions.\nDr Amber Ghaddar, who has worked for big banks and is now a founder at crypto platform AllianceBlock, says traditional banking has seen its fair share of big hacks too.\nShe points to the hack of $1 billion suffered by the Bangladesh central bank in 2016 of which $81m are still missing, and the incident at Union Bank of India that same year that saw hackers steal $171m, which was later recovered. In each case, no customers lost out.\nDr Ghaddar says crypto-hacks are a symptom of a still new sector that's growing too fast. \n\"Part of the problem is that these systems are built on open source technology. Open source is great because it uses the collective intelligence of a community to improve software and protocols, but one of the flip sides of open source is that some brilliant mind out there might find some weakness in the code.\" \nDr Ghaddar thinks that the only way to prevent these attacks from happening is to bring in more regulation and rules. \n\"We need auditing and testing. We need to have various standards that need to be monitored in order to protect market integrity if we really want cryptocurrency to reach mass adoption.\"\nAs well as cyber-attacks, everyday investors have been stung over the years by other types of crypto-catastrophe like so-called exit scams and rug pulls.\nInvestigators are still trying to ascertain how many millions, or maybe even hundreds of millions, were lost in the mysterious demise of the Africrypt exchange which collapsed earlier this year when the founders disappeared.\nCustomers of Canadian exchange QuadrigaCX are also still fighting for reimbursement after its founder died leaving $135m of coins unaccounted for in 2019.\nThe traditional finance system is of course littered with victims of large-scale pyramid schemes and other fraud which probably outweigh the losses in the cryptocurrency world.\nBut despite rapid growth, the crypto market is far smaller overall and recent history points to an industry-wide security problem.\nAs the $600m hacker warned in a recent public post: \"We, the hackers, are the armed forces. If you are given weapons and guarding billions from the crowd while being anonymous, will you be a terrorist or the Batman?\""

      "text": "A plane expected to fly from Luton Airport to rescue staff and animals from a charity in Afghanistan has been cancelled amid safety concerns. \nThe campaign to get Nowzad sanctuary founder Paul \"Pen\" Farthing, his staff and animals out of Kabul has become known as Operation Ark.\nA plane from a country neighbouring Afghanistan will now be used instead.\nTwo blasts at Kabul airport on Thursday followed a Foreign Office warning about an attack. \nTaliban officials said at least 11 people had been killed.\nWildlife campaigner and broadcaster Dominic Dyer, from Milton Keynes, told the BBC the volatile situation in the country meant the mission was \"too dangerous\" and that the private flight company \"could not enter Kabul airspace safely\".\n\"We have an option in place in a neighbouring country to lift Pen, his staff and animals out of Kabul before transferring them to the UK,\" he added. \nBut Mr Dyer warned the plane waiting in a neighbouring country could not land in Kabul until Mr Farthing is granted entry into the airport.\nHe is currently outside awaiting permission.\nThere had been criticism about prioritising animals over people, but approval was given for the flight.\nRoyal Marine veteran Mr Farthing, originally from Essex, founded the Nowzad animal shelter, rescuing dogs, cats and donkeys after serving in Afghanistan in the mid-2000s.\nHe has said he would not leave the country without his staff or animals.\nIt is understood Mr Farthing has about 68 staff and 150 cats and dogs as well as other people described as \"vulnerable\".\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said earlier this week he was not prepared to prioritise animals ahead of people \"in real danger\".\nHe then said if the charity's founder got to the airport with his staff and animals, he would seek a slot for the chartered flight.\nMr Wallace has since tweeted to say: \"I never said I would not facilitate. I said no-one would get to queue jump.\n\"As I have said, we will facilitate at all stages but the priority will be people not pets.\"\nMr Wallace urged people to \"let my civil servants and military get on with dealing with one of the most dangerous and challenging evacuations for a generation\".\nA supporter of Operation Ark has privately funded the plane due to take the charity workers out of the country.\nThe former Essex Marine pleaded with the Taliban to allow them in, saying his team had been waiting for more than 10 hours.\nAddressing Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen on Twitter, Mr Farthing said: \"My team & my animals are stuck at airport circle.\n\"We have a flight waiting. Can you please facilitate safe passage into the airport for our convoy?\"\nMr Dyer described the campaign as involving \"probably the most high profile group of Afghan refugees anywhere, now\".\nHe said the group had two trucks and three mini-buses.\n\"Now they're on the side of the street trying to keep the dogs and cats from dying of heat exhaustion,\" Mr Dyer said.\n\"I don't need to hear from ministers anymore that we have a priority list. \n\"I don't want to hear this 'we're putting pets before people' - it's nonsense.\"\nHe said the animals would be \"in the hold and we've got spare capacity in the seating and will take more refugees if we can\".\n\"This is a Dunkirk-spirit privately paid operation to rescue animals and protect people,\" he added.\n\"It's touch and go... but we're going to get them out of there.\"\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "A former pilot who had to give up his job when his airline collapsed has said getting a HGV job closer to home has been a lot easier this time round.\nAaron Leventhal said the UK was \"desperate for drivers\" and pay has increased significantly since he previously drove lorries.\nShortages of drivers have created major problems for shops and restaurants across the UK.\nThe pandemic, changes after Brexit and paperwork delays have all been blamed.\nMr Leventhal, who lives in Swansea, is a former Flybe pilot who returned to the HGV industry after the airline collapsed at the start of the pandemic.\nHe said being made redundant left him \"high and dry\" but as he worked during his pilot training, his HGV licences were all up to date.\nHe said some Flybe colleagues have gone to work in supermarkets as the demand for pilots is not there.\nSince the driver shortage emerged he has been able to get a job near his home in Swansea.\nThe father-of-one said he has seen pay rates for agency drivers in his licence category go from \u00a39 per hour a year ago to up to \u00a330 an hour - plus an extra \u00a35 an hour to pay for a driver's hotel room.\nHe has a dangerous goods licence which enables him to transport fuel - a section of the industry which traditionally paid more. \nHe said, however, many are moving over to transporting food, as the demand and pay rates are much higher.\n\"They are desperate to get drivers and they will pay more,\" he said.\n\"I can't see it coming down too much because it's kind of a trap. I've had emails coming through in the last six months paying up to \u00a330-an-hour.\"\nThe Road Haulage Association estimates there is a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, out of a pre-pandemic total of about 600,000.\nThat number included tens of thousands of drivers from EU member states who were living and working in the UK.\nEven before Covid, the estimated shortage was about 60,000 drivers, according to surveys of its members.\nBernard Davies has run haulage firm ATB Davies in Carmarthen since 1973 and the 76-year-old currently employs 16 drivers - but could do with more.\nHe said: \"There is a shortage and it is very serious because there's nobody coming through the system.\n\"We've had to increase pay by 10% to 12% - we've been to the customers and they have agreed to give us a rate increase to cover that. \n\"People are desperate - they are all desperate to get drivers to get their goods delivered.\"\nHe said Brexit and the cost of getting the licences is to blame.\n\"If you want a Class 1 now and you've got to do a Class 2 first and you're looking at \u00a33,500. \n\"Before Brexit I could recruit a lot more easily. Increasing the hours isn't going to solve anything - we need more drivers.\"\nHe said a HGV driver now is earning \u00a340,000 a year, up from about \u00a328,000 to \u00a330,000 five years ago. \n\"But somebody's got pay for it and it's going to be the public,\" he said.\n\"If you're going to the shop it's going to cost you a bit more. I don't think it's going to come out of the profits of the supermarket people.\"\nAnalysis by BBC Wales political reporter Adrian Browne\nThere was already a shortage of HGV drivers before Brexit and coronavirus.\nFreight firms and retailers estimate 25,000 EU drivers returned home during the pandemic and at the end of the Brexit transition period, when freedom of movement between the continent and UK ceased.\nAnd Covid-19 put driver training and testing for new lorry drivers on hold for 12 months.\nUK ministers are refusing to grant temporary work visas to EU drivers.\nThey insist the British people voted in a referendum and a general election to end free movement.\nUK firms, ministers say, should no longer rely on labour from abroad and must invest in the workforce at home instead.\nThe UK government has slightly relaxed the daily driving limit from nine hours to 11 hours twice a week.\nHaulage companies want a change in the rules to make it easier for drivers from abroad to get temporary visas to work here.\nBut the UK government argues progress is already being made in testing and hiring, and it says a big push is being made towards improving pay, working conditions and diversity.\nAnd ministers have said employers should invest in British workers.\nLuke Vernon, from Ceredigion, said growing up he always dreamed of being a lorry driver - just like his father.\nAfter 24 years in the industry, a car crash has meant he has been off work since last February.\nHe said medical examinations revealed it was not an ongoing problem but it had been a \"puzzle\" trying to get his licence back.\nHe said some people had left the industry because of companies \"treating drivers like children by constantly tracking them\", but the pay had a lot to do with it too.\nBrexit has made this worse because a lot of the European drivers went home, he added.\n\"Before this companies didn't have an issue recruiting drivers because they could pay low wages and always find employees but now this pool of employees has gone they are having to pay more.\"\nHe said lower-end drivers earn around \u00a310 per hour with higher-end ones taking home up to \u00a317 per hour.\n\"I really do enjoy it. I've never been that bothered about money because I'm single and live alone but I've been all over Europe.\"\nA Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency spokesperson said: \"By law, all drivers must meet the medical standards for fitness to drive at all times when driving.\n\"We are prioritising HGV provisional licence applications which are being issued in around two weeks, and HGV licence applications which are currently being issued in around four weeks. \n\"More complex transactions, for example if medical investigations are needed as part of a driving licence application, may face longer delays.\n\"There are delays in processing paper applications due to ongoing industrial action and social distancing requirements, which means that we have fewer staff than usual on site.\""

      "text": "The UK will continue its operation to evacuate people from Afghanistan despite the \"despicable\" attack at the capital's airport, Boris Johnson says.\nSpeaking after an emergency meeting, the PM pledged the UK would be working \"flat out\" until \"the last moment\".\nBut he also acknowledged the push was nearing its conclusion, with hours remaining.\nTwo explosions hit Kabul airport on Thursday, killing some 90 people - among them 13 US military personnel.\nAt least 150 people were also wounded in the attack, which the so-called Islamic State group say it was behind.\nThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) said there had been \"no reported UK military or UK government casualties\".\nFigures released by the MoD on Thursday night showed 13,146 individuals had been flown out by the UK so far. \nIn an address on Thursday night, President Joe Biden also promised to carry on with the evacuation, which is due to end on 31 August. \nHe said the US would \"not forgive\" and \"not forget\" the attack, telling the perpetrators: \"We will hunt you down and make you pay.\" \nUS commanders have said they are on alert for more attacks by so-called Islamic State, including possible rockets or vehicle-borne bombs targeting Kabul airport.\nBy Damian Grammaticas, BBC political correspondent\nIn the aftermath of the suicide bombings at the airport, the pace of the emergency airlift from Afghanistan has slowed but it has not halted. \nThe BBC understands that people who'd already been allowed inside the airport perimeter have continued to be processed, to be boarded on to departing planes. \nBut sources said the numbers arriving to be processed had decreased considerably as the Taliban were turning back many Afghans, particularly those who did not hold foreign passports or visas. \nBoris Johnson said the UK was \"coming towards the very end\" of its operation and suggested \"the overwhelming majority of those eligible\" had now been flown out. \nBut there remain many clamouring not to be left behind, including interpreters who had worked for the British military, security guards from the UK embassy, Afghan soldiers trained by British forces, those who worked with international organisations and academics.\nThursday's twin blasts took place outside the Abbey Gate - where US and British forces have been stationed to help with evacuations - and at a nearby hotel, following warnings there could be terrorist incidents in the area.\nSpeaking after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting, the PM described the blasts - reportedly carried out by suicide bombers - as \"barbaric\".\nHe said: \"I want to stress that this threat of a terrorist attack is one of the constraints that we've been operating under... in the big extraction that's been going on, and we've been ready for it, we've been prepared for it.\n\"And I want to stress that we're going to continue with that operation - and we're now coming towards the end of it, to the very end of it, in any event.\n\"But, clearly, what this attack shows is the importance of continuing that work in as fast and as efficient a manner as possible in the hours that remain to us, and that's what we're going to do.\"\nContinuing, Mr Johnson said the Foreign Office, Home Office and Border Force teams were \"going to work flat out\" to get people through \"as fast as they can\".\nHe added: \"We're going to keep going up until the last moment.\"\nThe US has set the deadline of the end of the month for the withdrawal of its troops, with President Biden rejecting calls from Mr Johnson and other allies for an extension.\nIn the past 12 hours, some countries including Canada, Germany and Australia have announced that they have ended their evacuation operations.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab has offered condolences to the families of the civilians who were killed or injured, saying the US troops who were killed and harmed \"paid the ultimate sacrifice while helping others reach safety\".\n\"The UK and US remain resolute in our mission to get as many people out as possible. It is testament to the remarkable courage of our personnel that they continue to do so while under fire,\" he said.\nA statement from the MoD said: \"Our primary concern remains the safety of our personnel, British citizens and the citizens of Afghanistan. We are in close contact with our US and other NATO allies at an operational level on the immediate response to this incident.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer called the attack \"devastating\", and said his thoughts were with \"all those killed and wounded, serving personnel supporting the evacuations and all those desperately trying to leave\".\nHe added: \"The bravery of the troops at the airport will always outweigh the cowardice of those who wish to harm us.\"\nKabul airport is currently being defended and run by the US, which has 5,800 troops on the ground - with the help of more than 1,000 UK troops.\nArmed Forces minister James Heappey declined to give a date for the last UK evacuation flights, but said it was likely that UK and other foreign troops would have to leave before the last American airlifts.\nHowever, Mr Johnson has insisted the US deadline will not mark the end of the UK's efforts to help people wishing to flee the Taliban-controlled country. \nHe said on Thursday that the current airlifts were just the \"first phase\".\n\"Even beyond the US deadline of 31 of this month, we hope to be able to continue to say to people, well you can come out,\" he said.\nAre you affected by issues covered in this story?

      "tags": "Afghanistan,Taliban,Long Reads",
      "text": "Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary saw the Taliban toppled in 2001 and his country transformed. But in his view, as he explains here, the US missed an opportunity to try to bring lasting peace. And in the last two weeks the path of his homeland took a terrifying twist, one that put his own life in danger.\nIn 2001, I was a carpet salesman at the Pearl Continental Hotel in Peshawar, Pakistan, having yet another unremarkable day at work. \nI'll never forget glancing up at the TV in a brief moment between sales, only to witness firsthand the dramatic footage as a passenger plane careered into the World Trade Center in New York. Then the second plane, and another at the Pentagon. \nNone of our lives would ever be the same. \nInternational attention immediately focused on Afghanistan where the ruling Taliban were accused of providing a sanctuary for the attack's prime suspects - Osama Bin Laden and his al-Qaeda movement.\nOnly the next day, there were suddenly hundreds of foreign media crews crowding the hotel's lobby, desperate for anyone who could speak English to assist them as a translator as they crossed the nearby border into Afghanistan. I took up that offer and I haven't stopped since.\nI hadn't lived in Afghanistan since I was a child - our family had fled the violence during the civil war in the 1990s when the Soviet troops withdrew. So when I entered Kabul for the first time again after all those years, I was shocked to discover the destruction, with buildings reduced to rubble and twisted metal. All signs of hustle and bustle had vanished. The people were so poor, and there was so much fear.\nI was initially working with Abu Dhabi TV and was based in the Intercontinental Hotel with five other journalists. I woke up every morning clouded in a haze of fear, as Kabul became the primary focus of American airstrikes. Known al-Qaeda operatives and Taliban came and went from our hotel, and we saw them wandering in nearby streets. Explosions rang through the night. I wondered if our hotel would be next. \nAnd then one morning in early December, the Taliban were gone. \nWithin hours, people were lining up again outside barber shops to have their beards trimmed. Rhythmic Afghan music filled the streets, filling the vacuum left by explosions. Afghanistan was born again that morning.\nFrom that moment onwards, I was intimately involved in observing the lives of ordinary Afghans firsthand, as they transitioned back to normality, no longer as a translator but as a journalist in my own right. From covering Tora Bora in the East to the Shai Koat battle in Paktia, I had seen the Taliban toppled. \nTheir fighters vanished into the mountainous rural areas, and their leadership fled to Pakistan. In retrospect, it is clear to me that this was a missed opportunity, a time when the US should have sat down with the Taliban to discuss a peace deal. I saw a genuine willingness amongst the rank-and-file of the Taliban to lay down their arms, and resume their lives. But the Americans didn't want that. From my reporting, it seemed to me and many other Afghans that their motivation was revenge after 9/11.\nThe ensuing years were a catalogue of errors. \nPoor and innocent Afghan villagers were bombed and detained. The Afghan government's willingness to allow foreigners to drive the war effort created a gulf between it and the people. I remember clearly an incident where the Americans had mistakenly arrested and detained a taxi driver named Sayed Abasin on the highway between Kabul and Gardez. His father, Mr Roshan, was elderly and a legendary employee of Ariana airlines. After we exposed the error, Mr Abasin was eventually freed. But others were not so connected and not so lucky.\nThe Americans persisted with a heavy-handed approach, causing excess loss of life among ordinary Afghans. In a clear attempt to minimise American casualties, they prioritised bombs and drones over the use of ground troops. Trust for the Americans continued to erode and hopes for peace talks faded. \nThere were brief glimpses of what Afghanistan could become. I could now drive on an open road for thousands of kilometres without fear of death. I criss-crossed the country, driving all the way from Kabul to remote villages in Khost and Paktika provinces late at night or early in the morning. Afghanistan's extraordinary countryside could be traversed. \nThe year 2003 was the turning point. \nIt was when the insurgents started to strike back with a renewed strength. I remember one day very clearly - it was the day that a huge truck bomb pierced the heart of Kabul, shaking the city and shattering windows. I was one of the first journalists on the scene and I'm still traumatised by what I found. It was my first experience of witnessing what would become the new normal, an imposed fact of life - carnage, flesh, and dead corpses littering the blood-splattered ground.\nAnd it just got worse. Later we would come to understand that the truck bombs and suicide attacks against Afghan forces, foreign forces and unarmed civilians in the middle of the city would mark the start of a very brutal chapter of the conflict. In response, the Americans escalated their reliance on airstrikes, this time expanding their list of Taliban targets - weddings and funerals in rural parts of the country. \nOrdinary Afghans came to see the sky as a source of fear. Gone were the days of gazing at the sunrise, sunset or the stars as a source of inspiration. \nOn one trip to the lush green Arghandab river valley, close to the city of Kandahar, I arrived eager to see the country's most famous pomegranates. But when I arrived, it was the blood of its residents, not the fruit, that was flowing. What I saw was a microcosm of what has happened in so many rural areas in Afghanistan. \nThe Taliban had thrust their fighters into the valley, but government forces were doing all they could to push them back. Control of the area teetered back and forth between the two sides, with ordinary Afghans caught in the middle. On that day, I counted 33 separate airstrikes ringing out. I lost count of the number of suicide car bombings launched in response by the Taliban. Homes, bridges and orchards were all destroyed. \nMany of the US airstrikes were led by false intelligence, provided by someone who wanted to settle a bitter personal rivalry or land dispute at a village level. The growing lack of trust between ground forces and ordinary Afghans meant that US forces couldn't tell the truth from the lies. The Taliban used these attacks to wedge Afghans against their own government, which proved to be fertile ground for their recruitment drives. \nIt was also during this period (between 2001 to 2010) that Afghanistan's 9/11 generation - young Afghans who had been granted opportunities to study overseas in India, Malaysia, the US, and Europe - came back to join the country's effort to rebuild. This new generation had hopes of being part of a great national rejuvenation. Instead, they found themselves confronted by new challenges. They returned to see newly empowered warlords enlisted by the Americans. And they saw that corruption was rife. When a country's reality drifts too far from its ideals, day-to-day pragmatism becomes a person's primary driver. A culture of impunity started to prevail.\nOur country's landscape is deceptive. \nIt is easy to be struck by its beautiful valleys, sharp peaks, winding rivers, and little hamlets. But what presents as a peaceful image hasn't provided ordinary Afghans with any peace. You can't find peace without safety in your own home. \nAbout four years ago, I was at a small village in Wardak province for a wedding. As the night fell, people had gathered and they were eating food under the stars. The sky was so clear. But suddenly, the night erupted into the sound of thundering drones and planes. There was clearly an operation taking place nearby. A sense of doom fell upon the wedding party.\nLater that evening, I found myself sharing Kabuli pilau, bread, and meat with the father of a Taliban fighter who described in excruciating detail how his son had been killed in Helmand. His son was only 25 and left behind a widow and two small children.\nI was left speechless when the father explained with melancholy pride that although he was only a humble farmer, his son was a talented fighter who had believed in fighting for a different life. All I could see in the face of this old man was pain and sadness. Under Taliban control, music wasn't permitted, even at weddings. Instead, all gatherings of villagers were just full of these sad stories.\nPeople often overlook the human cost for the Taliban - there are widows, fathers who have lost their sons, and young people crippled by war on the other side too.\nWhen I asked this father of the Taliban fighter what he wanted, his eyes filled with tears and he said: \"I want an end to the fighting. Enough is enough. I know the pain of losing a son. I know Afghanistan must have a peace process, must have a ceasefire.\"\nMy Kabul office was only a few kilometres from a large military hospital. \nFriends, family and acquaintances visiting from my home province, Kunar, often asked me to accompany them to the hospital to identify the corpses of relatives who were members of the Afghan National Security Forces. Sometimes I felt like the spirit of my province was being crushed by the weight of these coffins. \nWhen the Americans recently commenced negotiations with the Taliban in Doha, we were initially overwhelmed with hope. The country was pining for a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire and the negotiations were seen as the only pathway through. I, like so many millions of Afghans, had not seen peace in my country in my lifetime. \nIt didn't take long for our dreams to be shattered. It became clear that the talks were only about capitalising on battlefield victories, not trying to agree on a vision of peace. From an ordinary Afghan's perspective, they were meaningless. The Americans released 6,000 Taliban fighters and commanders from jail, which was sold as a means to a credible and meaningful peace process, and a permanent ceasefire. But that never happened. \nInstead, the peace process became clouded in a heartbreaking campaign of high-profile assassinations. Some of our country's most capable people from the media, legal sector, and judiciary were being killed on their doorsteps in Kabul and across the country. \nAs talks between the Americans and Taliban took place, I remember a local police chief stood up in the middle of a war council meeting and suddenly accused the Americans of abandoning Afghan forces by talking to the enemy. \"They've stabbed us in the back,\" he said angrily. Like many Afghans his relationship with America is steeped in pain.\nOne of my former classmates is a member of the Taliban and we are the same age. Over the last 20 years, we have continued to talk despite the fact that he's adhering to a different ideology. But recently, I saw him at a wedding and I could see how his attitude had hardened and soured. I saw and felt how this conflict has really divided Afghans. When we met, we could barely converse. He wasn't the guy that I remember from our days in Peshawar, playing cricket and stuffing our faces with juicy oranges. \nHow could I know that all these years later I would find him on the other side? \nHis story is also one of deep personal loss. His brother, father, and uncle were killed in a raid that was based on false intelligence and petty local rivalries. Separated as we are, I can't help but hope for a future of national reconciliation. \nBut that seems a distant possibility now. I covered the regional capitals falling to the Taliban in recent weeks, with massive surrenders where no one put up a fight. But I didn't think they could make it into Kabul and take over the city.\nThe night before it happened, officials I spoke to still thought they could hold it with the help of US air strikes. And there was talk of a peaceful transition of power into an inclusive government. But then [former president] Ghani left by helicopter and suddenly the Taliban were in the city. There was fear hanging in the air - people were very scared to see them back. \nThen I was told that my life was in danger.\nI took two changes of clothes and was taken to an undisclosed location with my wife, my baby daughter and my parents. This is a city I know intimately - every inch of it. I belong to this city and it's unbelievable to think no place was safe for me.\nI thought about my daughter Sola - her name means \"peace\" - and it was simply devastating to think the future we had hoped for her was now in tatters. As I left for the airport, I was reminded that for the second time in my life, I was leaving Afghanistan behind. When I got there, memories from years of work came back to overwhelm me - trips I had taken with officials or as a journalist heading to the front lines of the war. \nThen I saw all these people, all these families lining up to flee. A generation of Afghans burying their dreams and aspirations. \nBut this time I wasn't there to cover the story. I was there to join them.\nFollow Bilal Sarwary on Twitter\n#AfghanistanYouNeverSee - more about the author"

      "text": "A US judge has issued a blistering ruling against prominent lawyers who represented Donald Trump after his 2020 presidential election defeat. \nUS District Judge Linda Parker described a lawsuit filed in Michigan by Mr Trump's counsel as a \"profound abuse of the judicial process\". \nHer 110-page ruling, issued Wednesday, sanctioned Sidney Powell, Lin Wood and seven others who alleged voter fraud. \nJudge Parker said the lawyers intended to undermine the electoral system.\n\"This case was never about fraud - it was about undermining the people's faith in our democracy and debasing the judicial process to do so,\" she said in her ruling.\nJudge Parker ordered the lawyers to pay the court costs of their opponents - the city of Detroit and the state of Michigan - and undergo 12 hours of legal education.\nShe also referred them to the Michigan Attorney Grievance Commission and local disciplinary committees where they are licenced. \nLawyers representing Mr Trump filed a spate of lawsuits across the US after his 2020 election defeat making unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud. \nMr Trump refused to publicly concede defeat to his successor, President Joe Biden, for months. He only acknowledged a power transition would occur after a group of his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol building in January 2021, attempting to stop the result being certified. \nWednesday's ruling is the latest in a string of legal repercussions for those who pushed the former president's case in court.  \nMs Powell was among those to baselessly claim that electronic voting systems had switched millions of votes and the Trump campaign later distanced itself from her.\nMs Powell was later sued, along with Mr Trump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, by Dominion voting systems over the allegations.\nMr Giuliani also had his law licence suspended earlier this year by the state of New York over what they described as \"demonstrably false and misleading\" claims he made around the 2020 US election."

      "tags": "Companies,Iceland,Retailing,Supermarkets,Freight transport,Haulage",
      "text": "The boss of supermarket Iceland says the supply chain chaos is getting worse, just as retailers start planning for the key Christmas period.\nRichard Walker told the BBC he estimated the UK's shortage of lorry drivers was now about 100,000, with the company itself about 100 short.\nTesco boss John Allan said \"there may be some shortages\", but people should not \"over-dramatise\" and panic-buy.\n\"It's very easy to make a drama out of a modest crisis,\" he told the BBC.\nThe continuing shortage of HGV drivers is starting to make retailers nervous, as they are about to start planning for the key trading period.\nThe government said there was a \"highly resilient\" food supply chain and it was taking measures to tackle the driver shortage.\nBut Mr Walker said: \"The reason for sounding the alarm now is that we've already had one Christmas cancelled at the last minute. \n\"I'd hate this one to be problematic as well,\" he added. \"We start to stock-build from September onwards for what is a hugely important time of year,\" he added.\n\"We've got a lot of goods to transport between now and Christmas and a strong supply chain is vital for everyone.\"\n\"The driver shortage is impacting the food supply chain on a daily basis and leading to shortages on the shelves,\" Mr Walker said.\n\"We've had deliveries cancelled for the first time since the pandemic began, about 30 to 40 deliveries a day.\"\nThe simple solution he said, was for heavy goods vehicle drivers to be added to the UK's skilled workers list, to help get drivers recruited from overseas.\n\"These men and women, these HGV drivers, have kept the show on the road for 18 months during the pandemic and it's criminal that we're not viewing them as skilled workers,\" he told the BBC.\nAsked if Brexit is responsible for the supply chain problems, Mr Walker responded: \"I think so, but it's a 'self-inflicted wound' rather than an inevitable consequence of Brexit, caused by the government's failure to appreciate the importance of HGV drivers and the work they do for us.\"\nTesco chairman Mr Allan echoed the warnings, but felt the situation was unlikely to develop into a crisis. \"There may be some shortages at Christmas, but I wouldn't want to overdramatise the extent to which that would be the case.\"\nHe said that normally, the supermarket industry would start building stocks now in readiness for Christmas, but \"at the moment we're running very hard just to keep on top of the existing demand and there isn't the capacity to build stocks that we would like to see\". \nHe said Tesco, like all its rivals, was \"very short of drivers\".\nFirms from a number of sectors in the UK have been battling with a supply chain crisis due to a shortage of lorry drivers. \nSteve Murrells, chief executive of the Co-operative Group, warned that current food shortages were \"at a worse level than at any time I have seen\".\nHe told the Times that the Co-op had significantly reduced its range of some products to help serve customers.\nMr Murrells said the disruption to supply had been driven by \"Brexit and issues caused by Covid\" and the firm was retraining staff as lorry drivers to help fill vacant roles.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We have a highly resilient food supply chain. We have well-established ways of working with the food sector and are working closely with them to ensure businesses have the labour they need. \n\"We have put in place a package of measures to tackle the HGV driver shortage. Additionally, our Plan for Jobs is helping people across the country retrain, build new skills and get back into work. As part of this, we are streamlining the process for people to get their HGV licence.\"\nTesco has been offering lorry drivers a \u00a31,000 joining bonus amid a chronic shortage of drivers in the industry.\nOther companies are also understood to be offering similar incentives for HGV drivers after disruption to supply chains led to product shortages. Morrisons said it was working on schemes to train staff to become lorry drivers.\nOn Friday, Logistics UK, which represents freight firms, and the British Retail Consortium (BRC) wrote to the government to plead for new measures to alleviate the problem.\nProblems with shipping goods in from overseas could also hit Christmas, according to toy retailer boss Gary Grant. \nThe chairman of The Entertainer told the Mail Online that he had to contend with shortages of containers to bring goods in from Asia and a jump in shipping costs.\n\"What is unique to us is that Christmas is a fixed date, so we are under extreme pressure at the moment to move as much stock as we can, but are significantly behind with the shipment of products,\" he said. \n\"There's not a shortage of toys, but what will happen as when we get nearer to Christmas, the suppliers will not have back-up stock that we've previously relied upon. So the range of stock we have may be narrower.\" \nHe warned that popular toys such as Paw Patrol, Barbie and Rainbocorns could be in short supply. "

      "tags": "Internet privacy,Information Commissioner's Office,GDPR",
      "text": "The UK's new Information Commissioner will be charged with a post-Brexit \"shake up\" of data rules, including getting rid of cookie pop-ups.\nJohn Edwards has been named the next head of data regulator the ICO.\nThe government said Mr Edwards, currently the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner, would \"go beyond the regulator's traditional role\".\nThe job would now be \"balanced\" between protecting rights and promoting \"innovation and economic growth\". \nMr Edwards has been named as the government's preferred candidate, and said it is a \"great honour\".\n\"I look forward to the challenge of steering the organisation and the British economy into a position of international leadership in the safe and trusted use of data for the benefit of all,\" he said.\nHis predecessor, current Commissioner Elizabeth Denham, said Mr Edwards \"will take on a role that has never been more important or more relevant to people's lives.\"\nThe government's shake-up of the Information Commissioner's Office was announced alongside planned changes to data protection post-Brexit.\nIn an interview with The Telegraph newspaper, Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said the plans include getting rid of \"endless\" cookie pop-ups which are common on most large sites, asking for permission to store a user's personal information. \nThis is widely marketed as a tool for compliance with EU data law the GDPR, although the practice pre-dates it. \nHe told the newspaper that \"high risk\" sites would still need similar notices, but that many of them are \"pointless\".\nAnd he said reform of data protection rules is \"one of the big prizes of leaving\" the EU.\n\"There's an awful lot of needless bureaucracy and box ticking and actually we should be looking at how we can focus on protecting people's privacy but in as light a touch way as possible,\" he said.\nThe proposed reforms extend to all sorts of data.\nIn the official announcement, the government said it will prioritise making new \"data adequacy\" partnerships that will allow it to send people's personal data internationally, to places such as the United States, Korea, Singapore, Dubai and Colombia, among others.\nData adequacy in this sense means an agreement that the protections in place are similar in two countries, with the idea of ensuring that personal information remains safe. It is a key part of EU regulations and was a minor sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.\nThe UK currently has a data adequacy agreement with the EU, though it needs to be renewed in future and could change if the law in the UK diverges too far from EU rules.\nOther details remain light, with the government promising to launch a consultation on what future data laws will look like.\nThe government said that as much as \u00a311bn of trade \"goes unrealised around the world due to barriers associated with data transfers\".\n\"Now that we have left the EU I'm determined to seize the opportunity by developing a world-leading data policy that will deliver a Brexit dividend for individuals and businesses across the UK,\" Mr Dowden said.\n\"It means reforming our own data laws so that they're based on common sense, not box-ticking.\"\nAndrew Dyson, a data protection expert at law firm DLA Piper, said these announcements amounted to the \"first evidence\" of \"a bold new regulatory landscape for digital Britain post-Brexit\".\n\"It will be interesting to see the further announcements that are sure to follow on reforms to the wider policy landscape that are just hinted at here,\" he said.\nThis is a big moment in the evolution of the UK's data protection policies.\nAs New Zealand's Privacy Commissioner, John Edwards showed he was anything but timid in taking on the tech giants. After the Christchurch massacre, he described Facebook \"as morally bankrupt pathological liars who enable genocide (Myanmar), [and] facilitate foreign undermining of democratic institutions\" - in a tweet he later deleted.\nThe current commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, has been criticised by some privacy campaigners for not being robust enough in protecting data rights. But it looks as though the government wants her replacement to be even more cautious.\nMr Edwards \"will be empowered to go beyond the regulator's traditional role of focusing only on protecting data rights, with a clear mandate to take a balanced approach that promotes further innovation and economic growth.\"\nThat looks like a clear signal that the interests of those businesses complaining about the burden of what they regard as excessive data regulations will be given a hearing.\nOliver Dowden's told the Daily Telegraph that EU rules on cookies - which, by the way, predate the GDPR data laws - could be the first target of the new slimmed down approach to regulation. With many web users frustrated by the constant need to click \"accept\" on cookie banners every time they visit a new site, this could prove a popular move.\nBut data protection specialists warn that it's easy to generate  headlines about a bonfire of regulations, much harder to frame new laws diverging from what applies across the English Channel.\nAnd the tech companies themselves may complain about EU data laws - but may see this as just adding another layer of complexity to their global policies, rather than a big opportunity."

For context, just before schools stopped for the summer, there more than 900 cases and almost 29,000 isolating because they were a contact. \nWe should get the first report of this term at the end of the week. It will be worth looking out for just how many of these new cases are in school pupils. I expect we'll see a big drop in the number isolating, compared to last term, when there were more strict rules in place. \nThe latest figures from National Records of Scotland showed that Covid was mentioned on the death certificates of 41 people over the past week - the same total as the previous week.\nOf these, 12 deaths were of people aged under 65, six were people aged between 65-74 and there were 23 deaths of people aged 75 or over. \nThe majority - 28 - were male, with 13 female, while 20 of the country's 32 council areas recorded at least one Covid-related death.\nMr Swinney said acute illness remained relatively low in Scotland despite the country recording the highest number of cases it has ever seen, with the pressure on the NHS not as great as it was in other stages of the pandemic.\nHe said there were no plans to cancel large-scale events such as football matches and concerts \"at this moment\". \nAnd he said the government had to ensure that any new restrictions were proportionate based on the pressure the NHS was under, adding: \"that's the key assessment that ministers have to make\".\nHe added: \"In terms of fulfilling our legal obligations to apply any restrictions to the freedoms that individuals enjoy, we have to be able to be satisfied there is a proportionate danger and risk in having to act in that fashion\".\nMr Swinney also said the focus for now would be on attempting to ensure people followed the \"baseline measures\" such as wearing face coverings in shops and on public transport, trying to socially distance where possible and following good hand and cough hygiene. \nHe said that doing so would help to limit the circulation of the virus and avoid any further restrictions having to be applied in the future.

      "text": "Senior politicians feared Prime Minister Boris Johnson might die when he was admitted to intensive care with Covid, the Welsh Secretary has said.\nSimon Hart said there was \"a real feeling that we could wake up the next morning and find he was dead\" when Mr Johnson was ill last April.\nHe said he thought \"this wasn't in the script,\" when he heard Mr Johnson was unwell.\nHe added it had showed him that \"nobody was out of reach\" from Covid.\nIn the days prior to being admitted, the prime minister tried to \"soldier on\" despite being obviously ill, Mr Hart told the BBC's Walescast podcast.\nHe said although Mr Johnson was looking \"quite cheerful\", he could remember telling a colleague they needed to finish the meeting soon because he was \"looking rough\".\nThe Welsh secretary also defended his boss from accusations he responded too slowly or missed key government meetings early in the pandemic.\nInstead, he credited the \"unbreakable optimism\" and \"extraordinary stamina\" of a leader who was determined \"to try to save as many lives as we can\".\n\"It was a very sobering moment [when Mr Johnson was in intensive care] for all concerned - because it just reinforced that this thing knew no boundaries and nobody was outside its reach.\"\nThe drama of last spring seems a long way from the interview at Pendine Sands holiday park, in Mr Hart's Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire constituency.\nHe won the seat, where he and his wife Abigail raised their two children, at the 2010 General Election. \nHowever, he had operated in political circles before that, and as chief executive of the Countryside Alliance he lobbied against Labour's ban on fox hunting.\nHe said that battle's \"days are gone\" and that \"nobody wants to re-engage in that\".\nAs a backbencher during Brexit, he voted to remain, but under Theresa May campaigned and cajoled Remainers and Eurosceptics to try to get a deal through Parliament.\nBoris Johnson then appointed him to the cabinet after his predecessor Alun Cairns resigned shortly before the 2019 General Election.\nFrom Pendine's famous beach, which has been busy with visitors since lockdown restrictions in Wales have eased, Mr Hart said the furlough and vaccination programmes show how the union of the UK has underpinned Wales's response to the pandemic. \nBut his views on preserving that union clash with those of first minister Mark Drakeford, who has accused the UK government of putting the union at risk and of undermining the powers of the Senedd. \nMr Hart counters by accusing Mr Drakeford of \"talking up devolution endlessly\".\n\"I think talk of constitutional conventions and all sort of academic claptrap frankly to me doesn't seem to be in tune with the guys trying to run this camp.\"\nNevertheless, the Welsh secretary said he thinks he has a \"reasonable\" relationship with the first minister, who he sometimes spots on the seaside in his constituency.\n\"He's on holiday so I don't feel it's my place to pester him,\" he adds.\nNot intruding on people with political chit-chat is a theme. \n\"I wouldn't even know how half my friends vote,\" said Mr Hart.\n\"It wouldn't have ever crossed my mind to ask them.\"\nHe brings it up after telling us about how his home near Narberth was inundated with bird-watchers in 2018.\nEnthusiasts from all over the UK came to see a green heron - a native of Costa Rica and an exceptionally rare visitor to the UK - that had landed in his garden.\nHe said him and his family put trays of food out everyday but he was \"baffled\" by some people who said: \"'I'm never going to set foot in a Tory MP's garden'.\n\"They felt that strongly. I thought 'Oh, come on'.\"\nThe bird \"put on a show\" for a week, then flew off and the MP said his only regret was he wished \"it had done it in an election year\".\nBut then the migratory habits of birds, just like politics, don't always follow a plan.  \nYou can listen to Walescast on BBC Sounds"

called A New and Better Normal - also said that many existing inequalities have widened.\nIts findings are based on responses from 4,385 young people through surveys and focus groups.\nSome echo concerns previously raised elsewhere.\nA report by the National Children's Bureau previously said that families of children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) felt they were \"forgotten\" in the response to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nMany therapies and essential services they relied on were withdrawn and have not fully returned.\nThe NICCY report draws attention to the widespread suspension of services and their effect on children. \nMany face-to-face services in early years, for children aged 0-3 and their families, were suspended.\n\"The risk of increased emotional or behavioural problems in younger children due to the pandemic is a concern,\" said the children's commissioner Koulla Yiasouma in her report.\n\"Health visitors were redeployed to provide Covid-19 related care and services resulting in a reduction in the number of health assessments and home visits.\"\n\"Reductions in health visiting appointments, in addition to restrictions in access to other early years services, removed an important support system for parents, particularly first-time mothers and those from disadvantaged backgrounds.\"\nMore than a quarter (27%) of young people surveyed also said they could not \"get medical treatment during the pandemic for a health issue not related to coronavirus\".\nAnother young person who took part in the focus groups had lost their mum during the pandemic and had problems getting bereavement support.\n\"Yes [I've sought support for bereavement] but there is a waiting list and my guess is that it's as long as the Amazon River,\" they told the report's authors.\nThere was also a ban for periods on external visits for young people in the Juvenile Justice Centre, including from family.\n\"Existing barriers faced by children with disabilities or complex health needs in accessing support and services significantly worsened during the pandemic,\" the report noted.\nIn a companion study undertaken by academics from Queen's University Belfast on behalf of NICCY, a number of experts also expressed serious concern about the safety of children and young people during the pandemic.\nRelated concerns were previously raised by the Safeguarding Board for Northern Ireland.\nMark Clegg, from west Belfast, is a father to three children aged under nine, all with additional needs.\nThe family get support and respite from the Kids Together centre in west Belfast but services stopped temporarily at the start of the pandemic.\nMr Clegg said the lack of routine was very difficult for his daughter who has \"very severe self-injurious behaviour\".\n\"It would lead to biting, hitting out at objects and when it's really bad she will hit out at us and become very aggressive and destructive in her room,\" he said.\n\"The stress on us as a married couple and as a family - sometimes you don't want to be in your own home.\"\nHe said school holidays were \"challenging\" for his daughter prior to the pandemic due to \"not constantly getting up, getting on the bus going to school and coming back from school\".\n\"Allowing these services to resume and become essential - we're very blessed to have them in our lives.\n\"Until they resumed we did feel abandoned.\"\nYoung people also \"felt they were negatively stereotyped and blamed for spreading the virus\", according to the report.\nIt found that 585 community resolution notices were issued to under-18s by police for breaches of the Coronavirus Health Protection Regulations in 2020-21.\n\"While media stories suggested that these breaches were common, the vast majority of children and young people adhered closely to issued regulations and guidelines,\" the report said.\n\"Despite this, children and young people maintained they felt demonised and discriminated against by adults when they met together in public as restrictions relaxed.\n\"Many have felt judged and scapegoated when they have met up with friends in public spaces.\"\nMany children and young people said they felt \"lonely and trapped\" during lockdowns and due to restrictions.\n\"It is clear from the children and young people with whom we engaged through surveys and focus groups how important friendships and developing relationships are throughout childhood and into the teenage years, and how deeply they have felt the restrictions on their social interactions,\" the report said.\n\"The research data shows that the decline in play, recreational and leisure activities has had a devastating impact on many children's physical health and emotional wellbeing.\"\nThe NICCY report said that every effort should be made to ensure that school activities like sports, music, clubs and drama could be held.\nThe vast majority of children were also taught remotely out of school from March to June 2020 and again from January until Easter 2021.\nThe report said that had an impact on children from lower-income backgrounds especially.\n\"Children in poverty were identified as being particularly impacted by the move to online education, as they were more likely not to have access to an appropriate digital device or online IT access,\" it said.\n\"They were also more likely to be living in accommodation that did not have adequate inside or outside space to study and for recreational activities in lockdown.\n\"The continued closure of schools has undoubtedly exacerbated educational inequalities which were previously well documented before the pandemic.\"\nResearch conducted for the NICCY report found that 41% of primary seven respondents and 52% of 16-year-olds felt their mental and emotional health had worsened during the pandemic.\nA major study carried out before the pandemic had already found that anxiety and depression was 25% more common in children and young people in Northern Ireland compared with other parts of the UK.\nThe NICCY report said the executive had acted more quickly in helping families entitled to free school meals than other governments in the UK.\nHowever, that was a rare positive note.\n\"As we move out of the pandemic, more children and young people and their families are living in poverty, health waiting lists are unacceptably long, many have had their education adversely impacted due to lack of access to digital equipment, children in care and other vulnerable groups have not received the support they need,\" the report said.\nIt included a number of recommendations and said that infants, children and young people should be prioritised in the Executive's Covid-19 recovery plan.\nThe children's commissioner said the system didn't listen to young people.\n\"Here we are 18 months later with families still struggling, with families trying to get back to an equilibrium, into a routine, and parents are exhausted,\" added Ms Yiasouma.\n\"We abandoned those families and it's inexcusable that that happened to them.\n\"There is a way forward, nothing is irreparable - we can make this right - but we need to recognise where we let children down where we didn't take into consideration their needs.\""

      "text": "GPs in Scotland are warning against a rush back to more face-to-face consultations with patients as part of the government's NHS Recovery Plan.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the move will be one of the \"key actions\" for the next five years to reduce backlogs in healthcare.\nThe number of GPs will also be increased by 800 to try and tackle recruitment and retention problems.\nHowever, GPs insist the hybrid system for appointments should stay for now.\nThe Royal College of GPs in Scotland said it welcomed the government's recognition that general practice \"is going to be one of the ways out of this pandemic\".\nThe industry body also backed the announcement of increased investment to help in-person consultations eventually return to pre-Covid levels.\nBut it said a major shift back to face-to-face appointments should only be made when it is safe to do so.\nDavid Shackles, joint chair of the Royal College of GPs in Scotland, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that face-to-face consulting remained \"something that GPs and patients value\".\nHe said: \"It was only when we had the pandemic that there was this increased need for remote consulting.\n\"The model has served us very well throughout the pandemic.\n\"General practice is still open for face-to-face consultations when clinically necessary, and we see the likelihood of increasing face-to-face consultations as it becomes safe to do that. But we have got to make sure it is safe.\"\nDr Shackles pointed to the continued rise in Covid cases - with positives tests hitting a record high of 5,021 on Wednesday - as the main reason to be cautious.\nHe said \"With case numbers and hospitalisations rising, we've got to make sure that our vulnerable patients who do attend the surgery are not at risk of Covid because we are increasing the footfall too much.\"\nNicola Sturgeon has insisted that, overall, the recovery plan will both reform the NHS and increase its capacity.\nIts key actions will include:\nOpposition parties have described it as \"thin and flimsy\". The Conservatives said it contained \"a litany of recycled pledges and oversights\", while Scottish Labour said it was \"as underwhelming as it was overdue\".\nHowever, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said it set out a series of benefits for under-pressure healthcare workers.\nHe told Good Morning Scotland: \"They are right to raise concerns because staff, of course, have had the most difficult 18 months possible.\n\"They are, quite frankly, knackered.\n\"So that is why we are going to invest first and foremost in their mental health and wellbeing to make sure that what we are asking them to do, they are able to do without feeling undue pressure.\"\nMr Yousaf added: \"We are also increasing the number of medical graduates that we are going to take by 100 per annum.\n\"But we will also have to look at, and the BMA and the Royal College of GPs have made this point to me quite strongly, how we retain staff in the professions that they are currently in.\"\nThe Scottish Conservatives' health spokesman Craig Hoy said he feared the recovery plan would be \"too little, too late\".\nHe said: \"We should be acutely aware that the Scottish NHS had a capacity problem before we went into the Covid pandemic, and that problem has undoubtedly got much worse as a result.\"\nMr Hoy said the 28-page document was \"very thin on content, and in many senses rows back on previous commitments\".\nHe added: \"We would have wanted, for example, to see a real commitment to establishing Long Covid clinics.\n\"Clearly, that [Long Covid] is going to put stress on GPs' surgeries and this would also stop many patients presenting themselves at A&E clinics.\n\"There is also very little reference has to how A&E clinics are going to receive additional funding.\""

It was just the most horrific thing.\"\nMr Farthing, originally from Dovercourt in Essex, said US President Joe Biden had \"stopped\" his attempt to get the animals out of the country.\n\"There's nothing I can do. The staff are telling me it's time for me to go. They don't think a foreigner will be welcome here,\" he said.\n\"Staff have asked me to take as many dogs and cats as I can. But now I can't get them past the Taliban check points.\"\nHe said the Taliban were stopping people from Afghanistan coming to the airport even if they also had British passports.\nPentagon spokesman John Kirby confirmed the twin blasts occurred in a \"complex attack\" outside Hamid Karzai International Airport and there were \"a number of US and civilian casualties\".\nA senior Kabul health official told the BBC more than 60 people had died and more than 140 people were injured.\nAmerican officials said 11 US marines and a navy medic were killed.\nThe Ministry of Defence said there had been no UK military or government casualties reported.\nMr Farthing and his supporters have been campaigning to have his staff and their families, as well as 140 dogs and 60 cats, evacuated from Kabul since the collapse of the Afghan government.\nHe has dubbed the plan Operation Ark and made a plea on Twitter to ensure his \"safe passage\" into Kabul airport on Thursday.\nAddressing the Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen, Mr Farthing said: \"Dear Sir; my team and my animals are stuck at airport circle.

I said no-one would get to queue jump.\n\"As I have said, we will facilitate at all stages but the priority will be people not pets.\"\nMr Wallace urged people to \"let my civil servants and military get on with dealing with one of the most dangerous and challenging evacuations for a generation\".\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Some of their principles will come under pressure like never before. \nIf this deal is approved, Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater will become part of a government that remains committed to building new roads and has not set a date for ending oil and gas extraction. \nBut if the deal is rejected, Greens may lose the chance to shift more transport spending towards rail and cycling, set rent controls in social housing and expand renewable energy production. \nParty members have to decide if the deal includes enough Green clout to offset the compromises that come with sharing power. \nThe party's co-leaders stress their flexibility to criticise the SNP in policy areas outside their agreement but they may also be obliged to defend government decisions they do not like. \nFollowing her party's confirmation of the ministerial proposals, Lorna Slater said it was time for Scotland \"to step up efforts to decarbonise our economy and invest in a greener, independent future\".\nShe added: \"The co-operation agreement we've negotiated would put Greens at the heart of decision-making at this crucial time and if our members endorse it then I look forward to driving change in government.\" \nPatrick Harvie said if party members backed the plan, \"they can be assured that we'll waste no time getting to work to deliver on their transformative agenda\".\nHe said: \"With Greens in government we would be able to deliver positive change like tackling Scotland's emissions, protecting nature, advancing tenants' rights, bringing forward overdue equalities legislation and delivering an independence referendum.\"\nThe Scottish Conservatives' Covid recovery spokesman Murdo Fraser accused Nicola Sturgeon of looking to appoint \"extremists\" who \"don't believe in economic growth...and who actively want to limit Scotland's economy\". \nHe said: \"Neither Patrick Harvie or Lorna Slater should be anywhere near key financial decisions that will impact jobs and businesses. \n\"Their growing influence is a danger to our oil and gas industry and the 100,000 jobs it supports. The Greens seek to undermine the future of the North Sea sector at every turn, and Nicola Sturgeon is giving them a bigger platform to do that.\"\nThe Greens have signed up to the bulk of the government's policy - but there will also be areas where they are in disagreement with the SNP, and they will be able to criticise it on those points.\nThese excluded areas include aviation policy, international relations, policy on fee-paying schools, fox hunting and Nato membership if Scotland becomes independent.\nThe co-operation agreement says the two parties will work together to provide \"effective and responsible leadership for Scotland for this session of the Scottish Parliament, in the interests of Scotland, of the people who live in Scotland, and of future generations\".\nIt says they will secure a referendum on Scottish independence \"within the current parliamentary session on a specific date to be determined by the Scottish Parliament\".\nThey have also committed to holding a referendum on Scottish independence within the next five years, and preferably by the end of 2023."

      "text": "A radio presenter died due to complications from the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, a coroner has found.\nLisa Shaw, who worked for BBC Radio Newcastle, died at the age of 44 in May after developing headaches a week after getting her first dose of the vaccine.\nNewcastle coroner Karen Dilks heard Ms Shaw suffered blood clots in the brain which ultimately led to her death.\nThe inquest heard the condition linked to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was very rare.\nThe coroner said: \"Lisa died due to complications of an AstraZeneca Covid vaccination.\"\nMs Dilks said Ms Shaw was previously fit and well but concluded that it was \"clearly established\" that her death was due to a very rare \"vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia\", a condition which leads to swelling and bleeding of the brain. \nMs Shaw, a mother of one from Consett, received her first dose of the vaccine on 29 April.\nOn 13 May she was taken by ambulance to University Hospital of North Durham after having a headache for several days.\nIn a statement, Dr John Holmes who treated her said she complained of having a \"severe headache shooting and stabbing\" across her forehead and behind her eyes.\nTests were carried out and blood clots were found in her brain, prompting her to be moved to the neurology specialist unit at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI).\nThe clots are considered extremely rare - there have been 417 reported cases and 72 deaths - after 24.8 million first doses and 23.9 million second doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK. \nDr Christopher Johnson, a consultant in anaesthetics and intensive care at the RVI, said Ms Shaw had been conscious for several days and had been treated for the clots with drugs which seemed to be successful.\nBut on the evening of 16 May Ms Shaw said the headaches were worse and she had difficulty speaking.\nScans showed she had suffered a haemorrhage in the brain and after her condition deteriorated, part of her skull was removed to try and relieve the pressure inside her head.\nHer condition continued to worsen and despite more surgery and treatments, she died on 21 May.\nDr Johnson said doctors were in a daily conference with a national panel about vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, the condition Ms Shaw was believed to be suffering from.\nAsked if he would have changed the treatments given to Ms Shaw, he said: \"No.\"\nDr Johnson said The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) published guidelines on how to treat the condition in July which matched the treatment Ms Shaw received.\n\"Lisa got all the treatments that were recommended in the order they were recommended,\" he said.\n\"If we had the same presentation tomorrow we would do the same thing.\"\nDr Tuomo Polvikoski, a consultant neuro-pathologist who examined Ms Shaw after her death, said given her history of being fit and healthy with no medical problems, it was \"surprising\" she died of blood clots and bleeding in the brain.\nHe said \"timewise\" it \"seems most likely\" her death was \"indeed vaccine induced\".\nMs Dilks said the condition was \"very rare\" but agreed with Dr Polvikoski's findings.\nAfter the hearing, Ms Shaw's family said in a statement: \"This is another difficult day in what has been a devastating time for us.\n\"The death of our beloved Lisa has left a terrible void in our family and in our lives.\n\"She truly was the most wonderful wife, mum, daughter, sister and friend.\"\nThe Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's chief safety officer, Dr Alison Cave, said it would be \"reviewing\" the coroner's verdict. \n\"The benefits of the Covid-19 vaccine AstraZeneca continue to outweigh the risks for most people,\" she said. \n\"It is therefore still vitally important that people come forward for their vaccination and for their second dose when invited to do so.\" \nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "text": "Northern Ireland households and businesses are facing substantially higher gas bills this winter, the Utility Regulator has warned.\nJohn French said \"unprecedented\" increases in international wholesale prices were to blame.\nWholesale energy costs make up about half of gas and electricity bills.\nMr French said consumer gas prices would increase in September, but electricity prices would not be affected until next year.\nHe suggested gas bills could increase by more than \u00a3100 a year.\nHe said: \"It is likely that tariffs will increase from the current average household bill of about \u00a3515 per year, to be closer aligned with the average gas bills in GB (\u00a3625) and the Republic (\u00a3782).\nThe Fuel Poverty Coalition group said it was concerned about the possibility of many households being \"at risk of fuel poverty this winter\".\nIt highlighted that this is most common among older people, households with babies and young children, adults with disabilities and people living with long-term health conditions.\nIts chairperson, Pat Austin, advised consumers to take early \"practical steps\", such as making \"energy efficiency improvements or budgeting a little extra if they can each week to help cover the increased cost\".\nRaymond Gormley, head of energy at the Consumer Council, said people should \"seek help\" when they need it. \n\"While not practical for everyone, it is advisable to try to keep an energy budget aside for the coming winter,\" he added.\nElectricity prices have already increased this year.\nFor example, the regulated provider Power NI increased its tariffs by almost 7% in July with other providers increasing prices by up to 20%.\nMr French said he did not expect the regulated price to increase further this year.\nHowever, the picture is more uncertain next year and the higher gas prices could potentially feed through into higher electricity prices."

      "tags": "Pop music",
      "text": "Pop group Abba have teased a major announcement for next week, as fans await their first new music in 39 years.\nThe Swedish band launched a new website on Thursday morning titled \"Abba Voyage\", asking fans to register interest in a new project.\nIt is expected to be a long-gestating \"hologram tour\" that Abba initially announced in 2016.\nThe band are also expected to release five new songs to accompany the show.\nThe quartet - Agnetha Faltskog, Anna-Frid Lyngstad, Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson - returned to the studio in 2018, promising two new songs later that year.\nThose tracks, I Still Have Faith In You and Don't Shut Me Down, have been repeatedly delayed - and the band are now planning to release five tracks to thank fans for their patience.\nEarlier this year, Ulvaeus confirmed the music would \"definitely\" come out this year.\n\"It's not a case any more of it might happen, it will happen,\" he told The Herald Sun.\nThe Abba Voyage website was launched on Thursday morning, featuring a cryptic image of four glowing planets, accompanied by the date 2 September.\nAccording to The Sun, the show will involve \"Abba-tars\" of the stars performing hits like Waterloo, Dancing Queen and Mamma Mia.\nIt said the holograms will be beamed onstage in a purpose-built east London theatre, where fans will also be able to see a documentary-style film on the band's comeback.\nSpeaking to the BBC during the early stages of the show's production, Ulvaeus said the idea had been presented to the band by Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller.\n\"He came to Stockholm and he presented this idea to us that we could make identical digital copies of ourselves of a certain age and that those copies could then go on tour and they could sing our songs, you know, and lip sync. I've seen this project half-way through and it's already mind-boggling.\"\nFilming for the project reportedly took place at London's Ealing Studios last year.\nFormed in 1972, Abba were essentially a Swedish supergroup, consisting of songwriters Ulvaeus and Andersson from The Hep Stars and singers Faltskog and Lyngstad, who had scored success as solo artists.\nBut their joint project completely eclipsed their previous work. After winning the Eurovision Song Contest with Waterloo in 1974, the band sold almost 400 million singles and albums around the world.\nMamma Mia!, the musical based on their hits and produced by Ulvaeus and Andersson, has also been seen by more than 50 million people.\nDuring their most successful period, the band survived marriage break-ups between Ulvaeus and Faltskog, and Lyngstad and Andersson, but they finally called it a day in 1983.\nTheir final recording sessions, in 1982, produced the hits Under Attack and The Day Before You Came, which featured on the compilation album The Singles.\nTheir last public performance came three years later, on the Swedish version of TV show This Is Your Life, which honoured their manager Stig Anderson.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Department of Health & Social Care,NHS England,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "NHS organisations in England have been told to prepare for a possible extension of the Covid vaccination programme to all 12 to 15-year-olds.   \nAny change to the rollout next month will be dependant on a recommendation from experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).  \nJab offers in this age group only now go to people living with a vulnerable adult or certain health conditions.\nThe Department of Health said no decisions had been made.\nBut it confirmed that planning for a range of scenarios was taking place to ensure all eventualities were prepared for.\nEarlier this month, the JCVI advised that all 16 and 17 year olds should be given a first dose of a vaccine.  Unlike older age groups, no second dose is being scheduled.\nThe committee, which advises all four UK nations, has not made its final decision on whether the 12 to 15-year-old age group should be vaccinated.  \nThe US, Canada, France and the Netherlands are among the countries which are already vaccinating children aged 12 and over.  \nThe JCVI is weighing up the arguments on whether such a move should be made in the UK.  \nExperts are assessing the risks and benefits to children of vaccination and how much it might slow the wider spread of the virus. \nOne JCVI member, Prof Adam Finn, told Sky News this week that the committee was taking a \"very cautious\" approach.\nIt comes as UK Covid infection levels have been rising again, with more than 30,000 new cases confirmed each day in the last week. \nThe latest government data on Wednesday showed there had been a further 35,847 lab-confirmed cases, and 149 people had died within 28 days of a positive test. \nNearly 88% of over-16s have had the first dose of a vaccine, while 77.4% are fully-vaccinated.\nThe extension to the vaccination programme being planned for would coincide with the start of the new school year. \nProf Mike Tildesley, an infectious disease modeller at the University of Warwick, says September will be a crucial moment in the pandemic, when pupils are back in classrooms across the whole of the UK and people return to offices after the summer holiday.\nA record number of daily Covid cases announced in Scotland on Wednesday was said to have been partly fuelled by the return of schools after the break.\nMeanwhile, secondary school pupils in England are being urged to get tested before the start of the term and vaccinated if they have been invited for a jab."

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "Thousands of people are scrambling to flee Afghanistan after the Taliban seized back control of the country, almost two decades after they were ousted by a US-led coalition.\nThe United Nations has warned that up to half a million Afghans could flee the country by the end of the year and has called on neighbouring countries to keep their borders open. \nThe current crisis comes on top of the 2.2 million Afghan refugees already in neighbouring countries and 3.5 million people forced to flee their homes within Afghanistan's borders.\nThe US-led operation to evacuate people by air has now ended, with the last flight taking off from Kabul airport just after midnight on Tuesday - a deadline agreed with the Taliban for foreign forces to withdraw.  \nMore than 123,000 civilians were evacuated by US forces and its coalition partners after the Taliban took control of the capital on 14 August - but it's unclear exactly how many of those were Afghan nationals. \nThe US has said that it flew nearly 80,000 civilians out of Kabul and of those, about 5,500 were Americans and more than 73,500 were either Afghans or other foreign nationals. \nWhile the UK Ministry of Defence, which ended its evacuations on Saturday, said it had flown out more than 15,000 people and some 8,000 of them were Afghans. \nAt the height of the operation, the US said its military planes were departing the airport every 39 minutes - although the evacuations did slow down after the suicide bomb attack on the 26 August outside the airport, which killed about 170 people, including 13 American troops.\nMany of those flown out of the country were taken to emergency processing centres set up in several countries, including Spain, Germany, Qatar and Uzbekistan.\nAs many as 300,000 Afghans have been affiliated with US operations in the country since 2001, according to the International Rescue Committee, and tens of thousands of them are eligible to obtain a US visa - but many will now have to find a different way out of the country. \nAt the weekend, the US said it had received assurances from the Taliban that Afghan nationals who are issued with valid travel documents by another country will be allowed to leave Afghanistan. \nThe Taliban control all the main land crossing points with Afghanistan's neighbours (shown on the map below) and reports suggest they are only allowing traders or those with valid travel documents to leave the country.\nHowever, many of those trying to flee because they fear for their safety under Taliban rule will not have any paperwork. \nThe UN has urged Afghanistan's neighbours to keep their borders open to refugees and called on the international community to support those countries. \nBut Uzbekistan, which borders the north of Afghanistan, has said its main crossing point is closed to \"ensure security\" and there are no plans to open it. \nPakistan, which has the longest border with Afghanistan, has also said it will not accept refugees - with its US ambassador telling the BBC: \"We are already overburdened by the refugees, and it is beyond our capacity to host any more refugees.\"\nLast week, satellite imagery of the Spin Boldak crossing point between Afghanistan and Pakistan showed a large crowd of people gathered on the Afghan side. \nThe BBC's Shumaila Jaffery, who was at the crossing point, said it was a chaotic scene with many Afghans not being allowed to enter Pakistan. \nLast Friday, two Afghans were reportedly killed by Pakistani security forces at the Torkham border crossing after trying to enter Pakistan illegally.\nThere have also been reports of thousands of Afghans trying to cross the western border with Iran, but it's unclear how many have been successful. \nThe latest movement of Afghans is part of a historical exodus from a country that has suffered instability and conflict over many years.\nEven before the Taliban retook control, more than 550,000 people had been forced to flee their homes this year due to fighting, according to the UNHCR. \nThat means an estimated 3.5 million Afghans are currently internally displaced within the country.\nIn addition to those within Afghanistan's borders, about 2.2 million refugees and asylum seekers were also seeking sanctuary in neighbouring nations as of the end of last year.\nThis year, Afghans have also had to deal with a severe drought and food shortages across most of the country. A report by the UN World Food Programme (WFP) in June said that 14 million people - more than a third of the population - were suffering from hunger. \nMary-Ellen McGroarty, WFP country director for Afghanistan, said last week that unless emergency food and medical supplies arrived soon, the \"already horrendous situation\" would become \"an absolute catastrophe, a complete humanitarian disaster\".\nNeighbouring countries Pakistan and Iran saw the highest numbers of Afghanistan's refugees and asylum seekers last year.\nAlmost 1.5 million fled to Pakistan in 2020, while Iran hosted 780,000, according to UNHCR figures.\nGermany was third, with more than 180,000, while Turkey took nearly 130,000.\nWhen looking at asylum seeker numbers only - those who have applied for sanctuary in another country but whose claims have not yet been granted - Turkey, Germany and Greece top the list, with about 125,000, 33,000 and 20,000 respectively.\nAlthough there are no Afghan asylum seekers in Iran, those with refugee cards - an official document recognising their status - are able to access the country's health and education systems.\nThe UN has called on its member states to help Afghan people in \"their darkest hour of need\" - but while some countries have offered refugees a safe haven, others have indicated they will not be giving sanctuary to those fleeing the crisis. \nBoth Pakistan and Iran have said that they cannot cope with a further influx of Afghan refugees. Officials in both countries have said that any refugees that do arrive will have to stay in camps near the border until they can return to Afghanistan. \nUzbekistan has said it will help transfer Afghans to third countries but will only host refugees temporarily. The Tajikistan government previously offered to accept up to 100,000 refugees but it's unclear if any have been allowed in yet. Turkmenistan has said its airspace can be used for evacuation flights but it hasn't made any commitment to take in refugees itself. \nIn Turkey, the government has urged European countries to take responsibility for any new migrant crisis, saying Turkey would not be \"Europe's migrant storage unit\". The country has stepped up construction of a border wall with Iran to thwart those entering illegally. \nOfficials in several European Union countries say they are keen to avoid a repeat of the 2015 migrant crisis, when there was a populist backlash against large numbers of Syrian refugees being allowed to enter EU territory.\nFrance, which evacuated more than 2,800 people from Kabul airport, mostly Afghans, has indicated it will accept some refugees but has not specified a number. Germany has also not specified a number but Chancellor Angela Merkel has said as many as 40,000 people still in the country may have a right to be evacuated to Germany if they feel they are endangered.\nOther EU countries, like Austria, Poland and Switzerland have said they will not accept any new Afghan arrivals and are upping their border security to guard against illegal arrivals. \nThe UK has said it will take in 5,000 Afghans in 2021 as part of a scheme to resettle 20,000 over the next few years, focusing on those at greatest risk from the Taliban.\nThe US has not said how many refugees it will accept yet, but it has authorised $500m (\u00a3367m) for \"unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs of refugees\". Canada has said that it will resettle 20,000 Afghans while Australia has said it will take in 3,000.\nSeveral countries, including Kosovo and Uganda, have also accepted US requests to temporarily accept Afghan refugees before they are resettled elsewhere.

      "tags": "Electric cars,UK economy,Car industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "UK car production fell sharply last month, marking the worst July performance for the industry since 1956, a trade group has said. \nThe global microchip shortage, staff being affected by the so-called pingdemic, and shutdowns meant just 53,438 cars were built in the month.\nThat was a drop of 37.6% compared to July last year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.\nIt comes as sales of second-hand vehicles are soaring.\nOverall car production in the year to date is almost a fifth higher than during 2020 at 552,361 vehicles, but that is still 28.7% down on 2019 pre-pandemic levels. \nSMMT boss Mike Hawes said the July figures \"lay bare the extremely tough conditions UK car manufacturers continue to face\". \n\"While the impact of the 'pingdemic' will lessen as self-isolation rules change, the worldwide shortage of semiconductors shows little sign of abating,\" he said.\nNew cars often include dozens of microchips - also called semiconductors - but a shortage has put pressure on a number of carmakers, who are competing directly with tech companies and the consumer electronics sector for supply.\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, many car manufacturers cancelled orders due to fears of a long downturn in sales. However, as demand started to recover, companies found themselves at the back of the queue for microchips.\nManufacturers have had to grapple with absent workers as coronavirus restrictions eased due to employees being pinged by the NHS Covid app.\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs have predicted that the automotive sector is set to be hit hard by the chip shortage, with up to $20bn (\u00a314bn) wiped off global carmakers' operating profits in 2021.\nThe SMMT also revealed that car exports from the UK fell 37.4% in July, with just over 45,000 vehicles shipped overseas. \nHowever, demand for alternatively-fuelled models is picking up.  More than a quarter of all cars made in July were either battery electric or hybrid electric, the SMMT said, the highest share on record. \n\"The UK automotive industry is doing what it can to keep production lines going, testament to the adaptability of its workforce and manufacturing processes,\" Mr Hawes added.\n\"But government can help by continuing the supportive Covid measures currently in place and boosting our competitiveness with a reduction in energy levies and business rates for a sector that is strategically important in delivering net zero.\"\nThe car industry is a vital part of the UK economy accounting for \u00a378.9bn turnover. \nIt employs some 180,000 people in manufacturing and 864,000 across the wider supply chain. More than 30 manufacturers build around 70 car models in the UK."

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Rishi Sunak,Universal Credit,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Two Conservative MPs have written to Boris Johnson, urging him not to press on with plans to cut universal credit payments from October. \nPeter Aldous and John Stevenson said the \u00a320-per-week increase, brought in as a response to the pandemic, should be made permanent. \nThe letter comes amid warnings from two charities that cutting the top-up will push millions of families into debt. \nBut ministers have said the increase was only ever a temporary measure.\nAnd Boris Johnson said that the key focus for the government was on coming out of the pandemic with \"a jobs-led recovery\", saying he was proud to see the living wage had risen.\n\"I'm very pleased to see the way the unemployment numbers have been falling, employment numbers have been rising and also wages have been rising,\" the prime minister said.\nHe added: \"My strong preference is for people to see their wages rise through their efforts rather than through taxation of other people put into their pay packets, rather than welfare.\"\nIn the letter, the MPs, who represent constituencies in Suffolk and Carlisle and not so-called \"red wall\" former Labour strongholds, said they did \"not take this step lightly\".\nBut they told the prime minister they had \"very serious concerns\" about the ability of low income families to make ends meet if the top-up is removed. \nAnd they said they were \"alarmed to see the government unwilling to heed the widespread warnings that are coming from all quarters\" about the impact on living standards.\nThe letter read: \"Our central promise at the last election, that you articulated so well, was to level up. \n\"Infrastructure is a crucial part of this agenda, but with the emphasis solely on eye-catching projects we are at risk of forgetting the importance of investment in people in these communities, without whom this vision cannot be realised.\"\nThey told Mr Johnson that the majority of people impacted by the cut \"are in fact already in work\" and  \"low paid, hardworking families will see up to \u00a31,040 slashed from their income\". \nThe \u00a320-a-week boost is \"one of our best legacies from the pandemic\" and the investment must continue, they added. \nSpeaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Aldous said the feedback he is getting in his constituency is \"that this is going to cause an awful lot of problems to a lot of people, both in work and looking for work\".\nHe said that over the past 10 years, universal credit had \"not had the funding that it needed\" and there was \"an element of catch up\" that the extra \u00a320-a-week was helping to address. \nThe MPs' intervention comes amid increased warnings from campaigners as the change looms. \nThe charity Citizens Advice has warned that a third of people on universal credit, or at least 2.3 million people, will end up in debt when the extra payment is removed in October. \nIt said the average shortfall for people would be between \u00a351 and \u00a355 a month.\nIts chief executive, Dame Clare Moriarty, said: \"A cut to universal credit this autumn will be a hammer blow to millions of people.\n\"It undermines our chance of a more equal recovery by tipping families into the red and taking money from the communities most in need.\n\"The government must listen to the growing consensus that it should reverse course and keep this vital lifeline.\"\nIn a separate breakdown of the figures, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which campaigns against poverty, said a third of working age families would be affected in more than 400 constituencies across Britain. \nDeputy director of policy at the charity, Katie Schmuecker, said with warnings coming from all sides, \"now is the time for all MPs to step up and oppose this cut to their constituents' living standards\". \nShe added: \"Plunging low-income families into deeper poverty and debt as well as sucking billions of pounds out of local economies is no way to level up.\n\"It's not too late for the prime minister and chancellor to listen to the huge opposition to this damaging cut and change course.\"\nSpeaking on the Today programme, one universal credit claimant, Karen, said the extra \u00a320 a week had meant \"everything\" to her.\nShe went on to the benefit after being unable to return to work after a car accident, and has had notification that her payment will revert to the old rate after her September instalment. \nShe said: \"I've found everything is so much more expensive now especially with lots of shortages in the shops. \n\"You can't make a choice and budget like you used to be able to do. \n\"Everything still has to be paid, the electricity bill still has to be paid.\"\nThe universal credit uplift was designed to be a temporary measure to help people through the pandemic. \nAnd the number of people on the benefit has doubled over the course of the crisis - so the extra money costs a lot at a time when the Treasury is trying to bring spending under control.\nBut charities and opposition parties argue removing the extra \u00a320 a week will have a devastating impact on individuals and families already struggling to make ends meet. \nThere was a debate in government over ending the uplift - the Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey argued for it to stay. \nAnd several Conservatives are nervous about the impending change - with this letter a sign of how unhappy some backbenchers are. \nThe question is whether more will speak out in the coming weeks, and how much pressure they will put on No 10 and 11 to have a rethink.\nLabour also criticised the cut, saying it would hit the lowest paid hardest and damage the country's economic recovery.\nShadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said: \"Time is running out for the Conservatives to see sense, back struggling families and cancel their cut to universal credit. \n\"Labour would maintain the uplift until we can replace universal credit with a fairer social security system.\"\nSpeaking in July, Chancellor Rishi Sunak confirmed the uplift would be scrapped \"as it was always intended to be a temporary measure\". \nHe said like the furlough scheme, the top-up was part of the policies put in place to deal with the crisis and would have to come to an end. \nAnd he said ministers thought the best approach going forward to support people was to \"help them into work and make sure those jobs are well paid\".\nA government spokesman said: \"The temporary uplift to universal credit was designed to help claimants through the economic shock and financial disruption of the toughest stages of the pandemic, and it has done so. \n\"Universal credit will continue to provide a vital safety net and with record vacancies available, alongside the successful vaccination rollout, it's right that we now focus on our Plan for Jobs, helping claimants to increase their earnings by boosting their skills and getting into work, progressing in work or increasing their hours.\""

We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nCanada and Denmark are among seven countries moving to the UK government's green list in the latest changes to Covid travel restrictions. Finland, the Azores, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Lithuania will join them. Thailand and Montenegro are being added to the red list - meaning they are considered to be among the highest-risk destinations. The changes will come into force at 04:00 BST on Monday. Check our holiday rules explainer for all the latest information.\nA BBC Radio Newcastle presenter died due to complications from the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, a coroner has found. Lisa Shaw died at the age of 44 in May after developing headaches a week following her first dose of the vaccine. The inquest heard that Ms Shaw suffered blood clots in the brain which ultimately led to her death - but the condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine was very rare. After the hearing, Ms Shaw's family said: \"She truly was the most wonderful wife, mum, daughter, sister and friend.\"\nTwo Tory MPs have asked Boris Johnson not to press on with plans to cut universal credit payments. A temporary \u00a320 increase to the payments was introduced in response to the pandemic, but it officially ends on 6 October. Charities have warned that cutting the top-up will push millions of families into debt, but ministers say the increase was only ever temporary. The PM said the key focus for the government was on coming out of the pandemic with \"a jobs-led recovery\".\nSome university students have voiced concerns that prospective students are being offered things such as bursaries and discounted accommodation if they choose to delay their place for a year - saying that they, too, have had their education disrupted and have \"borne the brunt of this pandemic\". The deferral packages are an attempt by universities to tackle course oversubscription, after a record number of school students achieved top A-level grades. It's great news for those who are about to start university, but current students think it's unfair. \"It feels like we've been forgotten about,\" says Alice Clarke, 21. \"The incoming students have been prioritised.\"\nIndia is ramping up its coronavirus vaccination drive as it races to stave off a third wave of infections. It's now given out more than 600 million doses of three approved vaccines. The government said it took just 19 days to administer the last 100 million doses, compared to 85 days to give the first 100 million.

      "text": "Scientists say light pollution may be contributing to \"worrying\" declines in insects seen in recent decades.\nIn a UK study, artificial street lights were found to disrupt the behaviour of nocturnal moths, reducing caterpillars numbers by half.\nModern LED streetlights appeared to have the biggest impact.\nThere is growing evidence that insect populations are shrinking due to the likes of climate change, habitat loss and pesticides.\nFactors are complex and varied, including the steady loss of forests, heathlands, meadows and marshes, overuse of pesticides, climate change and pollution of rivers and lakes.\nThe use of artificial lights at night-time has been proposed as another driver of insect decline, although the scale remains unclear.\nThe researchers say their study, published in Science Advances, is the strongest evidence yet that light pollution can have detrimental impacts on local insect populations, with consequences for the birds and other wildlife that rely on caterpillars for food.\n\"In a local setting we can now be quite confident that light pollution is important, but what's less clear is if we're looking at a whole landscape,\" said lead researcher Douglas Boyes of the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.\n\"If insects are in trouble - as we believe they are, and have evidence to support that - perhaps we should be doing all we can to reduce these negative influences.\"\nThe researchers think street lights may deter nocturnal moths from laying their eggs or put the insects at risk of being spotted and consumed by predators such as bats. \nIn turn, caterpillars that are born under streetlights, particularly LEDs, alter their feeding habits.\nBut there are practical solutions that don't compromise public safety, they say, including dimming streetlights in the early hours, fitting motion sensors or using colour filters to cut out the most harmful wavelengths.\nIn the study, experts from the charity, Butterfly Conservation, Newcastle University and the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology surveyed caterpillars on stretches of grassland and hedgerows at the sides of roads in southern England.\nEach of 26 sites with streetlights in Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire was compared with a similar stretch of unlit road nearby. \nSurveys showed a reduction of caterpillars by about half in lit areas (47% reduction in hedgerows; 33% in grass margins). \nIn a second experiment, lighting rigs were set up in fields. They found a reduction in caterpillars under LED lights, suggesting an effect on feeding behaviour.\nScientists are increasingly concerned about the decline of some populations of insects.\nOne scientific review of insect numbers in 2019 pointed to 40% of species undergoing \"dramatic rates of decline\" around the world.\nThe study said bees, ants and beetles were disappearing eight times faster than mammals, birds or reptiles, while other species, such as houseflies and cockroaches, were likely to boom.\nThe loss of insects has far-reaching consequences for entire ecosystems.\nInsects provide a food source for many birds, amphibians, bats and reptiles, while plants rely on insects for pollination.\nFollow Helen  on Twitter.\nHear more about how artificial street lighting is impacting insects on the BBC Inside Science podcast on  BBC Sounds"

      "title": "'My husband refused a divorce for nine years'",
      "tags": "Marriage,Divorce laws,Judaism",
      "text": "Rifka Meyer was 32 when she entered into a religious marriage. Two-and-a-half years later, she became what is known among orthodox Jews as a \"chained wife\" - trapped in a religious marriage with a man who refused to let her have a divorce.\n\"You feel hopeless and you feel very alone,\" she tells BBC Newsnight. \"You feel like you're screaming and not being heard.\"\nIt would take her nearly 10 years to get a religious divorce. But more than 100 women from the Charedi Jewish community remain trapped in religious marriages in the UK, according to Labour Peer Jonathan Mendelsohn, who is part of a cross-party parliamentary group that formed to help them. \n\"The thing that has shocked me [is] that I alone have been contacted by people since I raised this issue,\" he says. \"Tens of cases, tens of cases, including a number of people in the Jewish community in which I live.\"\nUnder orthodox Jewish law, the husband must grant his wife a document called a \"get\" in Hebrew. Without this, worshippers believe she remains married to him even if they are legally divorced. The women stuck in these religious marriages are known as Agunot, or \"chained wives\".\nMs Meyer says it meant she was not permitted to have another partner. \n\"You're stuck. I can't even think of meeting anyone, or dating or moving my life forward because I am stuck in this corner without a view and I just can't go anywhere from there,\" she says.\n\"There's not enough communication and support to help you through it. You feel very desperate and very alone. It's a very lonely journey to go through.\"\nMs Meyer, who lives in London, finally received her get last year. She now runs a charity called GETT Out to help women who are in the same situation.\nAn amendment to the statutory guidance under the Domestic Abuse Act now says that withholding a get can be a form of domestic abuse. If it is deemed controlling or coercive behaviour, the man could be charged and, if found guilty, imprisoned. \nMinisters hope the change will give women more power to complain to the authorities about their former partners for not granting a religious divorce.\nBut the Federation of Synagogues, a group representing orthodox Jews, says any get \"given under duress, whether due to physical threats, financial threats or the threat of imprisonment, is absolutely invalid\" under Jewish law.\n\"The couple would remain married to one another, notwithstanding the granting of a get,\" it said in a letter.\nThe federation added that any woman using the provisions of the Domestic Abuse Act will have \"tied... the hands\" of the Jewish court, as \"clearly the husband in such a situation will be acting under duress\".\nEli Spitzer, a headteacher who is part of the orthodox Jewish community in London, says some rabbis believe that women seeking help under the legislation \"would start a process which is then irreversible\". \n\"The husband is no longer in a position to grant a divorce or to give the divorce to his wife out of free will because obviously he faces prosecution, and therefore what the rabbis are saying [is] this has undermined what a Jewish divorce is all about, that it has to be given out of free will,\" he says.\nBut Lord Mendelsohn, who is Jewish, believes there is no clash between religious and non-religious law, and questions the motives of the rabbis who say there is.\n\"They've chosen to create a conflict where none really exists. And I don't know why that is, I suspect [it] is because they feel they're losing control of parts of the process,\" he says.\n\"But in any situation where a religious minority exists in a democracy, you have to balance these things... I think they really have to get a grip of the situation and come to realise that this is Britain, this is Britain in 2021.\"\nSome worshippers have told Newsnight they believe the Torah did not intend for women to feel stuck in unhappy marriages. But there is concern among some in the orthodox community that secularism is overriding religion, wiping away centuries of deep-rooted tradition and law practised by millions.\nMs Meyer says that while the amendment to the guidance under the Domestic Abuse Act helps women, it is necessary to \"work with the rabbis as well\". \n\"The women feel desperate and they'll take whatever they can get in order to achieve their get,\" she says. \"It's a lifetime of these women being stuck in a marriage that's dead.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Freight transport,Haulage",
      "text": "A company which supplies food to care homes and restaurants says it is taking \"drastic action\" to try to get round the shortage of UK lorry drivers. \nThe boss of Country Range said the group was buying smaller vans in the face of \"significant\" problems caused by a lack of qualified HGV drivers. \nManaging director Coral Rose said the issue was \"going to get worse\" as schools and offices return to normal. \nIndustry warnings about the impact of driver shortages have been increasing.  \nOn Wednesday, both Tesco and Iceland said there could be some shortages on the shelves in the run up to the key Christmas trading period. \nA combination of Covid, Brexit and other factors has meant there are not enough drivers to meet demand.  \nThe Road Haulage Association estimates there is now a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, out of a pre-pandemic total of about 600,000. \nThat number included tens of thousands of drivers from EU member states who were living and working in the UK. Even before Covid, the estimated shortage was about 60,000 drivers. \nCountry Range is a group of 12 wholesalers supplying food and non-food items to schools, care homes, hotels, restaurants and small shops. \nMs Rose said the shortage of drivers had affected both the supply of products from manufacturers to its warehouses and also from its warehouses to its customers. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Rose said Country Range was \"taking drastic action such as buying smaller delivery vehicles to make sure that we don't have to have people with specific HGV licences to drive them\".\nThere was \"going to be increased pressure as schools reopen, people continue to holiday in the UK, people return back to their offices, so staff feeding may reopen again, so the issue is going to get worse and we would like government intervention\", she added.\nOne short-term fix the government could take would be to a temporary visa scheme \"to encourage EU workers to come back\", she said.\nBut she wants the government to give support for people with training and apprenticeships in the longer term \"because this is not a quick fix, it's a long-term issue\".\nMs Rose also said: \"There's lot of drivers who are able to drive but can't go on the road at the moment because they couldn't take their tests or refresher course and training through the last year because of Covid, so there's potential to release a lot more drivers. There could be some increased resource in that area as well and that would help.\"\nOn Wednesday, the government said there was a \"highly resilient\" food supply chain and it was taking measures to tackle the driver shortage.\nLabour's shadow minister for business and consumers, Seema Malhotra, said: \"The chaos hitting supply chains is of the Conservatives' making. Their failure to keep their promise to cut red tape for businesses, which are struggling with more paperwork and higher costs, combined with worker shortages, has created a perfect storm.\"\nThe government said it had \"well-established ways of working with the food sector to address food supply chain disruptions\". \nA spokesperson added the government had announced measures to tackle driver shortages, which included streamlining and increasing tests.\n\"Most of the solutions are likely to be driven by industry, with progress already being made in testing and hiring, and a big push towards improving pay, working conditions and diversity,\" they added. \n\"We want to see employers make long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad.\"\nThe motor industry has already reported that van sales have hit near record levels in 2021 as a result of a boom in home deliveries and the economy reopening. \nMs Rose admitted that a firm such as Country Range buying more small delivery vans would increase the number of vehicles on the roads. \"More vehicles and more staff required to do that, it's not an ideal scenario but it's something that we're trying to do to continue to supply our customers.\"\nShe said steps were needed in order to encourage people to take up driving jobs. \"We need to make this an attractive profession and a recognised profession, not just with food service but within the whole of the UK. \n\"The average age of the drivers is over 55 - there isn't a lot of new blood coming into the industry because it takes time and money to train and people don't necessarily have that.\" \nStaff shortages in the food industry are extending beyond drivers.\nBolton-based Greenhalgh's Craft Bakery has a chain of shops in Greater Manchester and Lancashire, and delivers wholesale nationally. \nSix members of the firm's management team have been taking turns to do shifts driving the delivery vans.\nBoss David Smart told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"It's a bit of a perfect storm really. We are short of drivers but it isn't just drivers, we're actually short of quite a few people throughout the business from bakers to bakery operatives to shop colleagues to drivers to office staff.\n\"It's the August bank holiday, everybody wants to go everywhere and because we're a food service industry we try to supply all those areas. We're extremely busy. However, we are very, very busy with too few hands.\""

      "text": "Nearly 200 people have been arrested at Extinction Rebellion demonstrations in London over the past four days.\nOn Wednesday, the climate change protesters blocked off roads near Oxford Circus, glued themselves to a giant table and formed a human chain around the area cordoned off by police.\nDozens were carried to police vans by officers who used loudspeakers to warn the crowd to leave or risk arrest.\nAt least 10,000 people congregated near the rallies since they began on Sunday.\nCurrently, 196 people have been arrested on suspicion of a variety of offences.\nWhat is Extinction Rebellion and what are its aims?\nThe Brazilian embassy, Piccadilly Circus and the Department for International Trade (DIT) were also targeted, with thousands listening to speeches and parading through the streets.\nThe group gave the DIT a mock award for \"making an outstandingly awful contribution to climate change\" and the embassy gathering was \"to show solidarity with indigenous people in the Amazon rainforest\".\nThe table, which had previously been erected in Seven Dials, represents an invitation to \"come to the table\" for discussions about fossil fuel. Chairs were left empty to represent an invitation to all those who identify as female, nonbinary or trans.\nExtinction Rebellion coordinate these actions very carefully.\nJust after 14:00 BST about 50 female protestors converged on the road junction at the centre of Oxford Circus.  \nA van drew up, the back doors were flung open, and women began to unload what looked like giant pieces of pink Lego.\nQuickly they began to assemble these in the middle of the road.\nAt the same time, 30 or so women formed a circle and superglued their hands together.  \nOthers lay down in the road and padlocked themselves together with locks inside steel tubes.\nThe idea is to make it as difficult and as time consuming as possible for the police to dismantle the protest.  \nWithin minutes, dozens of police officers arrived, charging into the middle of the group amid screams from the protesters. \nAnd the now familiar stand-off began, with police gradually tightening their cordons until - probably early tomorrow morning - they will go in and clear the remaining protesters from the streets.  \nThe demonstrations are planned to continue next week, when the activists will protest against the links between \"big finance, fossil fuels and the fossil of politics that is Westminster\"."
