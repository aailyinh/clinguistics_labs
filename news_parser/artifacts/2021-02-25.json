      "tags": "Ikea",
      "text": "If you started lockdown last year putting together a work-from-home desk, don't throw away the Allen key yet.\nIkea UK is planning to launch its promised \"Buy Back\" venture shortly after retail reopens, giving you the chance to return used items if you're heading back to the office.\nThe start of the scheme was postponed in November due to the pandemic.\nFinancial results for last year also show UK sales and profits fell sharply after Ikea stores closed in March.\nSome lost custom was made up for with an expanded online service as people scrambled to refurbish their homes and gardens during lockdown.\nBut overall revenues fell 10% in the year running from September 2019 to August 2020 and the business made a loss of \u00a332.7m.\nCustomers showed particular interest in sound absorbers and speakers, garden furniture, artificial plants and chairs and desks designed for gaming, Ikea said.\nEnthusiasm for Netflix series Tiger King prompted purchases of animal-themed wall art and sheepskin rugs, the firm added.\nOverall online sales were 31% higher than the previous year. \nBut the firm had to pause plans to start buying and selling second-hand items, postponing the scheme's November launch. \n\"Last year, Ikea was piloting Buy Back in our Edinburgh and Glasgow stores to explore how we support our customers to lead more sustainable lives, step by step,\" said Hege Saebjornsen, country sustainability manager for Ikea UK and Ireland.\n\"Irrespective of the trial being shorter than planned due to store closures, we believe strongly in the idea and moreover, believe that providing customers with more convenient ways to give their products a second life is the right thing to do.\"\nHe said Buy Back would launch as soon as possible after restrictions on non-essential shops were lifted, which the government has said will be some time after 12 April in England. In Scotland Ikea stores could open after 26 April. In Wales some non-essential retail may start to reopen from 15 March. Northern Ireland has not yet published a roadmap for reopening.\nThe Buy Back scheme offers customers cashback vouchers for a range of second-hand Ikea items including bookcases, tables, chairs and chests of drawers. Upholstered items will not be included.\nThe venture represented a \"brave\" move, said Lucie Middlemiss, associate professor in sustainability at the University of Leeds.\n\"I can't imagine it generating a lot of profit,\" she said. While the number of Ikea items available for resale on platforms like eBay suggested there was a market for things like Billy bookcases and desks, it wasn't clear whether customers would be willing to take the trouble of transporting the items to stores.\nThe items must be presented assembled, Ikea said. For larger items that could involve disassembling and flat-packing them to fit into the back of a car, before some quick work with an Allen key in the Ikea car park.\nIkea deserved credit for innovating in this area said Ms Middlemiss, but offering things like replacement sofa covers, which Ikea already does, probably did more to avoid \"fast furniture\", which like \"fast fashion\" encourages customers to update their styles on a regular basis, rather than keeping items for longer. \nIkea has already launched Buy Back schemes in 27 countries. In Australia, where it has operated for more than a year, more than 10,000 items have been returned.\nIkea has introduced further measures to improve its green credentials from using more sustainable wood and switching to renewable energy to adding plant-based balls alongside meatballs on its canteen menus.

      "title": "UK Covid alert level drops as NHS threat 'recedes'",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK's coronavirus alert level has been lowered from level five to four in all four nations as the risk that the NHS could be overwhelmed \"has receded\".\nThe four UK chief medical officers and NHS England's national medical director agreed the change following advice from the Joint Biosecurity Centre.\nThe alert level had moved to level five on 4 January, shortly before England and Scotland began fresh lockdowns.\nThe top medics urged people to \"remain vigilant\" by following lockdown rules.\nA change in the alert level does not automatically mean restrictions can ease, but it helps to inform government decisions on the rules.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon have this week set out their separate plans to lift lockdown restrictions. Northern Ireland and Wales will outline their plans in the coming weeks.\nEngland's Prof Chris Whitty, Northern Ireland's Dr Michael McBride, Scotland's Dr Gregor Smith, Wales's Dr Frank Atherton and NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said their decision to reduce the alert level was made because the number of cases in hospital was \"consistently declining\".\nHowever, they warned: \"We should be under no illusions - transmission rates, hospital pressures and deaths are still very high.\"\nThey said the vaccine rollout would eventually have \"a major impact\" but for the time being \"it is really important that we all - vaccinated or not - remain vigilant and continue to follow the guidelines\".\nProf Whitty added in a tweet: \"If we continue to follow the guidance, cases will continue to fall.\"\nA further 9,985 new coronavirus cases were reported in the UK in Thursday's daily figures, as well as 323 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test.\nThe coronavirus alert level, unveiled by the UK government in May 2020, is measured by a five-level, colour-coded system.\nLevel five (red), the highest level, is when there is a \"material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed\" within 21 days, and extremely strict social distancing is enforced.\nLevel four indicates a high or rising level of transmission, with social distancing still enforced.\nThe UK's alert level dropped down to level three in June 2020. During the summer, restrictions were gradually relaxed to allow people to socialise in groups indoors, and much of society reopened, including pubs and restaurants.\nHowever, the alert level was moved back up to level four in September as case numbers began to climb again. The same month a new, fast-spreading variant of the virus was detected in Kent. \nAs cases spiralled across the UK, the country moved to the highest level, level five, on 4 January.\nThe move to alert level five was made because the chief medical officers were worried the NHS was at risk of being overwhelmed.  \nIt was an announcement that essentially forced England's third national lockdown. \nBut since the number of cases peaked at over 39,000 in mid-January, cases have fallen rapidly. \nIn fact, the numbers of new admissions coming in each day are not far off what you would normally get for respiratory illnesses in winter.  \nBut while the immediate threat is over, hospitals are still incredibly busy. There are over 16,000 patients with Covid in hospital - that's only around 25% lower than the total in the peak of the first wave.  \nOperating theatres continue to be used as temporary critical care areas and non-urgent care is being cancelled in some places. \nBut with infection levels still coming down, we know this will ease further, hence the move to level four. \nThe Joint Biosecurity Centre, set up by the government in spring last year, has the task of recommending what the alert level should be, based on:\nThe centre's scientists identify changes in infection rates using testing, environmental and workplace data.\nNHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said despite the UK's alert level dropping, there was a \"long way to go yet\" and that no-one from the health service was \"anywhere near declaring this phase of battle won\".\nMeanwhile, new NHS England figures suggest one in five adults in England under the age of 70 have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. \nAn estimated 20.3% of people between the ages of 16 and 69 had been given their first jab as of 21 February, the figures say.\nHowever, the figures highlight some regional variations, with at least one in four over-70s yet to receive their first dose in several parts of London.\nMore than 18 million people have had a first vaccine dose - equivalent to one in three adults in the UK.\nThe vaccine rollout has entered its next phase, after everyone in the top four priority groups was offered a jab.\nMany areas are now offering vaccine appointments to over-60s, adult carers of disabled people and younger adults in care homes."

      "text": "The government is being urged to give GCSE and A-level students more information about this year's exams as soon as possible. \nHead teachers say it would help pupils deal with the disruption caused by the recent Omicron surge.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh governments have confirmed that face coverings will remain compulsory in high schools. \nAll UK schools must offer face-to-face teaching to every age group, and provide effective online learning for pupils who are absent or isolating.\nThe specific Covid measures in place vary across the nations. \nAll school staff and secondary school pupils are asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week (three in Wales).\nIn England, secondary school pupils no longer need to wear masks in the classroom, and won't be required to wear them in communal areas from 27 January.\nA teachers union has urged the government to give GCSE and A-level students information about this year's exams ahead of the planned update on 7 February. Pupils will be offered a choice of topics in some subjects, but don't yet have the final details. \nIn Wales, some schools have reintroduced year-group bubbles, and have staggered start and finish times. Face coverings will remain compulsory in classrooms and communal areas until the end of the February half term, when schools will be expected to revert to their normal timetable. Rules will be reviewed on 10 February. \nIn Northern Ireland, schools reopened with the same measures as last term. New guidance says all primary and post-primary pupils in a class where there are multiple Covid cases should take an LFT. The overall guidance to schools will be reviewed in mid-February.\nIn Scotland, social distancing remains in place, pupils are separated into groups where possible. Pupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the 1m (3ft) social distancing rule still applies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the guidance for schools was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nThe latest data for England shows that 415,000 pupils (5.1%) were absent for Covid-related reasons on 20 Jan, up from 3.9% on 6 January.\nOver the same period, 4.5% of teachers and leaders were off because of Covid, although a quarter of schools had absence rates above 15%.\nIn addition, 4.7% of teaching assistants and other staff were off for Covid-related reasons. \nThe latest data in Northern Ireland shows that on 24 January, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covid - the highest rates since the new term began.\nIn Scotland on 21 January, 30,238 students (4.4%) were missing from school due to Covid-related reasons. \nMany schools have told the BBC they can't find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. A number of supply teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.\nEngland's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says the government is considering options to deal with staff shortages. \nHe previously urged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response.\nMr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes in the event of teacher shortages. \nBut teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children.\nYes - as long as they don't have any of the main Covid symptoms, under-18s don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. \nSimilarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. \nHowever, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advised to take LFTs for at least seven days. \nAll primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland should take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. \nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the second jab typically given 12 weeks after the first.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has also recommended that booster doses should be offered to children aged:\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has also been approved for five to 11-year-olds who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from Covid. \nThe JCVI also recommends that primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, but it's not yet clear when they might get the doses.\nChildren who aren't considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after testing positive for Covid before being vaccinated.\nVentilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid. \nIn England, the government is making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. \nLabour says this isn't enough, but the Department for Education says the units are only required in areas where doors and windows cannot be opened effectively.\nSome 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors had already been promised for England's schools to help identify areas with poor ventilation, but teaching unions complained this won't solve the problem. \nThe Scottish government gave \u00a3100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.\nThe Welsh government has a \u00a36m programme to increase air circulation and purity which will provide 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines."

This excuse that they can't come due to Covid restrictions simply doesn't stack up,\" he said.\n\"She must come to Skewen and see the damage herself... when she does she will realise there is an overwhelming moral case to do the right thing.\"\nA spokeswoman for the department of Business, Energy and Clean Growth said: \"We understand this is a deeply difficult time for the people of Skewen, and our sympathies remain with those who have been effected by the flooding in the local area.\"\nThe authority previously said work to cap the mine shaft would take three months, but a new water management system being built deep underground to divert the water would take at least six.\nThe authority's chief executive, Lisa Pinney, said: \"Every home flooded, from any cause, is a tragedy. Our sympathy remains with all those affected by this incident.\n\"Whilst not liable for the flooding we do recognise the impacts of the incident on the community and are doing all we are able to provide practical help and support.\"\nShe said the authority had built a new access road which has allowed families to return to their homes and was beginning \"permanent remediation works\" on the mine shaft.\nIt is also clearing private drains and will soon start work to \"support the reinstatement of gardens\".\nMs Pinney added: \"We can now begin the permanent remediation works to repair the mineshaft and build a permanent solution for the mine water to provide peace of mind.\""

He was due to sit his GCSEs this summer.\n\"I feel anxious and relieved at the announcement,\" he said.\n\"We missed months and months last year along with weeks of self-isolation this year, and huge disruption with teachers having to self-isolate to the point where we missed such big gaps in the curriculum, that sitting any sort of exam just wouldn't work because there would be whole sections we couldn't answer.\"\nAden said it was \"inevitable\" that exams would be cancelled but \"it's a shame\" it took the government so long to make the decision.\nHe added the last year has been full of stress and anxiety felt by him and his friends. \n\"It's been really hard, we had those months at the start where you couldn't go anywhere and it was really isolating and really stressful,\" he said.\n\"We then had that brief period where we thought we might go back for a couple of weeks at the end which we didn't and not being able to do the normal things like going to parties or going to gigs, it was really not great for anybody's mental health at all.\"\nWhile GCSEs and A-Levels have been cancelled, vocational exams are still expected to go ahead this month in England.\nA-level student Jacob Tait, from Stroud, is campaigning for BTecs exams to be cancelled.\nThe politics, maths and chemistry student said while he was pleased his A-level exams had been cancelled, it was \"immoral\" for vocational exams to go ahead as normal. \n\"We'd like BTecs to be on the same footing as GCSEs and A-Levels,\" he said.\n\"It's just unfair because we've missed at least 12 weeks of teaching, that's about three months.\n\"In different areas of the country different schools have been in lockdown for different amounts of time and people in different socioeconomic backgrounds have had different access to equipment.\n\"We've had a really good response online and with signature lists and we will be sending letters to our MPs.\""

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has denied allegations that the name of a woman who complained about Alex Salmond was passed to him during a government investigation.\nMr Salmond claims to have been told the name of a complainer when a meeting with Ms Sturgeon was being set up.\nLabour MSP Jackie Baillie said this was \"beyond belief\" and an \"extraordinary breach of confidentiality\".\nMs Sturgeon said she did not accept Mr Salmond's account and said opposition MSPs had taken his claims \"as gospel\".\nThe first minister said the claims of a conspiracy against her predecessor were \"deeply unfair to the women involved\" and to \"the efforts to create a culture in Scotland where women feel they can come forward with complaints\".\nMr Salmond is expected to give evidence to a Holyrood inquiry into the government's handling of complaints against him on Friday, with Ms Sturgeon to follow next Wednesday.\nMr Salmond has made accusations of a \"malicious and concerted\" attempt to remove him from public life, taking aim at Ms Sturgeon, her government and the party he once led, the SNP.\nThe first minister has rejected the claims, saying there is \"not a shred of evidence\" that there was a conspiracy.\nAt her weekly question session at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon was challenged by opposition leaders about Mr Salmond's claims and whether her government had engaged in a \"cover-up\".\nMs Baillie - a member of the Holyrood inquiry committee - said the probe was at its heart about two women who had been failed by the government, after it admitted its investigation of their complaints against Mr Salmond had been unlawful.\nAnd she said that \"astonishingly\", the name of one of the women involved had been passed to Mr Salmond while a meeting with Ms Sturgeon was being arranged.\nShe said the identity of the woman had been revealed to Geoff Aberdein - Mr Salmond's former chief of staff - and was then conveyed on to him.\nMs Baillie said this was an \"extraordinary breach of confidentiality\" and a \"fundamental breakdown of trust\".\nMs Sturgeon replied: \"Jackie Baillie is accepting at face value Alex Salmond's account of all of this. I do not accept his account of much of this, which is why when I sit before the committee I will go through in detail what happened and what did not happen, and I think that is the right and proper way of proceeding.\n\"Accepting at face value the conspiracy theories and the account of the man that women accused of harassing them seems to me to be quite a strange way of standing up for and supporting those women.\"\nPressed by Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie on whether the name was passed on, Ms Sturgeon said: \"To the very best of my knowledge I do not think that happened.\"\nThe breach is alleged to have occurred while arrangements were made for a meeting between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond at the first minister's Glasgow home in April 2018.\nMs Sturgeon says this meeting was the first time she learned of the complaints, but has accepted that it was set up via a meeting with Mr Aberdein at her Scottish Parliament office on 29 March.\nScottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said the truth was that Ms Sturgeon had known about the allegations prior to April 2018, and that this had been \"exposed\" by submissions made to the inquiry by Mr Salmond.\nParts of these submissions were later deleted after the Crown Office raised \"grave concerns\" about their contents, and Ms Davidson asked if Ms Sturgeon could \"understand why this looks to the public like a cover-up, when the exact evidence being redacted is the most damaging to her personally\".\nMs Sturgeon insisted that there was no cover-up, pointing out that she had referred to the meetings in her own written evidence submitted in August 2020.\nShe said: \"Scrutiny of me is important and necessary and legitimate.\n\"What is not legitimate is to pursue a conspiracy theory and a scorched earth approach that threatens the reputation and integrity of Scotland's independent judiciary, just because you don't like this government - and to sacrifice all that, if I may say, on the ego of one man.\"\nThe first minister also said the deletions made to submissions would not affect what questions could be asked of her.\nAnd she added: \"All of Alex Salmond's allegations and claims about me are in the public domain and have been widely reported.\n\"I have always fully expected to be questioned in detail about all of those allegations when I appear next week - there is nothing in terms of publication or non-publication that has ever led me to expect anything else.\"\nSpeaking on the BBC's Today programme SNP MSP Alex Neil said Mr Salmond did believe \"a number of people\" had been involved with \"conspiring against him and stitching him up\".\nHe is an ally of Mr Salmond and has previously said he would welcome the former first minister returning to Holyrood.\nMr Neil also said: \"I think Alex believes after he lost his Westminster seat there was a possibility of a by-election in Scotland in his neck of the woods and he believes some people were frightened of him coming back in, which he says he had no intention of doing anyway.\n\"I think the SNP leadership has got to try and put a lid on this.\n\"If it was proven there was a conspiracy - everybody involved in the conspiracy, I think, would be getting their jotters.\""

you have to do it and demonstrate that you're competent and safe.\"\nHowever, when they returned to the classrooms, students saw differences in the way their courses are carried out, with strict social distancing measures in place.\nMr Davies warned that the age profile of most college students made their return to the classroom \"a bit more risky in terms of public health\".\nHe said \"very specific\" social distancing and personal protection measures had been put in place to make the return as safe as possible.\nBefore Christmas students at Coleg Menai, Anglesey, and Coleg Meirion-Dwyfor, in Gwynedd, could study in \"contact groups\", also known as bubbles.\nNow they have to stay two metres apart from others while at the college and wear face coverings at all times.\nPrincipal Aled Jones-Griffith said: \"They can't take it off during the assessments either - so that is a critical difference to what things looked like before Christmas.\"\nMr Jones-Griffith said his colleges were inviting students back in a \"very controlled way\" and phoning them the evening before they arrived to check if they had Covid symptoms. \nTyler Hard, 19, went back to Coleg Gwent to restart his welding and fabrication course on Wednesday after months out of college, and said he was now \"dreading\" catching up.\n\"Working from home has been difficult,\" he said.\n\"I just sit at home and get the emails sent to me for the work and have to just do them at the laptop.\n\"We haven't done any practical work all year - so it's about getting it all done, or at least as much as we can get down now.\"\nHis classmate Callum Gammon, 19, said it was a \"great relief\" to get back to the workshop and restart the course.\n\"It has been quite worrying just in case we wouldn't have the time to get the work done,\" he said.\nAlex Guppy, who teaches the course, said while many of his students had been able to practice their skills on their apprenticeships, it was no substitute to being able to learn in college.\n\"It's massive to get them in, it gets them re-engaged and motivated to get back into the course,\" he said. \n\"We need to give them the skills and industry to survive in the workforce.\"\nEducation minister Kirsty Williams has said she hopes year 11 and 13 students, due to sit their A-levels and GCSEs, along with those doing \"similar qualifications in colleges\" would be able to return from 15 March. \nEllie Kidd, 18, is in her first year of a Level 3 Sport NVQ at Coleg Cambria and said the lack of news about vocational courses in government announcements was \"frustrating\".\n\"People all over the country have completely different experiences learning at home,\" said Ellie, who added she has no idea when she will return to college.\n\"At least in school or college you're all getting the same education and learning the same things, but at home that's not possible for everyone.\"\nEllie said she hoped there would be clarity for students soon to help them return to face-to-face learning.\n\"In terms of announcements, I feel like all we normally hear about are GCSEs and A-levels,\" she said.\n\"It's quite irritating, because we just wish... we got more vocational course updates too.\n\"If you've taken a practical course it's because you enjoy the practical parts. Not having that practical element [at home] can make the written work a bit harder for you.\" "

      "text": "A pop star who was told she was \"not British enough\" to enter The Brits and the Mercury Prize has won a reversal in the awards' eligibility rules.\nRina Sawayama was told she could not compete for the prizes last year, because she was not a British citizen.\nThe singer, who has lived in the UK for 26 years, has now won the right to compete, after meeting award bosses.\nUnder new rules, artists who have been resident in the UK for more than five years qualify for the main prizes.\nSawayama holds indefinite leave to remain in the UK, but retains a Japanese passport to maintain ties with her family, including her father, who live in her country of birth.\nAs Japan does not allow dual citizenship, she cannot have a British passport. That led to her critically-acclaimed debut album, also called Sawayama, being ruled ineligible for last year's Mercury Prize.\n\"It was just heartbreaking,\" she told BBC News.\n\"I think a lot of immigrants feel this way -  where they assimilate and they become part of the British culture... and to be told that we're not even eligible to be nominated is very othering.\"\nSawayama first raised concerns about the situation in an interview with Vice last year.\n\"All I remember is living here,\" she said. \"I've just lived here all my life. I went to summer school in Japan, and that's literally it. But I feel like I've contributed to the UK in a way that I think is worthy of being celebrated, or at least being eligible to be celebrated.\"\nThe hashtag #SawayamaIsBritish trended in the UK shortly after her interview was published.\n\"Part of me that worried that I was... going to get blacklisted from the music industry for bringing this up,\" she told the BBC. \"But I'm glad I did.\"\nThe singer subsequently met with the BPI, which organises both the Brits and the Mercury Prize, and convinced them to review their criteria.\n\"I'm over the moon to share the news that, following a number of conversations, the BPI has decided to change the rules,\" Sawayama posted on Instagram on Wednesday.\n\"Starting this year, artists (like me) will be eligible for nomination even without British citizenship.\"\nThe Brit Awards confirmed the change to the BBC, saying it would apply to all its award categories, as well as the Mercury Prize.\nArtists will now have to meet one of three criteria to be eligible:\nThe change means Sawayama will be eligible for this year's Rising Star award, which recognises up-and-coming talent. \nHowever, she will not be able to compete in the main categories - including best British female and best album - as her record did not chart in the Top 40.\nSawayama has previously benefitted from funding from the BPI Music Export Growth Scheme, a grant that supports and celebrates British musicians, and her album is littered with references about growing up in London.\nThe record, which skilfully blends millennial pop and R&B with elements of nu-metal, was one of the best-reviewed new releases of 2020, with an average score of 89% on the review aggregation site Metacritic. \nMany publications, including the Guardian and the NME, named it among their best albums of the year; and it took 11th place in the BBC's \"poll of polls\", which combined the year-end lists from 35 influential newspapers, magazines and blogs.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Customs authorities in Germany and Belgium have seized a record amount of cocaine - more than 23 tonnes - that was destined for the Netherlands.\nGerman officials discovered 16 tonnes in five shipping containers that had arrived in the port of Hamburg from Paraguay earlier this month.\nPolice in the Netherlands were notified and a further 7.2 tonnes of cocaine was seized at the Belgian port of Antwerp.\nGerman officials said the cocaine had a street value of billions of euros.\nA 28-year-old man suspected of involvement in the trafficking of the drugs has been arrested in the Netherlands, Dutch police said on Wednesday.\nThe two raids, which took place earlier this month, resulted in the seizure of an \"enormous amount of cocaine\", customs officials said. \nIn Antwerp, the drug was hidden in a container filled with wooden blocks from Panama.\nThe cocaine found in the northern German city of Hamburg was concealed in tins of wall filler, which had entered Europe on a container ship from Paraguay. \nCustoms officers decided to take a closer look at the Paraguayan containers after noticing \"clear irregularities\" with some of the contents - tin cans that were meant to be filled with putty.\n\"Beyond a layer of genuine goods, packed just behind the container door, numerous tin cans were in fact filled with other goods,\" officials said.\nInvestigators then ordered the containers to be unloaded, and found cocaine stashed away in more than 1,700 tins.\n\"This is the largest amount of cocaine ever seized in Europe and one of the largest single seizures worldwide,\" German customs said, referring to the Hamburg haul alone.\n\"We are estimating a street sales value of between \u20ac1.5bn and \u20ac3.5bn ($1.8bn and $4.2bn) for the 16 tonnes,\" Hamburg customs official Rene Matschke told AFP news agency. \nHamburg is Europe's third biggest port, and the largest in Germany.\nParaguay has been a key transit country for drugs for years. \nPowerful drug trafficking gangs from neighbouring Brazil, such as First Capital Command (PCC), have expanded across the border into Paraguay and are running many of the smuggling operations there. \nThe drugs are often shipped in containers from Paraguay to port cities in Europe. \nThis latest haul, however, is the biggest ever discovered in Europe. \nIn October, 11.5 tonnes of cocaine was discovered hidden in scrap metal containers that had arrived in Antwerp from South America.\nIn August 2019, customs officials at the port of Hamburg seized about 4.5 tonnes of cocaine from a shipment that was listed as soya beans. Officials said at the time that the haul could have been worth up to \u20ac1bn, depending on its purity. \nHigh-purity cocaine can be cut up or divided, with different substances added to increase profits when sold on the street. \nLast year, about 102 tonnes of cocaine was intercepted while heading for Europe."

      "tags": "Teaching,Schools,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus testing,Gavin Williamson,Exams,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "GCSEs and A-levels cancelled in England by the pandemic will be replaced by grades decided by teachers, the exams watchdog Ofqual has confirmed.\nSchools can determine grades this summer by using a combination of mock exams, coursework and essays.\nThere will be optional assessments set by exam boards for all subjects, but they will not be taken in exam conditions nor decide final grades.\nResults will be published earlier in August to allow time to appeal.\nSchools minister Nick Gibb said the government had devised \"the best system possible to ensure there is consistency and fairness in how teachers submit grades for their students\".\nAsked whether he accepted grades would be inflated this year, he told BBC Breakfast the government had put in place \"different checking mechanisms\" to ensure there was \"consistency\". \nHe added ministers had devised the \"best system possible\" to ensure \"fairly awarded grades at a time when we don't think it's fair for [students] to sit the exams in the normal way.\"  \nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted on Thursday that \"no child should be left behind as a result of learning lost during the pandemic\", which was why government had devised a \"fair and flexible system\" that would ensure all young people \"can progress to the next stage of their education or career\".\nThe new arrangements, which will be set out by Education Secretary Gavin Williamson in the House of Commons later, come after a consultation into how best to assess pupils after months of school and college closures.\nLast summer, thousands of A-level students had their results downgraded from school estimates by a controversial algorithm, before Ofqual announced a U-turn which allowed them to use teachers' predictions instead.\nThere will be no fixed share of grades and schools will not be expected to keep in line with last year's results or any earlier year.\nBut the Education Policy Institute think tank has warned the plans for this year risk \"extremely high grade inflation\".\nScotland,Wales and Northern Ireland have already announced that exams will be replaced by teacher-assessed grades.\nAfter last year's chaos, the exams watchdog Ofqual and the Department for Education say there will be no algorithm calculating results.\nInstead, the grading system will be built around teachers' judgements - with schools allowed to decide on the evidence to be used, such as mock exams, coursework and essays.\nIf students are unhappy at the outcome of what their school and teachers have decided, they can appeal, with no financial charge expected.\nFor those still wanting to take written papers, there will be an option of exams in the autumn.\nA-level results day will be 10 August, with GCSEs results given out on 12 August.\nThey are earlier this year to create a \"buffer\" for appeals, ahead of decisions over university places in the autumn.\nStudents awaiting the result of an appeal before being granted a university place will be prioritised under this year's system, Mr Gibb said on Thursday.\nBefore the end of the school year, teachers can tell pupils how they got on in the test papers set by exam boards - but not their final grades.\nThere will be test papers set by exam boards for each subject, which are intended to inform the judgement of teachers, but will not decide the final grades.\nThese have been labelled \"mini-exams\", but Ofqual says the tests, which will be optional for schools to use, should not be seen as exams.\nQuestion papers, which could be from previous exams, will be sent to schools before the Easter holidays and can be taken before 18 June, when schools have to submit grades to exam boards.\nThe intention is that regardless of how much time pupils might have missed out of school, they will have questions on a topic they will have studied.\nThese tests will be taken in class rather than exam halls, there is no fixed time limit for their duration and they will be marked by teachers.\nThere will be no fixed share of grades - and schools will not be expected to keep in line with last year's results or any earlier year.\nInstead teachers will be expected to award grades based on their professional judgement, drawing on whatever evidence is available.\nSchools will be given detailed information about grading and will be expected to ensure consistency between teachers. \nExam boards will check random samples and if there are specific concerns about unusual results, they can investigate and change grades.\nTeachers' grades will be used to replace written vocational exams, in the same way as GCSEs and A-levels.\nBut where there are practical, hands-on skills to be tested, such as for a professional qualification, some of these exams will continue in a Covid-safe way.\nThe results of some vocational qualifications will be released in the week of 9 August.\nCaitlyn in Wigan, aged 15, is taking nine GCSEs and has been studying at home where it's hard to concentrate and the wi-fi keeps crashing. She is glad she won't have to sit exams.\n\"You feel relief because there's not so much pressure,\" she says, especially when they had missed so much time in school.\n\"It's not the same as face-to face interactions with teachers,\" she says.\nThe mock exams she sat in November she found particularly hard. \"You had that fear of going into a hall with 200 people around you.\n\"It was really stressful as obviously, we'd been online learning so then you had to quickly cram everything in which made quite a few people drained.\"\nKori from Blackburn, aged 16, is taking five GCSES.\nHe says learning from home was \"in a way better for me, so I could concentrate and there was no-one to distract me\". Although he did miss the support of teachers when he got stuck.\nKori feels the assessments, the so-called \"mini exams\", that will be offered \"are going to be better for me\".\nAlthough he worries all the pupils this year might be judged unfairly because they didn't sit the full exams.\nThe Education Policy Institute warned of a \"high risk of inconsistencies\" between schools - and if there are large numbers of successful appeals or widespread grade inflation it could be difficult for universities and employers to distinguish between applicants.\nBut the ASCL head teachers' union supported giving schools \"flexibility over the assessments they use\". While the National Education Union said it was probably the \"least worst option available\".\nParenting charity Parentkind said \"teacher assessment is, under the circumstances, the fairest way to test pupils\".\nLabour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said delays to deciding a replacement for exams had \"created needless stress for pupils, parents and teachers\".\nAre you a teacher or a student?

      "text": "Tiger Woods will not face any criminal charges following the single-car crash he was involved in on Tuesday that left him with serious injuries.\nThe US golfing champion was driving alone on a Los Angeles downhill stretch of road known for crashes.\nHis SUV hit the central reservation, crossed into the opposite lane, rolled over several times and then plunged off the road and down an embankment.\nHe is recovering after surgery to his fractured leg and shattered ankle. \n\"A reckless driving charge has a lot of elements into it, this is purely an accident,\" Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told reporters.\nThere no evidence Woods was impaired by drugs or alcohol, he added.\n\"He was not drunk,\" he said on Wednesday. \"We can throw that one out.\"\nHe added the most Woods could face would be a low-level offence known as an infraction if investigators concluded that he was speeding or not paying attention, the AFP news agency reports.\nWoods underwent surgery on his leg after he was removed from the wreck of his car by firefighters and paramedics.\nHe suffered fractures on the tibia and fibula bones in his lower right leg.\nInjuries to his foot and ankle have been stabilised with screws and pins.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Villanueva said of the road where the accident happened: \"Because it is downhill, it slopes and curves, that area has a high frequency of accidents. It is not uncommon.\"\nHe said the car hit a kerb, a tree and rolled over several times. \nWoods, who had been recovering from a fifth round of back surgery in January, was in Los Angeles to host last week's Genesis Invitational PGA Tour event and was driving one of the tournament cars when he crashed.\nIt is not the first time Woods has been in a car accident. He was involved in a car crash in November 2009 which eventually led to admissions of infidelity and the breakdown of his marriage. He then took a break from golf, but returned shortly afterwards. \nFollowing five wins in 2013, Woods started just 24 events in the next four years because of chronic back pain and multiple surgeries.\nIn 2017, he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence when he was found asleep at the wheel of his car. He later pleaded guilty to reckless driving.\nHe had five prescription drugs in his system as he recovered from the spinal fusion surgery that ultimately gave him a second golfing career.\nWoods ended an 11-year wait to claim a 15th major title when he won the Masters at Augusta National for a fifth time in 2019. \nHe jointly holds the record for most PGA Tour wins at 82 with Sam Snead and is three behind Jack Nicklaus' mark of 18 major titles.\nWoods recently said he had hoped to recover from his back surgery in time to play in this year's Masters in April. \nHe ended 2019 sixth in golf's world rankings, but is now 50th."

      "text": "A Vincent Van Gogh painting of a Paris street has gone on display for the first time after spending more than 100 years behind closed doors.\nA Street Scene In Montmartre has been owned by a French family for most of the time since it was painted in 1887.\nSotheby's estimates it could fetch up to eight million euros (\u00a36.9m) when it is sold at auction next month.\nVan Gogh expert Martin Bailey told BBC News that this is \"the first time we are able to see it properly\".\nSmall reproductions have been made in the past, often in black-and-white. \"What is exciting is that it is a Van Gogh painting which has been hidden away ever since it came off the artist's easel,\" Mr Bailey said.\n\"It has always been in private collections, so only the owners and their friends knew it. \n\"It is an interesting picture because it is a transitional work between Van Gogh's Dutch years, when he painted in dark, earthy colours, and the exuberant works that he did in Provence. It was in Paris that he discovered the Impressionists, and this led him to explore colour.\"\nIt is one of a series of works Van Gogh created while lodging with his brother Theo in 1886 and 1887 a short distance from the street depicted in the painting.\nThe estimated price tag of five to eight million euros reflects the fact that the artist's Paris paintings do not fetch the \"mega sums\" of his Provence paintings, added Mr Bailey, who writes a blog on Van Gogh for The Art Newspaper.\n\"But until the hammer goes down, one obviously never knows what will happen at an auction. There is now a great deal of interest in Van Gogh in the Far East, so the Van Gogh market is truly global.\"\nThe painting will be displayed at Sotheby's auction houses in Paris, Amsterdam and Hong Kong ahead of its sale on 25 March.\nSotheby's said: \"The appearance on the market of a work of this calibre, and from such an iconic series, is undoubtedly a major event.\"\nMontmartre was still semi-rural when the scene was painted. A windmill features prominently behind some perambulating locals. The famous Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur church that now dominates the area was under construction at the time.\nVan Gogh left Paris for the south of France in 1888.

      "tags": "Cambridge,Princess Latifa,United Arab Emirates,Mohammed Al Maktoum,Dubai",
      "text": "Princess Latifa, the captive daughter of Dubai's ruler, has appealed to UK police to re-investigate the kidnap of her older sister from a Cambridge street more than 20 years ago.\nIn a letter shared with the BBC, Latifa tells Cambridgeshire police this could help free Princess Shamsa, who was captured on the orders of their father. \nShamsa, who was just 18 then and is now 39, has not been seen in public since.\nThe government of Dubai has not responded to BBC requests for comment.\nA High Court judge ruled in 2019, that Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum had abducted both daughters and held them against their will.     \nLast week BBC Panorama broadcast shocking videos Latifa had secretly recorded on a phone she had been given, in which she described how she was being held \"hostage\" by her father following a failed escape attempt in 2018. The UN has since asked the United Arab Emirates for proof that Latifa is alive. \nBut almost two decades earlier, an attempt by her older sister to flee the family also ended in capture and imprisonment.\nIn August 2000, around two months after escaping from her father's Longcross Estate in Surrey, Shamsa was forcibly taken from Cambridge, flown by helicopter to France and then by private jet back to Dubai.   \nLatifa's handwritten letter, which was passed to the Cambridgeshire force by her friends on Wednesday, urges action for her sister by British authorities. It was written in 2019 while she was being held in solitary confinement in a \"jail villa\". \n\"All I ask of you\", writes Latifa, \"is to please give attention on her case because it could get her her freedom... your help and attention on her case could free her.\"\nShe adds: \"She has strong links to England\u2026 she really loves England, all of her fondest memories are of her time there.\"    \nLatifa dated the letter February 2018, before her escape attempt, to avoid revealing that she had a way of communicating with the outside world from captivity. It paints a chilling picture of her sister's fate after she was returned to Dubai. \n\"She was kept incommunicado with no release date, trial or charge. She was tortured by getting her feet caned...\"\nCambridgeshire police first launched a kidnap investigation in 2001 after Shamsa made contact via an immigration lawyer. But the investigation eventually hit a dead end when officers were blocked from going to Dubai.\nIt later emerged that aides acting for the sheikh had made representations to the Foreign Office around the time of the investigation. \nPolice reviewed the investigation in 2018, and BBC News can now reveal that one investigator acknowledged there were \"significant sensitivities\" with the case.  \nA further review was launched after the High Court judgment was published in 2020. \nIn a statement to BBC News, Cambridgeshire Police said it had received Latifa's letter, which \"will be looked at as part of the ongoing review\".  \nThe statement added: \"This is a very complex and serious matter and as such there are details of the case that it would be inappropriate to discuss publicly.\" \nThe Foreign Office, which has previously faced questions over its response in the wake of representations from a powerful state ally, told the BBC this was a private matter between two individuals and it had no role in the investigation by Cambridgeshire Constabulary or its outcome. \nThey also declined to comment on contact from the sheikh's office regarding the case. \nAfter the footage of Princess Latifa emerged, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the footage was \"deeply troubling\" and that the UK would \"watch very closely developments on that front\". \nIn 2018, the Dubai Royal Court told the BBC that Shamsa was \"adored and cherished\".\nThe sheikh's only statement on the case has been to the High Court, and speaks of \"relief\" at having found his \"vulnerable\" daughter Shamsa after she went missing. \nShamsa's story prefigured what happened to Latifa 18 years later and played a key role in her decision to seek a new life abroad. It led directly to her failed escape on a boat in the Indian Ocean. In a video posted to YouTube before her attempt to escape in 2018 Latifa describes what happened to her sister and its severe repercussions.\nBBC News has also spoken to someone who had regular contact with Shamsa in Dubai: \"You didn't need to be a doctor to know that [she] was tranquilised all the time.\"\nPrincess Shamsa had grown up partly in the UK and had been given a Western education.   \n\"Shamsa wasn't what you would call a 'Princess'\", according to her cousin Marcus Essabri, who lived with the family in Dubai for two years and was close to her. \"She was cheeky. Full of life and adventure.\" \n\"She wanted to make a difference for women, in the Arab world especially. She wanted to push the boundaries\u2026 this is when the problems started,\" Mr Essabri said.\nShamsa wrote to Mr Essabri from London in September 1999, nine months before her escape. Her father, then Crown Prince of Dubai, was not letting her pursue her studies and go to university.\n\"I'm not allowed to continue. You know that he didn't even ask me what I was interested in. He just said no.\" \nShe confided in her cousin that she was thinking of running away.  \n\"The one thing that scares me is imagining myself old and regretting not trying when I was 18. Try what? I don't know. Just taking that chance\".\nThen in summer 2000, she took it. She drove a black Range Rover to the edge of the sheikh's sprawling \u00a375m estate at Longcross in Surrey and slipped away. The sheikh deployed a team of agents to secretly track her down. \nOn 19 August 2000, a man took Shamsa to Cambridge, where they checked into the University Arms Hotel. Unbeknownst to her, up to four of her father's operatives had arrived, and she was captured on the street. \nShamsa was driven to the sheikh's estate near Newmarket. By 0500 the next day, she was on a helicopter from Newmarket to northern France, where she was transferred to a private jet. \nHours later, she was back in Dubai: her dreams of freedom and of an education over.\nIt took around seven months for the kidnap allegation to reach Det Ch Insp David Beck at central Cambridge's Parkside Police Station. \n\"It's not every day that an allegation involving a head of state lands on a police officer's desk,\" he told the BBC in 2018 for the documentary Escape from Dubai. \nShamsa had managed to get a letter to the immigration lawyer she'd met while she was in London earlier: \"I don't have the time to write in detail. I am being watched all the time so I'll get straight to the point. I was caught by my father, he managed to track me down. I am locked up until today\u2026 now, I am not only asking you to report this immediately, I am asking your help and to involve the authorities (involve everyone).\"\n\"The evidence at that point suggested that there may be some substance to what was being alleged. If the allegation was true, then an offence appears to have been committed against a UK law,\" Det Ch Insp  Beck told the BBC in 2018.\nMore details of the investigation were only revealed last year, when Cambridgeshire Police complied with a disclosure order from the High Court.\nIt emerged that he had managed to speak to Shamsa by phone, and then corroborated key details of her story. But he needed to go to Dubai to interview her and investigate further. He applied through the Crown Prosecution Service, but his request was rejected. \n\"I was never given a reason why.\"\nThe case was shelved, until a review in 2018 in the wake of yet another message from Shamsa. That was eventually closed because of \"insufficient evidence to take any further action\". \nThe sheikh did submit a statement to the High Court describing Shamsa as \"more vulnerable than other young women of her age\" because her status made her a kidnap risk.  \nLatifa's letter will represent the third time a plea has been made for police to investigate the abduction. \nThe sheikh's connections in the UK are deep. He is a friend of the Queen and one of the biggest private landowners in the country. Successive UK administrations have viewed the United Arab Emirates, of which Dubai is part, as a key strategic and business ally in the region.  \nIn 2000 or 2001 the sheikh's London office contacted the Foreign Office about Shamsa's case. The FCO would later confirm in a Parliamentary answer that they had responded that it was a matter for the police. But inside the Foreign Office, BBC News understands that there was silence about the alleged abduction.   \nTony Blair, then prime minister, told us through a spokesperson, that he has \"absolutely no recollection of this coming to him in government\".   \nIn response to a BBC Freedom of Information request for any conversations held by the FCO relating to the case, we were told that \"disclosure of information detailing our relationship with the UAE Government could potentially damage the bilateral relationship between the UK and UAE.\" \nLatifa has said that Shamsa spent the eight years after her capture in prison.\nWhen she was released in 2008, Latifa was able to see her. \"She had to be led around by her hand. She couldn't open her eyes\u2026 she was given a bunch of pills to control her. Those pills made her like a zombie.\"\nThe person who had contact with Shamsa after her release said: \"She was just\u2026. kept quiet. Everything she did was controlled. There was no spark in Shamsa any more. There was no fight in her. There was nothing. She was just a shell.\" \n\"I think she just resigned herself to the fact that this was her life. It's desperately sad.\"\nIn 2019 Latifa met Shamsa again, by which time Latifa was imprisoned herself after also trying to escape. She described the meeting to her cousin via her secret phone. \n\"Latifa warned me 'you are not going to recognise her now'. She has been drugged up so much. She is alive. But Shamsa is not Shamsa\", said Mr Essabri.\nThe person who has known Shamsa adds: \"You couldn't actually make this up. Because who would believe you. It seems so unreal. But unfortunately, it's real. And I understand that people can't get their head round it, they just see some rich girl. It's not like that at all. It's horrific.\" "

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Ghana,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Ghana has become the first country to receive coronavirus vaccines through the Covax vaccine-sharing initiative.\nA delivery of 600,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine arrived in Accra on Wednesday. The first recipients are due to be healthcare workers.\nThe Covax scheme aims to reduce the divide between rich countries and poorer nations unable to buy doses.\nThe programme is planning to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of the year.\nGhana, which has a population of over 30m, was chosen as the first recipient of the free vaccines after promising quick distribution and meeting the criteria set by Covax.\nFurther deliveries are expected to neighbouring Ivory Coast later this week, the Covax alliance says.\nVaccinations are expected to start in Ghana next week, and, as well as health workers, those over 60, people with underlying health conditions, and senior officials are due to be prioritised.\nThe vaccines delivered to Accra were produced by the Serum Institute of India and developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. The vaccine has been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its roll-out in Ghana is not part of a trial.\nThe doses being sent to lower-income countries such as Ghana are funded by donations. As well as procuring and delivering the vaccines, Covax partners are supporting local authorities in areas such as training people to administer the jabs and helping provide an adequate cold-chain storage and delivery system.\nMany nations in the developed world, which began their own vaccinations months ago, have faced criticism for buying or ordering more vaccines than they need.\nBut many of those countries placed orders for doses with pharmaceutical companies before knowing whether the vaccine in development would be effective. They were hedging their bets - placing multiple orders in the hope that at least some of them would work out.\nThe UK, which has ordered 400 million vaccine doses and will have many left over, has said it will donate most of its surplus vaccine supply to poorer countries.\nThe Covax scheme is led by the WHO and also involves the Global Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi). \nIn a joint statement, the WHO and the United Nations children's fund (Unicef) said it was a momentous occasion and \"critical in bringing the pandemic to an end\".\nGhana has recorded more than 80,700 cases of coronavirus and 580 deaths since the pandemic began. These numbers are believed to fall short of the actual toll because of low levels of testing.\nThough the vaccines are not generally intended for children, Unicef is involved in the scheme because of its expertise in procurement and the logistics of vaccine delivery.\nThe Covax scheme was set up by the WHO, the Gavi vaccines alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to try to prevent poorer countries from being pushed to the back of the queue.\nThe programme is designed so that richer countries buying vaccines agree to help finance access for poorer nations, too. \nIt hopes to deliver more than two billion doses to people in 190 countries in less than a year. In particular, it wants to ensure 92 poorer countries will receive access to vaccines at the same time as 98 wealthier countries.\nIt aims to reach up to 20% of the populations of poorer countries, at no cost to their governments.\nMost African countries are intended recipients of Covax, but a number of them such as Senegal have been making provisions for vaccines outside the initiative.\nCommenting on Wednesday's first shipment, the Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said it was a major first step but just the beginning.\n\"We will not end the pandemic anywhere unless we end it everywhere\", he added.\nAnalysis by BBC Africa health editor Anne Mawathe\nThe arrival of the first Covax vaccines in Ghana follows sharp criticism that African countries could be left behind in the fight against Covid-19. Western countries have been condemned for their rush to purchase more vaccines than they needed, leaving little left over for the rest of the world.\nBut this is just a start.\nGhana, a country with a population of about 31 million people, has now got a total of 600,000 doses of the vaccine. \nAfrica, a continent with about 1.4 billion people, is largely still waiting on Covax to deliver.\nIt is unlikely that many governments on the continent will go to the market and fight it out with countries with more financial muscle. In fact, most African countries will be buying the vaccines at a higher price than their Western counterparts, partly because they didn't pre-order.\nSome have called for the big pharmaceutical companies to stop blocking a patent waiver, which would lead to lower prices and mean more vaccine would be produced. \nBut the companies have not agreed to this, knowing it could dent any profit margin.\nCovax has so far raised $6bn (\u00a34.3bn), but says it needs at least another $2bn to meet its target for 2021.\nThe scheme has faced some criticism for not moving quickly enough. One WHO board member, Austria's Dr Clemens Martin Auer, said it had been slow to secure vaccine deals and deliver doses.\nThe joint statement on Wednesday said the shipment to Ghana represented \"the beginning of what should be the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in history\".\nNana Kofi Quakyi, who is a health policy research fellow at New York University's School of Global Public Health, told the BBC that Ghana would still struggle to compete with wealthier nations to make up the shortfall in doses it needed to find, even with the Covax initiative.\n\"The challenge that countries like Ghana are having is that in an open market, our bargaining power for bilateral deals is just not competitive against other wealthier countries that... in some cases, are buying more than they even need.\""

      "tags": "Google,Facebook,Australia",
      "text": "Australia has passed a world-first law aimed at making Google and Facebook pay for news content on their platforms.\nThe legislation had been fiercely opposed by the US tech giants, with Facebook blocking all news content to Australians over the row.\nFacebook agreed to reverse its decision after robust negotiations with the government, which led to changes to the law to address some of their concerns.\nThe law is seen as a test case for similar regulation around the world.\nThe amended legislation - the News Media Bargaining Code - was passed by Australia's House of Representatives on Thursday, after earlier going through the Senate.\nFacebook and Google had earlier argued the law \"fundamentally\" misunderstands how the internet works.\nThe news code encourages tech giants and news organisations to negotiate payment deals between themselves, and commits Facebook and Google to invest tens of millions of dollars in local digital content.\nIf negotiations fail, an independent arbitrator can set the price they pay domestic media - something analysts say benefits the news groups.\nThe government argues this prescribes a \"fairer\" negotiation process between the parties, as it gives news organisations more leverage.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) - a market regulator - says publishers have had little negotiating power until now because they are so reliant on tech monopolies like Google and Facebook.\nIt follows an investigation by the commission into the tech firms' online advertising dominance, which showed that in 2018 for every A$100 (\u00a356; \u20ac65) spent by Australian advertisers, A$49 went to Google and A$24 to Facebook.\nThe code also forces tech platforms to give notice to news publishers of changes to their algorithms, which decides which stories are being displayed.\nThe amended law also now requires the government to consider a platform's existing contributions to journalism - such as commercial deals with publishers - before applying the code to them. \nThis means Facebook and Google could escape the arbitration process entirely.\nThe government also has to give a platform a month's notice if it is considering applying the code. \nThe tech firms argue they already help news publishers by driving traffic back to news sites from their platforms.\nFacebook and Google simply help people find news content in the first place, the platforms say.\nBoth tech companies lobbied the Australian government to amend the law, while also pursuing contracts with local news companies. \nGoogle had threatened to withdraw its primary search engine from Australia, but the company recently agreed deals with local media companies including Nine Entertainment and Seven West Media worth an estimated A$60m ($47m; \u00a334m) in total. \nIt has also signed a deal for an undisclosed sum with Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Facebook promised to reverse its ban on news content, however Australian news pages remain unavailable. Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the ban would be lifted on Friday.\nFacebook has since signed at least one deal - with Seven West Media - and is in talks other Australian news groups.\nBoth firms have also committed to spending $1bn each in the news industry globally over the next three years. \nWhen Facebook decided to restore news content in Australia, the big question became who blinked first: Australia or the tech giant? \nBut this was really a major face-saving exercise. \nThe government - which was blindsided by the social media company - can say triumphantly that it convinced Facebook to reverse its decision. \nFacebook - which has done its reputation much damage globally by the move - can also claim it brought the highest levels of government to the negotiating table, and gained crucial amendments to a law it deeply disliked.\nCompromise seems to be a key word here. \nBut this whole stand-off isn't just about power - it's essentially about precedent. The world is watching this closely. And if Australia's move works, you can be sure that other countries will want to start their own negotiations.  \nFacebook's black-out of Australian news content in past week has triggered harsh criticism, both in Australia and globally. \nThe company has admitted it overstepped in also removing over 100 non-news pages, including key health and emergency agencies.\nBut its powerful action has been interpreted as a warning shot to lawmakers elsewhere - such as in Canada, the UK and the EU - who have expressed interest in Australia's law. \nAs more news readership has shifted online, tech giants have faced calls internationally to pay more for news stories hosted on their platforms.\nThey have also faced increased scrutiny over their power, including calls for them to do more to combat misinformation and abuse."

Many areas are now offering vaccine appointments to over-60s, adult carers of disabled people and younger adults in care homes.\nSome 600,000 people out of 1.7 million added to the shielding list last week are now being invited to book a slot for a vaccine, NHS England said, while the remainder have already had their jabs as part of the first phase of the vaccination programme. \nThe Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall have both received their first doses of the vaccine, with Camilla saying she \"leapt for joy\" after getting her jab.\nAnd the Duke of Cambridge said at a vaccine centre in Norfolk on Monday that he would be at the \"front of the queue\" for a vaccine to help to reassure people of its safety, but that he would \"wait my turn\".\nDuring his visit William also said his grandfather, Prince Philip, was \"OK\" after being admitted to hospital last week. \nThe Duke of Edinburgh remains at King Edward VII's Hospital in central London where he is being treated for an infection."

      "text": "No child should have their prospects \"blighted by the pandemic\", the education secretary has said.\nGavin Williamson was speaking at a Downing Street briefing as he set out \u00a3700m in funding to help pupils in England catch up on missed learning.\nAsked about what would replace exam grades this year, he said they were \"putting trust\" in teachers.\nIt comes as the number of people to receive one dose of the vaccine in the UK surpassed 18 million. \nA further 9,938 coronavirus cases were recorded across the UK on Wednesday, as well as 442 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to government figures. It takes the death toll by that measure to 121,747. \nLabour said the government should put forward a \"long-term plan... not just a quick fix over the summer\".\nThe government has confirmed that all schools will open from 8 March, as part of the first step of a roadmap for easing England's lockdown.\nAs part of the latest announcements, schools will have the option to run summer classes for pupils who need it most, potentially starting with those who will be moving up to Year 7 at secondary school this year.\nThe government says it will be up to schools to decide how and if they run summer schools, how long they will be, and which pupils will be invited to attend.\nMr Williamson said the funding announcements were about offering \"immediate\" support for children and schools.\nBut the education secretary said many children would need longer term support, and \"extensive work\" was under way on plans for that.\nHe said: \"We're going to make sure we do everything can do to make sure children reach their potential - while looking at all issues - and we're not going to be timid in aspirations for them and the actions we need to take.\"\nThe government's \u00a3700m education support package for England includes:\nHe also reiterated that there would be \"no algorithms whatsoever\" used in determining A-level, AS and GCSE grades, with marks \"firmly in the hands of teachers\". \nIt has already been announced that exams will not take place. \nThe minister said there would be a \"clear and robust\" appeals mechanism for students who are unhappy with their results.\nFurther details on how students in England will be graded this year will be set out on Thursday.\nThe challenge for the education secretary is to keep sounding as though he has a new plan for what everyone can see is a massive problem with no obvious easy answers.\nChildren have missed a huge amount of school and exams have been cancelled for two years running.\nThe latest announcement on catch-up has an extra \u00a3400m, but it's focused on a familiar check list - summer schools, tuition, after-school activities, much of which happens anyway and with schools deciding how it will be spent.\nGavin Williamson told Wednesday's press conference that the government was \"not going to be timid\", but the reports about radical plans such as longer school days and shorter holidays seem to have fizzled away.\nThe unshowy and highly-experienced school recovery tsar, Sir Kevan Collins, will be more interested in long-term results than show-boating headlines.\nThe education secretary ran through the plans for pupils going back to school - from 8 March with testing and masks - and that date offers families some certainty.\nAlthough university students must think they are being kept in an expensive limbo, with no date yet set for when many of them can return.\nThe education secretary also defended the requirement for pupils in secondary schools to wear face masks in classrooms. \nHe said it was a \"temporary\" measure that would be reviewed over the Easter break. \nAsked if the government was looking at lengthening the school day in the future, Mr Williamson said it was not part of the immediate plans announced, but it could be something considered as part of a wider consultation being led by education recovery commissioner Sir Kevan Collins into the longer term support and change needed within schools following the pandemic.\nThis week, the government announced that secondary school and college students in England will be asked to take regular coronavirus tests at home when they return to school next month.\nDeputy chief medical officer for England Jenny Harries said more testing in secondary schools would mean that parents, teachers and grandparents could be reassured that schools would be as safe as they could be. \nThese measures would have a positive impact on breaking the chains of transmission, she said. \nBut she warned that \"children should not go hugging grandparents too much\" before the the impact of the vaccine rollout was felt.\nLabour's shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the impact of lost learning for children was now \"baked in\" and she was sceptical about whether the catch-up tutoring programme would reach many of the children who needed it most.\nShe also said there needed to be a \"really robust moderation process to make sure that children are treated fairly... a robust appeals process\" and time for schools and exam boards to assess pupils and standardise results. \nIn Scotland, younger primary pupils have gone back to school, along with some exam year students in secondary schools. A wider reopening has yet to be decided.\nIn Wales, younger primary years also returned on Monday - with older primary pupils set to go back on 15 March if Covid levels continue to fall.\nIn Northern Ireland, younger primary pupils will return to classrooms on 8 March.\nLast year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a \u00a31bn catch-up fund for England, and later appointed Sir Kevan as education recovery commissioner.\nIn Scotland, the administration has promised \u00a3140m in funding to help disadvantaged pupils. Tens of millions of pounds have also been put into catch-up schemes in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe announcement comes as the Treasury has said its levelling-up fund will be extended to the whole of the UK to \"help boost growth\" in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland."

It\u2019s an aberration that we\u2019re going to correct as soon as possible,\u201d he told a conference on Wednesday.  \n\"I'm really not looking forward to going back into the office,\" Tom, a 35-year-old who works in urban planning, told the BBC.\nHe has enjoyed being more involved with his young children during the pandemic. But his employer is quite \"stubborn\" about wanting him back in five days a week.\n\"I have found the lack of understanding and support from the older generation of directors, as well as their eagerness to just go back to offices and not learn lessons really difficult.\"\nHe says his employer seems to assume there will be someone at home to cover childcare and other day-to-day demands, whereas the tech industry, where his wife works, allows more flexibility.\nTom is now looking for a new job that will offer him more choice.\n\"The best-case scenario for me would be two days in the office - to get that connection with colleagues - and two to three days at home.\"\nIn particular Mr Solomon was worried about an incoming \u201cclass\u201d of about 3,000 new recruits, who wouldn\u2019t get the \u201cdirect mentorship\u201d they need.  \n\u201cI am very focused on the fact that I don\u2019t want another class of young people arriving at Goldman Sachs in the summer remotely,\u201d he said.  \nAlthough he thought the Covid-19 pandemic had helped push the adoption of digital technologies and created ways for the investment bank to run more efficiently, Mr Solomon thought it would not lead to huge changes over the longer term. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think as we get out of the pandemic the overall operating mode of the way a business like ours operates will be vastly different,\u201d he said.  \nWithin the finance sector, it appears Mr Solomon is not alone. \nIn September, JP Morgan\u2019s chief executive Jamie Dimon said that working from home has had a negative effect on productivity. \nBarclays boss Jes Staley also expressed hope recently that the vaccine would allow employees to return to the office. \nHowever, more recently Lloyds Banking Group said it planned to cut the amount of office space it uses by 20% within three years, and HSBC has announced a 40% cut in its office footprint.\nTech companies, also appear to be more enthusiastic about work from home arrangements. \nMicrosoft, Facebook and Twitter have all said staff would have the option to work from home permanently. \nFacebook has suggested that up to half of its staff could work remotely within five to ten years. \nBut the social media giant has also hinted that remote workers might receive lower pay, as their expenses would be less away from San Francisco and Silicon Valley.\nAre you planning to return to the office soon?

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you on Friday morning. \nThe coronavirus alert level has been lowered from level five to four across all four UK nations. The four UK chief medical officers and NHS England's national medical director agreed the change following advice from the Joint Biosecurity Centre. It means that the risk the NHS could be overwhelmed is deemed to have \"receded\". The alert level has been at level five since early January, when Scotland and England began their latest lockdowns. You can read about how the Covid alert system works here. \nPlans for teachers to grade GCSE and A-level pupils in England this summer are a \"good compromise\", Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. Schools will determine grades using a combination of mock exams, coursework and essays, exam regulator Ofqual confirmed on Thursday. The prime minister said the process would be \"fair\" and \"durable\" amid concern it will result in grade inflation. You can read our piece here on what students and teachers think about the plans and analysis from our education correspondent Sean Coughlan.\nThe old pattern of peak commuting from Monday to Friday may never return after the pandemic eases, according to the chair of Network Rail. Sir Peter Hendy told the National Rail Recovery conference that commuter traffic could return to 80% of pre-pandemic levels. But he predicted that leisure travel might boost weekend traffic, especially if limits on international travel continue.\nThe number of rough sleepers in England fell by a third over a year, official figures suggest. Government statistics show 2,688 people on the streets on one night in autumn 2020, down from 4,266 in 2019. The fall follows the \"Everyone In\" scheme, which has housed about 37,000 people since the pandemic hit last March.\nCamp Bestival has become the latest UK festival to express confidence in going ahead as planned this summer. The four-day festival is due to take place at Lulworth Castle in Dorset from 29 July to 1 August. Its curator Rob da Bank said he was \"counting down\" the minutes, hours and days to the event. The government has said Covid restrictions in England could be lifted by 21 June - if strict conditions are met. On Wednesday, Reading and Leeds Festival organisers said they were \"very confident\" of running their events.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nRemind yourself when lockdown restrictions are being eased in your area.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has warned of an attempted military coup, after the country's armed forces said he and his cabinet must resign.\nThe army \"must obey the people and elected authorities,\" he told thousands of supporters in the capital Yerevan. His opponents held a rival rally.\nThe military's top brass was angered by the PM's sacking of a commander.\nMr Pashinyan has faced protests after losing last year's bloody conflict with Azerbaijan over a disputed region.\nNagorno-Karabakh is an enclave internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but which had been controlled by ethnic Armenians since a 1994 truce. \nDuring the six-weeks of fighting late in 2020, Azerbaijan not only recaptured areas around the enclave but also took the key town of Shusha inside it.\nUnder the Russian-brokered deal that emerged shortly afterwards, Azerbaijan keeps the areas it has captured. Hundreds of Russian peacekeepers are deployed in the disputed area.\nIn a Facebook video post on Thursday, Mr Pashinyan, 45, said he considered a statement by the military earlier on Thursday an \"attempted military coup\".\nHe urged his backers to gather on Republic Square in the heart of Yerevan, and was seen shortly afterwards surrounded by thousands of supporters on the streets of the city.\n\"The army is not a political institution and attempts to involve it in political processes are unacceptable,\" he told his supporters. \nBut he invited the opposition to hold talks on how to resolve the crisis, stressing that any change in power must take place \"only through elections\".\nMeanwhile, opposition supporters staged a rival demonstration in the capital, insisting that Mr Pashinyan must go.\nVazgen Manukyan, one of the opposition leaders, urged the crowds to start blocking the parliament, saying lawmakers should be brought in to vote for Mr Pashinyan's dismissal.\n\"Get ready, we will stay here all night and will block the street with barricades,\" he was quoted as saying by the Armenpress news agency.\nMr Pashinyan, a former journalist, took office after leading a peaceful 2018 revolution in the post-Soviet state.\nHe has recently survived several attempts in parliament to dismiss him.\nBy Ilya Barabanov, BBC Russian, Yerevan\nThis is the first time since the end of the war in Nagorno-Karabakh that Nikol Pashynian called on his supporters to come out on to the Republic square in the centre of the Armenian capital.\nWhile the prime-minister's supporters were gathering, the opposition assembled a rival rally nearby - in the Freedom square. The opposition's plan was to later head to parliament building, where some of the factions were attempting to start an emergency session to approve a call for an early general election.\nNeither of the rallies managed to gather considerable numbers. The opposition tried to set up some tents next to the parliament but their efforts were not that impressive, considering there were fewer than a thousand people in the vicinity. \nAround ten tents, a few wood-burning stoves, some makeshift tables with tea and biscuits for the protesters did not look like the sort of threat that might force the authorities to make any concessions. \nOpposition supporters said they were setting up barricades with rubbish bins. But the police had blocked all traffic in the area and kept the parliament building cordoned off, while not engaging with the protesters. A few hours later the police started leaving the area.\nThe General Staff of Armenia's military issued its statement soon after Mr Pashinyan had dismissed armed forces deputy chief Tiran Khacharyan.\nMr Khacharyan had ridiculed Mr Pashinyan's claims that Russia-supplied Iskander missiles failed to hit targets during the fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh.\nRussia has a military alliance with Armenia and an army base in the country, but it did not intervene during the conflict. It also has close ties with Azerbaijan and has sold weapons to both countries.\nAzerbaijan was openly backed by Turkey during the fighting.\nIn its statement, the military's top brass said \"the prime minister and the government are no longer able to make reasonable decisions\", according to the Armenpress. \n\"For a long time, the Armenian armed forces were patiently tolerating the 'attacks' by the incumbent government aimed at defaming the armed forces, but everything has its limits.\"\nThe statement accused Mr Pashinyan's government of making \"serious mistakes in foreign policy\" that resulted in the Armenian state being on the verge of destruction. \nSoon after the statement was issued, Mr Pashinyan also sacked armed forces chief Onik Gasparyan.\nIt is unclear if the two fired top commanders have left their posts, as President Armen Sargsyan first needs to approve the prime minister's orders.\nMr Sargsyan - who holds a largely ceremonial role in the country - urged all sides to \"show restraint and common sense\".\nTwo Armenian opposition parties backed the military's demand for Mr Pashinyan and his government to resign, calling on the prime minister to avoid a civil war.\nIn a statement, Armenia's National Security Service urged all sides to \"refrain from actions that threaten national security\".\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said: \"We strongly condemn the coup attempt in Armenia.\"\nRussia has expressed concern and called for calm. \nThe US called on \"all parties to exercise calm and restraint and to de-escalate tensions peacefully\"."

The safety of our patients and staff is incredibly important and it was necessary to make these difficult decisions to ensure this.\"\nThis week, Gwynedd Council said three schools in Bangor would be delaying their foundation age school return, which began from Monday, \"due to the increase in Covid-19 cases at Ysbyty Gwynedd\".\nThe schools are now expected to return on Monday 1 March.\nGwynedd currently has a case rate of 80.3 cases per 100,000. Some of its neighbouring local authorities have the highest case rates in Wales, such as Flintshire (97.4) and Anglesey (101.4). \nAnglesey council released a warning earlier in the week about the high case rates, urging people to follow the rules.\nIt said the \"stark figures, combined with the outbreak now declared at Ysbyty Gwynedd, has led Anglesey's Covid-19 Prevention and Surveillance Group to urge communities to remain very cautious and follow the basic rules to keep each other safe\". \nThe group comprises of representatives from Anglesey County Council, Public Health Wales, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, North Wales Police, Wales Ambulance Service Trust, Bangor University, Gr\u0175p Llandrillo-Menai and Anglesey GP Surgeries.\nBetsi Cadwaladr and Cardiff and Vale health boards both had the most \"probable\" and \"definite\" new cases in the week to 21 February - each with 42 - according to official PHW figures.\nThe north Wales health board has had 474 cases since the start of November."

      "text": "The UK will never meet its carbon targets unless homes are better insulated, ministers have been warned.\nThe Climate Change Committee (CCC) - an independent body which advises the UK government and devolved administrations - says the struggling Green Homes Grant must be rescued.\nThe scheme offers households up to \u00a310,000 to insulate their property.\nBut many have not been able to apply because contractors were overwhelmed - and some contractors have not been paid for work done.\nThe Times has reported that the scheme might be axed in next week's Budget.\nBut CCC chief executive Chris Stark said he believed no decision to scrap it had yet been taken.\nHowever, it is clear the chancellor wants to claw back cash from an original \u00a31.5bn budget, of which just \u00a3109m has been spent on the scheme, which currently has one more month to go.\nThe government says Rishi Sunak will divert the under-spend into Treasury coffers, rather than keeping it for insulation.\nThe CCC is urging him to ring-fence the money and invest it temporarily on other insulation projects, deemed to be doing well.\nMr Stark said: \"There's no escaping the fact that the UK won't hit its legally binding climate change targets unless buildings are much better insulated and low-carbon heat systems are installed.\"\nHe added that \"an attractive and efficient programme for insulating homes and promoting low-carbon heating\" was needed.\nThe CCC says the government needs to spend at least \u00a32bn a year through to 2030 for badly insulated homes, with extra cash for developing low-carbon heating.\nThe total allocated budget for home decarbonisation is around \u00a33bn a year currently, but the CCC estimates a further \u00a33bn a year is required.\nSo what is gone wrong with the grant scheme? \nThe Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy blames the coronavirus pandemic, which it says has made many reluctant to welcome tradespeople into their homes. \nCritics say that is wrong - and that many insulation contractors have gone out of business following stop-start government incentive schemes. \nQuestions are also being asked about ICF, the US-based consultancy that won the contract to administer the scheme. \nI understand the government is bound by a contract to continue with the company. \nBut a group of trades unions has written to the chancellor complaining of what it calls damage from outsourcing.\nIts letter says: \"The obvious answer to administrative problems is to strengthen the Green Homes Grants scheme by bringing it under public sector management and using the experience and knowledge of local authorities. \n\"Instead, the rug is apparently to be pulled from under the scheme. This backtracking would call into question whether this government has any real commitment to a green recovery.\"\nGovernment sources say the Treasury imposed strict conditions on administrators because it was stung by malpractice in the Northern Ireland \"cash-for-ash\" scandal. \nA government spokeswoman said around 76,000 grant applications had been made, and more than 26,000 vouchers had been issued.\nCritics say this does not include the thousands of people who could not find a contractor. \nThe government spokeswoman said there were 938 registered installer companies registered. \nBut, out of 7,400 members of the Master Builders' Federation, only three had been accredited.\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"

      "text": "With children in England back in the classroom, teachers face the massive task of making up for months of missed learning.\nA \u00a3720m package has been announced to help pupils in England catch up - although teachers' unions say more is needed. \nHere are some of the measures which could be used to help pupils.\nThe government has asked schools to consider offering face-to-face learning over the summer holidays this year.\nIt is to provide \u00a3200m to secondary schools to fund summer classes for pupils who need it most, especially those children moving up to Year 7.\nSummer schools with qualified teachers leading small groups can help children make up to four months of academic progress, according to the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF). \nThey need a strong academic element, chief executive Becky Francis says, although sporting and other fun activities can also contribute to children's emotional wellbeing.\nShe adds: \"Staffing summer schools will be a challenge because of burnout among teachers.\"\nThe government's education catch-up tsar, Sir Kevan Collins, has said that the idea of summer schools has \"promise\".\nAnd Welsh Education Minister Kirsty Williams said she was \"willing to discuss all possibilities\" for keeping schools open over the summer. \nHowever, evidence suggests that disadvantaged pupils, who would benefit the most, are less likely to take up the offer.\nTwo summer school trials run by the EEF saw less than 50% attendance among students in the target group.\nOne-to-one tuition is seen as a proven method of helping children catch up. \nWeekly sessions could help a student make three to six months of academic progress, with particularly large gains in literacy and numeracy among primary-school pupils, according to four recent UK studies.\nThe government is pledging money to an expanded National Tutoring Programme (NTP) for primary and secondary pupils, and an extended tuition fund for 16 to 19-year-olds. \nMore than 100,000 disadvantaged pupils have accessed the service since it began, in November.\nBut the NTP has largely offered online tuition since January, and many of the tutors are university students. \nProf Lee Elliott Major, from the University of Exeter, who first proposed the scheme, early last year, says: \"The evidence is thin about tutoring done online not by professionals.\n\"So the exact impact of the NTP is unclear at the moment.\"\nThe practice of retaking a whole year is common in some countries, such as Germany and the US, but rare in the UK.\nThe Education Policy Institute (EPI) think tank has suggested it could help pupils whose education has fallen behind.\nBut the Association of School and College Leaders says the idea would be practical for a small number of students only.\nLarge-scale repetition would create \"a log-jam in the system\" and have huge knock-on effects on funding for universities.\nThe EEF estimates it would cost \u00a36,000 per pupil per year in England.\nAnd pupils who repeat a year make an average of four months' less academic progress than those at a similar level who continue on to the next school year, research suggests.\nDisadvantaged pupils can benefit from longer school days, US research suggests.\nAnd Robert Halfon, who chairs the Education Select Committee, told BBC News he had suggested the idea as \"a serious solution for the government to consider\" in England. \nThe extra teaching time could be provided by \"civil society instead of teachers\", he says. \nAfter-school clubs cost about \u00a37 a session, the EEF estimates.\nBut adding two extra weeks of school time a year would cost \u00a3260 per primary pupil and \u00a3360 per secondary pupil. \nThere have been calls for extra funding for mental health support for schoolchildren, to help ease their return to the classroom and improve their chances of catching up.\nTeaching staff trained to improve emotional wellbeing can help pupils make substantial attainment progress, EEF research suggests.\nAnd the EPI has proposed \u00a3650m of extra funding for additional school staff and in-school counselling programmes in England.\n\"Remedial wellbeing work will be necessary to achieve [academic] catch-up,\" it says, particularly for disadvantaged pupils."

      "tags": "Companies,Stock markets,Reddit,GameStop",
      "text": "Shares in GameStop surged on Wednesday in what could mark a return to frenzied trading that rocked markets last month.\nTrading in the US games firm was halted twice after shares more than doubled suddenly on Wednesday afternoon.\nGameStop stock climbed by 104% until trading was halted for a second time - moments before markets closed.\nThe rapid rise came as Reddit, the online home of activist investors that led the GameStop movement in January, went down temporarily.\nThe stock gained nearly 90% in after-hours trading.\nIt came one day after the firm announced its chief financial officer Jim Bell would resign next month to help \"accelerate GameStop's transformation\".\nSome investors have talked publicly and posted on social media site Reddit about not selling their shares in GameStop during last month's volatile trading because of what they see as its long-term potential.\nOn Wednesday, Reddit was down for many users. The company did not say what caused the outage but said it had identified the issue, fixed it and that \"systems are beginning to recover.\"\nIt is the latest twist in a battle that has pitted amateur investors against Wall Street giants.\nMajor hedge funds had bet billions of dollars that GameStop's shares would fall.\nBut they have faced major losses after amateurs, swapping tips on social media sites like Reddit, drove up the share price by more than 700% in one week.\nThe retail trading frenzy drew concern from regulators and has even led to a Congressional hearing in the US.\nKeith Gill, who became a key player in the trading and is known as 'Roaring Kitty' on YouTube, has also been hit with a class action lawsuit. He allegedly duped retail investors into buying inflated stocks while hiding his sophisticated financial background.\nMr Gill has downplayed his impact and rebutted claims he violated any laws.\n\"The idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors is preposterous,\" Mr Gill said in the prepared testimony.\n\"I was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only, and that my aggressive style of investing was unlikely to be suitable for most folks checking out the channel.\"\nThe GameStop saga was hailed as a victory of the little guys against big Wall Street hedge funds that were betting against video games retailer GameStop and other struggling businesses.\nBut it is unclear what role hedge funds had in the rally, as some are reported to have made millions from the GameStop share rally that was inspired by Reddit users.\nThe key part of the theory of why GameStop shares went up so high in January was a 'short squeeze'. \nThis is when hedge funds, who'd bet GameStop shares would fall, tried to buy them back when the share price began to rise. \nThat in turn pushed the price even higher. Some hedge funds lost hundreds of millions of pounds.\nThe prevailing view was that hedge funds wouldn't put themselves into that position again. That they would be all over Reddit and more careful about 'shorting'.  Therefore, you wouldn't see a giant spike in the share price again. \nBut evidently, that view was wrong. That the share price, in just a few hours, could explode again tests some of the assumptions about what happened last month. \nIt's often very difficult to understand exactly what drives a share price, and who is driving it. \nBut it does once again appear that the hype on WallStreetBets, the influential subreddit, was part of the rise. \nReddit even went down at one point, though it's not clear yet whether that was because of an increase in activity on the site. \nPolicy makers will be looking on closely. At a hearing last week in Washington, many politicians were concerned that 'meme stocks' could spike again. \nThat can be beneficial to some investors when the stock is rising. But on the way down amateur investors can get burnt too. \nIf these kinds of spikes become more common, expect more pressure on legislators to step in. "

      "text": "The popular 1990s US TV shows Frasier and Rugrats are both set to be rebooted for the new Paramount+ platform.\nFrasier starred Kelsey Grammer as a pedantic psychiatrist with his own radio show.\nRugrats will go from being a cartoon to a CG animation, featuring the voices of most of the original cast.\nGrammer confirmed his show's revival saying: \"I gleefully anticipate sharing the next chapter in the continuing journey of Dr Frasier Crane.\"\nThere has been no confirmation if other members of the original cast will also return.\nThe news was announced by ViacomCBS on Wednesday as it prepares to launch the platform, which follows in the footsteps of the likes of Disney+, in the US next month.\nThere is as yet no date for a UK release for the new streaming service, although popular shows could be bought up and sold on outside the US.\nFrasier remains one of the US's most successful TV sitcoms.\nIt ran for 11 seasons - between 1993 and 2004 - and won 37 Emmy Awards, including five for best comedy series.\n\"There has long been a call from fans for its return, and that call is now answered,\" David Stapf, president of CBS Studios, said.\nNo date has been given for when audiences might expect to be able to watch it.\nDr Frasier Crane first appeared in another hit TV show, Cheers, and the spin-off series charted his return to his hometown of Seattle to care for his cranky father, played by John Mahoney who died in 2018.\nThe show also followed Frasier's relationships with his brother Niles, played by David Hyde Pierce, English housekeeper Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves), and Frasier's producer Roz Doyle, played by Peri Gilpin. \nIn January, it was announced that another hit show from the 1990s, Sex and the City, would also be returning.\nMeanwhile, the Nickelodeon children's cartoon Rugrats will be re-animated, quite literally, for the new platform.\nThe show, which ran for nine seasons, focuses on the lives of a group of toddlers. It spawned a 1998 movie, and a sequel two years later that saw the American babies head to Paris.\nThe TV series bagged four Daytime Emmy Awards and six Kids' Choice Awards during a 13-year run; and even has its own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. \nThe original characters, Tommy, Chuckie - voiced by Bart Simpson star Nancy Cartwright after Christine Cavanaugh retired in 2002 - Angelica, Susie and twins Phil and Lil will appear in the updated style later this year.\n\"Rugrats is one of the most iconic cartoons recognised by fans around the globe, and this original version is one we are taking great care and pride in creating for a brand new audience,\" said Ramsey Naito, president of Nickelodeon Animation.\nTV critic and Must Watch podcaster Scott Bryan thinks the new animated Rugrats are \"quite scary\" to be honest.\nHowever he told the BBC he understands why the new platform, which incorporates the pre-existing site CBS Access, would use such nostalgia as a jumping off point.\n\"I would say that we're having two different types of streaming wars at the moment,\" he said.\n\"There's the streaming war with new content - spending hundreds and hundreds of millions of pounds for the new shows to get people to subscribe to your service. But at the same time, there's a streaming bidding war for all of these shows that are amazingly successful because people now re-watch them time and time again, or get into them for the very first time.\"\nHe added: \"So, what has happened now is that in the US, particularly, massive amounts of money have been paid for the entire rights of, let's say Friends or Sex in the City and now Frasier, to be on their existing streaming services because they know that they will get subscribers to them.\n\"The reason why so many of these shows have been rebooted is that it's a way to get a lot of publicity because the shows are adored, but also get people to subscribe to your streaming service because it's easier, it's much more likely with an existing audience to get subscribers than it is to get a new show that might flop even if it's got big talent attached. \n\"So is it like a advertisement essentially, for what you already have, with the new episodes to provide something new.\"\nTim Glanfield, editorial director RadioTimes.com stressed there have been remakes and reboots \"for almost as long as there has been TV\", and with good cause.\n\"The reason is simple - great television is about creating characters that resonate with audiences and creating universes that viewers want to spend time within,\" he said.\nHe added that when a much-loved TV show ends, it is often \"hugely missed\".\n\"The characters are missed, the world it occupied is mourned for, a little gap is left in people's lives, and audiences often ask, 'why couldn't they have made more?'\n\"And what better way to get people talking about your new streaming service than by leaning into screen nostalgia and announcing you're bringing back a beloved TV show or spinning off a much-loved franchise for the small screen - be that the Mandalorian on Disney+, Sex and the City on HBO Max or Frasier on Paramount+.\"\n\"Such announcements are followed by many curious fans of the original, and potential subscribers to your service.\"\nViacomCBS said live-action versions of other children's TV favourites Dora The Explorer and The Fairly OddParents were also on the way.\nWhile plans are also in place for a string of new TV series for adults based on films like The Italian Job, Fatal Attraction and Flashdance.\nElsewhere, a host of classic MTV and VH1 shows - including the franchises Unplugged, Behind the Music, and Yo! MTV Raps - will be resurrected too.\n\"We are thrilled to re-invent some of our most storied and impactful music franchises,\" said Viacom music president, Bruce Gilmer.\n\"In addition, we will partner with some of the biggest names across the music industry to bring exclusive and unique content to the platform, such as Dave Grohl's Cradle to Stage based on his mom's critically-acclaimed book, and many more to come.\"\nDetails of a Yellowstone prequel, Y:1883, as well as a spin-off, called 6666, were also included in the announcement, along with the return of Inside Amy Schumer, with five specials starring the stand-up comedian, actor and director.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has set out Scotland's \"cautious\" route out of lockdown and her approach over the next few months will be guided by six tests, including evidence that the epidemic in Scotland is controlled.\nUsing a system outlined by the World Health Organization (WHO), what can we tell about the state of Scotland's Covid-19 epidemic?\nWhen it comes to judging the level of Covid-19 transmission within a community, the WHO uses a seven tier scale ranging from \"no active cases\", all the way up to a \"very high incidence of locally-acquired cases\" that are also \"widely dispersed\".\nThe Scottish government has previously indicated it wants to get a \"moderate\" level of community transmission before significantly relaxing any restrictions.\nSo how far away is Scotland from this goal?\nThe WHO advises governments to look at their weekly confirmed cases per 100,000 people and then average the figure out over a 14-day period.\nBy this measure, Scotland had a rate of 105 cases per 100,000 on 24 February.\nThis puts the country firmly in the middle of the WHO's CT3 level - a high incidence of community transmission - and well above the \"moderate\" threshold.\nThere's been a sustained fall in this figure since the middle of January, but the decline does now appear to be slowing.\nThe last time Scotland was below 50 cases per 100,000 was at the beginning of October.\nIt's difficult to compare this rate with the first outbreak in the spring as there was no mass testing earlier in the pandemic.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe 14-day average on 24 February was 5.2% - still in the \"high incidence\" category, but only just above the 5% threshold for \"moderate\" incidence.\nIt's worth pointing out that WHO's preferred way of measuring positivity is through \"sentinel surveillance\", or random community testing, which is not how the Scottish government measures it.\nHowever, the organisation lists overall test positivity as an additional measure if a comprehensive testing system is in place.\nThe WHO says governments should look at the number of weekly deaths \"attributed\" to Covid-19 per 100,000 people and average them out over 14 days.\nAccording to this measure, Scotland experienced \"very high\" levels of community transmission from 15 January.\nThe rate reached a peak on 3 February and has now gone below the threshold that indicates a \"high\" incidence of transmission.\nA death rate of two per 100,000 people or less needs to be achieved to indicate \"moderate\" levels.\nThis chart counts deaths in Scotland within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19. If the wider definition of all death certificates mentioning the virus were used, the rate would be slightly higher.\nThe full lockdown in the spring ended on 28 May, although the easing of restrictions was phased over several weeks during the summer.\nFigures on Covid-19 hospital admissions are currently available up to 18 February, when the 14-day average of weekly admissions was 11.4.\nThis figure has more than halved over the last month.\nThe rate is still in the WHO's \"high\" level, but it's close to the threshold of 10 cases per 100,00, indicating a \"moderate\" level of transmission.\nThe WHO use a risk uses something called a \"risk matrix\" which factors in both the state of an epidemic in a country and the local capacity to respond to the outbreak.\nSo for instance, if Covid transmission is at a moderate level, but there is very limited testing or hospital capacity, then the risk may still be high.\nAt the highest level, the WHO considers the epidemic \"uncontrolled\", with an overwhelmed healthcare system and deaths spiralling.\nIf Scotland's response can currently be judged as \"adequate\" that would put the country in roughly the middle of the risk scale. \nThis is where the organisation recommends that schools and businesses can open up, with limits remaining on social and mass gatherings and home working still encouraged.\nBut given the recent high case and death rates, it's likely Scotland was closer to the top end of the risk scale in January and early February.\nWith signs that the decline in cases is now slowing, this may have helped persuade the first minister to choose a slow and cautious route out of lockdown.\nSo far, 1,515,980 people in Scotland have received their first dose of either the Pfizer or Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, which is about a third of the population aged 16 and over.\nAnd the good news is there are early signs that even just receiving the first dose has a significant impact on preventing serious illness.\nMs Sturgeon says the aim is to have everyone in this group offered a first dose of the vaccine by the end of July.\nBut crucially good progress is also being made vaccinating the highest risk groups in Scotland - those who are most likely to become seriously ill or die with Covid-19.\nThe priority groups were set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\nThe virus was suppressed to low levels in the summer entirely through public health and social restrictions because there was no vaccine.\nThis time the vaccine could be a useful tool if the Scottish government does want to take more risks and begin to open the country up faster.\nBut for now there's every sign the government will stay on its \"deliberately cautious\" path, allowing the level of risk to drop to the lower end of the WHO's scale."

      "text": "US regulators have found the single-shot Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine is safe and effective.\nIt paves the way for it to become the third Covid-19 vaccine to be authorised in the US, possibly within days.\nThe vaccine would be a cost-effective alternative to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and can be stored in a refrigerator instead of a freezer.\nTrials found it prevented serious illness but was 66% effective overall when moderate cases were included.\nThe company has agreed to provide the US with 100 million doses by the end of June. The UK, EU and Canada have also ordered doses and 500 million doses have also been ordered through the Covax scheme to supply poorer nations.\nThe briefing document published by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gives more detail on the data submitted by Janssen, a pharmaceutical branch of Johnson & Johnson, to the regulator. The FDA concludes that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has \"known benefits\" in reducing both symptomatic and severe illness.\nIt comes after the firm released data last month.\nResults from trials conducted in the US, South Africa and Brazil found its efficacy against the worst outcomes of the virus was \"similarly high\" but overall protection was lower in South Africa and Brazil, where virus variants have become dominant.\nData showed it was more than 85% effective at preventing serious illness, but only 66% effective overall when moderate cases were included, when considering cases at least 28 days after vaccination.\nNotably, there were no deaths among participants who had received the vaccine and no hospital admissions after 28 days post-vaccine.\nAn external committee of experts will meet on Friday to recommend whether the FDA should authorise the vaccine, possibly adding to a coming surge in vaccine availability in the US. The US would be the first country in the world to approve the vaccine.\nA White House official said the administration anticipated distributing at least three million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine next week, should it receive emergency authorisation from the FDA.\nThe company says it plans to deliver 20 million doses in total by late March, in line with an agreement to supply the US with 100m doses by the end of June.\nNot only will the vaccine require fewer doses than its two-shot Pfizer and Moderna counterparts, it will also require fewer vaccine appointments and medical staff as a result.\nOver 65 million Americans have already been vaccinated and about 1.3 million doses are being administered across the country each day.  \nHalf a million people in the US have died of Covid but new cases, hospitalisations and deaths have all been on the decline over the past few weeks.\nTop public health experts, however, continue to warn that mutations of the virus can still threaten progress."

      "tags": "Teaching,Schools,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus testing,Gavin Williamson,Exams,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "GCSEs and A-levels cancelled in England by the pandemic will be replaced by grades decided by teachers, the exams watchdog Ofqual has confirmed.\nSchools can determine grades this summer by using a combination of mock exams, coursework and essays.\nThere will be optional assessments set by exam boards for all subjects, but they will not be taken in exam conditions nor decide final grades.\nResults will be published earlier in August to allow time to appeal.\nSchools minister Nick Gibb said the government had devised \"the best system possible to ensure there is consistency and fairness in how teachers submit grades for their students\".\nAsked whether he accepted grades would be inflated this year, he told BBC Breakfast the government had put in place \"different checking mechanisms\" to ensure there was \"consistency\". \nHe added ministers had devised the \"best system possible\" to ensure \"fairly awarded grades at a time when we don't think it's fair for [students] to sit the exams in the normal way.\"  \nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted on Thursday that \"no child should be left behind as a result of learning lost during the pandemic\", which was why government had devised a \"fair and flexible system\" that would ensure all young people \"can progress to the next stage of their education or career\".\nThe new arrangements, which will be set out by Education Secretary Gavin Williamson in the House of Commons later, come after a consultation into how best to assess pupils after months of school and college closures.\nLast summer, thousands of A-level students had their results downgraded from school estimates by a controversial algorithm, before Ofqual announced a U-turn which allowed them to use teachers' predictions instead.\nThere will be no fixed share of grades and schools will not be expected to keep in line with last year's results or any earlier year.\nBut the Education Policy Institute think tank has warned the plans for this year risk \"extremely high grade inflation\".\nScotland,Wales and Northern Ireland have already announced that exams will be replaced by teacher-assessed grades.\nAfter last year's chaos, the exams watchdog Ofqual and the Department for Education say there will be no algorithm calculating results.\nInstead, the grading system will be built around teachers' judgements - with schools allowed to decide on the evidence to be used, such as mock exams, coursework and essays.\nIf students are unhappy at the outcome of what their school and teachers have decided, they can appeal, with no financial charge expected.\nFor those still wanting to take written papers, there will be an option of exams in the autumn.\nA-level results day will be 10 August, with GCSEs results given out on 12 August.\nThey are earlier this year to create a \"buffer\" for appeals, ahead of decisions over university places in the autumn.\nStudents awaiting the result of an appeal before being granted a university place will be prioritised under this year's system, Mr Gibb said on Thursday.\nBefore the end of the school year, teachers can tell pupils how they got on in the test papers set by exam boards - but not their final grades.\nThere will be test papers set by exam boards for each subject, which are intended to inform the judgement of teachers, but will not decide the final grades.\nThese have been labelled \"mini-exams\", but Ofqual says the tests, which will be optional for schools to use, should not be seen as exams.\nQuestion papers, which could be from previous exams, will be sent to schools before the Easter holidays and can be taken before 18 June, when schools have to submit grades to exam boards.\nThe intention is that regardless of how much time pupils might have missed out of school, they will have questions on a topic they will have studied.\nThese tests will be taken in class rather than exam halls, there is no fixed time limit for their duration and they will be marked by teachers.\nThere will be no fixed share of grades - and schools will not be expected to keep in line with last year's results or any earlier year.\nInstead teachers will be expected to award grades based on their professional judgement, drawing on whatever evidence is available.\nSchools will be given detailed information about grading and will be expected to ensure consistency between teachers. \nExam boards will check random samples and if there are specific concerns about unusual results, they can investigate and change grades.\nTeachers' grades will be used to replace written vocational exams, in the same way as GCSEs and A-levels.\nBut where there are practical, hands-on skills to be tested, such as for a professional qualification, some of these exams will continue in a Covid-safe way.\nThe results of some vocational qualifications will be released in the week of 9 August.\nCaitlyn in Wigan, aged 15, is taking nine GCSEs and has been studying at home where it's hard to concentrate and the wi-fi keeps crashing. She is glad she won't have to sit exams.\n\"You feel relief because there's not so much pressure,\" she says, especially when they had missed so much time in school.\n\"It's not the same as face-to face interactions with teachers,\" she says.\nThe mock exams she sat in November she found particularly hard. \"You had that fear of going into a hall with 200 people around you.\n\"It was really stressful as obviously, we'd been online learning so then you had to quickly cram everything in which made quite a few people drained.\"\nKori from Blackburn, aged 16, is taking five GCSES.\nHe says learning from home was \"in a way better for me, so I could concentrate and there was no-one to distract me\". Although he did miss the support of teachers when he got stuck.\nKori feels the assessments, the so-called \"mini exams\", that will be offered \"are going to be better for me\".\nAlthough he worries all the pupils this year might be judged unfairly because they didn't sit the full exams.\nThe Education Policy Institute warned of a \"high risk of inconsistencies\" between schools - and if there are large numbers of successful appeals or widespread grade inflation it could be difficult for universities and employers to distinguish between applicants.\nBut the ASCL head teachers' union supported giving schools \"flexibility over the assessments they use\". While the National Education Union said it was probably the \"least worst option available\".\nParenting charity Parentkind said \"teacher assessment is, under the circumstances, the fairest way to test pupils\".\nLabour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said delays to deciding a replacement for exams had \"created needless stress for pupils, parents and teachers\".\nAre you a teacher or a student?

      "tags": "Turkey,Mohammed bin Salman,Saudi Arabia,United States,Killing of Jamal Khashoggi,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The US is set to release a report of an investigation into the gruesome murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi which is widely expected to implicate the kingdom's powerful crown prince.\nPresident Joe Biden has read the report and is due to speak to the Saudi king.\nMr Biden wants to \"recalibrate\" ties with the US ally, which became closer under President Donald Trump.\nKhashoggi's body was dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. The prince denies involvement.\nThe journalist, known for his criticism of Saudi authorities, went to the consulate in October 2018 in order to obtain papers allowing him to get married.\nSaudi authorities say his death and dismemberment was the result of a \"rogue operation\" by a team of agents sent to return him to the kingdom.\nFive individuals were given death sentences for the murder by a Saudi court but these were commuted to 20 years in prison last September.\nThe report, which is expected to be released later on Thursday, will say that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved \"and likely ordered\" Khashoggi's killing, four US officials told Reuters news agency.\nThey said the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) - the US overseas spy agency - was the main contributor to the report.\nThe Saudi public prosecution and Prince Mohammed insist he did not have any knowledge of the murder but in 2019 he said he took \"full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government\".\nNBC News reports that the intelligence assessment is not new and is based on work by the CIA which was widely reported back in 2018.\nAccording to that reported assessment, there was no \"smoking gun\" but US officials thought such an operation would have required the prince's approval.\nThe Washington Post, which Khashoggi worked for, said at the time that the CIA assessment had been based partly on a phone call made by the crown prince's brother, Prince Khalid bin Salman, who was the then Saudi ambassador to the US.\nPrince Khalid, who is now deputy defence minister, allegedly called Khashoggi at the direction of his brother and gave him assurances that he would be safe to go to the consulate in Istanbul. Prince Khalid has denied any communication with the journalist.\nIn 2019, UN special rapporteur Agnes Callamard accused the Saudi state of the \"deliberate, premeditated execution\" of Khashoggi and dismissed the Saudi trial as an \"antithesis of justice\". \nThe publication of the report is part of Joe Biden's policy to realign ties with long-term ally Saudi Arabia and take a much tougher stance than his predecessor Mr Trump on certain Saudi positions.\nThe Trump administration had previously rejected a legal requirement to release a declassified version of the report, focusing instead on improved co-operation with the Saudis.\nWhite House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Wednesday that Mr Biden would communicate with King Salman, and not directly with the crown prince, who is his son and is considered the de facto ruler in Saudi Arabia. \nShe said the president was due to speak to the 85-year-old king for the first time since taking office  \"soon\", without giving a specific time for the call.\n\"We've made clear from the beginning that we are going to recalibrate our relationship with Saudi Arabia,\" she told reporters.\nThe new administration has already made some major policy changes in that regard, with President Biden ending US support for offensive operations by the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen, and freezing arms sales to the kingdom.\nBy Alistair Coleman, BBC Monitoring\nThere has been what looks like a concerted online effort ahead of the US report to bury it under Twitter posts supporting the Saudi government.\nWhile some posts, largely from exiled Saudis, look forward to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) being named in the US report, others seem to be trying to deflect blame away from him.\nSeveral hashtags relating to Jamal Khashoggi trended on Twitter using various spellings of his name, such as \"khasxoggi\", \"Jamal\" and \"shooggi\". It's been suggested that this is an attempt to dilute the trend and limit criticism of MBS.\nThese tags accompany tweets deflecting attention away from the report by questioning America's own human rights record. Some mention the deaths of people of colour at the hands of police, and others in Abu Ghraib prison following the Iraq war. \nBut it is hard to tell if there is any official campaign to bury the news on social media. This is largely because Saudi-based Twitter users are intensely patriotic, seeing any criticism of MBS as a slight on their nation, and will engage with any issue they see as attacking the kingdom. \nTwitter is huge in Saudi Arabia, with around 20 million users, so any potential campaign would be aimed domestically at first - but the English messages could also be used to drown out global coverage.\nThe 59-year-old journalist was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October 2018 to obtain papers that would allow him to marry his Turkish fianc\u00e9e. \nAccording to the Saudi public prosecution, Khashoggi was forcibly restrained after a struggle and injected with a large amount of a drug, resulting in an overdose that led to his death. His body was then dismembered and handed over to a local \"collaborator\" outside the consulate, the prosecution said. The remains were never found.\nGrim details were revealed in transcripts of purported audio recordings of the killing obtained by Turkish intelligence.\nKhashoggi was once an adviser to the Saudi government and close to the royal family, but fell out of favour and went into self-imposed exile in the US in 2017.\nFrom there, he wrote a monthly column in the Washington Post in which he criticised the policies of Prince Mohammed.\nIn his first column for the newspaper, Khashoggi said he feared being arrested in an apparent crackdown on dissent overseen by the prince.\nIn his last column, he criticised Saudi involvement in the Yemen conflict."

      "tags": "Economic inequality,Social inequality,Coronavirus vaccines,Birmingham,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Alum Rock is an inner city suburb of Birmingham. It is deprived and ethnically diverse, with a large Pakistani community.\nThe area has seen high rates of infection and yet it has among the lowest number of people coming forward for vaccination. Just six in 10 of those aged over 80 have had the jab.\nA few miles to the north is Sutton Four Oaks, an affluent area with detached houses and tree-lined streets. Infection rates have been three times lower in recent weeks, but close to 95% of over-80s have been vaccinated.\nLocal MP Liam Byrne spoke about the problem in the House of Commons this week. It is, he told MPs, \"a story of two nations - rich and poor\".\nThis is not unique to Birmingham. It is a pattern that is being repeated across the country. The people who are most at risk from the virus are the ones, it seems, who are least likely to come forward for vaccination.\nDetailed data on uptake down to a community level is not being published by the government to the frustration of many - the figures for Birmingham were published by the council. But what information is available suggests the poorest and most ethnically diverse communities (there is a huge overlap between the two) are seeing the lowest levels of uptake.\nSir Sam Everington, who is a GP in the east London borough of Tower Hamlets, one of the poorest areas in the city, says he has seen this pattern emerging, which he describes as \"enormously worrying\".\nHe believes the vaccination programme needs to be taken out into local communities more, instead of relying on mass vaccination centres and large community hubs.\nHe would like to see local GPs, nurses and the community working hand-in-hand, taking the vaccine out into community settings.\nIt is, to be fair, something that has already been recognised by the government. It has provided \u00a323 million of funding under the Covid Champions Fund, to help councils address some of the problems.\nCouncils like Birmingham are using it to work with community leaders, training them to speak informatively and confidently about the benefit of vaccination. Some areas are setting up pop-up clinics in neighbourhoods where uptake is low. They have been run in mosques, churches and community halls.\nBut there is a barrage of misinformation out there, with videos and information circulating on the internet and social media claiming the vaccines cause fertility problems, contain animal products and even alter a person's DNA.\nThe Center for Countering Digital Hate estimates that the biggest English-language anti-vaxxers social media accounts enjoy a global following of 59 million, with the top 147 accounts increasing their reach by nearly a fifth in the last year.\nThese myths need busting. But Dr Farzana Hussain, of the NHS Confederation, which represents GPs in charge of the vaccination programme, says it is also important to recognise people have legitimate \"questions and fears\" too that they want addressing. \"It is not always resistance. It's been rolled out very quickly - [they ask] how can it be safe?\"\nBut this is not just about vaccination. It has been well-documented that those in more deprived and ethnically diverse communities have been at greater risk from the virus. Work by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows that those living in the most deprived neighbourhoods have been more than twice as likely to die from Covid as those in the least deprived - the reasons for this are complex, ranging from greater exposure to higher levels of poor health.\nAnd that is likely to continue. Infection rates are still circulating at higher levels in the poorest neighbourhoods. React, one of the government's surveillance programmes, showed that when the second wave peaked in January, infection rates were 50% higher in the most deprived areas than in the least deprived. Ethnic minority groups were twice as likely to be infected than their white peers.\nDr Sakthi Karunanithi, director of public health in Lancashire, believes this combination of lower vaccine uptake and higher infection levels could further \"entrench inequalities\" for years to come, with the virus clustering in the most deprived neighbourhoods.\nHe wants the government to \"progressively advantage\" such communities when it comes to the response to Covid. He says this could include everything from prioritisation in vaccination rollout, to better financial support to self-isolate, pointing out they work in higher risk professions where they have more frequent contacts, and are less able to work from home.\nWithout this, Dr Karunanithi is concerned that deprived areas face the prospect of cases rising when lockdown lifts or having tougher restrictions for longer, further disadvantaging communities.\nAnalysis by the Health Foundation has shown that even before the pandemic, people in the poorest tenth of the country were three times more likely to die prematurely than some in the richest tenth. The pattern emerging with Covid, the think-tank warned, was likely to increase that gap even further.\nThis is a \"real risk\", says Prof Jackie Cassell, a public health expert at the University of Brighton. \"The government is talking about the civic duty of people to do their bit, but that is harder for some than others.\"\nShe says there are so many complex factors at play. \"If you haven't got a car or you are in ill health, it may not be easy to get to a vaccination centre. We can't assume it is because people do not want to be vaccinated - it may be about access. \n\"And if you live in crowded housing, are on a zero-hours contract or have to provide care to an elderly relative, isolating when you have symptoms is not easy. If we don't find a way to address these challenges, it will be devastating for the most deprived. They will be left behind.\"\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

I wasn't even looking, but the [moped] slowed down and the man on the back grabbed my bum before zooming off into the distance.\" \nShe added: \"If I'd gone to the right-hand-side, I hate to think - they might have pushed me into the canal.\"\nMs McDonald's tweet highlighting the incident prompted other women to share stories of harassment and assault while out running.\n\"I normally don't speak out about these things, but on this occasion I had to make an exception and have been overwhelmed by the response,\" she said. \nA number of Welsh female sprinters have recently reported being verbally abused by strangers as they trained in public rather than at athletics tracks during Covid restrictions.\n[Until the incident] I'd have felt comfortable being on my own,\" said Ms McDonald who added: \"This has been a wake-up call - be vigilant and look after each other.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

But industry experts say the economics don't make sense as the batteries are heavy and hard to transport as they are not currently permitted through the Channel Tunnel for safety reasons. \nDoubts about the long-term future of the factory intensified after recent comments from the chief executive of the parent company Stellantis - the new name for the merged PSA and Fiat Chrysler.\nCarlos Tavares referred to the \"brutal\" decision for the UK government to bring forward the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars to 2030 and said it might make more sense to move future electric production closer to its biggest market in the EU. \nGovernment officials are aware that the future of car production in the UK depends on a rapid scaling up of battery production and it is widely hoped Chancellor Rishi Sunak will address the issue in his Budget speech next Wednesday, which is coincidentally the same day that Stellantis announce their annual results and operating review."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK's coronavirus alert level has been lowered from level five to four in all four nations as the risk that the NHS could be overwhelmed \"has receded\".\nThe four UK chief medical officers and NHS England's national medical director agreed the change following advice from the Joint Biosecurity Centre.\nThe alert level had moved to level five on 4 January, shortly before England and Scotland began fresh lockdowns.\nThe top medics urged people to \"remain vigilant\" by following lockdown rules.\nA change in the alert level does not automatically mean restrictions can ease, but it helps to inform government decisions on the rules.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon have this week set out their separate plans to lift lockdown restrictions. Northern Ireland and Wales will outline their plans in the coming weeks.\nEngland's Prof Chris Whitty, Northern Ireland's Dr Michael McBride, Scotland's Dr Gregor Smith, Wales's Dr Frank Atherton and NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said their decision to reduce the alert level was made because the number of cases in hospital was \"consistently declining\".\nHowever, they warned: \"We should be under no illusions - transmission rates, hospital pressures and deaths are still very high.\"\nThey said the vaccine rollout would eventually have \"a major impact\" but for the time being \"it is really important that we all - vaccinated or not - remain vigilant and continue to follow the guidelines\".\nProf Whitty added in a tweet: \"If we continue to follow the guidance, cases will continue to fall.\"\nA further 9,985 new coronavirus cases were reported in the UK in Thursday's daily figures, as well as 323 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test.\nThe coronavirus alert level, unveiled by the UK government in May 2020, is measured by a five-level, colour-coded system.\nLevel five (red), the highest level, is when there is a \"material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed\" within 21 days, and extremely strict social distancing is enforced.\nLevel four indicates a high or rising level of transmission, with social distancing still enforced.\nThe UK's alert level dropped down to level three in June 2020. During the summer, restrictions were gradually relaxed to allow people to socialise in groups indoors, and much of society reopened, including pubs and restaurants.\nHowever, the alert level was moved back up to level four in September as case numbers began to climb again. The same month a new, fast-spreading variant of the virus was detected in Kent. \nAs cases spiralled across the UK, the country moved to the highest level, level five, on 4 January.\nThe move to alert level five was made because the chief medical officers were worried the NHS was at risk of being overwhelmed.  \nIt was an announcement that essentially forced England's third national lockdown. \nBut since the number of cases peaked at over 39,000 in mid-January, cases have fallen rapidly. \nIn fact, the numbers of new admissions coming in each day are not far off what you would normally get for respiratory illnesses in winter.  \nBut while the immediate threat is over, hospitals are still incredibly busy. There are over 16,000 patients with Covid in hospital - that's only around 25% lower than the total in the peak of the first wave.  \nOperating theatres continue to be used as temporary critical care areas and non-urgent care is being cancelled in some places. \nBut with infection levels still coming down, we know this will ease further, hence the move to level four. \nThe Joint Biosecurity Centre, set up by the government in spring last year, has the task of recommending what the alert level should be, based on:\nThe centre's scientists identify changes in infection rates using testing, environmental and workplace data.\nNHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said despite the UK's alert level dropping, there was a \"long way to go yet\" and that no-one from the health service was \"anywhere near declaring this phase of battle won\".\nMeanwhile, new NHS England figures suggest one in five adults in England under the age of 70 have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. \nAn estimated 20.3% of people between the ages of 16 and 69 had been given their first jab as of 21 February, the figures say.\nHowever, the figures highlight some regional variations, with at least one in four over-70s yet to receive their first dose in several parts of London.\nMore than 18 million people have had a first vaccine dose - equivalent to one in three adults in the UK.\nThe vaccine rollout has entered its next phase, after everyone in the top four priority groups was offered a jab.\nMany areas are now offering vaccine appointments to over-60s, adult carers of disabled people and younger adults in care homes."

I'm so happy for all those people who have been living in fear,\" Jo Whiley said, adding that it was \"very difficult\" to categorise people according to their disability.\nThe charity Mencap said everyone with a learning disability should check they are on the register and, if not, ask to go on it.\nPeople with a \"severe or profound\" learning disability in England and Wales were already in priority group six for the coronavirus vaccine, along with unpaid carers for those with disabilities and the elderly.\nAnd adults with Down's Syndrome have already been offered a jab, in priority group 4, as part of the UK's target to vaccinate 15 million people by mid-February.\nNow everyone on their GP's learning disability register will be invited for vaccination as part of priority group six, Public Health England has confirmed, regardless of how severe their disability is.\nAnd the NHS is being asked to work with local authorities to identify other adults, in residential care or receiving support to live in the community, who are severely affected by a learning disability and may not be registered, but who should be offered a vaccine.\nIt comes after an analysis found that people registered with their GP as having a learning disability, who tend to be those at the more severe end, are more at risk of being seriously ill and dying from Covid.  \nThere are 1.2 million people with a learning disability in England - but only a quarter to a third of them, or 250,000, are thought to be on the GP learning disability register.\nProf Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JCVI, said all those with severe learning disabilities were \"very disadvantaged\" and should be reached out to - but he said including people with mild learning disabilities was not recommended because they were at no greater risk than someone else of the same age.\nSpeaking in front of a committee of MPs, he said he didn't want lots of families who might be concerned about their relative with a mild learning disability to start contacting GPs and \"overwhelming them\".\nHowever, Nicola Sturgeon announced that Scotland would prioritise all people with learning disabilities in group six on Monday. She said priority group six would be expanded to include those with mild or moderate learning disabilities.\nA report from Public Health England in November found that people with a learning disability were up to six times more likely to die from Covid-19 and, in the 18-34 age group, their risk was 30 times higher.\nThe charity Mencap said the announcement was \"fantastic news for people with a learning disability\".\n\"It's now crucially important that everyone with a learning disability checks that they are on the register and asks to go on it if they are not,\" said the charity's Jackie O'Sullivan.\n\"Being on the register has many benefits and entitles people to annual health checks and prioritisation for future vaccinations, as well as allowing them to get the Covid vaccine and be confident they are protected.\"\nHelen Whately, minister for care in England, said everyone who is on the GP's learning disability register would be invited for vaccination to protect those at higher risk from the virus. \n\"I have heard first-hand how tough this pandemic has been for people with learning disabilities and their families,\" she said. \n\"We are determined those more at risk from Covid should be vaccinated as soon as possible.\" "

      "text": "Ministers have failed to protect the rights of children who are home educated in Wales 10 years after a child's death, a review has found.\nDylan Seabridge, eight, died of scurvy in 2011 after not being seen by any services for seven years.\nA review by the Children's Commissioner claims the Welsh Government has \"failed to respond adequately\" to his death.\nThe Welsh Government said it took protecting children's rights \"extremely seriously\".\nThe review, which calls for changes to laws after the upcoming election, comes after Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland used her statutory powers to look into the Welsh Government's response following the death of Dylan in Pembrokeshire.\nIn 2015, an inquest into his death found he had not been seen by any authorities for seven years before he died. \nA child practice review published in 2016 said it was \"tragic there are many references that the child was 'invisible'.\"\nIt led to calls to ensure home-educated children are known to officials - either on a database or register - and for them to be seen by professional services.\nMinisters have made a number of commitments to change home education regulation, but plans for a new law requiring councils to create a database of children not on a school register were shelved because of the pandemic.\nProf Holland said while she acknowledged the \"huge diversion of government resources\" because of the pandemic, she was concerned delays were \"long-standing and may continue in years to come\".\nProf Holland said while consultations and work had been carried out by the Welsh Government since Dylan's death, there had been \"no change or strengthening in any meaningful sense to the regulations around home education\".\nShe said that meant Wales remained one of the least regulated places in Europe for children being home schooled.\nFreedom of Information requests by BBC Wales Live found there were at least 2,250 home-educated children last year, but that number is likely to be higher.\nThe Children's Commissioner referenced another case in Powys which highlighted the need to strengthen home-education law.\nLast year a child practice review was published which described children being severely physically and emotionally abused.  \nThe report noted that the current home-education guidance had \"deficiencies\", and the children involved said \"it should be the kids' choice whether to be home educated\" and that \"education officers should come to the house\". \nFamilies who opt to home educate have long opposed a formal register and any kind of local authority monitoring.\nErika Lye, of home education charity Mountain Movers, said the community was exhausted by the continued debate around regulation.\n\"It's really frustrating, this perpetual cycle that is ongoing every two years,\" she said.\n\"The reasons aren't justified and it won't affect the change that needs to happen.\n\"What needs to happen is to recognise that social services desperately need funding and resourcing. If social services were properly resourced and funded, they have all the existing powers they can help children [in need].\"\nIn her review, Prof Holland said ministers had also failed to close \"safeguarding loopholes\" to protect children attending independent schools, despite some issues being \"on their radar for at least 18 years\".\nIn 2018-19 almost 10,000 pupils were enrolled in independent schools, where there is currently no requirement for staff to register with the Education Workforce Council for Wales - the independent regulator for education staff. \nIt means staff cannot be struck off the workforce register, meaning they could continue to work with children even if they are sacked because of misconduct involving children.\nProf Holland said the case of Toby Belfield - a former headteacher of Ruthin School in Denbighshire sacked for messaging female students - should have \"acted as a catalyst\" to strengthen the law but it still \"had not been prioritised\". \nThe report makes a series of recommendations to be put forward by the next Welsh Government, including the introduction of new laws to ensure all children in Wales can be seen and spoken to about their education as well as \"substantially\" updating the regulation of independent schools. \nGareth Pearson, who chairs the Welsh Independent Schools Council, said the safeguarding and wellbeing of its pupils was its \"top priority\"\nHe said: \"We have consistently welcomed any opportunity to work with the Welsh Government to further strengthen our safeguarding provision and look forward to acting upon the recommendations of this report.\"\nThe Welsh Government said it took its responsibility for protecting children's rights \"extremely seriously\" and ministers were disappointed the pandemic had led to \"important planned work\" being dropped.\n\"In normal circumstances, work would have by now been nearing completion,\" a spokesman said.\n\"However, we are not in normal circumstances and the government has had to fundamentally shift its focus thus having an impact on completing this work.  \n\"We have noted the findings in the review and will consider the report in detail before responding more formally.\""

      "text": "First Minister Arlene Foster has said she has \"full confidence\" in NI Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride.\nIt comes after her party, the DUP, said health officials had been \"overcautious\" in recommending a phased return of NI schools.\nThe DUP had called for the executive to revisit the plan but Dr McBride said the medical evidence had not changed.\nHealth and education officials are to work together on further timelines for the return of all pupils to classrooms.\nOn Thursday, DUP Education Minister Peter Weir said his preferred option had been a full return to school on 8 March, and that he \"wanted answers\" from Dr McBride about why his advice remained against that.\nAll schools in England are to reopen on 8 March, but only a small number of pre-school, nursery and primary pupils will return in NI on that date.\nMr Weir said he did not want NI to be \"out of sync\" with the rest of the UK or \"second-class citizens\".\nHe said NI was in a similar position to England and it was therefore \"hard to square the circle of Michael McBride and Chris Whitty being on the same page,\" considering the medical advice on reopening schools was different in the two jurisdictions.\nEast Antrim DUP MP Sammy Wilson also criticised health officials on Thursday, comparing Health Minister Robin Swann to \"a poodle for an unaccountable chief medical officer\". \nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was \"disrespectful\" and \"disgraceful\".\nMrs Foster said \"sometimes tweets would be better to be typed out and then deleted\", adding it was not language she would have used.\nAsked whether Dr McBride still had her support, Mrs Foster said he \"absolutely\" did.\n\"He has worked tirelessly, as indeed has the chief scientific adviser and deputy to bring us impartial advice and that's the key - impartial advice - then we as politicians have to decide on the best way forward.\n\"So absolutely Michael retains and will have my full confidence and that of my party.\" \nThere have been no changes to the staggered approach, initially agreed by the executive last week.\nBut Mrs Foster said health and education officials will work together on further timelines for the return of all pupils to classrooms.\nShe said ministers indicated a desire at Thursday's meeting to avoid primary one to primary three pupils, who are due to return on 8 March, having to \"revert back\" to remote learning for a week from 22 March.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said all ministers also recognised that it was important to get students back to classrooms quickly - but safely. \nUnder the current timetable, only pre-school, nursery and pupils in primaries one to three will return to classrooms in Northern Ireland on 8 March. After two weeks, they will resume remote learning so older pupils in years 12 to 14 can go back to school.\nIt looks pretty clear that at least part of the executive's plan is going to change, for the return of some primary school pupils at least.\nNo principal I spoke to thought it was a good idea to bring primary one to primary three pupils back for effectively nine days, given most schools are off on St Patrick's Day and to then send them home for a week of remote learning when years 12 to 14 are due to return.\nIt is probably one of the easier changes for the executive to make.\nHowever there is still significant uncertainty for other year groups who don't yet have a potential date as to when they might return.\nWhether there are major changes this side of Easter is hard to predict because obviously it will depend how ministers see the public health situation moving.\nMuch of the executive's discussions on Thursday focused on the proposed pathway-to-recovery blueprint.\nIt is understood ministers received a presentation from interim Head of the Civil Service, Jenny Pyper, who leads the executive's Covid-19 taskforce. \nLast week, the first and deputy first ministers said they would publish the plan on Monday 1 March.\nBut at Thurday's press conference, they said they wanted to ensure they \"got it right\", rather than prematurely publishing the document.\nThe plan is not expected to include indicative dates, but will set out criteria that must be met before restrictions on different sectors can be eased.\nMrs Foster said the executive would also take into consideration \"not only local data but emerging evidence from other jurisdictions too\".\n\"We will keep to the standard of reviewing the regulations every three weeks, and every time we look at things we'll hope we can move further,\" she added. \nIn England and Scotland, recovery plans have been published that include target dates for easing restrictions - but the respective governments have said lifting of the rules will only happen if certain conditions are met.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, lockdown restrictions have been extended until 5 April.\nMs O'Neill said she hoped work on the executive's plan would continue over the weekend.\nShe added that she wanted to see \"robust and co-ordinated quarantine measures\" in place for travel across the island of Ireland, as part of the executive's overall response to manage the route out of lockdown.\nNI's lockdown has been extended until 1 April, with a review due on 18 March.\nOn Thursday, five more Covid-19 related deaths were recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.\nThe department's coronavirus death toll now stands at 2,048.\nA further 281 new positive cases of the virus have also been recorded.\nThere are also 341 people being treated for Covid-19 in hospitals, with 44 of those patients being treated in intensive case units (ICU), of those patients in ICU, 32 are ventilated.\nThe department's latest figures also show 491,593 people in Northern Ireland have now received their first Covid-19 vaccine.\nSome 31,637 people have had both doses.\nThe rate of transmission for new cases in Northern Ireland is estimated to be between 0.8 and 1.05, according to the Department of Health.\nThere were 35 additional deaths reported in the Irish Republic, with 613 more cases confirmed.\nIt means there has been a total of 4,271 coronavirus-related deaths in the country, with 217,478 confirmed cases.\nAre you worried about the new variants of coronavirus in Northern Ireland?

I don't think from the evidence we have, we would regard it as a major issue but nor would we deny that in certain cases it does take place.\n\"Our view is that whatever happens should be in the best interests of a child.\n\"The pressures on a school, the pressures on school leaders might sometimes lead them to take decision that in other circumstance they wouldn't. \n\"That doesn't make the decision right and I think we have to keep coming back to this that from a moral point of view we have to say that whatever the circumstance, the interests of the child must come first.\"\nBut he believes changes to accountability measures being introduced by ministers should help.\nIn the past, the percentage of pupils achieving five A* to C passes including English or Welsh and maths has been an influential measure of school performance, but that is being ditched as part of reforms.\nA Welsh Government spokesman said: \"We have been working with head teachers on a range of new interim performance measures that place a greater focus on raising our aspirations for all learners.\n\"These new measures will remove the narrow focus on the achievement of just C grades that has occurred as a result of the current measures and will value the progress of all pupils across the cohort. This will ensure that every child matters.\"\nErika Lye, who's the chair of a home education charity, is concerned about the number of young people leaving the school system late in their schooling, particularly children with additional learning needs.\nShe believes that is partly driven by pressures on budgets and performance measures.\n\"Home education is a valid choice, it's a successful choice but it should be a choice. It shouldn't be something that parents are forced into. \n\"If they want their children in school, the state should be providing what those children need.\n\"It's really unfair the pressures that the schools are under, and teachers themselves are under - they need more resources - they need more support.\n\"Government is the one that's setting these targets and I suppose society has this expectation of performance outcomes where really you want a happy school for your child, you want an inclusive environment for your child. \n\"Performance outcomes really shouldn't be what you plan your child's education for. For your job, for anybody's job you're going to work to your performance targets.\""

      "tags": "Merthyr Tydfil,Cardiff,Newport,NHS Wales,Mountain Ash,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "What can different statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales?\nHere we update some of the key areas of data for measuring the pandemic and we also try to explain some of the different measures being used. \nThe emergence of the Omicron variant in December 2021 led to record case numbers and fears that a surge in cases could put pressure on hospitals already struggling - as a result, tighter rules were imposed on 26 December.\nBy the second week of January, case numbers began to fall quickly. One week later, the Welsh government was confident the peak had passed and Wales moved to the lowest level of restrictions - alert level zero - on Friday. \nWe saw record numbers of Covid cases in the community in the days after Christmas but this did not translate into a significant rise in hospital cases, with the number of Covid patients now falling for more than a week.\nThere was a rolling average of 560 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on 27 January, a 22% drop on a week ago, although the daily figure has now risen for two successive days to 566.\nThere were two and a half times as many people in hospital with confirmed Covid at the same point in 2021. \nWhen we include patients with suspected Covid and recovering from Covid, there are an average of 1,028 patients. They make up 12% of all hospital patients.  \nThere are now 470 patients who are recovering, so they no longer test positive for Covid but are either still rehabilitating or waiting for a discharge or care support or place to become available. This is the highest number of these patients since last March.\nThe number of Covid patients on invasive ventilation or in critical care beds stood at 20 on 27 January. This is a figure we last saw in early August.\nThe average daily number has fallen from 28 to 21 in a week.\nAbout 90% of these patients are primarily being treated for Covid.\nThere are seven times the number of non-Covid patients in critical care. \nAt the same point in 2021, there were 134 critically ill Covid patients.\nThe mortality rate of a critical care Covid patient, in the most recent study of 623 Welsh patients since May 2021, is about 35%, including those who died later in a general ward.\nAbout half had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived are spending less time in critical care than earlier in the pandemic.\nThe average age is 55, nearly two-thirds are men and they are more likely to be overweight. Nearly half are from more deprived parts of Wales. Just under a third are aged under 50.\nThe study, at a UK level, showed 61% of those Covid patients in critical care were unvaccinated in December.\nCovid admissions are at an average of 25 a day - lower than the average of 40 last week - and make up 2.3% of all hospital admissions.\nWe can also see how they are running lower than modelled scenarios, based on various estimates based on vaccine effectiveness.\nWe can see from a comparison with December-January 2020-21, that despite much higher numbers of cases in the community, the hospital admissions rate is much lower.\nAccounting for a 10-day lag between cases being confirmed and hospital admissions, on 24 January, Covid hospital admissions were just less than 1% of positive Covid tests, compared to 9.4% at the same point in 2021.\nAdmissions have been considerably lower compared to the second wave.\nNearly six in 10 cases of patients in hospital with confirmed Covid in the last week were patients being treated for other conditions.\nOnly 41.5% of patients in acute hospital beds with Covid were being primarily or \"actively\" treated for the virus.\nBut that proportion rises to 90% of those in critical are.\nThe figures on these \"incidental\" Covid cases are only just being published and reflect the fact there has been a lot of people being infected out in the community, while in the latest week there were 220 patients who caught Covid \"probably\" or \"definitely\" while in hospital for other reasons.\nNearly 10,000 patients have hospital-acquired Covid since the start of the pandemic.\nIt doesn't mean that these patients can't have complications because of having Covid and it can still present challenges for patient management.\nSeparate analysis of Covid admissions to Welsh hospitals between the start of the pandemic and August 2021 in Wales estimated that 71.2% were directly due to Covid.\nIn cases where Covid wasn't the primary cause, trauma injuries made up nearly one in five cases, with Welsh Government scientists saying acute illnesses were known to increase the propensity to fall, which on top of reduced physical activity and consequent muscle loss due to shielding and self-isolation issues, \"would increase the likelihood of hip fractures\".\nOne indication of pressure on the NHS is overall bed occupancy in acute hospitals, which has been 90.7% on average for the week, at its highest level over the last two weeks.\nThe other measure is NHS staff absence.\nLatest figures show NHS staff sickness related to Covid-19 in Wales has improved slightly over the last two weeks after being at its highest level since the start of the first wave.  \nOverall staff absence was slightly higher last winter.\nA total of 1.5% of staff were absent due to Covid-related sickness in the week to 24 January. Another 1% of staff were having to self-isolate, according to the weekly Welsh government figures. This does not include NHS Wales staff absent for other reasons. \nThe total absence proportion has dropped to 7.1%.\nAbout 84% of those eligible for a booster in Wales have now received one.\nThere have been an average of 3,494 boosters given out a day in the past week, which has seen a drop off, as the programme works through people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. Before Christmas, the daily average was 42,500.\nAt the peak of the vaccine programme in March, between 38,000 and 40,000 daily vaccines were given out. \nAbout 61% of all vaccines being given out are boosters, with nearly two thirds of 12 to 15-year-olds now having a second dose.\nThe chart above shows the number of people admitted to hospital who have had two doses of vaccine, and those who have had none, for every 100,000 people.\nIt shows the rate of admissions for over-60s who have not had a jab is nearly triple that of those who have been double jabbed and is also far higher for the 18-59 age group.\nThe latest infection survey by the Office for National Statistics suggests - based on swab samples of 9,430 people - that one in 30 people in Wales had Covid in the week ending 22 January.\nThat is 99,500 people, or 3.27% of the population.\nThat's estimated to be highest in youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nThis shows another decrease, compared to the estimate of 112,100 the previous week.\nWhen it comes to age groups, the highest proportion of people infected are youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nCase rates are becoming more problematic to interpret, because three-quarters of people who test positive for lateral flow tests are no longer asked to take follow-up PCR tests.\nThe infection survey is a useful indicator, as it picks up asymptomatic people.\nONS says it shows Covid infections fell in Wales, as in England and Scotland, with an uncertain trend in Northern Ireland. Similar surveys showed infections were one in 30 in Scotland too and one in 20 in England and Northern Ireland. \nIt's now more than two weeks since results from the new testing criteria started coming in, which meant most asymptomatic people no longer needed to take follow-up PCR tests if they tested positive with a lateral flow device. \nAround 80% of those testing positive for lateral flows did not take a follow-up test in the latest week.\nWe know that there were 17,000 people with positive LFTs in the week to 22 January, who did not have follow-up PCR tests and so were not included in the case rate figures - set against 16,000 positive PCR results in the same period. LFT results are published weekly and so we have to be careful with comparisons and interpretation.\nBut if we look at the trend from those figures taken roughly together, in the latest week they would have pushed up the case rate more noticeably than it has risen in recent days. But this is still well down on the numbers we saw in early January.\nThe positivity rate has levelled out - at 34.4% - roughly the same as the week before.\nThe nature of this wave so far has been defined by the age profile.\nThis can also be seen in the big change in January 2022, compared to the week in 2021.\nAround 10% of Covid cases in Wales were in the over-60s, compared to 22% in the very early days of the vaccine roll out in January 2021. \nThere has been a big rise in the proportion of cases in the under 19 age group, now making up a third of all cases.\nThis is back to a share not seen since September and early October and can probably be linked to schools going back.\nAbsence for Covid-related reasons in primary schools has been an average of 4.7% and 2.7% in secondary schools in the last week.\nMost age groups are showing a decline, although there has been a recent rise in the under 16 age group.\nThis week, the proportion of cases among the under 19 age group reached 37% of all positive tests for the first time since September.\nThe 30 to 39 age group remained the largest group. \nCouncil areas in Cardiff and Vale and the Aneurin Bevan health board area all showed rises, as 13 of Wales' 22 local authority areas showed falls in under 25s in the week ending 20 January.\nNewport (1122.9 cases per 100,000) had the highest rate in the under 25s, as it did for case rates as a whole, showing how younger people have generally driven rises in case rates.\nNewport also had above average case numbers in the over 60s.\nMeanwhile, the R-number - reproduction number - for Wales has been estimated at the slightly lower range, between 1.1 and 1.5, up to 13 January. This is a calculation which looks at various factors to work out a transmission rate for Covid. It suggests that for every 10 people with Covid, another 11 to 13 people would be infected.\nRecent modelling, published on 7 January, indicated a rise over the following two weeks, with the situation unlikely to ease. \nBut a fall in cases led First Minister Mark Drakeford, a week later, to say there were \"positive signs that the peak may have passed\" although he added caution over a \"fast-moving and volatile variant\".\nBy 21 January, after a sharp drop, he could say \"confidently\" that Wales had passed the peak of the Omicron wave and the \"incredibly high levels of infections we have seen across Wales\".\nThe latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics suggests that 97.4% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection.\nAlthough slightly less than the other UK nations, it is an increasing proportion and the highest yet recorded, since estimates began more than a year ago.\nThe estimate is 97.2% of 16 to 24-year-olds would have tested positive for antibodies, although it falls to 96.4% for those aged over 80. It is as high as 98.2% for people in their 70s. \nONS also estimates that 88% of 12 to 15-year-olds in Wales have antibodies.\nIn the most recent week, up to 14 January, 69 people in Wales had a death which involved Covid-19 - and saw it included as a contributory factor on a death certificate.\nThis compared to 61 deaths registered in the previous week, according to the ONS.\nIn 77.4% of cases (across England and Wales) in the latest week, Covid was the underlying cause of death - so deaths were due to Covid. This is a lower proportion than seen in earlier months, when it averaged 87%.\nThere were no deaths from Covid in only three counties in the latest week: Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil and Powys.\nThe Betsi Cadwaladr health board area had 18 deaths.\nDuring 2021, there were 4,007 deaths involving Covid, of those registered up to now.\nThat includes 204 deaths in December. Back in December 2020, there were 1,333 deaths involving Covid.\nThe second wave in the winter brought 83 deaths alone on 11 January 2021 - the worst single day during the pandemic in Wales.\nA total of 9,384 deaths involving Covid have occurred during the pandemic in Wales - with 65 actually occurring, rather than just being registered, over the most recent week.\nThe ONS measure includes deaths in people's homes, hospices and other settings, as well as hospitals and care homes.\nBecause Public Health Wales' \"snapshot\" measure only includes deaths within 28 days and after a positive Covid lab test, mostly in hospitals, it excludes deaths involving Covid elsewhere, including many deaths in the first wave of the pandemic, hundreds of deaths in people's own homes and where doctors suspect Covid has been a contributory factor.\nONS also records so-called \"excess deaths\". This has been seen as a useful measure of the pandemic's impact because it looks at deaths from all causes overall, compared to the five-year, non-pandemic average.\nSo since March 2020, there have been 6,520 more deaths than we might expect to see on average.\nDeaths ran above average for the last half of 2021 and in the latest week were the same as the five-year norm. \nNearly a fifth of all Covid deaths (19%) registered have occurred in care homes.\nThere were 10 deaths involving a care home resident in the latest week.\nCare Inspectorate Wales reports that deaths peaked in May 2020 and said it has been notified of 2,019 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid- 16.1% of all reported deaths.\nDeaths in people's own homes have also been running at more than a third higher than average.\nWe can also see how deaths in the third wave have been at much lower levels than in the second wave.\nCovid-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in Wales in December. \nMortality analysis by the ONS showed it accounted for 5.4% of all registered deaths. This compares with 5.2% of all deaths in England.\nCovid was the third leading cause of death in the previous three months and had been ranked as the leading cause of death in six months since the pandemic began.\nDementia, heart disease and chronic lower respiratory diseases were the three leading causes of death in Wales in December. Flu and pneumonia ranked seventh, with the mortality rate significantly lower than normal levels.\nCovid was the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease throughout 2021.\nThe ONS, which takes into account population and age structure, found the mortality rate for deaths due to Covid in Wales in December was 59.3 deaths per 100,000 - significantly lower than the previous month. This was lower than five of the nine English regions: the north west, north east, east and west Midlands and the highest in London (70 deaths per 100,000).\nFour health board areas in Wales had mortality rates in December higher than the Welsh average - the highest was 107 deaths per 100,000 in Cardiff and Vale due to Covid.\nAcross the course of the pandemic, the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is the same in Wales and England - 147.4 deaths per 100,000, with Scotland (126.9) and Northern Ireland (132.5) both lower in the 22 months to the end of December.\nThe age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England, than in Wales.\nWhen a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales again.\nONS also looks at how deaths are registered on certificates and found since the pandemic began, Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 79.6% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales. \nThis is a fall from 83.9% in November. It has been as high as 94% and on average since the start of the pandemic it has been 87%.\nIn around 3% of these deaths, the doctor had written that Covid was \"suspected\".\nA doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution. \nRhondda Cynon Taf has the highest mortality rate over the course of the pandemic in Wales.\nBy the second week of January, RCT and Cardiff each had a total 1,024 deaths.\nRCT also has the seventh highest mortality rate of all local authorities across England and Wales.\nSix of its communities were also in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates are broken down further.\nThe area with the highest number of deaths in the first two waves of the pandemic was Tonyrefail, with a total of 57 deaths due to Covid, followed by Sandfields in Port Talbot (52) and Porth East in Rhondda Cynon Taf (48 deaths), by the end of April 2021.\nWhen translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Llanelli Bigyn is the highest, followed by Port Talbot East.\nAnd there is one community remaining which has had no Covid deaths at all through the pandemic - Llandudno Junction South & Llansanffraid Glan Conwy.\nIn the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales.\nThe ONS and public health bodies are measuring things in a different way - and information is available at different times so do not expect to see the same thing:\nPublic Health Wales' daily updates on its online dashboard show numbers of deaths and positive tests for coronavirus:\nThe graphic above shows how it looks when you compare figures from the different data sources - and how there is a difference between ONS and PHW. There is also a similar count used by the UK government, which takes the PHW statistics and involves people who died within 28 days of a first positive test for Covid.\nThere is a difference of about 2,620 deaths.\nAccording to the PHW measure, on 28 January, there had been a total of 6,804 deaths with Covid, with the daily average running at four a day in the last week.\nMore than eight million Covid-19 tests have been carried out during the pandemic so far.\nNHS Wales labs have capacity to handle 15,000 a day but private labs process most of the test results.\nAlthough PHW figures show more than 765,000 positive tests, this is not the total number of people who have had Covid as mass testing was not available until the tail end of the first wave of the pandemic.\nSince the summer of 2021, and with the easing of restrictions, more lateral flow tests (LFTs) of asymptomatic people have been undertaken, which saw more positive tests eventually feeding into the system - adding about 10% to numbers.\nThe most recent week has seen more than 383,000 LFTs, with a record 21,127 positive. This positive proportion of 11% in the week ending 23 January, was another record. \nThe highest incidence is still among the under 20s - 8,873 positive tests, an 87% rise - and the positivity rate of 24.9% is also the highest  -which is likely to be associated with schools going back.\nIt is the only age group showing a rise, although figures will not show up in overall case numbers.\nFrom 6 January 2022, most people who take LFTs are not being asked to take a follow-up PCR test if positive. This will affect the number of cases which appear - only counting those who come forward with symptoms. This will have to be taken into account when interpreting case data.\nAbout 19,000 tests are routinely taken in hospitals each week and 25,000 in care homes. \nThe number of tests processed in the last two weeks have showed a big drop - half what they were a fortnight ago.\nAbout 96% of tests requiring a rapid turnaround were completed within one calendar day.\nThere have been 1,068 positive tests in care homes among residents and staff in the latest week, following routine testing. This is down on two weeks before, which set a record high since the programme returned in October 2020.\nCare Inspectorate Wales figures also show 235 (22.3%) care homes in Wales have notified one or more confirmed cases of Covid in the last week.\nThis is also fall on the previous week.\nIn the last two weeks, there have also been 39 reported deaths of residents with confirmed or suspected Covid.\nThe dominant variant in Wales is now Omicron, with more than 12,344 new cases sequenced.\nNumbers are now only being reported weekly, as the variant has taken hold.\nPHW increased lab capacity in readiness for sequencing more cases. About 20-30% of positive cases in Wales, which are flagged as being more likely to be variants, have swabs sent for sequencing, with results coming back a few days after people get their normal test results.\nWe can also see more people reporting symptoms of \"long Covid\" - 58,000 estimated in Wales to be experiencing the long-term effect of having the virus. \nThis includes 21,000 people estimated to still be reporting symptoms a year or more after their infection."

      "tags": "RTS awards,Television",
      "text": "The BBC has won scoop of the year at the Royal Television Society journalism awards for its interview with footballer Marcus Rashford about his experience of growing up in poverty. \nRashford spoke to BBC Breakfast in June as he urged the government to extend the provision of free school meals.\nThe awards' judges said it was the exclusive \"everyone wanted\".\nElsewhere, the BBC's Clive Myrie won television journalist of the year while Andrew Marr won interview of the year. \nThe corporation led the way at the RTS Television Journalism Awards, winning in nine of 19 categories. \nRashford had been urging the government to change its mind about not offering food vouchers during the summer holidays when he spoke to BBC Breakfast.\nDuring the first lockdown - which began in March 2020 - the government had provided vouchers to families whose children qualify for free meals, but had insisted this would not continue outside of term time.\nIn the Breakfast interview, the Manchester United striker told the BBC about how, when he was growing up, his mother had struggled to feed her five children.\n\"It's the stress on her shoulders that affected her, after we've ate our dinner, because she knows she's worrying about the situation. She's trying to go to sleep but she can't because she's so worried,\" he told the BBC. \n\"Everyone wanted this exclusive but only one team got it and it made headlines everywhere for days,\" the judges said. \nFollowing Rashford's intervention, the government ended up extending the provision of free school meals into the summer holidays.\nThe BBC's Clive Myrie won network presenter of the year for what judges called his \"versatile, measured and compelling style\". \nHe had documented life on the front-line of the pandemic with reports from the Royal London Hospital, where he found staff struggling to cope.\n\"The jury agreed the winner had had an astonishing year - as excellent as a package maker and interviewer as a studio and location presenter,\" the judges said. \nThe Andrew Marr Show was recognised for its interview with the Chinese Ambassador, Liu Xiaoming.\nHe was shown drone footage which appeared to show its Uighur population being blindfolded and led to trains, and which has been authenticated by Australian security services.\nThe judges described the interview as \"a master class in technique, gutsy and went for the jugular\".\nSky News won five awards, including news channel of the year, while daily news programme of the year went to ITV's News at Ten. \nThe judges' award was given to all the technical teams in recognition of the \"ingenuity, innovation and speed they demonstrated this year to keep journalism on the air\". \nChair of the awards Simon Bucks said: \"This has been an incredibly challenging year for all journalists and news organisations. \n\"Despite the difficulties of covering the Covid-19 pandemic, all the broadcasters who enter these awards have distinguished themselves with some remarkable coverage and every one of the nominees would have been a worthy winner.  \n\"Moreover, many of them were not about the Coronavirus, but a range of other important stories which in any normal year would have dominated the agenda.\"\nThe other winners were:"

      "tags": "Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish Parliament,Douglas Ross",
      "text": "Holyrood faces a \"crisis of credibility\" over its inquiry into the handling of harassment complaints against Alex Salmond, opposition leaders have claimed.\nThe row centres on written evidence submitted to the inquiry by Mr Salmond that was later redacted at the request of the Crown Office.\nThe Crown Office has dismissed concerns the move was politically motivated.\nMr Salmond is now expected to give evidence to the inquiry on Friday.\nIn another development,  MSPs on the inquiry committee have used their statutory powers to demand the release of more Crown Office documents.   \nThey are asking the Crown Office to hand over all correspondence between Peter Murrell, chief executive officer of the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon's husband, Liz Lloyd, Nicola Sturgeon's chief of staff, Sue Ruddick, chief operating officer for the SNP and Ian McCann, SNP compliance officer. \nMr Salmond claims the documents being requested will show he was the victim of a high-level plot.\nMs Sturgeon, who has emphatically denied there was any such plotting against her former boss, is scheduled to appear before MSPs next week.\nShe described suggestions that the Crown Office's intervention was politically influenced as \"downright wrong\".\nAlex Salmond had been due to appear before the committee on Tuesday but pulled out when the parliament withdrew and then republished a redacted version of one of his submissions - after \"grave concerns\" were raised by the Crown Office. \nAnswering an urgent question in the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday afternoon, Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC said the decision to ask for the document to be amended was taken independently by \"senior professional prosecutors\".\nAnd he said that government ministers had not sought to direct them.\nHe added: \"The Crown has no interest in interfering with or limiting the conduct of proceedings in this parliament.\n\"Its only interest is securing compliance with an order of the High Court with which we are all obliged to comply.\"\nThe law officer was responding to a question by Scottish Labour interim leader Jackie Baillie, who said it was \"simply unacceptable that the Lord Advocate refused to answer the questions put to him with any detail\".\nShe added: \"The fact of the matter is that the parliament is not getting straight answers from a Lord Advocate who appears to have viewed this afternoon's session in the chamber as a necessary chore and not a chance to engage with the Scottish Parliament in a spirit of democratic accountability.\"\nMeanwhile, Mr Salmond said in a statement that his lawyers would be writing to the Lord Advocate to ask for an explanation for the Crown Office's \"unprecedented and highly irregular actions\". \nMr Salmond said he had also instructed his lawyers to request specifically that the Crown \"preserve and retain all material and communications with all or any third parties which led to their decision to intervene at the very last minute\" before he was due to appear before the inquiry. \nHis submission to the inquiry accuses First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of misleading parliament, and was posted on the parliament's website on Monday.\nIt was published after MSPs on Holyrood's corporate body decided after taking legal advice that it was possible to do so.\nBut the corporate body agreed on Tuesday morning to remove and revise the document after receiving a letter from the Crown Office which expressed \"grave concerns\". \nThe Crown Office later said it had taken action because of issues of potential contempt of court. \nThe inquiry has been hit by severe delays since it started its work, with opposition MSPs accusing both the Scottish government and Mr Salmond of attempting to frustrate it and avoid scrutiny. \nSpeaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme earlier on Wednesday, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said \"of course\" parliament was facing a crisis of credibility over the inquiry.\nHe said: \"This sleaze and scandal within the SNP has now undermined everything that's going on in Holyrood and the nationalists are clearly treating parliament and the Scottish people with contempt\".\nThe Lord Advocate was appointed by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and is both the head of the Crown Office and the Scottish government's chief legal adviser. \nSeparate documents submitted to the inquiry by Mr Salmond accuse the Crown Office of being unfit for purpose under its current leadership, and claim it is too close to both the Scottish government and the SNP.\nMr Salmond also alleged that there was \"a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort amongst a range of individuals within the Scottish government and the SNP to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned.\"\nMr Ross claimed that the Lord Advocate being a member of the Scottish government meant there could be a possible conflict of interest in his involvement. \nRuth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative group leader at Holyrood, later told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that she believed there should be an independent, judge-led inquiry into \"why the government is not allowing a committee of its own parliament to have access to information they need\".\nShe added: \"At the moment the government is running riot and is denying the parliament its right of scrutiny.\"\nMs Sturgeon, who is currently due to give evidence to the inquiry next week, has denied there was a conspiracy against Mr Salmond, saying her predecessor had made claims \"without a shred of evidence\".\nShe has also denied that she breached the ministerial code or that her government has attempted to obstruct the inquiry, and has said that she is \"relishing\" the prospect of giving evidence in person. \nSpeaking at her daily coronavirus briefing, she said: \"Decisions the Crown Office takes in relation to enforcing or upholding the law are taken independently of government.\n\"Any suggestion at all that these decisions are in any way politically influenced is downright wrong\".\nMs Sturgeon also said she did not believe the redaction of the document was a good reason for Mr Salmond to refuse to appear before the inquiry.\nThe inquiry committee has been examining what went wrong with the government's internal investigation into sexual harassment complaints against Mr Salmond that were made by two female civil servants.\nThe government had to pay legal expenses of more than \u00a3500,000 to Mr Salmond after it admitted it had acted unlawfully during the investigation. \nMr Salmond was later cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault against a total of nine women after a High Court trial last year."

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nTeachers will decide the grades of pupils in England whose GCSEs and A-levels have been cancelled because of the pandemic. Exams watchdog Ofqual says schools will be able to use a combination of mock exams, coursework and essays to determine grades, with exam boards drawing up test papers solely to help inform their judgement. Teachers had already been placed centrally to arrangements for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nFormer Chancellor Lord Hammond says the government must risk unpopularity and tell \"some difficult home truths\" about the state of the economy.  Dealing with the pandemic has been the financial equivalent of \"fighting a war\", he says, and the government may have to admit it can no longer deliver on \"very extravagant commitments\" made before coronavirus hit. \nUS regulators say the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine, which is administered in a single jab, is safe and effective. It could be authorised for use there within days. The UK has ordered 30 million doses of the jab and the government has previously said that - provided it is approved by British regulators - deliveries could be expected \"in the second half of this year\".\nCouncil data shows that despite high infection rates, just 61% of people aged over 80 have been vaccinated in Birmingham's deprived, ethnically diverse area of Alum Rock. A few miles north in leafy, more affluent Sutton Four Oaks the figure is 95% and infection rates have been three times lower of late. Health correspondent Nick Triggle examines whether this trend is being repeated across the country.\nWhen the pandemic hit, choreographer and dance teacher Lizzi Gee found herself out of work. So she decided to use her new-found spare time to teach her son Rufus, eight, to tap dance. Now their mother and son routines attract millions of hits online...\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nRemind yourself when lockdown restrictions are being eased in your part of the world.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

It has yet to decide if a new generation of a hatchback model will be produced there.\nVauxhall confirmed on Thursday that talks on \"different scenarios for Ellesmere Port\" were ongoing with UK authorities \"at both national and local levels\".\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has been involved in discussions with Stellantis, which have been ongoing for several weeks.\nThe BBC understands that three options on the table for the plant include: \nStellantis boss Carlos Tavares recently referred to the \"brutal\" decision for the UK government to bring forward the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars to 2030 and said it might make more sense to move future electric production closer to its biggest market in the European Union (EU).\nShadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: \"The Ellesmere Port plant is a major employer and winding it down would have devastating consequences, with 1,000 highly skilled jobs lost from the local community.\n\"To support our automotive manufacturing industry and boost its competitiveness, Labour has called for ambitious investment in electric vehicle technology, including the electric battery supply chain, through a \u00a330bn green economic recovery. This investment would mean manufacturers have the long-term confidence they need to build new electric models in the UK.\"\nA government spokesperson said: \"We are committed to ensuring the UK continues to be one of the best locations in the world for automotive manufacturing, and we're doing all we can to protect and create jobs, while securing a competitive future for the\u202fsector.\""

This would mean the loss of 800 jobs.\nIt also plans to change about 1,100 store management roles, although it insists that this will mean an increase in jobs overall.\nAsda chief executive Roger Burnley said: \"The pandemic has accelerated change across the retail sector especially the shift towards grocery home shopping and our priority is to serve customers in the way they want to shop with us. \n\"The last 12 months have shown us that businesses have to be prepared to adapt quickly to change and I am incredibly proud of the way we demonstrated our agility and resilience through the pandemic.\"\nPeople close to the business insist that the move is led by a change in demand from shoppers rather than a cost-cutting drive, and point to the 4,500 new jobs being created as order pickers and delivery drivers.\nThe company can handle 90% more online orders compared to a year ago.\nAsda says it hopes many of those at risk can be moved to the new jobs and that the actual number of workers leaving the business will be lower. \nOne store manager, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, told the BBC the proposed job cuts would \"pile more pressure and stress on an already stretched workforce\" and described scenes of upset in their store. \nAsda was recently purchased by billionaire brothers Zuber and Mohsin Issa and private equity firm TDR Capital, in a deal valuing it at \u00a36.8bn, funded largely with debt.\nThe deal came after a failed attempt at merging with rival Sainsbury's.\n\"Asda workers have had a torrid two years,\" Roger Jenkins, national officer for the GMB union said.\n\"The failed Sainsbury's takeover, twelve months working on the pandemic frontline and now the uncertainty of a new take over, sidling the company with huge debts and potential sell offs. \n\"This is the last thing they need.\"\nThe union said the company is profitable and does not need to enforce redundancies."

      "tags": "John Healey,Nato,Trident,Labour Party,Jeremy Corbyn",
      "text": "Labour's support for keeping the UK's nuclear weapons is \"non-negotiable,\" the shadow defence secretary has said. \nBut in a speech, John Healey also promised to \"lead efforts to secure multilateral disarmament\" if the party wins power.\nLabour dropped its policy of unilaterally getting rid of the UK's nuclear weapons after then-leader Neil Kinnock lost the 1987 general election.\nMany on the party's left remain vehemently opposed to that decision.\nFormer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - a long-time opponent of the UK's Trident submarine-based missile system and a vice president of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) - said in 2015 that he would never use it if he became prime minister.\nYet maintaining nuclear weapons remained a pledge in the party's 2019 election manifesto.\nIn a speech to the Royal United Services Institute think tank, Mr Healey emphasised that the party leadership under Sir Keir Starmer is far clearer in its backing of this than Mr Corbyn was.\n\"Labour's support for the UK's nuclear deterrent is non-negotiable. The matter is settled,\" he said. \nHe added that Labour wanted to see the UK \"doing more to lead efforts to secure strategic arms limitation and multilateral disarmament\". \nMr Healey also said the party's commitment to the NATO military alliance - which Mr Corbyn said in 2012 should be disbanded, but later argued should focus on reducing \"tensions around the world\" - is  \"unshakeable\".\nThis isn't a change in policy, but it's a distinct change in tone.\nLabour wants to make sure it gets a serious hearing on defence.\nIt knows that it needs its own position to be clear to be able to most effectively challenge the government's decisions (which is particularly important with the Integrated Review due soon).\nThat means definitively answering some of the questions which have been raised over recent years, especially around NATO and nuclear weapons.\nKeeping Britain's nuclear weapons system has always been a divisive issue within Labour, but it is party policy.\nThat didn't change under Jeremy Corbyn, but his lifelong personal opposition to nuclear weapons - and his statement in 2015 that he would never use them - allowed Labour's commitment to be questioned.\nStating that it is \"non-negotiable\" ends that speculation, although it is unlikely to go down well with everyone in the party.\nThe government launched its Integrated Review last year, looking at the UK's long-term foreign policy and defence priorities.\nMr Healey said the review should \"refocus our defence efforts on where the threats are, not where the business opportunities might be\".\nHe also called for the review - which ministers have promised this month - to be published now, to end \"confusion and speculation\" about its contents. \nHe added that unless the review confirmed a reduction in potential threats to the UK, it would be \"very hard to accept the case for reducing the strength of our full-time forces\". \nAnd he also urged the government to \"set a higher bar\" when deciding to buy military equipment from abroad. \nResponding to Mr Healey's speech, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament accused Labour's leadership of being \"stuck in a 20th Century rut\".\nIts general secretary Kate Hudson said the UK today was facing \"new and different threats,\" including climate change, pandemics, artificial intelligence and cyber warfare.\n\"This is where investment urgently needs to go, not on massively expensive nuclear weapons,\" she added. \n\"Labour has to stop pandering to an old agenda and give the people the sensible, forward-looking thinking that today's reality demands.\"  \nThe government has promised an increase in spending on defence of 2.6% above the rate of inflation between 2019/20 and 2020/21.\nIt expects the overall figure to rise to \u00a341.5bn during this time.\nMargaret Thatcher's Conservative government first acquired Trident - using submarines to carry up to eight missiles each - in the early 1980s, replacing the previous Polaris system.\nOpponents say the maintenance and update costs - running into billions of pounds - are excessive and that the deterrent effect of such weapons is questionable, and that is not truly independent as it relies on US technology.\nBut supporters argue that there is no alternative, and that Russia and China already have nuclear missiles, with several others attempting to develop them.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has described Trident as \"vital\" to protecting the UK."

      "text": "Former Chancellor Lord Hammond has said the government must risk unpopularity and tell \"some difficult home truths\" about the state of the economy.  \nHe told the BBC that dealing with the pandemic had been the financial equivalent of \"fighting a war\".\nBut giving money away was easier than collecting it for \"a populist government\", he added.\nA No 10 spokeswoman said she \"doesn't recognise\" his characterisation of a government reluctant to be unpopular.\nShe added that the pandemic had shown Boris Johnson was \"a prime minister that is prepared to take difficult decisions and is weighing up very hard choices at the moment\".\nThe Budget on Wednesday comes amid rising unemployment and follows the biggest UK annual economic shrinkage on record.\nIn an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Lord Hammond - who resigned as chancellor when Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019 - said the economy had taken a \"huge hit\" from Covid-19, but should \"bounce back\".\nThere had been \"long-term scarring\", with sectors like aviation and hospitality suffering \"permanent damage\", and transport and retail \"changed forever\", he added.\nOfficial figures show the UK economy contracted by 9.9% in 2020 - more than twice as much as in any previous year on record.\nOn Tuesday, it was revealed unemployment had risen to 5.1% in the three months to December - the worst rate since 2015.\nAnd the national debt - worsened by furlough, other pandemic help schemes and falling tax takes - stands at more than \u00a32 trillion.\nLord Hammond said it was unlikely in the \"foreseeable future\" that ministers would be able to \"do anything that will actually see the debt starting to fall\".\n\"But what matters is not the absolute size of the debt, but the size of the debt relative to our economy,\" he said.\n\"If we can grow the British economy over the coming years, then just as we did after the Second World War, we can make the debt fade in significance, because, although it stays the same in absolute terms, it becomes a much smaller percentage of our national economy.\"\nPhilip Hammond has never been Boris Johnson's number one fan, to put it mildly.\nThey clashed on Brexit, with the former chancellor being booted out of Parliamentary Conservative Party during the wild political autumn of 2019.\nBut even though he is back in the party fold, and with the ermine of a Tory member of the House of Lords no less, the former occupant of No 11 isn't mincing his words.\nWhile he sticks to the broad consensus backing the government's massive emergency economic support during the pandemic, Lord Hammond looks very pointedly to the challenges that will come next, questioning whether Downing Street will have the right priorities.\nHis not very subtle implication: Downing Street would rather be popular than do the right thing.\nRead more from Laura here.\nLord Hammond said the challenge facing the government was \"how to move out of this crisis period\". \nHe praised Mr Sunak for getting the economic response right so far and said he was \"very confident\" his instincts were \"the right ones\". \nBut he said his fear was \"that as a populist government, giving money away is always easier than collecting it in\", and warned that ministers had \"made very extravagant commitments to the British electorate in good faith before the coronavirus crisis\".\n\"Not all of those commitments can now sensibly be delivered on and that's going to be a big challenge for a government that regards its short-term popularity as very, very important,\" Lord Hammond added.\nHe said he was \"not sure\" the current \"top leadership\" had the \"appetite for being unpopular, in order to do the right thing\".\nThe prime minister has said the chancellor will set out the government's plans to \"build back better\" in next Wednesday's Budget. \nMr Sunak has promised to lay out the \"support we'll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery\", adding: \"I know how incredibly tough the past year has been for everyone, and every job lost is a personal tragedy.\"\nA Treasury spokesman added: \"The chancellor has always put protecting jobs and livelihoods at the heart of everything he has done and that will not change.\n\"This Budget will give people the reassurance they need in the immediate term, and he will be honest with the British people about how we are going to recover beyond this crisis.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"not the time\" for tax increases for individuals or businesses, given the ongoing impact of the pandemic.\nJames Green, who runs the Whitstable Oyster Company in Kent, says the impact of the pandemic has been \"tough\".\n\"Obviously there's Covid-19 at the beginning of the year, which affected us, the restaurant side of the business and the oyster sales. We were open over the summer. We were busy, like most coastal places, and then we shut again in November.\"\nBut Mr Green adds: \"For the oyster side of the business the impact of Brexit is probably had more of an effect than Covid-19, I would say.\"\nAs a result of Britain leaving the single market, he says he has tons of oysters sitting on his farm that he cannot sell either to France or domestically. \nMr Green says the chancellor should give the shellfish industry \"some help to get us through now - otherwise there won't be one\".

      "tags": "Companies,Online shopping,Retailing,Primark,Fashion,Coronavirus pandemic,UK High Streets",
      "text": "Fast fashion chain Primark hopes to offload millions of pounds worth of last year's clothing stock when its shops reopen in England on 12 April.\nThe High Street giant does not offer online sales and says it expects to have lost \u00a31.1bn in sales due to the latest lockdown closures.\nIt plans to sell more than \u00a3400m of last year's stock to help plug the gap.\nThe chain said its stores would also offer new ranges for all the new seasons, including this spring.\nPrimark said its 153 stores would reopen in England on 12 April, and in Scotland on 26 April.\nUnlike rivals, the retailer had no online operation to shift stock when stores were closed during lockdowns.\nBut Primark is not set up to sell online, and has said the costs involved in distribution and  sales online would mean price rises for customers. \nPrimark's \u00a31.1bn sales drop contrasts with online only fashion retailers such as Asos and Boohoo, whose sales rose by around 40% in the last four months of 2020.\nPrimark owner Associated British Foods said sales for the 24 weeks to 27 February 2021 were \u00a32.2bn, compared to \u00a33.7bn in the same period last year, as lockdowns and closures in the UK and Europe stopped people going to many High Street shops.\nIts stores have been closed in many countries across Europe, including Germany and the Netherlands.\nIt has dates for reopening shops in those countries, but still does not know when it will reopen in Wales, the Republic of Ireland and Portugal.\nHowever, it is optimistic that customers will return to all of its stores as soon as they reopen: \"We know that people will welcome us back when we reopen,\" finance chief John Bason said. \"There is pent-up demand.\"\nIt will be selling a mix of new and old lines for the remainder of the year as it plays catch-up.\nWhen stores reopen Primark expects to sell \u00a3150m of spring and summer lines that were stored in warehouses from last year. It then aims to sell \u00a3260m of autumn and winter stock such as jeans and jumpers next season.\nThis is unusual in the fashion world, where unsold stock is usually sold off in end-of-season sales, and has in the past even been burnt or sent to landfill, to make space for new ranges.\nPrimark says it does not burn or bin any unsold stock but instead normally donates it to charity.\nSophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the closures of the Primark estate were \"costing a pretty penny\".\n\"However, the retail chain is a force to be reckoned with,\" she said. \"When previous lockdowns ended we saw demand rebounded strongly.\"\nWhile sales were down 15% in the last round of reopening, which \"sounds bad\", \"in reality that's an impressive recovery when you consider people had little reason to visit the High Street, and Primark's lack of online business\".\n\"Even more importantly, so strong is the demand for Primark's clothes, excess inventory has been less of a problem during the pandemic, because more of it flies off the shelf than expected once the doors open,\" she said.\nIn the past Primark has said it won't sell online because the cost of manning the operation and processing high volumes of returns would mean it could no longer offer low prices.\nBeing in fast fashion means it has low margins, so \"they have to be very competitive on price,\" Patrick O'Brien, UK retail research director at GlobalData told the BBC in January.\nOnline players like Asos and Boohoo were \"geared up for it in terms of logistics\". \n\"But Primark would be starting from scratch, and would have to integrate any new online operation with its existing store structure which would be costly.\"\nHowever Retail Economics' Richard Lim said Primark was at risk of \"potentially alienating its customers\" who increasingly expect to be able to shop online.\nCustomers would be finding new ways of shopping with rivals, he said.\nPrimark's performance meant owner-Associated British Foods' first half sales and earnings would be lower than the previous year, the company said.\nBut Associated British Foods has a grocery division, with brands that include Kingsmill bread, Twinings tea and Ovaltine, as well as major sugar, agriculture and ingredients businesses.\nThese fared well as people stocked up during lockdown.\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: \"Primark store closures are inevitably punching a hole in profits, but the diversified nature of the business is serving AB Foods well.\n\"Changing habits arising from the pandemic have boosted other parts of the business.\""

      "tags": "Michigan,Larry Nassar sex abuse scandal,United States",
      "text": "A former US Olympics gymnastics coach has killed himself hours after he was charged with sexual assault and human trafficking, officials say.\nMichigan's attorney general confirmed the death of John Geddert, hours after outlining 24 charges against him. \nGeddert was head coach of the women's gymnastics team in 2012 and worked closely with team doctor Larry Nassar. \nNassar was sentenced to up to 300 years in jail in 2018 for abusing more than 250 girls from his position. \nThe widespread abuse revelations have caused intense scrutiny of USA Gymnastics and criticism of how it safeguards athletes.\nGeddert, 63, had owned the training facility in Michigan where Nassar had served as the gym's doctor. A number of gymnasts accused him of abusive behaviour when they testified during Nassar's trial.\nHe was expected to turn himself in on Thursday afternoon but did not appear, the attorney general's office said. \n\"My office has been notified that the body of John Geddert was found late this afternoon after taking his own life,\" Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel later said in a statement.\n\"This is a tragic end to a tragic story for everyone involved.\"\nEarlier, Ms Nessel had announced 24 separate charges against Geddert that \"focus around multiple acts of verbal, physical and sexual abuse perpetrated by the defendant against multiple young women\".\nTwo of the counts involved the alleged sexual assault of a girl between the age of 13 and 16.\nHe also faced 14 human trafficking charges for allegedly subjecting \"his athletes to forced labor or services under extreme conditions that contributed to them suffering injuries and harm\".\nGeddert \"neglected those injuries that were reported to him by the victims and used coercion, intimidation, threats and physical force to get them to perform to the standard he expected,\" the attorney general's statement said.\nA lawyer for some of Geddert's alleged victims had earlier welcomed the interpretation of human trafficking laws in the case and said it marked \"an important step in child protection\" to potentially deter similar actions by others.  \nGeddert was also accused of lying to investigators in 2016 during the probe into the allegations against Nassar.\n\"Geddert's abuse, like so much, was never a secret. EVER,\" tweeted Rachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar. \n\"We have to grapple with the reality that it was known, and no one stopped him.\"\nSarah Klein, the first known victim of Nassar, told NBC 25 News on Thursday that the abuse from Geddert was worse, describing it as \"pure trauma\".\nIn a statement, Ms Klein - who is now an attorney and advocate for victims of sexual abuse - called Geddert's death an \"escape from justice\" for \"a narcissistic abuser\".\nSara Teristi, another former gymnast who trained under Geddert, said his death \"victimised us all over again\".\n\"I am thankful that the survivors will not have to endure a lengthy and painful trial, but I am saddened that the chance to see justice served has been stolen from us,\" she said. \"We deserve better.\"\nEchoing those sentiments, a third survivor, Makayla Thrush, told Fox 2 Detroit that Geddert's passing means \"no closure for me at all\".\nIn January 2020, USA Gymnastics announced a plan to pay a $215m (\u00a3164m) settlement to the group of athletes abused by Nassar. \nUSA Gymnastics president and chief executive Li Li Leung has said they \"recognise how deeply we have broken the trust of our athletes and community, and are working hard to build that trust back\".\nBut some, including the US's most decorated gymnast, Simone Biles, believe the organisation \"has not taken full accountability for its actions\" over the scandal.\nBiles, 23, who was one of the gymnasts abused by Nassar, has called for an independent investigation.\n\"We bring them medals. We do our part. You can't do your part in return?\" she told CBS last week. \"It's just, like, it's sickening.\""

      "text": "The popular 1990s US TV shows Frasier and Rugrats are both set to be rebooted for the new Paramount+ platform.\nFrasier starred Kelsey Grammer as a pedantic psychiatrist with his own radio show.\nRugrats will go from being a cartoon to a CG animation, featuring the voices of most of the original cast.\nGrammer confirmed his show's revival saying: \"I gleefully anticipate sharing the next chapter in the continuing journey of Dr Frasier Crane.\"\nThere has been no confirmation if other members of the original cast will also return.\nThe news was announced by ViacomCBS on Wednesday as it prepares to launch the platform, which follows in the footsteps of the likes of Disney+, in the US next month.\nThere is as yet no date for a UK release for the new streaming service, although popular shows could be bought up and sold on outside the US.\nFrasier remains one of the US's most successful TV sitcoms.\nIt ran for 11 seasons - between 1993 and 2004 - and won 37 Emmy Awards, including five for best comedy series.\n\"There has long been a call from fans for its return, and that call is now answered,\" David Stapf, president of CBS Studios, said.\nNo date has been given for when audiences might expect to be able to watch it.\nDr Frasier Crane first appeared in another hit TV show, Cheers, and the spin-off series charted his return to his hometown of Seattle to care for his cranky father, played by John Mahoney who died in 2018.\nThe show also followed Frasier's relationships with his brother Niles, played by David Hyde Pierce, English housekeeper Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves), and Frasier's producer Roz Doyle, played by Peri Gilpin. \nIn January, it was announced that another hit show from the 1990s, Sex and the City, would also be returning.\nMeanwhile, the Nickelodeon children's cartoon Rugrats will be re-animated, quite literally, for the new platform.\nThe show, which ran for nine seasons, focuses on the lives of a group of toddlers. It spawned a 1998 movie, and a sequel two years later that saw the American babies head to Paris.\nThe TV series bagged four Daytime Emmy Awards and six Kids' Choice Awards during a 13-year run; and even has its own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. \nThe original characters, Tommy, Chuckie - voiced by Bart Simpson star Nancy Cartwright after Christine Cavanaugh retired in 2002 - Angelica, Susie and twins Phil and Lil will appear in the updated style later this year.\n\"Rugrats is one of the most iconic cartoons recognised by fans around the globe, and this original version is one we are taking great care and pride in creating for a brand new audience,\" said Ramsey Naito, president of Nickelodeon Animation.\nTV critic and Must Watch podcaster Scott Bryan thinks the new animated Rugrats are \"quite scary\" to be honest.\nHowever he told the BBC he understands why the new platform, which incorporates the pre-existing site CBS Access, would use such nostalgia as a jumping off point.\n\"I would say that we're having two different types of streaming wars at the moment,\" he said.\n\"There's the streaming war with new content - spending hundreds and hundreds of millions of pounds for the new shows to get people to subscribe to your service. But at the same time, there's a streaming bidding war for all of these shows that are amazingly successful because people now re-watch them time and time again, or get into them for the very first time.\"\nHe added: \"So, what has happened now is that in the US, particularly, massive amounts of money have been paid for the entire rights of, let's say Friends or Sex in the City and now Frasier, to be on their existing streaming services because they know that they will get subscribers to them.\n\"The reason why so many of these shows have been rebooted is that it's a way to get a lot of publicity because the shows are adored, but also get people to subscribe to your streaming service because it's easier, it's much more likely with an existing audience to get subscribers than it is to get a new show that might flop even if it's got big talent attached. \n\"So is it like a advertisement essentially, for what you already have, with the new episodes to provide something new.\"\nTim Glanfield, editorial director RadioTimes.com stressed there have been remakes and reboots \"for almost as long as there has been TV\", and with good cause.\n\"The reason is simple - great television is about creating characters that resonate with audiences and creating universes that viewers want to spend time within,\" he said.\nHe added that when a much-loved TV show ends, it is often \"hugely missed\".\n\"The characters are missed, the world it occupied is mourned for, a little gap is left in people's lives, and audiences often ask, 'why couldn't they have made more?'\n\"And what better way to get people talking about your new streaming service than by leaning into screen nostalgia and announcing you're bringing back a beloved TV show or spinning off a much-loved franchise for the small screen - be that the Mandalorian on Disney+, Sex and the City on HBO Max or Frasier on Paramount+.\"\n\"Such announcements are followed by many curious fans of the original, and potential subscribers to your service.\"\nViacomCBS said live-action versions of other children's TV favourites Dora The Explorer and The Fairly OddParents were also on the way.\nWhile plans are also in place for a string of new TV series for adults based on films like The Italian Job, Fatal Attraction and Flashdance.\nElsewhere, a host of classic MTV and VH1 shows - including the franchises Unplugged, Behind the Music, and Yo! MTV Raps - will be resurrected too.\n\"We are thrilled to re-invent some of our most storied and impactful music franchises,\" said Viacom music president, Bruce Gilmer.\n\"In addition, we will partner with some of the biggest names across the music industry to bring exclusive and unique content to the platform, such as Dave Grohl's Cradle to Stage based on his mom's critically-acclaimed book, and many more to come.\"\nDetails of a Yellowstone prequel, Y:1883, as well as a spin-off, called 6666, were also included in the announcement, along with the return of Inside Amy Schumer, with five specials starring the stand-up comedian, actor and director.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "A Covid outbreak has hit five adult wards at a north Wales hospital.\nYsbyty Gwynedd, in Bangor, said 49 of the 75 coronavirus patients being treated are linked to the outbreak. \nThe hospital's medical director Dr Karen Mottart said testing had begun for staff and patients.\n\"As we continue with a programme of additional testing, we expect to find more cases in patients and staff who are not currently symptomatic,\" she said.\nDr Mottart added: \"This approach will help us build an accurate picture of the current situation, enabling us to safely manage patients and prevent any unknown potential transmission.\"\nShe said new variants are more transmissible and more patients have recently been admitted to the hospital than at any time during the pandemic.\n\"A significant risk is that a patient can test negative for Covid-19 while the virus is in its incubation period, and then test positive after being admitted to hospital,\" Dr Mottart added.\n\"All hospitals face the challenge of balancing the risk of infection while providing care for those who need it.\"\nShe asked people to help reduce the risk of transmission by only visiting hospitals when it is \"absolutely necessary\".\nThe area has some of the highest case rates in Wales - with 94.7 per 100,000 people in Gwynedd and 112.8 per 100,000 in neighbouring Anglesey. \nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said he was \"anxious to hear\" about the outbreak. \nThe MS for Anglesey added: \"It is yet another demonstration of the contagious nature of the virus around us and the need to take firm measures to bring down numbers. \n\"It also shows how easily pressure can mount on health and care services that are already under great strain.\""

      "tags": "Rhondda,Skewen,Merthyr Tydfil,Bridgend,Welsh government,Abertridwr,Mining,Caerphilly County Borough Council,Coal mining",
      "text": "Almost 300 old coal tips in Wales have been classed as \"high-risk\" a year on from a 60,000 tonne landslip caused by Storm Dennis.\nThe matter was discussed at a Welsh Government summit on mine safety on Tuesday.\nWales has more than 2,000 coal tips. Most are on private land and most are around the south Wales valleys.\nOf those, 294 are categorised as \"high-risk\", meaning they could endanger life or property.\nSeventy are in Caerphilly, 64 in Rhondda Cynon Taf, 59 in Merthyr Tydfil, 42 in Bridgend, 35 in Neath Port Talbot, 16 in Blaenau Gwent and eight in Swansea.\nThe landslip last year was at Tylorstown, in Rhondda. Since it happened, work has been done to map tips and assess their stability. \nThe Welsh and UK governments, the Coal Authority, local councils and other bodies have been examining the problem.\nTheir investigation has concluded current legislation surrounding tips is \"neither sufficiently robust or fit for purpose in relation to inspection and maintenance\".\nCoal Authority chief executive, Lisa Pinney, said managing tips on hillsides was key to reducing risk to communities.\n\"Just under 300 are higher-risk sites but that really just means that they needed much more regular attention and inspection to make sure they stay safe,\" she said.\nShe said when there were concerns, action would be taken. \n\"Any tip which is old mining material sitting on a hillside can pose a risk, obviously, but the key thing to their safety is to manage water and keep it away,\" said Ms Pinney.\n\"And that's why these inspections and maintenance are so important.\"\nNo-one was hurt in the Tylorstown landslip and work is under way to secure the hillside.\nRhondda MP Chris Bryant said funding was essential.\n\"It's shocking that no proper register of disused coal tips was made when the mines closed, so this work is long overdue,\" he said. \n\"With so many on private land this is going to be a massive and complex piece of work in which Parliament and Senedd must work together.\n\"My biggest fear is [Chancellor] Rishi Sunak will demand that local councils pay for this out of their council tax but the poorest communities in the UK should not be forced to pay for tidying up our national industrial heritage.\"\nPlaid Cymru Member of the Senedd for Rhondda Leanne Wood said the UK government should foot the full bill for making the tips safe and anything less would be \"unacceptable\".\n\"When the profits from coal mining were not seen in Rhondda, nor in many other coalfield areas across Wales, coupled with the high cost to health and lives of the workers and their families, that funding and more is owed to us,\" she said.\nWelsh Conservative Janet Finch-Saunders said long-term work to make the tips safe could only be done in partnership with the UK government.\nCoalfield historian Ben Curtis said some tips were removed or made safe after the Aberfan disaster in 1966. \n\"But it is a potential problem that continues to remain for some of these tips to become unsafe over time, perhaps [because of] factors like the effects of climate change and increased rainfall,\" he said.\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"Ever since the devastating storms of early 2020, the UK government has been working with the Welsh Government on its devolved responsibility to provide extra support for flood relief and protection to the communities which were so badly affected.\n\"In December we confirmed that \u00a331m would be provided for this vital work, of which \u00a39m was to repair vulnerable coal tips.\n\"We also provided the Welsh Government with an additional \u00a31.3bn for next year at the recent spending review so they are well placed to continue this work\"\nThe summit - which was held virtually - was also due to discuss wider issues of mine safety after water escaped after building up in a mine shaft in Skewen, Neath Port Talbot, flooding nearby homes in January.\n\"The coal tip is made up of what we call unconsolidated materials so this is loose material like grains of sugar, all stacked up on top of each other,\" Ashley Patton, an engineering geologist from the British Geological Survey said. \nShe told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: \"When it gets to a certain angle it can make it unsafe and then when you get triggering factors, such as water from a spring line or from heavy rain that we've seen quite a lot of in south Wales, it can just make it destabilise.\n\"The main problem with south Wales is you've got lots of steep-sided valleys and then if you're going to put coal spoil on top of those steep slopes that's just going to make it more likely that it's going to fail...\n\"The most important thing is to take what we call the angle of friction so you're looking at what is the perfect angle for that material - so if you can cut it back to a shallower angle... generally speaking, it could be quite stable, and of course the other important thing is to make sure that the slopes are not sited on any spring lines or areas where farmers are putting water onto the slopes.\""

      "tags": "Tourism,Austria,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Greece,Coronavirus vaccines,European Union",
      "text": "Greece and Austria are urging other EU states to adopt coronavirus vaccination \"passports\" which could help revive Europe's stricken tourist industry.\nThe idea of such a document, likely to be a certificate, would be to permit those who have been vaccinated to travel freely within the EU.\nThe proposal was put forward during a virtual discussion between EU leaders. \nBut a vaccine passport faces opposition from some of the bloc's 27 member states.\nFrance and Germany say such documents could be premature because data on the efficacy of vaccines in preventing a person from carrying or passing on the virus is incomplete. \nThere are also concerns that enabling a vaccinated minority to enjoy foreign travel while others, such as young people who are not seen as a priority for inoculation, continue to face restrictions would be discriminatory. \nA further complication is the rapid spread of more contagious Covid variants - the English, South African and Brazilian forms - and the possibility of future mutations. So it is more likely that people will need booster jabs to remain protected.\nGreece - as well as Israel - already has digital vaccination certificates, and others such as Denmark and Sweden have talked about developing them. \nGreek Deputy Prime Minister Akis Skertsos told the BBC that a common digital certificate \"is not discriminatory at all\". He argued that non-vaccinated tourists could also visit Greece this summer, but the procedure for them would be slower - they would have to be tested and might have to self-isolate on arrival.\nGreece and Cyprus have agreed to admit Covid-negative Israeli tourists this summer - those who can prove their status with the Israeli \"green\" digital certificate. \nGreek Tourism Minister Harry Theocharis said a similar deal could be reached with the UK. However, the UK government has not yet approved any vaccination certificate, nor has it given the go-ahead for foreign holidays.\nGreek tourism slumped disastrously last year because of the pandemic. Its revenues fell to \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.5bn; $5bn), from \u20ac18bn in 2019, Reuters news agency reports. Tourism makes up about a fifth of the Greek economy, employing one in five workers. \nAustrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz tweeted that \"we're advocating a digital Green Pass, like Israel's\". \n\"That should allow you to prove, on your mobile phone, that you've been tested, inoculated or have recovered [from Covid]. Our goal: to avoid a lengthy lockdown and finally enable freedom to travel again in the EU, and freedom to enjoy events and cuisine.\"\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said it would take three months to set up a data system for use at the borders and in national healthcare systems, but that most countries agreed that \"a digital vaccination certificate\" could be necessary in the future.\nAs some EU countries now struggle with a third wave of the virus there are tensions over unilateral border restrictions. Germany is the latest to have received a complaint from the European Commission, since it imposed new police checks on the Czech and Austrian borders.\nDuring the virtual meeting on Thursday, EU leaders also discussed how to address concerns over the slow vaccine rollout that has been widely criticised.\nThe Commission - the EU executive - has been under fire over its vaccine procurement strategy. It got into a row with AstraZeneca, because the Anglo-Swedish drug firm fell far short of the first-quarter delivery target.\nSome member states have also implied that the AstraZeneca vaccine is somehow inferior to others - French President Emmanuel Macron said at one point that it might be \"quasi-ineffective\" in the over 65s, without offering any evidence.\nThis has reportedly led to issues of authorities in some countries, such as Italy, reluctant to use supplies of the drug.\nThe Commission still aims to get at least 70% of adults vaccinated in the bloc by mid-September. But so far, the total vaccinated is below 10%.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she felt assured that the target would be met. \"These are 255 million people in the European Union, and if we look at the planned figures, this is a goal we are confident we'll reach,\" she said. \nThe EU is desperately seeking ways to increase vaccine supplies and improve its ability to track new variants, BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly reports. But it is pursuing policies that might pay off in months or years, when voters want answers in days or weeks, he says.  "

      "tags": "Bowel cancer,Cancer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Almost half of people with potential cancer symptoms did not contact their GP during the first wave of the pandemic, a survey suggests.\nSymptoms left unchecked included coughing up blood, lumps and changes to the appearance of moles.\nNHS figures showed a fall in referrals to cancer services last spring.\nBut this study, of almost 8,000 people, captures the fall in people contacting their GP in the first place.\nThe team that carried out the study, from Cardiff University and Cancer Research UK, said this raised concerns that people could be diagnosed later - and so be less likely to be treated successfully and recover.\nThey surveyed a representative sample of people across the UK recruited from two panels - HealthWise Wales and Cancer Research UK's Cancer Awareness Measure - between March and August 2020.\nThe team found that of the 3,025 people who said they had experienced at least one symptom which could be a warning sign of cancer, 45% did not seek help.\nThey also found that:\nSome of the reasons given by people who did not contact their GP were not wanting to waste doctors' time or put extra strain on the NHS; not wanting to be seen as someone who made a fuss; and fear of catching Covid at appointments. \nBut people who did contact their GP reported feeling \"safe\" and \"secure\" when attending face-to-face appointments. \nWhile the first lockdown saw NHS services significantly reduced, this was not as true during the second wave of the UK's epidemic. \nThe Cardiff and Cancer Research team plan to run another round of the survey to see whether people's likelihood to contact their GP changed in the later part of 2020.\nMatt Black, 55, went to his GP after persuasion from his wife. He had been experiencing flu-like symptoms, stomach problems and unexplained weight loss but believed his symptoms were linked to Covid-19.\nIt was only after visiting the Royal Free Hospital in north London, having lost more than 10kg (22lb) in weeks, that a tumour 9cm (3.5in) long was discovered in his bowel.\nMr Black said Covid had \"delayed\" his decision to seek help, since he was \"worried about being a drain on resources\".\nHe added that \"there was so much confusion about what Covid symptoms were at that time\" that he assumed what he was experiencing must be related to the virus. \nMr Black wanted to send a message to others to not \"just think it will go away - if you've got a problem, a symptom, get it checked out\". \nMonths on and he said he felt like the \"luckiest guy in the world...I'm running, I'm walking, I'm working\". \nProf Kate Brain, who led the study, said she was concerned that the message during the first lockdown, to protect the NHS, might have left the public might thinking \"cancer can wait\".\nIn the first months of the pandemic, people were broadly discouraged from using health services, and many screening services were shut down. \nBut from last summer onwards, and during the second wave of infections, huge efforts were put into keeping NHS services running.\nPeople were encouraged to come forward with any health concerns, especially symptoms which could be cancer-related. \nWhile it's been well-reported that cancer screenings and referrals for treatment have fallen, Prof Brain said this was the first population study to assess people's \"attitude and behaviour towards cancer symptoms and screening\".\nThe message to the public was that \"the NHS is open safely,\" Prof Brain said.\nAnd she called for a concerted national campaign to encourage people to contact their GPs with urgent issues.

This would mean the loss of 800 jobs.\nIt also plans to change about 1,100 store management roles, although it insists that this will mean an increase in jobs overall.\nAsda chief executive Roger Burnley said: \"The pandemic has accelerated change across the retail sector especially the shift towards grocery home shopping and our priority is to serve customers in the way they want to shop with us. \n\"The last 12 months have shown us that businesses have to be prepared to adapt quickly to change and I am incredibly proud of the way we demonstrated our agility and resilience through the pandemic.\"\nPeople close to the business insist that the move is led by a change in demand from shoppers rather than a cost-cutting drive, and point to the 4,500 new jobs being created as order pickers and delivery drivers.\nThe company can handle 90% more online orders compared to a year ago.\nAsda says it hopes many of those at risk can be moved to the new jobs and that the actual number of workers leaving the business will be lower. \nOne store manager, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, told the BBC the proposed job cuts would \"pile more pressure and stress on an already stretched workforce\" and described scenes of upset in their store. \nAsda was recently purchased by billionaire brothers Zuber and Mohsin Issa and private equity firm TDR Capital, in a deal valuing it at \u00a36.8bn, funded largely with debt.\nThe deal came after a failed attempt at merging with rival Sainsbury's.\n\"Asda workers have had a torrid two years,\" Roger Jenkins, national officer for the GMB union said.\n\"The failed Sainsbury's takeover, twelve months working on the pandemic frontline and now the uncertainty of a new take over, sidling the company with huge debts and potential sell offs. \n\"This is the last thing they need.\"\nThe union said the company is profitable and does not need to enforce redundancies."

A-level results day will be 10 August, with GCSE results given out on 12 August.\nBut concerns have been raised that the measures will result in grade inflation.\nOn a visit to Accrington Academy in Lancashire earlier, Mr Johnson said exams would have continued normally in an \"ideal world\". \n\"But I think this is as good a compromise as we can come to.\n\"I think it will be fair, I think it will be durable and it's the right way forward.\"\nAsked if he had confidence in Education Secretary Gavin Williamson amid speculation he will be moved out of the position in an upcoming reshuffle, Mr Johnson said: \"Of course.\"\nLast summer, thousands of A-level students had their results downgraded from school estimates by a controversial algorithm, before Ofqual announced a U-turn which allowed them to use teachers' predictions instead.\nMr Halfon said school-assessed grades were the \"least worst option that the government has come up with\" but it risked \"baking a rock cake of grade inflation into the system\".\n\"So will (Gavin Williamson) confirm what is the government's plan to ensure we will not have a wild west of grading, that these grades will be meaningful to employers so as not to damage children's life chances and when?\"\nMr Williamson said grade inflation was an \"important issue\" but it was being addressed through internal and external checks, and exam boards would be able to \"root out malpractice\".\nAddressing the Commons about the plans, he said: \"Ultimately, this summer's assessments will ensure fair routes to the next stages of education or the start of their career. That is our overall aim.\" \nDuring last year's exam protests there were banners saying \"trust in teachers\".\nThis is certainly the case this year, with teachers being given a remarkable amount of flexibility over how they will decide this summer's A-level and GCSE results.\nBefore the pandemic disrupted exams, there was control freakery over how grades were shared out. \nNow it's going to be left to teachers' professional judgement, with no limits on grades or anchoring to previous years' results.\nIt's the free jazz of exam systems.\nDepending on your perspective, that's either a liberating outbreak of trust in teachers, or else it's going to mean headlines about \"Exam Chaos 2\" and massive grade inflation.\nEven the test papers being sent out by exam boards are optional and they won't be taken in exam halls or against the clock.\nThe only people with exam nerves are going to be the publishers of revision guides.\nThis is going to be another unpredictable year for exams.\nIt could be a chance for teachers to show how an assessment system can work without huge layers of bureaucracy. \nAnd Education Secretary Gavin Williamson will be desperately hoping it's less disastrous than last year.\nOr it could become blighted with worries about whether some schools are awarding grades that are much more generous than others, sparking waves of angry appeals.\nBut the exam season for 2021 is getting under way. So turn over your papers and begin. Or don't if you don't want to.\nThere will be no fixed share of grades and schools will not be expected to keep in line with last year's results or any earlier year.\nThe Education Policy Institute think tank has warned the plans for this year risk \"extremely high grade inflation\".\nBut Ofqual's interim chief regulator of exams, Simon Lebus, said he did not expect \"a huge amount\" of grade inflation.\n\"Giving proper weight to teacher judgements is the best way of approaching a very difficult situation,\" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, adding that there was \"no reason to assume [teachers'] results won't be accurate\".\nScotland,Wales and Northern Ireland have already announced that exams will be replaced by teacher-assessed grades.\nCaitlin Orsborn, an A-level student from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, said she and her friends were \"relieved\" teachers would decide their grades.\nThe 18-year-old says: \"We're all relieved this morning because we have been working towards nothing for two months.\"\nShe believes teacher-awarded results are the \"best way\" for students to be graded this year, explaining that \"being in and out of school so sporadically has really affected so many students' level of work and mental health\".\n\"So to make exams compulsory, in my eyes, was never a good idea,\" she adds.\nRead more about what students make of the plan\nThe Education Policy Institute warned of a \"high risk of inconsistencies\" between schools - and if there are large numbers of successful appeals or widespread grade inflation it could be difficult for universities and employers to distinguish between applicants.\nBut the ASCL head teachers' union supported giving schools \"flexibility over the assessments they use\". While the National Education Union said it was probably the \"least worst option available\".\nParenting charity Parentkind said \"teacher assessment is, under the circumstances, the fairest way to test pupils\".\nLabour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said delays to deciding a replacement for exams had \"created needless stress for pupils, parents and teachers\".\nAre you a teacher or a student?

      "tags": "Companies,Online shopping,Retailing,Primark,Fashion,Coronavirus pandemic,UK High Streets",
      "text": "Fast fashion chain Primark hopes to offload millions of pounds worth of last year's clothing stock when its shops reopen in England on 12 April.\nThe High Street giant does not offer online sales and says it expects to have lost \u00a31.1bn in sales due to the latest lockdown closures.\nIt plans to sell more than \u00a3400m of last year's stock to help plug the gap.\nThe chain said its stores would also offer new ranges for all the new seasons, including this spring.\nPrimark said its 153 stores would reopen in England on 12 April, and in Scotland on 26 April.\nUnlike rivals, the retailer had no online operation to shift stock when stores were closed during lockdowns.\nBut Primark is not set up to sell online, and has said the costs involved in distribution and  sales online would mean price rises for customers. \nPrimark's \u00a31.1bn sales drop contrasts with online only fashion retailers such as Asos and Boohoo, whose sales rose by around 40% in the last four months of 2020.\nPrimark owner Associated British Foods said sales for the 24 weeks to 27 February 2021 were \u00a32.2bn, compared to \u00a33.7bn in the same period last year, as lockdowns and closures in the UK and Europe stopped people going to many High Street shops.\nIts stores have been closed in many countries across Europe, including Germany and the Netherlands.\nIt has dates for reopening shops in those countries, but still does not know when it will reopen in Wales, the Republic of Ireland and Portugal.\nHowever, it is optimistic that customers will return to all of its stores as soon as they reopen: \"We know that people will welcome us back when we reopen,\" finance chief John Bason said. \"There is pent-up demand.\"\nIt will be selling a mix of new and old lines for the remainder of the year as it plays catch-up.\nWhen stores reopen Primark expects to sell \u00a3150m of spring and summer lines that were stored in warehouses from last year. It then aims to sell \u00a3260m of autumn and winter stock such as jeans and jumpers next season.\nThis is unusual in the fashion world, where unsold stock is usually sold off in end-of-season sales, and has in the past even been burnt or sent to landfill, to make space for new ranges.\nPrimark says it does not burn or bin any unsold stock but instead normally donates it to charity.\nSophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the closures of the Primark estate were \"costing a pretty penny\".\n\"However, the retail chain is a force to be reckoned with,\" she said. \"When previous lockdowns ended we saw demand rebounded strongly.\"\nWhile sales were down 15% in the last round of reopening, which \"sounds bad\", \"in reality that's an impressive recovery when you consider people had little reason to visit the High Street, and Primark's lack of online business\".\n\"Even more importantly, so strong is the demand for Primark's clothes, excess inventory has been less of a problem during the pandemic, because more of it flies off the shelf than expected once the doors open,\" she said.\nIn the past Primark has said it won't sell online because the cost of manning the operation and processing high volumes of returns would mean it could no longer offer low prices.\nBeing in fast fashion means it has low margins, so \"they have to be very competitive on price,\" Patrick O'Brien, UK retail research director at GlobalData told the BBC in January.\nOnline players like Asos and Boohoo were \"geared up for it in terms of logistics\". \n\"But Primark would be starting from scratch, and would have to integrate any new online operation with its existing store structure which would be costly.\"\nHowever Retail Economics' Richard Lim said Primark was at risk of \"potentially alienating its customers\" who increasingly expect to be able to shop online.\nCustomers would be finding new ways of shopping with rivals, he said.\nPrimark's performance meant owner-Associated British Foods' first half sales and earnings would be lower than the previous year, the company said.\nBut Associated British Foods has a grocery division, with brands that include Kingsmill bread, Twinings tea and Ovaltine, as well as major sugar, agriculture and ingredients businesses.\nThese fared well as people stocked up during lockdown.\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: \"Primark store closures are inevitably punching a hole in profits, but the diversified nature of the business is serving AB Foods well.\n\"Changing habits arising from the pandemic have boosted other parts of the business.\""

      "text": "Two seven-year-old boys who set up a lemonade stand to raise money for those affected by the Yemen crisis have been awarded Gold Blue Peter badges.\nAyaan and Mikaeel's stand raised \u00a3100,000 for children living in the war-torn country.\nThe best friends will feature on Blue Peter's Gold badge special show alongside other children who have \"achieved incredible things\".\nReceiving the award earlier, the boys said it was \"the best day ever\".\nAyaan and Mikaeel, from Redbridge in east London, set a target to raise \u00a3500 but by the end of their first day had raised \u00a35,000.\nThey went on to receive a donation from Oscar-winning actor and campaigner Angelina Jolie.\nAyaan's mum Adeela said she was \"extremely proud\" of her son and his friend.  \n\"It is something we started in the midst of lockdown as we wanted to teach them a lesson of charity,\" she said.\n\"We definitely didn't expect a letter and a donation from Angelina Jolie. It's just nice to see someone of her celebrity status recognising what the boys were doing and realising we are all on the same page.\"\nOnly a small number of gold badges are awarded each year, to people who have inspired a nation, saved a life or who have shown bravery and courage.\nPrevious recipients of the gold badge include the Queen, Sir David Attenborough, TV cook Dame Mary Berry, footballer Raheem Sterling and fellow fundraiser Captain Sir Tom Moore.\nIn a special message to the boys, rapper Stormzy said: \"I have heard about your incredible lemonade stand and all the amazing work you guys have done. I was blown away. \n\"You are a pair of little legends. Wear it with pride because you deserve it.\"\nFootballer Marcus Rashford, who successfully lobbied the UK government into a U-turn over its free school meals policy in England, has also received a badge as has Greta Thunberg.\nBlue Peter editor Ellen Evans said: \"Each year only a few gold badges are awarded to our amazing audience who have shown outstanding bravery, overcome adversity and achieved the most brilliant things.\n\"It's so difficult to choose who is awarded a badge and I hope that [the children who received badges] inspire others with their stories, as both Greta and Marcus have done.\""

      "tags": "Tourism,Companies,Travel,Travel & leisure industry,Airbnb,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Online booking platform Airbnb has said it is preparing for a \"significant\" travel rebound as the world emerges from coronavirus lockdowns.\nHowever the company said it was still \"too early\" to predict how the business would fare this year.\nThe company's revenue dropped 30% last year to $3.4bn (\u00a32.4bn), as Covid-19 restrictions kept many from travelling.\nThat was better than many other travel companies, as people took to their cars for longer stays in private homes.\nThe firm said it has already seen a smaller decline in travel this year than in the last three months of 2020, when revenue was down 22% year-on-year at $859m. That was better than many analysts had expected,given the resurgence of Covid cases and fresh lockdown restrictions in many areas.\n\"Travel is coming back and we are laser-focused on preparing for the travel rebound,\" its chief executive Brian Chesky said.\nMr Chesky said he expected new travel preferences to emerge from the pandemic that will benefit his company.\nHe said the firm is optimistic that staying in private homes will appeal to people travelling to see family and friends. Remote working patterns will also allow people to take more frequent weekend trips - or even spend several months away from home, he suggested.\n\"We've\u00a0seen a number of new use cases,\" he said. \"We don't think we're ever going to go back to travel in 2019. It's going to change and it's going to be different.\"\nHowever, Airbnb also warned that it still had \"limited visibility for growth trends in 2021 given the difficulty in determining the pace of vaccine rollouts and the related impact on willingness to travel\".\n\"We are not providing an outlook for the rest of 2021 at this time,\" it said in its first financial update for investors since its public listing in December.\nAirbnb, which is active in more than 220 countries, said people around the world are travelling more domestically during the pandemic - but not enough to make up for the loss of business from international tourism.\nIts business in Europe, which is fuelled by cross-border travel, was the hardest hit region in 2020, especially the UK, Germany and Italy. North America was the most stable.\nOverall the firm lost $4.6bn last year, including $3.9bn in the last three months of the year, when it was hit with high costs connected with its stock market debut.\nA recent survey conducted for the company in the US found that more than half of about 1,000 respondents had already booked or were planning to travel this year.\nOn a call with analysts, the firm faced some questions about its relationships with hosts, which has been strained this year partly due to financial losses suffered after cancellations.\nBut Angelo Zino, an equity analyst at CFRA, said he expected revenue to come \"roaring back\" as vaccines become widely distributed in the US and Europe by the summer, \"reflecting the enormous amount of pent-up demand in the ecosystem\". \n\"We believe Airbnb's business model and growth opportunities are highly attractive and struggle to find a better way to play the travel space,\" he said."

      "tags": "Commuting,Network Rail,Department for Transport,Rail travel",
      "text": "Around 10% fewer train services should run once the country opens up again, compared to the pre-pandemic timetable, the chairman of Network Rail has said.\nThe old pattern of five days of peak commuter travel may not return, Sir Peter Hendy warned the National Rail Recovery conference.\nInstead, leisure travel might boost weekend traffic, especially if limits on international travel continue.\nCommuter traffic could return to 80% of pre-pandemic levels, he suggested.\n\"The service doesn't run better if you put too many trains on the track. We've proved that,\" said Sir Peter.\n\"You shouldn't try to get more out of the infrastructure than it can give you. All of my experience is that people prefer reliability to journey time.\"\nPassenger numbers fell precipitously in March when the pandemic struck and have only partially recovered since. Many commuters are working from home and some businesses remain closed. \nThe government's timetable foresees a gradual opening up of the economy over the coming months. However, some firms have already signalled some workers may continue to work from home for some of their working week.\nSir Peter said commuter traffic on the railways could remain at around 80% for the next one to three years, although he said that Network Rail, which manages the UK's rail infrastructure, were also looking at a range of possibilities between 60% and100%.\nHe warned that the working week could change so dramatically that commuter routes may only see one peak day a week and that ticketing options should be looked at to even out the service.\nLeisure visits to family or for recreation could boost passenger numbers on summer weekends, he suggested.\n\"I used to watch the trains to the Cornish Riviera from Paddington and it was packed and we might need to get used to that again,' he told the conference.\n\"If Saturday and Sunday get busy in the summer we need to do engineering work at other times.\"\nRail Minister Chris Heaton-Harris also acknowledged that commuting was not going to return to previous levels quickly.\n\"We are not going back to before - this is the new normal. We now need to fundamentally change,\" he said. Without a concerted cross-industry effort passengers might not return, he added.\nIn December, the government said it was \"committed to providing a more flexible, modern ticketing system for passengers\" and asked rail operators to develop flexible season tickets.\nWhen many commuters travelled to work four or five days a week, a season ticket provided value for money. Part-time commuters currently face a much higher price per journey.\nThe Department for Transport expects flexible season tickets to be introduced across England later this year, which could save commuters \"hundreds of pounds\".\nMr Heaton-Harris said during the pandemic passenger numbers fell to levels \"not seen since the 19th Century\" but everyone would work hard to restore business, and ensure a safe and clean network. He said this would require a \"coherent approach, [where] innovation is needed more than ever\".\nKeith Williams, whose much anticipated rail review is expected to be published soon, described the pandemic as a \"Black Swan\" event for the rail industry. The review had been due for release shortly before the pandemic began and has now been updated."

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has set out Scotland's \"cautious\" route out of lockdown and her approach over the next few months will be guided by six tests, including evidence that the epidemic in Scotland is controlled.\nUsing a system outlined by the World Health Organization (WHO), what can we tell about the state of Scotland's Covid-19 epidemic?\nWhen it comes to judging the level of Covid-19 transmission within a community, the WHO uses a seven tier scale ranging from \"no active cases\", all the way up to a \"very high incidence of locally-acquired cases\" that are also \"widely dispersed\".\nThe Scottish government has previously indicated it wants to get a \"moderate\" level of community transmission before significantly relaxing any restrictions.\nSo how far away is Scotland from this goal?\nThe WHO advises governments to look at their weekly confirmed cases per 100,000 people and then average the figure out over a 14-day period.\nBy this measure, Scotland had a rate of 105 cases per 100,000 on 24 February.\nThis puts the country firmly in the middle of the WHO's CT3 level - a high incidence of community transmission - and well above the \"moderate\" threshold.\nThere's been a sustained fall in this figure since the middle of January, but the decline does now appear to be slowing.\nThe last time Scotland was below 50 cases per 100,000 was at the beginning of October.\nIt's difficult to compare this rate with the first outbreak in the spring as there was no mass testing earlier in the pandemic.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe 14-day average on 24 February was 5.2% - still in the \"high incidence\" category, but only just above the 5% threshold for \"moderate\" incidence.\nIt's worth pointing out that WHO's preferred way of measuring positivity is through \"sentinel surveillance\", or random community testing, which is not how the Scottish government measures it.\nHowever, the organisation lists overall test positivity as an additional measure if a comprehensive testing system is in place.\nThe WHO says governments should look at the number of weekly deaths \"attributed\" to Covid-19 per 100,000 people and average them out over 14 days.\nAccording to this measure, Scotland experienced \"very high\" levels of community transmission from 15 January.\nThe rate reached a peak on 3 February and has now gone below the threshold that indicates a \"high\" incidence of transmission.\nA death rate of two per 100,000 people or less needs to be achieved to indicate \"moderate\" levels.\nThis chart counts deaths in Scotland within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19. If the wider definition of all death certificates mentioning the virus were used, the rate would be slightly higher.\nThe full lockdown in the spring ended on 28 May, although the easing of restrictions was phased over several weeks during the summer.\nFigures on Covid-19 hospital admissions are currently available up to 18 February, when the 14-day average of weekly admissions was 11.4.\nThis figure has more than halved over the last month.\nThe rate is still in the WHO's \"high\" level, but it's close to the threshold of 10 cases per 100,00, indicating a \"moderate\" level of transmission.\nThe WHO use a risk uses something called a \"risk matrix\" which factors in both the state of an epidemic in a country and the local capacity to respond to the outbreak.\nSo for instance, if Covid transmission is at a moderate level, but there is very limited testing or hospital capacity, then the risk may still be high.\nAt the highest level, the WHO considers the epidemic \"uncontrolled\", with an overwhelmed healthcare system and deaths spiralling.\nIf Scotland's response can currently be judged as \"adequate\" that would put the country in roughly the middle of the risk scale. \nThis is where the organisation recommends that schools and businesses can open up, with limits remaining on social and mass gatherings and home working still encouraged.\nBut given the recent high case and death rates, it's likely Scotland was closer to the top end of the risk scale in January and early February.\nWith signs that the decline in cases is now slowing, this may have helped persuade the first minister to choose a slow and cautious route out of lockdown.\nSo far, 1,515,980 people in Scotland have received their first dose of either the Pfizer or Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, which is about a third of the population aged 16 and over.\nAnd the good news is there are early signs that even just receiving the first dose has a significant impact on preventing serious illness.\nMs Sturgeon says the aim is to have everyone in this group offered a first dose of the vaccine by the end of July.\nBut crucially good progress is also being made vaccinating the highest risk groups in Scotland - those who are most likely to become seriously ill or die with Covid-19.\nThe priority groups were set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\nThe virus was suppressed to low levels in the summer entirely through public health and social restrictions because there was no vaccine.\nThis time the vaccine could be a useful tool if the Scottish government does want to take more risks and begin to open the country up faster.\nBut for now there's every sign the government will stay on its \"deliberately cautious\" path, allowing the level of risk to drop to the lower end of the WHO's scale."

There have been several cases, around the United States, sometimes involving violent assaults on their owners, where the animals have been stolen. \nIn January, a woman in San Francisco was attacked at gunpoint by three men who escaped with her five-month-old puppy. \nFrench bulldogs are hugely popular and in much demand, but they are notoriously difficult to breed. They require artificial insemination and the physical characteristics of the dog - a large head and shoulders - mean they usually have to be delivered by Caesarean section. \nThe breeding costs explain the price tag of a puppy, which can range from $2,000-$10,000.\nLos Angeles Police Department confirmed that they are searching for a man who \"fired a gunshot from an unknown location and struck the victim\" on North Sierra Bonita Avenue at 21:40 on Wednesday.\nA \"possible suspect\" fled the scene in a white vehicle towards Hollywood Boulevard, they added.\nIt is not clear whether Lady Gaga's dogs were specifically targeted in the attack.\nGaga is known to be extremely protective of her dogs, who have accompanied her to the American Music Awards and her 2017 Super Bowl Halftime show.\nMiss Asia even has an official Instagram account. \nYou may be interested in watching:\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

That is why the charity collapsed.\"\nThe Official Receiver (OR) brought High Court proceedings against Ms Batmanghelidjh and the former trustees, arguing they were \"unfit\" to hold directorships because of their handling of the charity.\nBut, in a ruling on February 12, Mrs Justice Falk rejected the case and said the charity may have survived financially to continue its work had it not closed.\nA statement issued after the ruling on behalf of the former trustees said: \"Kids Company was forced to close in August 2015 following what the judge records as 'unfounded allegations' of child abuse, which made fundraising from private and government sources impossible.\n\"We are pleased that finally the facts have been gathered and assessed in a court of law, and that Mrs Justice Falk has exonerated both the former trustees and Kids Company chief executive Camila Batmanghelidjh.\"\nFounded in 1996 in south London, Kids Company provided practical, emotional and educational support to up to 36,000 deprived and vulnerable inner-city children and young people.\nIt employed more than 600 people, with high-profile supporters including the then prime minister David Cameron.\nYou can listen to the full Woman's Hour interview here."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "First Minister Arlene Foster has said she has \"full confidence\" in NI Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride.\nIt comes after her party, the DUP, said health officials had been \"overcautious\" in recommending a phased return of NI schools.\nThe DUP had called for the executive to revisit the plan but Dr McBride said the medical evidence had not changed.\nHealth and education officials are to work together on further timelines for the return of all pupils to classrooms.\nOn Thursday, DUP Education Minister Peter Weir said his preferred option had been a full return to school on 8 March, and that he \"wanted answers\" from Dr McBride about why his advice remained against that.\nAll schools in England are to reopen on 8 March, but only a small number of pre-school, nursery and primary pupils will return in NI on that date.\nMr Weir said he did not want NI to be \"out of sync\" with the rest of the UK or \"second-class citizens\".\nHe said NI was in a similar position to England and it was therefore \"hard to square the circle of Michael McBride and Chris Whitty being on the same page,\" considering the medical advice on reopening schools was different in the two jurisdictions.\nEast Antrim DUP MP Sammy Wilson also criticised health officials on Thursday, comparing Health Minister Robin Swann to \"a poodle for an unaccountable chief medical officer\". \nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was \"disrespectful\" and \"disgraceful\".\nMrs Foster said \"sometimes tweets would be better to be typed out and then deleted\", adding it was not language she would have used.\nAsked whether Dr McBride still had her support, Mrs Foster said he \"absolutely\" did.\n\"He has worked tirelessly, as indeed has the chief scientific adviser and deputy to bring us impartial advice and that's the key - impartial advice - then we as politicians have to decide on the best way forward.\n\"So absolutely Michael retains and will have my full confidence and that of my party.\" \nThere have been no changes to the staggered approach, initially agreed by the executive last week.\nBut Mrs Foster said health and education officials will work together on further timelines for the return of all pupils to classrooms.\nShe said ministers indicated a desire at Thursday's meeting to avoid primary one to primary three pupils, who are due to return on 8 March, having to \"revert back\" to remote learning for a week from 22 March.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said all ministers also recognised that it was important to get students back to classrooms quickly - but safely. \nUnder the current timetable, only pre-school, nursery and pupils in primaries one to three will return to classrooms in Northern Ireland on 8 March. After two weeks, they will resume remote learning so older pupils in years 12 to 14 can go back to school.\nIt looks pretty clear that at least part of the executive's plan is going to change, for the return of some primary school pupils at least.\nNo principal I spoke to thought it was a good idea to bring primary one to primary three pupils back for effectively nine days, given most schools are off on St Patrick's Day and to then send them home for a week of remote learning when years 12 to 14 are due to return.\nIt is probably one of the easier changes for the executive to make.\nHowever there is still significant uncertainty for other year groups who don't yet have a potential date as to when they might return.\nWhether there are major changes this side of Easter is hard to predict because obviously it will depend how ministers see the public health situation moving.\nMuch of the executive's discussions on Thursday focused on the proposed pathway-to-recovery blueprint.\nIt is understood ministers received a presentation from interim Head of the Civil Service, Jenny Pyper, who leads the executive's Covid-19 taskforce. \nLast week, the first and deputy first ministers said they would publish the plan on Monday 1 March.\nBut at Thurday's press conference, they said they wanted to ensure they \"got it right\", rather than prematurely publishing the document.\nThe plan is not expected to include indicative dates, but will set out criteria that must be met before restrictions on different sectors can be eased.\nMrs Foster said the executive would also take into consideration \"not only local data but emerging evidence from other jurisdictions too\".\n\"We will keep to the standard of reviewing the regulations every three weeks, and every time we look at things we'll hope we can move further,\" she added. \nIn England and Scotland, recovery plans have been published that include target dates for easing restrictions - but the respective governments have said lifting of the rules will only happen if certain conditions are met.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, lockdown restrictions have been extended until 5 April.\nMs O'Neill said she hoped work on the executive's plan would continue over the weekend.\nShe added that she wanted to see \"robust and co-ordinated quarantine measures\" in place for travel across the island of Ireland, as part of the executive's overall response to manage the route out of lockdown.\nNI's lockdown has been extended until 1 April, with a review due on 18 March.\nOn Thursday, five more Covid-19 related deaths were recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.\nThe department's coronavirus death toll now stands at 2,048.\nA further 281 new positive cases of the virus have also been recorded.\nThere are also 341 people being treated for Covid-19 in hospitals, with 44 of those patients being treated in intensive case units (ICU), of those patients in ICU, 32 are ventilated.\nThe department's latest figures also show 491,593 people in Northern Ireland have now received their first Covid-19 vaccine.\nSome 31,637 people have had both doses.\nThe rate of transmission for new cases in Northern Ireland is estimated to be between 0.8 and 1.05, according to the Department of Health.\nThere were 35 additional deaths reported in the Irish Republic, with 613 more cases confirmed.\nIt means there has been a total of 4,271 coronavirus-related deaths in the country, with 217,478 confirmed cases.\nAre you worried about the new variants of coronavirus in Northern Ireland?

      "tags": "Robert Jenrick,Homelessness,Southwark,Homelessness in the UK",
      "text": "The number of rough sleepers in England fell by a third over a year, official figures suggest. \nGovernment statistics show 2,688 people on the streets on one night in autumn 2020, down from 4,266 in 2019.\nThe fall follows the \"Everyone In\" scheme, which has housed about 37,000 people since the pandemic hit last March. \nIn the House of Commons, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said he was \"heartened\" by \"this fantastic result\".\nMr Jenrick congratulated council officers and outreach workers on their \"incredible achievements\", but said these were only a beginning: \"Our ambition is that no one should need to sleep rough.\"\nHowever, Labour's shadow housing secretary, Thangam Debbonaire, told MPs there was \"a real risk that the gains made last year will be lost\". \nThe number of people housed by councils under Everyone In far outstripped the numbers in the 2019 official estimate.\nThe 2020 figures, from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, show:\nThe official estimate is based on a snapshot where councils in England either count rough sleepers on one night each year between 1 October and 30 November - or give an estimate based on information from \"local agencies\", often charities. \nBut research carried out by the BBC a year ago, also using figures from local authorities, suggested 25,000 people slept rough in England at some point in 2018, five times the figure in the autumn snapshot for the same year. \nThere's no doubt the government's approach to rough sleeping during the pandemic has proved what can be done.\nBut while there's widespread acknowledgement that the efforts were successful in the short term, questions remain about the government's strategy.\nCharities report that while the snapshot figures show a decrease in the last few years, people are still sleeping rough in significant numbers. \nAnd there's concern that without a sea change in support, rising unemployment and the financial pressures of the pandemic could lead to the problem getting much worse. \nIf Boris Johnson is to keep his promise to end rough sleeping by the end of this parliament, the figures will have to fall much further and faster than they have so far.  \nIn the London Borough of Southwark, Helen Dennis, cabinet member for social support and homelessness, says the Everyone In scheme was \"really effective in getting people off the streets, particularly during the first lockdown\". \nBut she added: \"The challenge is we are seeing new people sleeping rough all the time.\"\nMs Dennis says the number of homelessness applications in the borough is currently 48% higher than at this time last year, and this is translating into a rise in the numbers of rough sleepers. \n\"We've seen people losing their jobs in catering, cleaning, so lots of people who maybe were on low-paid jobs to start with have lost that lifeline and find themselves homeless for the first time.\" \nArran Nahal, 25, originally from Stratford-upon-Avon, had just returned to the UK after a two-year stint working in hospitality in Australia and was due to start a live-in job at a hotel in the Cotswolds as the UK first locked down last March. \nThe Cotswolds job was cancelled, leaving him jobless and without accommodation, his savings ran low and he \"hit rock bottom\" when he had to spend the night in a central London bus stop. \n\"Not being quite familiar with homelessness in the past and rough sleeping... I was a bit lost, a bit scared.\n\"You have some deep dark thoughts during those hours.\"\nHe says he asked himself repeatedly: \"How has it come to this?\"\nThe next day he \"stumbled across\" Southwark's Manna day centre, which found him emergency accommodation and then a hostel room in east London where he still lives. \nHe had never heard of Universal Credit but now relies on it. Soon he hopes to move on, although the lockdown means jobs in hospitality are impossible to find.\n\"If it hadn't been for the help I received almost immediately, I don't know where I'd be right now,\" he says. \n\"It's opened my eyes, given me a new perspective on the struggles people go through.\"\nLaurence Cummins, now 20, found himself rough sleeping in London in 2019 after his father died and he could no longer stay in the family home.  \n\"It was really cold, really dark and uncomfortable,\" he remembers. \n\"It's not a lifestyle you want really... but I didn't have a choice.\n\"At first I was very frightened. I just didn't really know what services were out there and that there were people who could provide accommodation for you.\"\nBy last winter, Laurence was sleeping in cold weather shelters. His earlier hopes of university and a good career were gone. \nIt was only when the he got an Everyone In hotel place at the start of the pandemic that he started receiving support to turn his life around.\nHe is now in stable accommodation, studying for a diploma in fashion and hoping to progress to a degree course.\nFor Laurence, the pandemic provided a lifeline and \"the chance to think\".  \nHe was in the hotel for more than a month. It allowed him to sleep, watch TV and - with the help of youth charity New Horizons - plan a future.\n\"I just forgot about being homeless,\" he says."

      "text": "Both Covid-19 case rates and positivity rates for Wales have now fallen below \"trigger\" figures used for putting areas into lockdown restrictions.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford has said stay at home rules could be revised when lockdown measures are reviewed this week and announced on Friday.\nIt comes as health chiefs reported no Covid deaths in Wales on Monday.\nWales' overall Covid case rate is 45 cases per 100,000 people for the last week - below the 50 cases threshold.\nThe proportion of Covid tests coming back positive has also fallen below a 5% threshold for the first time since September.\nBut Public Health Wales warned of a possible lag in reporting deaths, especially after the weekend, for the zero daily figure - which has not been that low since September.\nDr Giri Shankar, incident director for the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak response at Public Health Wales, added the dashboard is designed to be a \"rapid reporting tool which is subject to ongoing reconciliation\" and that \"official data is provided by the Office for National Statistics\".\nThe overall case rate for Wales is at its lowest point since 18 September.\nThe figure of 50 cases per 100,000 is seen as a so-called \"circuit breaker\" for bringing in restrictions and so getting areas below it, a sign-post on the road out of lockdown.\nThere are now 15 of Wales' 22 local authority areas under this figure.\nGwynedd remains the local authority with the highest case rate for a seven day period - 77.1 cases per 100,000 people.\nThis is followed by Merthyr Tydfil (72.9) and Anglesey (72.8).\nThe lowest case rates are seen in the Vale of Glamorgan (23.2), Pembrokeshire (17.5) and Ceredigion (15.1).\nThe proportion of tests which are positive is 4.8% in Wales, the lowest point since 23 September.\nThe World Health Organisation suggests a 5% threshold, which needs to be sustained, as part of requirements to come out of restrictions.\nThere are now 13 local authority areas below 5% - with Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Vale of Glamorgan below 3%.\nThere were no further deaths reported on Monday, leaving the total so far during the pandemic involving lab-tested cases, at 5,403.\nIt is advised to look at the rolling 7-day daily average for deaths as reported by Public Health Wales and account for the lag in reporting, so waiting until we know when the deaths occurred.\nBy 3 March, there was an average of nine deaths a day - this is the lowest number since 24 October.  \nIt is down from a peak of 47 daily deaths on 3 January. There were 57 deaths occurring on 1 January, the highest daily figure in the pandemic.\nA total of 998,296 people have now received at least a first dose of a Covid vaccine in Wales.\nOf those, 183,739 have had their second jab.\nDr Giri Shankar said: \"The Welsh Government has announced that the revised vaccine strategy will mean that every eligible adult in Wales will be offered a first dose by the end of July. \n\"In addition, adults with severe or profound learning disabilities, and those with any mental illness that causes severe functional impairment, will be invited for vaccination as part of the JCVI priority group six, and the Welsh Government has published guidance on identifying eligible individuals in these groups and how to support them to take up their vaccine offers.\n\"We encourage everyone, whatever their background, socio-demographic and ethnicity, to have the vaccine when they are offered it.\n\"We also stress the importance of seeking information from a trusted source such as Public Health Wales, the Welsh Government, local health board or GP.\"\nThe latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show Covid was mentioned on 7,458 death certificates, up to 19 February.\nThis gives a bigger picture and includes deaths where Covid is either confirmed or suspected by doctors and covers deaths in all settings, including care homes, hospices and people's homes.\nThe ONS figures show the weekly total has fallen for the fifth successive week.\nWhen looking at the number of all deaths and comparing them over a period of five non-pandemic years to what we might normally expect to see, this shows 5,411 deaths above the average.\nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nThe postcode search has been updated to replace data for health boards in Scotland with data for local councils. In England, data for county councils has been replaced with data for district councils. Figures for boroughs and unitary authorities remain unchanged. \nPHW figures only record deaths which have a confirmed Covid-19 diagnosis, backed up by a laboratory test, and mostly involve hospital deaths.\nONS takes a little longer to report deaths because it collates details of death registrations. In about 90% of cases, it is the underlying cause of death."

      "text": "Former Chancellor Lord Hammond has said the government must risk unpopularity and tell \"some difficult home truths\" about the state of the economy.  \nHe told the BBC that dealing with the pandemic had been the financial equivalent of \"fighting a war\".\nBut giving money away was easier than collecting it for \"a populist government\", he added.\nA No 10 spokeswoman said she \"doesn't recognise\" his characterisation of a government reluctant to be unpopular.\nShe added that the pandemic had shown Boris Johnson was \"a prime minister that is prepared to take difficult decisions and is weighing up very hard choices at the moment\".\nThe Budget on Wednesday comes amid rising unemployment and follows the biggest UK annual economic shrinkage on record.\nIn an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Lord Hammond - who resigned as chancellor when Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019 - said the economy had taken a \"huge hit\" from Covid-19, but should \"bounce back\".\nThere had been \"long-term scarring\", with sectors like aviation and hospitality suffering \"permanent damage\", and transport and retail \"changed forever\", he added.\nOfficial figures show the UK economy contracted by 9.9% in 2020 - more than twice as much as in any previous year on record.\nOn Tuesday, it was revealed unemployment had risen to 5.1% in the three months to December - the worst rate since 2015.\nAnd the national debt - worsened by furlough, other pandemic help schemes and falling tax takes - stands at more than \u00a32 trillion.\nLord Hammond said it was unlikely in the \"foreseeable future\" that ministers would be able to \"do anything that will actually see the debt starting to fall\".\n\"But what matters is not the absolute size of the debt, but the size of the debt relative to our economy,\" he said.\n\"If we can grow the British economy over the coming years, then just as we did after the Second World War, we can make the debt fade in significance, because, although it stays the same in absolute terms, it becomes a much smaller percentage of our national economy.\"\nPhilip Hammond has never been Boris Johnson's number one fan, to put it mildly.\nThey clashed on Brexit, with the former chancellor being booted out of Parliamentary Conservative Party during the wild political autumn of 2019.\nBut even though he is back in the party fold, and with the ermine of a Tory member of the House of Lords no less, the former occupant of No 11 isn't mincing his words.\nWhile he sticks to the broad consensus backing the government's massive emergency economic support during the pandemic, Lord Hammond looks very pointedly to the challenges that will come next, questioning whether Downing Street will have the right priorities.\nHis not very subtle implication: Downing Street would rather be popular than do the right thing.\nRead more from Laura here.\nLord Hammond said the challenge facing the government was \"how to move out of this crisis period\". \nHe praised Mr Sunak for getting the economic response right so far and said he was \"very confident\" his instincts were \"the right ones\". \nBut he said his fear was \"that as a populist government, giving money away is always easier than collecting it in\", and warned that ministers had \"made very extravagant commitments to the British electorate in good faith before the coronavirus crisis\".\n\"Not all of those commitments can now sensibly be delivered on and that's going to be a big challenge for a government that regards its short-term popularity as very, very important,\" Lord Hammond added.\nHe said he was \"not sure\" the current \"top leadership\" had the \"appetite for being unpopular, in order to do the right thing\".\nThe prime minister has said the chancellor will set out the government's plans to \"build back better\" in next Wednesday's Budget. \nMr Sunak has promised to lay out the \"support we'll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery\", adding: \"I know how incredibly tough the past year has been for everyone, and every job lost is a personal tragedy.\"\nA Treasury spokesman added: \"The chancellor has always put protecting jobs and livelihoods at the heart of everything he has done and that will not change.\n\"This Budget will give people the reassurance they need in the immediate term, and he will be honest with the British people about how we are going to recover beyond this crisis.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"not the time\" for tax increases for individuals or businesses, given the ongoing impact of the pandemic.\nJames Green, who runs the Whitstable Oyster Company in Kent, says the impact of the pandemic has been \"tough\".\n\"Obviously there's Covid-19 at the beginning of the year, which affected us, the restaurant side of the business and the oyster sales. We were open over the summer. We were busy, like most coastal places, and then we shut again in November.\"\nBut Mr Green adds: \"For the oyster side of the business the impact of Brexit is probably had more of an effect than Covid-19, I would say.\"\nAs a result of Britain leaving the single market, he says he has tons of oysters sitting on his farm that he cannot sell either to France or domestically. \nMr Green says the chancellor should give the shellfish industry \"some help to get us through now - otherwise there won't be one\".

      "text": "The life of 19th Century fossil hunter Mary Anning is being celebrated with a new commemorative 50p coin collection. \nAnning discovered Jurassic skeletons in her hometown of Lyme Regis, Dorset, which helped change long-held thinking about prehistoric life.\nBut her achievements were often overlooked at a time when the scientific world was dominated by men.\nThe cost of each of the three Royal Mint coins will range from \u00a310 to \u00a31,100 for a gold version.  \nThe collection will depict a temnodontosaurus - a large-jawed marine reptile, a plesiosaurus - a large marine sauropterygian reptile, and a dimorphodon - a small flying reptile.\nAnning, who was born in 1799, was the child of a poor family and had nine siblings when she started helping her father collect fossils which he sold to tourists. \nHer father died when she was 11 years old but she continued his work and, despite a lack of formal education, began teaching herself about geology and anatomy. \nIt was a year after her father's death that Anning discovered the skeleton - now known to be an ichthyosaur - that helped propel her into the history books.\nShe died in 1847, aged 47, of breast cancer. \nThe new coins are part of the Royal Mint's Tales of the Earth commemorative 50p series, which have been created with the Natural History Museum. \nClare Matterson, from the museum, said the collection \"celebrates a pivotal figure in the understanding of palaeontology, important contributions to science that were rarely acknowledged in Mary's lifetime\".\nThe coins were designed by paleo-artist Robert Nicholls and feature augmented reality (AR), which was first used by the Royal Mint in 2020.\nAfter receiving the coin, collectors can use AR to scan the packaging to unearth facts, clips and images about the prehistoric beasts.\nThe coins will be available to buy on the Royal Mint's website. \nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "Around 10% fewer train services should run once the country opens up again, compared to the pre-pandemic timetable, the chairman of Network Rail has said.\nThe old pattern of five days of peak commuter travel may not return, Sir Peter Hendy warned the National Rail Recovery conference.\nInstead, leisure travel might boost weekend traffic, especially if limits on international travel continue.\nCommuter traffic could return to 80% of pre-pandemic levels, he suggested.\n\"The service doesn't run better if you put too many trains on the track. We've proved that,\" said Sir Peter.\n\"You shouldn't try to get more out of the infrastructure than it can give you. All of my experience is that people prefer reliability to journey time.\"\nPassenger numbers fell precipitously in March when the pandemic struck and have only partially recovered since. Many commuters are working from home and some businesses remain closed. \nThe government's timetable foresees a gradual opening up of the economy over the coming months. However, some firms have already signalled some workers may continue to work from home for some of their working week.\nSir Peter said commuter traffic on the railways could remain at around 80% for the next one to three years, although he said that Network Rail, which manages the UK's rail infrastructure, were also looking at a range of possibilities between 60% and100%.\nHe warned that the working week could change so dramatically that commuter routes may only see one peak day a week and that ticketing options should be looked at to even out the service.\nLeisure visits to family or for recreation could boost passenger numbers on summer weekends, he suggested.\n\"I used to watch the trains to the Cornish Riviera from Paddington and it was packed and we might need to get used to that again,' he told the conference.\n\"If Saturday and Sunday get busy in the summer we need to do engineering work at other times.\"\nRail Minister Chris Heaton-Harris also acknowledged that commuting was not going to return to previous levels quickly.\n\"We are not going back to before - this is the new normal. We now need to fundamentally change,\" he said. Without a concerted cross-industry effort passengers might not return, he added.\nIn December, the government said it was \"committed to providing a more flexible, modern ticketing system for passengers\" and asked rail operators to develop flexible season tickets.\nWhen many commuters travelled to work four or five days a week, a season ticket provided value for money. Part-time commuters currently face a much higher price per journey.\nThe Department for Transport expects flexible season tickets to be introduced across England later this year, which could save commuters \"hundreds of pounds\".\nMr Heaton-Harris said during the pandemic passenger numbers fell to levels \"not seen since the 19th Century\" but everyone would work hard to restore business, and ensure a safe and clean network. He said this would require a \"coherent approach, [where] innovation is needed more than ever\".\nKeith Williams, whose much anticipated rail review is expected to be published soon, described the pandemic as a \"Black Swan\" event for the rail industry. The review had been due for release shortly before the pandemic began and has now been updated."

      "tags": "Pembrokeshire County Council,Children,Eglwyswrw,Welsh government,Ceredigion County Council",
      "text": "Concerns were raised about a boy more than a year before he died of scurvy, BBC Wales has learned.\nDylan Seabridge, eight, died in Pembrokeshire in 2011 but nothing has been published about whether agencies could have helped to prevent his death. \nThe inquest into his death heard that he had no contact with the authorities in the seven years before he died. \nPembrokeshire council said a Child Practice Review on the case would be published soon.  \nA draft serious case review leaked to BBC Wales, which was written in 2013, concluded that the laws on home education in Wales needed to be strengthened as a matter of urgency.\nThe inquest into the death of Dylan, from Dolau in Eglwyswrw, Pembrokeshire, heard that scurvy was an easily preventable and treatable disease.\nThe inquest heard his parents Glynn and Julie Seabridge had told police they did not believe he had scurvy and thought he was suffering from growing pains.  \nThey were charged with neglect but the Crown Prosecution Service dropped those charges in 2014.  \nNo serious case review has been published since Dylan's death four years ago, but an unpublished draft report has been leaked to BBC Wales.\nIt said Dylan was educated at home and \"invisible\" to the authorities, though his parents dispute that. \nThe author of the report said she knew so little about Dylan that it was \"impossible for her to even draw a pen picture of him\".\nAlthough the family lived in Pembrokeshire, Mrs Seabridge worked in neighbouring Ceredigion before her work was terminated.\nDuring employment tribunal proceedings, a lawyer and a head teacher contacted social services after they became aware Mrs Seabridge suffered from mental ill health and her child was home educated. \nEducation officials visited the Seabridges but they had no power to see Dylan.\nThe Children's Commissioner for Wales Dr Sally Holland said: \"This is a rare case, but I don't think Dylan Seabridge is the only child under the radar in Britain so we should be learning what we can from this case and of course as quickly as possible.\"\nThe Welsh government said it would publish new non-statutory guidance soon on home education.\nFiona Nicholson, a home education consultant, said the law was \"adequate as it is\".\n\"Changes aren't needed to safeguard children. If you turn it into policing, people will put up barriers,\" she said.\nPembrokeshire council said the serious case review was suspended pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings.\nSystem changes meant a different type of review was under way which would be published soon, it added.\nCeredigion council said it provided information for the report promptly and said current regulations do not give authorities enough power to monitor home educated children."

      "tags": "Floods,Skewen",
      "text": "People flooded out of their homes after a mine blow-out are in \"limbo and need answers\".\nEighty people were evacuated from Skewen in Neath Port Talbot on 21 January and residents have been urged to stay away due to safety fears.\nSome people will not be able to return home for at least six months, the Coal Authority has said.\nResident Kelly Birch said there was no clear plan about what was happening and insurers had been unable to visit. \nMs Birch said she and her family had been able to move in with her parents but many of her neighbours were staying in hotels. \n\"It's been really difficult because our houses are still full of flood water, sludge and slurry,\" she told BBC Radio Wales. \n\"We haven't been able to get any insurers in to have a look.\n\"The Coal Authority have advised a six-month window but we don't know if that is six months before we can get people to start working on our houses or if that is six months until we're actually able to go back and live there.\n\"So we're all in a bit of limbo at the moment, we're getting pieces of information but we're never really getting the full picture.\"\nShe said if it was not for their local councillor Mike Harvey they would \"not know anything at all\".\nMs Birch said they had just finished decorating their home after moving there 18 months ago.\n\"We literally just finished doing everything to that house in November,\" she said. \n\"Every single thing downstairs is ruined, there's nothing salvageable.\"\nShe said she feared their possessions upstairs were becoming damaged because the house was damp after the flooding. \n\"It is full of mud and we don't know when that's going to be cleaned out,\" she said. \nMany people had been unable to return to get belongings and some neighbours had been unable to get their cars so could not go to work, she said. \nA \u00a36.5m support package is available to people affected by flooding - on top of payments of between \u00a3500 to \u00a31,000 per household - to help with the \"immediate cost of water damage and replacing belongings\" from Welsh Government.\nThe Coal Authority said the \"blow out\" was caused by a blockage underground which led to the water breaking out to find the easiest path.\nChief executive Lisa Pinney said work to cap the mine shaft would take three months but a new water management system will have to be built deep underground to divert the water, which will take at least six months.\nShe said the authority was looking at \"every option\" to get as many people as possible back in their homes as quickly and safely as possible."
