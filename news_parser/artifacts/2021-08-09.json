      "title": "New 'Banksy' artwork appears at Great Yarmouth model village",
      "tags": "Gorleston-on-Sea,Lowestoft,Banksy,Great Yarmouth",
      "text": "Another piece of street art possibly created by secretive graffiti artist Banksy has appeared in East Anglia.\nA new model of a miniature stable, which appears to have been signed by the artist, was found at Merrivale Model Village in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, on Sunday morning.\nBanksy-style art also appeared on Friday in Admiralty Road in the town, in Gorleston and in Oulton Broad and Lowestoft in Suffolk.\nNone has yet been authenticated.\nFirst spotted by a visitor, the new work is a model of a thatched stable depicting a small rodent that appears to be standing on a wooden wheel placed by the building. It is captioned \"Go big or go home\".\nA post on the attraction's Facebook page said \"a model we had never seen before was sitting amongst our little cottages\" and \"looked as though vandals had been decorating it\".\n\"Upon closer inspection it was adorned with a familiar name to the street art scene....,\" the post said.\nOwner Frank Newsome told the BBC: \"It's not one of our cottages. Someone has brought it in.\n\"I'm a layman but we've Googled it and it does look genuine so we're now trying to ascertain via the Banksy website whether it is or it isn't.\"\nHe said the stable would be kept on display for visitors to the model village, but removed and stored safely elsewhere at night.\nIt would not be the first time Banksy has added his own work to an existing attraction. \nHe has previously visited galleries including Tate Britain, Le Louvre and four of New York's most prestigious museums, to place his work on their walls while wearing a disguise, and also positioned a doll dressed as a Guantanamo detainee at Disneyland. \nIt also carries on the theme of rats causing disruption. The animals, a long-time favourite of Banksy's, were captured messing up his bathroom during lockdown and spreading germs on the London Underground last summer.\nAnother artwork spotted in Great Yarmouth depicts people dancing on a bus shelter while an amusement arcade-style toy-grabbing crane appeared in Gorleston.\nPart of a piece in Nicholas Everitt Park, Oulton Broad, near Lowestoft, was removed on Sunday over flooding fears. It depicted three children, who appeared to be standing in a small boat placed under the painting.\nAnother artwork was spotted on a wall outside the former Lowestoft Electrical shop on London Road North, which appears to show a child next to a sandcastle.\nA large painting of a seagull appearing to scavenge from a skip has also appeared in Lowestoft, along with a picture of a rat reclining in a deckchair, drinking a cocktail.\nThe appearance of the artwork comes after Great Yarmouth, Gorleston and Lowestoft submitted a joint bid to become the next UK City of Culture in 2025.\nFurther along the coast in Cromer, another mural depicts a group of hermit crabs near some empty shells. One of the creatures, who has already secured a shell, holds a sign saying: \"Luxury rentals only\".\nThe BBC has attempted to contact representatives of Banksy, whose recent work includes a hula-hooping girl and an escaping prisoner.\nHe typically claims responsibility for pieces of street art via posts on his Instagram account and website.\nBanksy expert Prof Paul Gough, principal and vice chancellor of Arts University Bournemouth, said he was \"pretty sure\" the works were by Banksy or \"very good fakes\" and that the artist \"has clearly been enjoying an East Anglian staycation\".\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "The Taliban have taken control of Afghanistan, almost 20 years after being ousted by a US-led military coalition. \nEmboldened by the withdrawal of US troops, they now control all key cities in the country, including Kabul. \nThe Taliban took some areas from government by force. In other areas, the Afghan National Army withdrew without a shot being fired. \nAlthough renewed clashes had been going on for several weeks, from 6 August the Taliban made a more rapid advance across the country, as they took control of provincial cities.\nThe maps below start in early July and show the 400 or so government districts as they fell to the Taliban.\nUS forces based outside Afghanistan had launched air strikes against Taliban positions earlier last week, but they failed to slow the advance of the insurgents.\nAlthough most US troops left in July, several thousand returned to Kabul at the weekend to help evacuate American and allied personnel from the capital.\nThe airport in the capital was the only official route out of the country after the Taliban took control of all the major border crossings. \nCustoms duty on goods entering the country via crossings they control is now collected by the Taliban - although exact amounts are unclear as the volume of trade has fallen as a result of the fighting. \nBut, Islam Qala on the border with Iran was, for example, capable of generating more than $20 million per month. \nDisruption to the flow of imports and exports has affected prices of essential goods in the markets - fuel and foodstuffs in particular.\nUS troops and their Nato and regional allies forced the Taliban from power in November 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US.\nBut despite a continued international presence in the region, billions of dollars of support and training for the Afghan government forces, the Taliban regrouped and gradually regained strength in more remote areas.\nA  BBC study in 2017 showed the Taliban were in full control of a number of districts. But the research also showed they were active in many other parts of the country, mounting weekly or monthly attacks in some areas, suggesting significantly higher strength than previous estimates. \nIn 2017 about 15 million people - half the population - were reported to be living in areas either controlled by the Taliban or where the Taliban were openly present.\nAdditional reporting by BBC Afghan service"

      "tags": "Gainsborough,Coronavirus vaccines",
      "text": "Adam really wants to get vaccinated against Covid-19, but an extreme fear of needles is holding him back. \nThe 23-year-old from Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, says it's not the pain he's afraid of. For him, it's the thought of the injection itself - and the needle piercing his skin.\n\"It feels like the world is ending in that moment,\" Adam says.\n\"It feels like you have no way out, you can't do anything, your heart rate's pushing 200, you can't focus on anything.\n\"It's about a pathological fear of needles.\"\nIn total, over 85 million doses of the Covid vaccine have been administered across the UK.\nBut a recent Oxford University survey of more than 15,000 adults in the UK suggests needle phobia accounts for about 10% of Covid vaccine hesitancy.\nMore than 68% of 18 to 29-year-olds in England have had a first jab, while 88.6% of all UK adults have had one.\nThe survey suggests reluctance to get the Covid jab is generally a bit higher in younger people and some ethnic minority groups.\nAdam has severe anxiety - and he thinks his needle phobia developed after he had his ear pierced when he was eight.\nIt took weeks for him to get himself to a vaccine centre to even attempt to get a Covid jab. But when he saw his local hospital's vaccine centre put a message out on Facebook offering support to anyone nervous about the jab, Adam decided to take the plunge. \nAt his appointment, he was given a side room with a nurse where he could discuss his fears. \nHe tells BBC News that after hours of \"severe panic\", he felt he'd made some progress, but still wasn't ready to have the jab.\nThree days later, Adam spent three more hours in a private room with nurses. They used techniques such as slow breathing and distraction to help him overcome his fears.\nAdam said he came close to having the jab this time, but flinched at the last moment so the needle didn't inject the dose.\nNeedle phobia is a fear of medical procedures that involve needles or injections. It affects about one in 10 people, according to the NHS.\nThe fear is often the result of bad memories of needles in younger life. \n\"It's possible that seeing others reacting [badly] to an injection means you learn that response from them,\" says psychologist and phobia specialist, Robert Edelman.\n\"Needles are also associated with blood and for a lot of people that triggers an anxiety response - an increase and then a decrease in heart rate results in fainting.\"\nThere are lots of ways to help people overcome needle phobia, such as cognitive behavioural therapy.\nTreatment can include someone getting gradual exposure to needles and injections, by being shown pictures and videos to begin with.\nAnd there are methods to help stop people fainting in fear, such as teaching them to recognise early signs of a dip in blood pressure.\nOther tips from experts we've spoken to include:\nPsychiatrist Andrew Iles says it's good to remember that it's natural to find it unpleasant to get a jab.\n\"Jabs are uncomfortable and strange so it's absolutely fine to be fearful of needles, but it's really important not to let that put you off getting the vaccine.\"\nDespite Adam's failed attempts, he's feeling optimistic about trying again - and has booked in at the same vaccine clinic next week.\n\"Game on! Hopefully I'll grab it and get it out of the way.\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here. "

      "tags": "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,COP26,UK climate change protests,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "Human activity is changing the climate in unprecedented and sometimes irreversible ways, a major UN scientific report has said.\nThe landmark study warns of increasingly extreme heatwaves, droughts and flooding, and a key temperature limit being broken in just over a decade. \nThe report \"is a code red for humanity\", says the UN chief.\nBut scientists say a catastrophe can be avoided if the world acts fast.\nThere is hope that deep cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases could stabilise rising temperatures. \nEchoing the scientists' findings, UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said: \"If we combine forces now, we can avert climate catastrophe. But, as today's report makes clear, there is no time for delay and no room for excuses. I count on government leaders and all stakeholders to ensure COP26 is a success.\" \nThe sober assessment of our planet's future has been delivered by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group of scientists whose findings are endorsed by the world's governments.\nTheir report is the first major review of the science of climate change since 2013. Its release comes less than three months before a key climate summit in Glasgow known as COP26.\nIn strong, confident tones, the IPCC's document says \"it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land\".\nAccording to Prof Ed Hawkins, from the University of Reading, UK, and one of the report's authors, the scientists cannot be any clearer on this point.\n\"It is a statement of fact, we cannot be any more certain; it is unequivocal and indisputable that humans are warming the planet.\"\nPetteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization, said: \"By using sports terms, one could say the atmosphere has been exposed to doping, which means we have begun observing extremes more often than before.\"\nThe authors say that since 1970, global surface temperatures have risen faster than in any other 50-year period over the past 2,000 years.\nThis warming is \"already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe\". \nWhether it's heatwaves like the ones recently experienced in Greece and western North America, or floods like those in Germany and China, \"their attribution to human influence has strengthened\" over the past decade.\nThe new report also makes clear that the warming we've experienced to date has made changes to many of our planetary support systems that are irreversible on timescales of centuries to millennia. \nThe oceans will continue to warm and become more acidic. Mountain and polar glaciers will continue melting for decades or centuries.\n\"The consequences will continue to get worse for every bit of warming,\" said Prof Hawkins.  \n\"And for many of these consequences, there's no going back.\"\nWhen it comes to sea level rise, the scientists have modelled a likely range for different levels of emissions.\nHowever, a rise of around 2m by the end of this century cannot be ruled out - and neither can a 5m rise by 2150.\nSuch outcomes, while unlikely, would threaten many millions more people in coastal areas with flooding by 2100. \nOne key aspect of the report is the expected rate of temperature rise and what it means for the safety of humanity.\nAlmost every nation on Earth signed up to the goals of the Paris climate agreement in 2015.\nThis pact aims to keep the rise in global temperatures well below 2C this century and to pursue efforts to keep it under 1.5C.\nThis new report says that under all the emissions scenarios considered by the scientists, both targets will be broken this century unless huge cuts in carbon take place. \nThe authors believe that 1.5C will be reached by 2040 in all scenarios. If emissions aren't slashed in the next few years, this will happen even earlier.\nThis was predicted in the IPCC's special report on 1.5C in 2018 and this new study now confirms it.\n\"We will hit one-and-a-half degrees in individual years much earlier. We already hit it in two months during the El Ni\u00f1o in 2016,\" said Prof Malte Meinshausen, an IPCC author from the University of Melbourne in Australia. \n\"The new report's best estimate is the middle of 2034, but the uncertainty is huge and ranges between now and never.\"\nThe consequences of going past 1.5C over a period of years would be unwelcome in a world that has already experienced a rapid uptick in extreme events with a temperature rise since pre-industrial times of 1.1C.\n\"We will see even more intense and more frequent heatwaves,\" said Dr Friederike Otto, from the University of Oxford, UK, and one of the IPCC report's authors.\n\"And we will also see an increase in heavy rainfall events on a global scale, and also increases in some types of droughts in some regions of the world.\"\nProf Carolina Vera, vice-chair of the working group that produced the document, said: \"The report clearly shows that we are already living the consequences of climate change everywhere. But we will experience further and concurrent changes that increase with every additional beat of warming.\"\nSo what can be done?\nWhile this report is more clear and confident about the downsides to warming, the scientists are more hopeful that if we can cut global emissions in half by 2030 and reach net zero by the middle of this century, we can halt and possibly reverse the rise in temperatures. \nReaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible using clean technology, then burying any remaining releases using carbon capture and storage, or absorbing them by planting trees.\n\"The thought before was that we could get increasing temperatures even after net zero,\" said another co-author, Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds, UK.\n\"But we now expect nature to be kind to us and if we are able to achieve net zero, we hopefully won't get any further temperature increase; and if we are able to achieve net zero greenhouse gases, we should eventually be able to reverse some of that temperature increase and get some cooling.\"\nWhile the future projections of warming are clearer than ever in this report, and many impacts simply cannot be avoided, the authors caution against fatalism.\n\"Lowering global warming really minimises the likelihood of hitting these tipping points,\" said Dr Otto. \"We are not doomed.\"\nA tipping point refers to when part of the Earth's climate system undergoes an abrupt change in response to continued warming.\nFor political leaders, the report is another in a long line of wake-up calls, but since it comes so close to November's COP26 global climate summit, it carries extra weight.\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Taliban",
      "text": "The Taliban have captured three regional capitals in Afghanistan as they continue to make sweeping territorial gains in the country.\nThey seized control of the key northern city of Kunduz on Sunday, as well as Sar-e-Pul and Taloqan.\nIt means five regional capitals have fallen to the militants since Friday, with Kunduz being their most important gain this year.\nThe Taliban said there is no agreement on a ceasefire with the government. \nA spokesman for the group warned against further US intervention in Afghanistan while speaking to Al Jazeera TV on Sunday. \nViolence has escalated across Afghanistan after US and other international forces began to withdraw their troops from the country, following 20 years of military operations. \nTaliban militants have made rapid advances in recent weeks. Having captured large swathes of the countryside, they are now targeting key towns and cities.\nThe three northern cities fell to Taliban control within hours of each other on Sunday, with one resident in Kunduz describing the situation as \"total chaos\".\nThe Afghan government, meanwhile, said its forces were fighting to retake key installations.\nHeavy fighting has also been reported in Herat in the west, and in the southern cities of Kandahar and Lashkar Gah.\nThousands of civilians have been displaced this year. Families, including babies and young children, have been sheltering in a school in the north-eastern city of Asadabad.\n\"Many bombs were dropped on our village. The Taliban came and destroyed everything. We were helpless and had to leave our houses. Our children and ourselves are sleeping on the ground in dire conditions\", Gul Naaz told AFP.\n\"There was firing, one of my seven-year-old daughters went out during that fighting and disappeared. I don't know if she is alive or dead,\" another displaced resident said.\nThe US has intensified its air strikes on Taliban positions, with Afghan military officials saying militants have been killed. But the Taliban say the air strikes hit two hospitals and a school in the city of Lashkar Gah. Neither claim has been independently verified.\nThe US embassy in Afghanistan condemned the Taliban's \"violent new offensive against Afghan cities\", saying the group's actions to \"forcibly impose its rule are unacceptable\".\n\"They demonstrate wanton disregard for the welfare and rights of civilians and will worsen this country's humanitarian crisis,\" it said in a statement.\nBy Khalil Noori, BBC News, Kabul\nThis attack on a number of strategic cities and their fall to the Taliban was unprecedented. But as the deadline for the full withdrawal of foreign forces approached, a big change on the battlefield was expected.\nNow it is time for the Afghan government to prove that its well-equipped forces, 350,000 strong, are able to retake the lost areas.\nIt would be difficult for the Taliban to hold Kunduz, but for several weeks the group has kept control of commercial centres important for trade with Iran and Pakistan.\nThe populations in cities taken by the Taliban are paying the price of war, having lost loved ones or property. They are having to leave their homes, fearing the launch of a government operation to retake the cities.\nPeace talks with the Taliban in Doha are deadlocked. If the process resumes, from now on both sides will be trying to control the larger area to justify a greater share of power, if they agree on a transitional government.\nThe seizure of Kunduz is the most significant gain for the Taliban since they launched their offensive in May. The city, home to 270,000 people, is considered a gateway to the country's mineral-rich northern provinces.\nAnd its location makes it strategically important as there are highways connecting Kunduz to other major cities, including Kabul, and the province shares a border with Tajikistan.\nThat border is used for the smuggling of Afghan opium and heroin to Central Asia, which then finds its way to Europe. Controlling Kunduz means controlling one of the most important drug smuggling routes in the region.\nIt also holds symbolic significance for the Taliban because it was a key northern stronghold before 2001. The militants captured the city in 2015 and again in 2016 but have never been able to hold it for long. \nBy Paul Adams, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent\nFormer British Gen Sir Richard Barrons says there is a danger of Afghanistan feeling \"friendless\", in the wake of recent battlefield defeats and the possible withdrawal of diplomats and contractors from Kabul if things get worse.\nIt is much too early to speculate about a Saigon-style withdrawal from the capital, echoing the way the Americans hastily left Vietnam in the final act of the war there, in 1975.\nBut in recent days, British and American calls for their nationals to leave the country threaten to create a dangerous narrative.\nIt is something that western military planners have been worried about for some time, following US President Joe Biden's decision, in April, to withdraw American forces by 11 September.\nIn June, classified UK Ministry of Defence documents were found at a Canterbury bus stop by a member of the public. One of them voiced just this concern, speaking about the need to counter an \"abandonment narrative\" in Afghanistan.\n\"Precise language may be needed,\" it said, \"to avoid misunderstandings about 'retrograde to zero' vs normal diplomatic (including military) representation.\"\n\"Retrograde to zero\" is the peculiar euphemism used to describe the withdrawal process now in its final weeks. In other words, planners were only too aware of creating the dangerous impression that Afghanistan might indeed be left \"friendless\".\nThat is not yet the case. American air strikes are still being used in an attempt to halt the Taliban's advances. Britain and the US will doubtless have hidden assets on the ground, working feverishly to stem the tide of the war."

      "text": "Nations vulnerable to climate change have warned they are on the \"edge of extinction\" if action is not taken.\nThe warning by a group of developing countries comes after a landmark UN report argued that global warming could make parts of the world uninhabitable.\nWorld leaders including UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have called the report a \"wake-up call to the world\".\nBut some of the strongest reaction to its findings has come from countries that are set to be the worst hit.\n\"We are paying with our lives for the carbon someone else emitted,\" said Mohamed Nasheed, a former Maldives president who represents almost 50 countries that are vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\nThe Maldives is the world's lowest-lying country and Mr Nasheed said the projections by UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) would be \"devastating\" for the nation, putting it on the \"edge of extinction\".\nAccording to the latest IPCC report, heatwaves, heavy rainfall and droughts will become more common and extreme. The UN's chief has labelled it a \"code red for humanity\".\nThe report says there is \"unequivocal\" evidence that humans are to blame for increasing temperatures. Within the next two decades, temperatures are likely to rise 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, it adds.\nThat could lead to sea levels rising by half a metre, but a rise of 2m by the end of the century cannot be ruled out.\nThat could have a devastating impact on low-lying coastal countries, said Diann Black-Layne, ambassador of Antigua and Barbuda, and lead climate negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States.\n\"That is our very future, right there,\" Ms Black-Layne said.\nThe report comes less than three months before a key climate summit in Glasgow known as COP26.\nBoris Johnson, who is hosting the conference, said the report showed help was needed for countries bearing the brunt of climate change.\n\"Today's report makes for sobering reading, and it is clear that the next decade is going to be pivotal to securing the future of our planet,\" he said.\n\"We know what must be done to limit global warming - consign coal to history and shift to clean energy sources, protect nature and provide climate finance for countries on the frontline.\"\nUnder the 2015 Paris Agreement, more than 190 governments agreed the world should limit global warming to 2C or ideally 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\nBut the new report says that under all scenarios, both targets will be broken this century unless huge cuts in carbon take place.\nUS Climate Envoy John Kerry said that to reach the targets, countries urgently needed to change their economies.\n\"This is the critical decade for action, and COP26 in Glasgow must be a turning point in this crisis,\" Mr Kerry said.\nClimate activist Greta Thunberg, who confirmed on Monday that she will attend the COP26 talks, said the report \"confirms what we already know... that we are in an emergency\".\n\"We can still avoid the worst consequences, but not if we continue like today, and not without treating the crisis like a crisis,\" she said on Twitter."

      "text": "A student nurse says she'd rather be in prison than the Spanish quarantine hotel where she's been placed. \nSophie Burdge, 22, from Barry, had been on holiday in Majorca but tested positive for Covid before her flight home.\nShe said the lack of communication and service had left her \"begging\" for food and water.\nThe hotel said water was available and meals were supplied by hospital catering. \nMiss Burdge said staff at the Hotel Palma Bellver had never checked on her condition, despite her positive test.\nFollowing her test result on Tuesday, she said she was not picked up and taken to the hotel until 24 hours after the initial appointment, at 21:00 local time (20:00 BST) the following day. \n\"They then said, because I'd gotten there so late, I couldn't have any food, so I was really hungry,\" she said. \nMiss Burdge said she was not provided with any food the following day until she decided to order some herself at about 13:00. \n\"I ordered McDonald's and they didn't give it to me, they took it off me. Then I tried ordering again from a different company, and they didn't give me that either.\n\"I was crying my eyes out because I was so hungry, I was starving,\" she said. \nShe said: \"On my first night, I got there, and I had no water. I was thinking, 'I know I'm hungry, but water is more important'.\n\"I was ringing and ringing and ringing asking and begging for water, I think I was crying at one point for water.\"\n\"There's no laundry service. I've run out of knickers, so I've been washing them in the sink - sounds bad but I have no choice.\" \nShe said other guests at the hotel had started passing supplies to each other using bed sheets tied up to make ropes.\n\"This boy cut up a bed sheet, tied it all together, tied the water and roped it down to me, so I could have a bottle of water. \n\"People are ordering food and putting the rope down and the delivery guy will just tie it on,\" she added.\nMs Burdge also said she had run out of medication she needed for a mental health issue because she was unable to communicate with the doctor at the hotel.\n\"I only took enough for a seven-day holiday, but now I don't have any,\" she said. \"I'm not supposed to stop taking it, but I don't have it to take.\" \nMiss Burdge said she had planned the holiday following a tough few months, and this had only made things worse.\n\"I lost my partner a few months ago, so I've come on holiday with my friend and her little girl just to get away really, just to have a break and clear my head,\" she said.\nSpain is currently on the UK's amber list, meaning double vaccinated travellers no longer have to quarantine once they return, but must take a private Covid test before the flight home.\nIf this test is positive, they must isolate for 10 days before returning to the UK, and this will sometimes mean being placed in a quarantine hotel. \nHotel Palma Bellver said food was served by hospital catering, not the hotel, and that water was available to guests on request.\nIn a statement, the hotel said: \"The operation is sanitary (more similar to that of a hospital than to that of a hotel), and therefore the meals (four a day) are served by the hospital catering, supervised by hospital dietitians.\n\"The guests/patients are allowed to order meals outside, (as well as other basic supplies) but not processed food, as per the doctor's prescription.\n\"The staff of our company only manages the inventory of rooms, we respond to the client-patient, and we serve as a 'connecting link' between the various agents involved,\" they added.

      "text": "With Scottish school pupils set to receive their grades after another year of learning disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, there is debate over how - or if - exams should be conducted in future.\nThe Scottish government has already announced wide-ranging changes to the education system, with the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) to be replaced with a new agency overseeing the curriculum.\nHowever, with these reforms taking time to push through, an announcement in due in the coming weeks about what will happen in the next school term.\nWhat are the arguments for and against returning to traditional exams, and what have ministers said about it?\nIn 2020, Scotland's school exams were cancelled for the first time ever as the Covid-19 pandemic took hold.\nGrades were instead awarded using a system where teachers estimated the scores pupils should be given - but there was outcry over a moderation system which saw 125,000 of these estimated results being downgraded.\nThe government apologised and dropped the moderation system - and pledged not to use any \"algorithms\" to tinker with results the following year.\nHowever there was also controversy over the 2021 diet, with claims that pupils ended up sitting assessments which were \"exams by another name\" because there was little time in the classroom to assess other work.\nA decision on what pupils will work towards next spring is due before schools go back for the new term later in August.\nCritics of the old exam system, who say an all-or-nothing exam paper might not accurately reflect what a pupil had learned across the school year, think the pandemic may help change things for the better.\nThe Scottish Greens - who are set to sign a cooperation agreement with the governing SNP - have called for a move away from the \"antiquated high-stakes end of term exam model\" towards \"systems of ongoing assessment which judge a pupil's knowledge and abilities with far more accuracy\".\nTeaching groups have also suggested the current model should be retained at least for the coming year, to give more certainty to staff and pupils in uncertain times.\nSeamus Searson of the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association said there were \"real positives\" to using teacher judgements, as long as it is not done in a \"mad rush\".\nSome argue that anonymously-marked exam papers are still the best way of guaranteeing consistent standards in schools, and avoid any unintentional bias from teachers.\nThe Commission on School Reform, set up by the think tank Reform Scotland, said the exam system tests memory and focus and how to consolidate knowledge over short periods of time  - all \"important and useful skills for life and work\".\nDr Keir Bloomer, who led the study, said: \"Anonymous marking is effectively insurance against the sort of rapid grade inflation that ultimately only ends when every pupil returns straight As, which would do no favours to either individual pupils or the country as a whole.\n\"If Scotland were to scrap exams altogether, as some wish, it would put us out of step with the rest of the world, which increasingly relies on a hybrid model of coursework and exams. That should be our future, too.\"\nThe Scottish Conservatives have also called for exams to be reinstated, calling them \"the best and fairest way we have to measure educational attainment\".\nIn June, Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville announced that the SQA would be scrapped as part of a \"substantial overhaul\" of education, which will see a new agency put in charge of qualifications.\nThis was prompted by a report by the OECD, which said there was too much focus on exams in the later years of schooling.\nThe group is set to publish a further report later this month specifically on the topic of exams, and Prof Ken Muir - a former chief of the General Teaching Council for Scotland - is to head a group which will engage with staff, parents and pupils about what the future should hold.\nMs Somerville said this work would begin in August, and take about six months to complete.\nShe stressed that \"this isn't going to be an overnight change\" - and that the SQA will continue to deliver qualifications in the meantime.\nWhat questions do you have about this year's results?\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "A major investigation has been launched into property developer entrepreneur Gavin Woodhouse.\nIt will focus on investments he offered in care homes and hotels, some of which were in Wales, between 2013 and 2019.\nThe Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said it is investigating \"suspected fraud and money laundering\" relating to him, as well as associated individuals and firms.\nMr Woodhouse declined to comment on the investigation.\nUK-based investors into the suspected fraudulent schemes were being urged to complete an SFO questionnaire.\nIt said this would \"help us to establish the circumstances of the investments offered, to identify and pursue new information, and to progress the investigation as quickly as possible\".\nMore than 1,000 people, including many overseas investors, have thought to have invested about \u00a380 million in companies owned by Mr Woodhouse.\nThose taking part in the schemes handed over cash for hotel rooms, \"off-plan\" care home rooms and unbuilt lodges on the proposed Afan Valley Adventure Resort in south Wales. \nNeath Port Talbot Council said Mr Woodhouse was \"no longer involved\" in the Afan Valley project, and the new applicant hoped to \"drive this development forward\".\nDerrick Towlson, from Llysfaen in Conwy, invested in a room at the Fourcroft Hotel in Tenby in 2017 after selling his business. \nHis \u00a375,000 was supposed to fund the hotel's renovation and in return he would be paid an annual rental. \nHe was told he could then sell his room back after 10 years at 25% profit.\n\"I've worked hard since the age of 15 and never had a day out of work so that I could retire early, now we've lost almost everything,\" he told BBC Wales. \n\"For the first time in our lives we've had to go on universal credit because our savings are depleted. \n\"We had nowhere to live so we moved in with my 90-year-old mother. It's been really hard.\"\nGary Thomas, who invested in two rooms at the Queen's Hotel in Llandudno, welcomed the SFO's investigation.\nThe retired financial advisor from Flintshire did receive a return on his investments for a couple of years, but these dried up in 2018 and he said he was about \u00a375,000 out of pocket.\n\"I'm pleased the Serious Fraud Office are investigating this,\" Mr Thomas said. \n\"The Queen's is up for sale and we're waiting to see what will happen if it sells, whether they buy the rooms from us or offer us an income.\n\"I just want out, really. I want to draw a line under this and move on.\"\nConcerns were raised about unfinished projects and the finances of Mr Woodhouse's Northern Powerhouse Developments (NPD) companies.\nIn 2019, a High Court judge put Northern Powerhouse Developments Ltd into administration, ruling that Mr Woodhouse's business model appeared to be \"thoroughly dishonest\" and a \"shameful abuse of the privileges of limited liability trading\".\nBBC Wales revealed in November 2019 that a number of Welsh hotels were being offered for sale following the collapse of the NPD schemes to try to get some money back for investors, many of whom were told that the Land Registry documents relating to their purchases were likely to be worthless.\nLaw firm Penningtons Manches Cooper are pursuing professional negligence claims against a number of solicitors who advised investors in the NPD schemes.\nPenningtons partner David Niven said the firm was representing \"hundreds of clients\" in respect of investments totalling about \u00a320m, including some who invested in Welsh hotels and the Afan Valley Adventure Resort scheme as well as hotels and care homes in England.\nThe SFO would not comment further on its investigation but said its core purpose were to \"deliver justice for victims\".\nIt added: \"If we obtain convictions and compensation is appropriate and possible, we will seek to return monies to victims.\""

      "tags": "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,COP26,UK climate change protests,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "Human activity is changing the climate in unprecedented and sometimes irreversible ways, a major UN scientific report has said.\nThe landmark study warns of increasingly extreme heatwaves, droughts and flooding, and a key temperature limit being broken in just over a decade. \nThe report \"is a code red for humanity\", says the UN chief.\nBut scientists say a catastrophe can be avoided if the world acts fast.\nThere is hope that deep cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases could stabilise rising temperatures. \nEchoing the scientists' findings, UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said: \"If we combine forces now, we can avert climate catastrophe. But, as today's report makes clear, there is no time for delay and no room for excuses. I count on government leaders and all stakeholders to ensure COP26 is a success.\" \nThe sober assessment of our planet's future has been delivered by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group of scientists whose findings are endorsed by the world's governments.\nTheir report is the first major review of the science of climate change since 2013. Its release comes less than three months before a key climate summit in Glasgow known as COP26.\nIn strong, confident tones, the IPCC's document says \"it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land\".\nAccording to Prof Ed Hawkins, from the University of Reading, UK, and one of the report's authors, the scientists cannot be any clearer on this point.\n\"It is a statement of fact, we cannot be any more certain; it is unequivocal and indisputable that humans are warming the planet.\"\nPetteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization, said: \"By using sports terms, one could say the atmosphere has been exposed to doping, which means we have begun observing extremes more often than before.\"\nThe authors say that since 1970, global surface temperatures have risen faster than in any other 50-year period over the past 2,000 years.\nThis warming is \"already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe\". \nWhether it's heatwaves like the ones recently experienced in Greece and western North America, or floods like those in Germany and China, \"their attribution to human influence has strengthened\" over the past decade.\nThe new report also makes clear that the warming we've experienced to date has made changes to many of our planetary support systems that are irreversible on timescales of centuries to millennia. \nThe oceans will continue to warm and become more acidic. Mountain and polar glaciers will continue melting for decades or centuries.\n\"The consequences will continue to get worse for every bit of warming,\" said Prof Hawkins.  \n\"And for many of these consequences, there's no going back.\"\nWhen it comes to sea level rise, the scientists have modelled a likely range for different levels of emissions.\nHowever, a rise of around 2m by the end of this century cannot be ruled out - and neither can a 5m rise by 2150.\nSuch outcomes, while unlikely, would threaten many millions more people in coastal areas with flooding by 2100. \nOne key aspect of the report is the expected rate of temperature rise and what it means for the safety of humanity.\nAlmost every nation on Earth signed up to the goals of the Paris climate agreement in 2015.\nThis pact aims to keep the rise in global temperatures well below 2C this century and to pursue efforts to keep it under 1.5C.\nThis new report says that under all the emissions scenarios considered by the scientists, both targets will be broken this century unless huge cuts in carbon take place. \nThe authors believe that 1.5C will be reached by 2040 in all scenarios. If emissions aren't slashed in the next few years, this will happen even earlier.\nThis was predicted in the IPCC's special report on 1.5C in 2018 and this new study now confirms it.\n\"We will hit one-and-a-half degrees in individual years much earlier. We already hit it in two months during the El Ni\u00f1o in 2016,\" said Prof Malte Meinshausen, an IPCC author from the University of Melbourne in Australia. \n\"The new report's best estimate is the middle of 2034, but the uncertainty is huge and ranges between now and never.\"\nThe consequences of going past 1.5C over a period of years would be unwelcome in a world that has already experienced a rapid uptick in extreme events with a temperature rise since pre-industrial times of 1.1C.\n\"We will see even more intense and more frequent heatwaves,\" said Dr Friederike Otto, from the University of Oxford, UK, and one of the IPCC report's authors.\n\"And we will also see an increase in heavy rainfall events on a global scale, and also increases in some types of droughts in some regions of the world.\"\nProf Carolina Vera, vice-chair of the working group that produced the document, said: \"The report clearly shows that we are already living the consequences of climate change everywhere. But we will experience further and concurrent changes that increase with every additional beat of warming.\"\nSo what can be done?\nWhile this report is more clear and confident about the downsides to warming, the scientists are more hopeful that if we can cut global emissions in half by 2030 and reach net zero by the middle of this century, we can halt and possibly reverse the rise in temperatures. \nReaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible using clean technology, then burying any remaining releases using carbon capture and storage, or absorbing them by planting trees.\n\"The thought before was that we could get increasing temperatures even after net zero,\" said another co-author, Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds, UK.\n\"But we now expect nature to be kind to us and if we are able to achieve net zero, we hopefully won't get any further temperature increase; and if we are able to achieve net zero greenhouse gases, we should eventually be able to reverse some of that temperature increase and get some cooling.\"\nWhile the future projections of warming are clearer than ever in this report, and many impacts simply cannot be avoided, the authors caution against fatalism.\n\"Lowering global warming really minimises the likelihood of hitting these tipping points,\" said Dr Otto. \"We are not doomed.\"\nA tipping point refers to when part of the Earth's climate system undergoes an abrupt change in response to continued warming.\nFor political leaders, the report is another in a long line of wake-up calls, but since it comes so close to November's COP26 global climate summit, it carries extra weight.\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "text": "Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 350 million confirmed cases and more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. \nThe US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. \nVery few places have been left untouched. \nThe latest available data for the total number of cases in France since the start of the pandemic is from 16 January. \nIn the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Doctors,Cardiff,NHS Wales,Coronavirus pandemic,GP",
      "text": "As Wales moves into alert level zero, legal limits on the numbers of people who can meet will be dropped.\nAll businesses can reopen with risk assessments, although face masks in many indoor venues will remain.\nBut what about GP surgeries?\nWhen the pandemic began, surgeries quickly put measures in place to prevent infections spreading among the most vulnerable - older people and those living with certain medical conditions.\nThis meant initial phone consultations with face-to-face appointments when necessary, and GPs say they have never been busier.\nBut some people told BBC News they were unhappy with this system. \nA man from Port Talbot said: \"If you are lucky enough to have the receptionist pick up the phone, you have to tell them what's wrong before they decide if it's an emergency or not.\n\"Then if you get past that stage you then get a call back from a doctor, who then decides if you need to actually be seen. Absolutely ridiculous.\"\nHe said the surgery had banned patients from criticising it on social media, threatening to remove them as a patient if they did.\nRequesting anonymity as a result, he said: \"There's a sign stating that anything negative said about the practice on social media etc, then that patient would be removed from there.\"\nKing's Surgery in Port Talbot apologised and said it would amend the notice immediately, but added: \"We are also aware of derogatory comments being left on some social media sites, and ask that wherever possible patients contact us directly if they are unhappy, so we can work with them to resolve the issues.\"\nSwansea Bay health board said: \"We can give assurances that making a complaint or sharing poor experience should not lead to any patient being removed from a list.\n\"Only in extreme circumstances, where the complaints are targeted against individuals and unfounded, could this be seen as a breakdown in the patient-doctor relationship, and potential removal from the practice list.\"\nIt added that patient feedback was always welcome \"and we clearly recognise the role social media plays in this\" but asked people to be respectful and not write anything abusive about individual staff members.\nMoira Tresize, from Castleton, Newport, said she spent 11 days trying to get through to her GP for a repeat prescription. \n\"Patients are just unable to get through by telephone and they are not able to see a GP in person,\" she told Steffan Powell on the Radio Wales Phone-In.\n\"I think the perception is that GP surgeries are still in full lockdown mode, while the rest of Wales is opening up.\" \nShe added: \"I tried for 11 days to get through. One day was 162 calls another was 149 calls.\n\"It's not about me because I don't need to see a GP very often, but it just haunts me to think of frail, elderly or chronically sick people trying to navigate systems like this.\"\nMeanwhile, a patient at a surgery in Cardiff said: \"They are a disgrace hiding away when so many have had to work alongside the public like supermarket people, yet they are paid less than GPs.\"\nOthers said they had no issue receiving medical attention throughout the pandemic, and preferred the flexibility of phone consultations.\nGPs said far from \"hiding away\" they were holding more consultations than ever, favouring the phone when clinically appropriate in order to protect vulnerable people - not themselves.\nThey said such criticism was affecting morale.\nGareth Thomas, business manager at West Quay Medical Centre in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, said: \"We're all beginning to feel exhausted and fatigued when we see comments from a minority of patients which suggest we haven't been open, or comments we've had such as 'you lot should get back to work'.\n\"It's really disheartening that patients feel this way and perceive that we have all been work-shy throughout the pandemic which is absolutely not the case.\"\nMr Thomas said he had personally answered the phone to patients when demand was high, and worked during his annual leave to support staff.\n\"A lot of my staff including myself gave up a number of Saturdays to facilitate Covid vaccinations,\" he said.\nNo, they have been open throughout.\n\"It is a complete misconception to suggest that surgeries have been closed,\" Phil White, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee in Wales said.\n\"Appointments have always been honoured whether through video, telephone consultations or face-to-face where clinically necessary.\"\nMr Thomas added: \"Our doors are open and have always been throughout the pandemic.\n\"We cannot go back to pre-Covid times with lots of patients in one reception space and I am not sure this will ever return.\n\"What we've learnt is we really need to protect our elderly and vulnerable patients from illnesses such as influenza and Covid especially as we go into this winter.\"\n\"Face-to-face consultations are gradually increasing,\" Dr White said.\n\"But with Covid measures in place including PPE and room cleaning, each face-to-face consultation can take twice as long and so offering a range of consultations can help us to try to meet the growing need for our services whilst keeping the most vulnerable safe.\n\"Some patients told us they prefer telephone consultations and in some cases the flexibility has enabled us to treat more patients and speak to those who felt nervous about entering the practice.\"\nMr Thomas added: \"GPs as much as patients would like to go back to all face-to-face appointments and have a personal connection again with all patients.\n\"Just like everyone we all want to get back to as normal as possible, but we are just not there yet.\"\nA GP working in mid Wales, who did not wish to be named, said: \"It is about avoiding spending no longer than necessary physically in the practice.\n\"So yes in Covid times you cannot physically walk in and get an appointment, but you can phone, you can send an e-consult.\n\"Until all guidance regarding masks, social distancing and infection control are removed then we can't all just go back to normal, presuming that what you mean by normal is patients all sitting in a doctor's waiting room.\n\"By the nature of it, the patients who come into a GP practice are ill, vulnerable, frequently elderly... Is it right to expect them to all sit in a small room - as in normal pre-Covid times - especially when we know the Delta variant has much higher transmission rates?\"\nShe said recruiting staff had been \"near impossible\", and with staff members having to self-isolate or shield the logistics of juggling staff rotas had been difficult.\n\"We do not have enough numbers on the ground to cover the workload.\n\"We have undertaken more consultations during the last 16 months than we ever have done, with limited staff and constantly changing guidance from the health board and Welsh government.\n\"We also gave more flu vaccinations in autumn last year than we ever have done and then went on to provide Covid vaccines for [thousands of] patients, twice.\"\nDr White said GPs had seen a \"significant rise\" in requests for appointments and the number of mental health consultations had risen dramatically.\nMr Thomas added: \"Unfortunately every day in general practice demand outstrips capacity.\n\"The additional extra workload has been at a time when I am trying to balance patient access against staffing levels of our clinical team through to our administration and reception team.\n\"It's been really difficult mainly due to isolation rules, meaning at times we've only skeleton staff covering, with other staff including myself working extra hours to ensure a service for patients.\n\"I currently have a member of staff off with a positive Covid test as well, even although they were double vaccinated. So Covid hasn't simply gone away.\"\nAccording to the Welsh government:"

      "text": "Covid vaccines are now open to most of the UK population, but some people - particularly young black people - are still reluctant to get a jab.\nBlack adults are the most likely to be hesitant and people aged 18-21 are least likely to have a jab, according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nBBC Radio 1Xtra's If You Don't Know podcast spoke to some people who said the reason for this was the spread of misinformation.\nYouTube has removed more than 900,000 videos related to dangerous or misleading information about Covid since February 2020, according to statistics given to the podcast.\nOne person who was initially reluctant to have the vaccine because of rumours online is Grace.\nShe's a mental health nurse for the NHS, which means she was offered the vaccine right at the start of the rollout.\n\"I didn't want it for the longest time,\" the 25-year-old from Milton Keynes tells the podcast.\n\"Social media was just moving so mad, telling me all the black people are going to be infertile, they're trying to kill us all off.\"\nNot only is there no evidence that vaccines cause fertility problems in men or women, but experts say there's no realistic way they could.\nClaims to the contrary on social media are false.\nDespite being \"really shocked\" by those claims, Grace soon realised that a return to normal life wouldn't happen without having the vaccine - so she agreed to take it.\nSharnie Crooks is a student from London and has decided against booking a Covid jab in for the moment, \"simply because it hasn't been around for long enough\".\nThe 19-year-old is worried the speed that vaccines have been developed means we don't yet know about any potential long-term side effects of taking it.\n\"I personally feel as though the nation has been very much rushed into taking it and I'd like to wait for more research to just be carried out.\"\nSpeaking on the podcast, Dr Tosin Sotubo, a black doctor, says she's \"had all kinds of conversations\" about the vaccine and has heard concerns like Sharnie's.\n\"People are nervous that the vaccine is coming around too fast, wondering if we're experimenting with it, if we know the real side effects, and some have religious concerns.\"\nDr Tosin admits having to \"pause and think\" about the speed of vaccine development herself.\nBut she says people should realise \"the research and foundation of the vaccine was in the works for many years\" and governments around the world pumped money into developing a Covid jab, to help speed up the process.\n\"The vaccine didn't skip any steps, it had to pass the same safety regulations all other vaccines pass.\"\nChecks continue to happen after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks.\nAnother factor around hesitancy, she says, is the long-term differences in healthcare between white people and ethnic minorities, in things like maternal mortality rates.\nBlack women in the UK are much more likely to die from complications surrounding pregnancy and childbirth than white women, according to a 2019 report.\n\"When you see those disparities and black people are more affected in some cases, compared to their white counterparts, you have to question if we're doing enough,\" Dr Tosin says.\n\"We need to talk to the black community and educate them around the facts.\"\nShe says at times it feels like \"misinformation spreads faster than the virus\", adding: \"It's crazy how one message can go completely viral and that message becomes the 'truth'.\"\nBut she encourages people to take the jab: \"You're taking the vaccine for everyone globally.\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

      "tags": "Oil,Saudi Arabia",
      "text": "Saudi Arabian energy giant Aramco has seen its profits jump almost four times, boosted by a rise in oil prices as demand recovers.  \nThe company added that the easing of Covid restrictions, vaccinations, stimulus measures and the return of economic activity had supported results.\nCrude oil prices have risen by more than 30% since the start of the year.\nAramco's chief executive also gave an upbeat assessment for the rest of 2021.\nThe firm, which is the world's biggest oil producer, said net income rose by 288% to $25.5bn (\u00a318.4bn) for the second quarter.\n\"Our second-quarter results reflect a strong rebound in worldwide energy demand and we are heading into the second half of 2021 more resilient and more flexible, as the global recovery gains momentum,\" Amin Nasser said in a statement.\nHowever, the rise in profits was not welcomed by campaigners against climate change, who have described Aramco as the world's largest corporate greenhouse gas emitter. \nAccording to some estimates, it is responsible for more than 4% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions since 1965. \nOn Monday, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a major report that human activity was changing the climate in unprecedented and sometimes irreversible ways.\nThe head of the UN, Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said the report \"is a code red for humanity\". \nAmong those reacting to the report was Nafkote Dabi of Oxfam, who said it provided \"the most compelling wake-up call yet for global industry to switch from oil, gas and coal to renewables\".\nAramco is the latest major energy firm to report strong results in recent weeks.\nLast month, US energy giant Exxon Mobil posted a rise in income of $4.7bn in the second quarter, compared to a loss of more than $1bn for the same period last year.\nEuropean rival Royal Dutch Shell reported its highest quarterly profit in more than two years.\nWith economies easing Covid restrictions and opening up, global demand is recovering, boosting the price of oil.\nBrent crude has also been boosted to around $70 a barrel after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as Opec+, agreed to cut oil production.\nHowever, higher crude oil prices will have a knock-on effect on drivers as they push up the cost of petrol.\nLast week the UK motoring body, the RAC, said that country's petrol prices were at an eight-year-high after nine straight months of rises.\n\"Prices really are only going one way at the moment - and that's not the way drivers want to see them going,\" warned RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams."

      "tags": "Mars,Nasa,Geology,Nasa Perseverance Mars rover,Space exploration,Mars rovers",
      "text": "Engineers are trying to work out what went wrong when the US space agency's Perseverance rover tried to gather its first rock core on Mars. \nThe robot's mechanisms seemed to work perfectly but when a metal tube expected to hold the sample was examined, it was found to be empty.\nThe mission team think the particular properties of the target rock may have been to blame.\nMore images and telemetry pulled down from Mars should solve the puzzle.\n\"The initial thinking is that the empty tube is more likely a result of the rock target not reacting the way we expected during coring, and less likely a hardware issue with the sampling and caching system,\" said Jennifer Trosper, project manager for Perseverance at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. \n\"Over the next few days, the team will be spending more time analysing the data we have, and also acquiring some additional diagnostic data to support understanding the root cause for the empty tube.\"\nPerseverance has a drilling and coring system on the end of its 2m-long robotic arm. \nThis is capable of cutting and retrieving finger-sized samples of rock. These are then passed to a processing unit inside the rover's belly that packages and seals them in titanium cylinders.\nBut before sealing, a camera and probe are used to assess the amount of material recovered, and when this was done for Friday's coring attempt it became obvious the sample was missing.\nThis would not be the first time the Red Planet's surface has played hard-to-get with robots' analytical tools.\nNasa's 2007 Phoenix lander found the local soils in Mars' \"Arctic\" region to have a sticky consistency that made it difficult to get a sample into the robot's onboard laboratory. And the agency's 2018 InSight lander struggled, and ultimately failed, to drive a temperature instrument into the ground. The sub-surface was unexpectedly resistant.\nPerseverance landed on Mars in February, in a 45km-wide (30 miles) crater called Jezero. Its mission is to try to determine whether life exists, or has ever existed, on the planet.\nOne of the ways it hopes to do this is by collecting a range of rock samples for later return to Earth.\nThe initial attempt at getting a core was targeted at a rock that is suspected to represent the base material of Jezero. Scientists hope that if such a sample could be accurately dated, it would give them a timeline for everything that subsequently happened in the crater.\nJezero looks, from satellite pictures, to have hosted a lake many billions of years ago. It's the kind of environment that might have been favourable to micro-organisms.\nThomas Zurbuchen, Nasa's science director, said he had no doubt engineers would soon work out why the sample is missing.\n\"I\u2019m confident we have the right team working (on) this, and we will persevere toward a solution to ensure future success,\" he added."

Fr Maire, 60, had been welcoming the man into his church for several months, French media say.\nSister Dorothee Harushinana told Reuters news agency that the priest \"close to the people. You could always call on him.\"\nLast year's fire destroyed stained glass windows and the grand organ in the cathedral. It came months after the devastating 2019 fire at the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris."

      "title": "Extreme weather: What is it and how is it connected to climate change?",
      "tags": "Wildfires,Climate change,Severe weather,Heatwaves",
      "text": "Heatwaves, deadly floods and wildfires - this summer  people are having to confront the link between extreme weather and climate change.\nEmissions from the burning of fossil fuels have been trapping heat in the atmosphere since the start of the industrial era. As a consequence, average temperatures have risen by 1.2C. \nThis additional energy is unevenly distributed and bursts out in extremes like the ones we've been seeing this summer. Without reductions in global emissions, this cycle will keep going.\nHere are four ways climate change is contributing to extreme weather.\nTo understand the impact of small changes to average temperatures, you need to to think of them as a bell curve, with extreme cold and hot at either end, and the bulk of temperatures in the middle. A small shift in the centre means that more of the curve touches the the extremes - and so heatwaves become more frequent and extreme.\nIn the UK, warm spells have more than doubled in length in the past 50 years, according to the Met Office.\nBut the record heatwaves in Western Canada and the US were made longer and more intense by another weather phenomenon - a heat dome.\nWeeks ago, a Pacific storm, fuelled by warmer-than-normal sea temperatures, disrupted the jet stream. When a storm distorts the jet stream, which is made of currents of fast-flowing air, it is a bit like yanking a long skipping rope at one end and seeing the ripples transferring along it. \nThese waves cause everything to slow drastically and weather systems can become stuck over the same areas for days on end.\nIn an area of high pressure, hot air is pushed down and trapped in place, causing temperatures to soar over an entire continent. \nIn Lytton, Western Canada, temperatures hit 49.6C, breaking the previous record by almost 5C. Such an intense heatwave would have been virtually impossible without climate change, according to the World Weather Attribution network. \nOne theory is higher temperatures in the Arctic are causing the jet stream to slow down, increasing the likelihood of heat domes.\nAnd exceptional heat has not been limited to North America this summer. In Russia, a heatwave sent temperatures soaring - matching a 120-year record. Northern Ireland broke its temperature record three times in the same week, while a new high was set in the Antarctic continent.\nAs heatwaves become more intense and longer, droughts can worsen. \nLess rain falls between heatwaves, so ground moisture and water supplies run dry more quickly.\nAnd this in turn means the ground heats up more quickly, warming the air above and leading to more intense heat.\nDemand for water from humans and farming puts even more stress on water supply, adding to water shortages. \nAnd by mid-July, following the early summer heatwaves, more than a quarter of US land was experiencing \"extreme\" or \"exceptional\" drought.\nWildfires can be sparked by direct human involvement - but natural factors can play a huge part. \nThe cycle of extreme and long-lasting heat caused by climate change draws more and more moisture out of the ground and vegetation. \nAnd these tinder-dry conditions provide fuel for fires, which can spread at an incredible speed. \nThe impact of the heatwave on fire development was seen in an explosive fashion in western Canada this summer. \nFires developed so rapidly and explosively they created their own weather system, as pyrocumulonimbus clouds formed. \nAnd these colossal clouds produced lightning, igniting more fires.  \nThis same story is being repeated in Siberia.\nThe frequency of large wildfires has increased dramatically in recent decades. \nCompared with the 1970s, fires larger than 10,000 acres (40 sq km) are now seven times more common in western America, according to Climate Central, an independent organisation of scientists and journalists.\nIn the usual weather cycle, hot weather creates moisture and water vapour in the air, which turns into droplets to create rain. \nThe warmer it becomes, however, the more vapour there is in the atmosphere, resulting in more droplets - and heavier rainfall, sometimes in a shorter space of time and over a smaller area.\nHistoric flooding in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands has shown the devastating impact extreme rainfall events can have. \nAnd these rainfall events are connected to the impacts of climate change elsewhere, according to Peter Gleick, a water specialist from the US National Academy of Sciences.\n\"When areas of drought grow, like in Siberia and western US, that water falls elsewhere, in a smaller area, worsening flooding, like Germany and Belgium,\" he says.\nThe weather across the globe will always be highly variable - but climate change is making that more extreme. \nAnd the challenge now is not only limiting the further impact people have on the atmosphere but also adapting to and tackling the extremes we are already facing.\nTop image from Getty Images.

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "text": "A baby thought to be the world's smallest at birth has been discharged from a Singapore hospital after 13 months of intensive treatment.\nKwek Yu Xuan was just 212g (7.47oz) - the weight of an apple - when she was born and measured 24cm long.\nShe was delivered at just under 25 weeks - far short of the average 40.\nThe previous record holder was a girl in the US who weighed 245g at birth in 2018, according to the University of Iowa's Tiniest Babies Registry.\nYu Xuan's mother gave birth to her by emergency C-section four months early after she was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia - dangerously high blood pressure that can damage vital organs and be fatal for both mother and baby.\nYu Xuan now weighs a much healthier 6.3kg (14 pounds).\nThe baby girl had a \"limited chance of survival\", according to Singapore's National University Hospital (NUH) where she was born.\n\"Against the odds, with health complications present at birth, she has inspired people around her with her perseverance and growth, which makes her an extraordinary 'Covid-19' baby - a ray of hope amid turmoil,\" the hospital said in a statement.\nDuring her time in hospital, Yu Xuan was given multiple kinds of treatment and relied on different kinds of machines to survive.\nDoctors say her health and development progressed well under their care and she is now well enough to be discharged. \nYu Xuan still has chronic lung disease and will need help with her breathing at home.  However, NUH doctors say she is expected to get better with time.\nHer mother, Wong Mei Ling, told local media that Yu Xuan's birth and size came as a shock because her first child - a four-year-old boy - was delivered at term.\nYu Xuan's parents were able to pay for her long hospital stay through a crowdfunding campaign that raised S$366,884 ($270,601; \u00a3195,188)."

      "title": "Lockdown muscle loss: Five ways to get back in shape",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures",
      "text": "Millions of people missed out on regular exercise and are likely to have lost muscle mass during the Covid-19 pandemic, say experts.\nNearly a third of people believed their general strength had declined, according to a survey for the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy and Sport England. Almost a quarter (23%) of under-34s said it had dipped, either \"a bit\" or \"a lot\", while the figure was higher for those aged over 55.\nMuscle loss can lead to long-term problems with mobility and balance. Those in turn can trigger or aggravate a whole range of serious health conditions. Experts say that that those with persistent problems should seek help from a doctor or physiotherapist, but there are things that many people can do to get themselves back in shape.\nGetting started with some basic exercise is the hardest thing for many people, say the experts. Their advice: don't try to do too much.\n\"Starting small is the key to motivation,\" says Uzo Ehiogu of the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham. \"You need one small win everyday.\"\nStrengthening exercise is fundamentally about moving heavy things. But that doesn't necessarily mean big weights. Your own bodyweight can be enough. For someone who has been doing very little or no exercise during lockdown, 15 minutes of housework or gardening, or an extra thousand steps a day, could be a good place to start, he says. \n\"The single biggest factor in forming healthy habits is consistency.\" So the best way to achieve that is to set small goals which you know you can achieve. \"People with grandiose goals are much less likely to stick with them.\"\nStarting with a few push ups or half push ups, sit to stand exercises or squats and lunges - can go a long way.\nOur upper body muscles, the biceps, triceps,  pectoral or chest muscles, and trapezius muscle in back and shoulders may well have weakened during the lockdown. Lisa Osborn-Jenkins, who treats patients in Southampton, says simple things like changing the way we shop may have added to the problems. \n\"Carrying loaded shopping bags is a great strength activity. The switch to online shopping means that's gone for many people.\"\nA good way to get it back is to start doing push and pull exercises.\n\"The muscles in the front of your body are usually good at pushing, and the muscles in the back are good at pulling,\" says Mr Ehiogu. \"You should try to balance them both.\"\nSo that can mean press-ups, or three-quarter press-ups on your knees if full press-ups are too much, with initially just a few repetitions. A pull exercise can be a rowing action, using a stretch band, or a pull-up using a cheap pull-up bar on a door frame. \nAnd it doesn't need to be formal exercise. Moving things around in the garden or cleaning out a cupboard can give you the same workout. \nSimple exercises for your lower body and your core can yield big benefits, says neurological specialist Dr Caroline Appel. That means exercising the leg muscles, your bottom, abdominals and lower back. \n\"Sit to stand exercises are good way to start,\" she says, along with calf raises and stepping up and down the stairs. Just start with 10 repetitions and build up, \"Build up more slowly than you think you can,\" says Dr Appel.\nWhen you're ready, and if it's appropriate, you can move on to squats and lunges. \n\"If you don't have a lot of money for equipment, it shouldn't stop you. You can start with almost nothing.\"\nHaving a schedule written down helps us to overcome \"decision fatigue\" and stay on track says physiotherapist Ben Lombard.  \nHe points out millions of people have been missing out on incidental exercise such as walking to the station during lockdown.  So making a schedule to make up for lost exercise has become doubly important.\n\"People need to be organised with simple, smart and specific goals,\" says Patricia Smith of the University of London. That's hard to achieve without a schedule.\nMs Smith says that exercising at the same time each day can also help us to develop healthy routines. And Lisa Osborn-Jenkins says it's doubly effective if you can make it social. Exercising with others gives you two sorts of motivation: \"There's the enjoyment from being with others, and there's the all important feeling that you won't want to let them down by not turning up.\"\nLeaving your exercise kit laid out the night before is a good way to make sure you don't back out of exercising in the morning, says Mr Lombard.\n\"It's about minimising the mental barriers to exercise.\"\nIn those few minutes, perhaps when you've just woken up, seeing your kit laid out and ready, is a powerful signal that a firm decision has been made. You're doing it. \nHaving to hunt through your wardrobe for your shorts makes it much more likely that you'll back out - and next time roll over and go back to sleep.\nLikewise, Mr Ehiogu says: \"Put your trainers by the door.\"\nIf you've got out of the habit of exercise during lockdown, give yourself one less reason to avoid getting back into it now. \nIllustrations by Gerry Fletcher"

      "tags": "David Cameron,Greensill Capital,Lobbying in the United Kingdom",
      "text": "Former Prime Minister David Cameron made about \u00a33.3m from shares in the collapsed finance company Greensill Capital, documents obtained by BBC Panorama suggest.\nLast month an MPs' report accused Mr Cameron of \"a significant lack of judgement\" in lobbying the government on behalf of the company, although it said he did not break any rules.\nIn 2020, Mr Cameron tried to persuade ministers to allow Greensill - who employed him as an adviser - to join a scheme called the Corporate Covid Financing Facility (CCFF). \nThis would have allowed the company to issue loans, insured by the government, to help firms through the pandemic.  \nHowever, Mr Cameron - and the company's founder, Lex Greensill - were unsuccessful in their attempts. \nGreensill Capital collapsed this year, with the loss of 440 jobs, and possible billion-pound losses for investors.\nMr Cameron has consistently declined to say how much he was being paid by Greensill, except that it was \"far more\" than his salary as PM. \nHowever, BBC's Panorama has obtained a letter from Greensill Capital to the former PM which suggests that he made \u00a33.29m after selling a tranche of Greensill shares in 2019.  \nAs well as the shares, Mr Cameron is reported to have received a salary of $1m (\u00a3720,000) a year as a part-time adviser.\nThe programme also understands that the former prime minister was paid a bonus of $700,000 (\u00a3504,000) in 2019 on top of his salary.\nIn total, it looks like he made around $10m before tax for two-and-a-half years' part-time work.\nMr Cameron's spokesman said his remuneration was a private matter.\nMr Cameron has been accused of trying to exploit private contacts with former government colleagues, for his own benefit.\nThe former PM used private channels to lobby ministers and former colleagues.\nHe and his staff sent 45 emails, texts and WhatsApp messages concerning Greensill between 5 March and 26 June 2020.\nAmong these were nine WhatsApp messages to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and 12 text messages to Sir Tom Scholar, the Treasury's top civil servant.\nThe Bank of England has published correspondence showing that Mr Cameron had contacted senior officials several times, in an unsuccessful attempt to win their support.\nAlong with Lex Greensill, Mr Cameron met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a \"private drink\" in 2019 to discuss a new payment scheme for NHS staff.\nA report last month by the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee said that while no lobbying rules were broken, Mr Cameron's actions showed there was a \"good case for strengthening them\", with the current ones offering \"insufficient strength\".\nIt also said that the Treasury was right to reject the former PM's proposals, but it \"should have encouraged\" him into \"more formal lines of communication as soon as it had identified his personal financial incentives\".\nA Cabinet Office review commissioned by Boris Johnson also criticised Mr Cameron, and said he had understated his relationship with Greensill when lobbying the Treasury. However, it said that \"his actions were not unlawful\".\nSeveral other reviews are investigating matters related to lobbying and Greensill. \nResponding to the Treasury Committee report, Mr Cameron admitted that he should have used more formal channels, but said he had worked for Greensill primarily because he thought the firm could help small businesses during an economic crisis.\nHowever, Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner said the fact that Mr Cameron had been cleared of breaking rules proved \"that the rules that are supposed to regulate lobbying are completely unfit for purpose\".\nCurrent rules state that \"on leaving office, ministers will be prohibited from lobbying government for two years\".\nBefore accepting new jobs, former ministers are supposed to inform a body called the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba).\nAcoba advises civil servants and politicians on what they can and can't do after leaving public service. \nHowever, although former ministers are required to contact Acoba, they are not obliged to act on its advice.\nAcoba's head, Lord Pickles, has called for ex-ministers who work as lobbyists to go on a register for up to 10 years to ensure \"transparency\",\nThe company's collapse earlier this year was triggered after its insurer refused to renew cover for the loans Greensill was making. \nGreensill was the principal financial backer of Liberty Steel, which employs 3,000 people in England, Scotland and Wales.\nTalks are now underway to try to secure Liberty's future."

      "tags": "China,Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "China's carbon emissions are vast and growing, dwarfing those of other countries. \nExperts agree that without big reductions in China's emissions, the world cannot win the fight against climate change.\nIn 2020, China's President Xi Jinping said his country would aim for its emissions to reach their highest point before 2030 and for carbon neutrality before 2060. \nHis statement has now been confirmed as China's official position ahead of the COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow.\nBut China has not said exactly how these goals will be achieved.  \nWhile all countries face problems getting their emissions down, China is facing the biggest challenge. \nPer person, China's emissions are about half those of the US, but its huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions. \nChina became the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2006 and is now responsible for more than a quarter of the world's overall greenhouse gas emissions. \nIt is expected to come under intense scrutiny at the COP26 summit over its commitments to reduce these. \nAlong with all the other signatories to the Paris Agreement in 2015, China agreed to make changes to try to keep global warming at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and \"well below\" 2C.\nChina strengthened its commitments in 2020, but Climate Action Tracker, an international group of scientists and policy experts say its current actions to meet that goal are \"highly insufficient\".  \nGetting China's emissions down is achievable, according to many experts, but will require a radical shift.\nCoal has been the country's main source of energy for decades.\nPresident Xi says China will \"phase down\" coal use from 2026 - and will not build new coal-fired projects abroad - but some governments and campaigners say the plans are not going far enough. \nResearchers at Tsinghua University in Beijing say China will need to stop using coal entirely for generating electricity by 2050, to be replaced by nuclear and renewable energy production. \nAnd far from shutting down coal-fired power stations, China is currently building new ones at more than 60 locations across the country, with many sites having more than one plant.\nNew stations are usually active for 30 to 40 years, so China will need to reduce the capacity of newer plants as well as close old ones if it is to bring emissions down, says researcher Philippe Ciais of the Institute of Environment and Climate Science in Paris.   \nIt may be possible to retrofit some to capture emissions, but the technology to do so at scale is still developing, and many plants will have to be written off after minimal use. \nChina argues it has a right to do what Western countries have done in the past, releasing carbon dioxide in the process of developing its economy and reducing poverty.\nIn the short term, Beijing has ordered coal mines to increase production to avoid power shortages over the coming winter. Surging demand from heavy industry in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to shortages in several regions of the country in recent weeks.\nTsinghua University researchers say 90% of power should come from nuclear and renewables by 2050.\nIn moving towards that goal, China's lead in the manufacture of green technology, such as solar panels and large-scale batteries, may be a big help. \nChina first embraced green technologies as a means to tackle air pollution, a serious problem for many cities. \nBut the government also believes they have enormous economic potential, providing jobs and income for millions of Chinese, as well as reducing China's dependence on foreign oil and gas.\n\"China is already leading the global energy transition,\" says Yue Cao of the Overseas Development Institute. \"One of the reasons we are able to deploy cheaper and cheaper green technology is China.\" \nChina generates more solar power than any other country. That might not be so impressive given China's enormous population, but it is a sign of where the country is heading.\nChina's wind power installations were more than triple those of any other country in 2020.\nChina says the proportion of its energy generated from non-fossil fuel sources should be 25% by 2030, and it is expected by many observers to hit the target early. \nChina ranks seventh in the world for its percentage of car sales that are electric, but given its huge size, China makes and buys more electric cars than any other country by a considerable margin. \nCurrently, about one in 20 cars bought in China is electric-powered.\nBy 2035, Chinese officials and car industry representatives are predicting that almost all new vehicles sold in China will be fully electric-powered or hybrid.\nWorking out by how much the shift to electric vehicles reduces emissions is not straightforward - particularly when taking into account manufacturing and charging sources. \nBut studies suggest that emissions over the lifetimes of electric vehicles are typically below those of petrol and diesel equivalents. \nThis matters because transport is responsible for around a quarter of carbon emissions from fuel combustion, with road vehicles being the largest emitters. \nChina will also by 2025 be producing batteries with double the capacity of those produced by the rest of the world combined.\nObservers say that will enable the storage and release of energy from renewable sources on a previously impossible scale.\nGetting to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions doesn't mean that China will stop producing emissions.\nIt means China will cut emissions as much as possible and absorb what's left, through a combination of different approaches.\nIncreasing the area of land covered in vegetation will help, as plants absorb carbon dioxide.\nHere again, there is encouraging news. China is getting greener at a faster rate than any other country, largely as a result of its forestry programmes designed to reduce soil erosion and pollution.\nIt is also partly a result of replanting fields to produce more than one harvest per year, which keeps land covered in vegetation for longer. \nThe world needs China to succeed. \n\"Unless China decarbonises, we're not going to beat climate change,\" says prof David Tyfield of the Lancaster Environment Centre.\nChina has some big advantages, particularly its capacity to stick to long-term strategies and mobilise large-scale investments.  \nThe Chinese authorities are facing a colossal task. What happens next could hardly be more important."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\nCovid is \"still here\" so the Scottish government is reluctant to call today \"freedom day\", Health Secretary Humza Yousaf says. But for those living in Scotland, the day where almost all remaining coronavirus restrictions are lifted has arrived. Level zero restrictions have ended so large outdoor gatherings can now take place and hospitality venues are allowed to open at full capacity. However, some restrictions remain. \"I would enjoy this day but also please remember that the virus is still with us,\" says the health secretary.\nAs students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland gear up to receive their A-level results on Tuesday, the head of the exams watchdog says they can feel satisfied that their grades are fair. Teacher assessments give a \"much more accurate reflection\" of achievements, according to Simon Lebus from Ofqual. Grades have been based on teachers' estimates, rather than exams, for a second year due to the pandemic. The Scottish Highers results are also being released on the same day.\nWaiting lists for vital heart care were \"far too long\" before the pandemic, says the British Heart Foundation as it warns they could get even longer. It says the numbers of people waiting for heart surgery in England could rise by more than 40% by next spring. It predicted patients who didn't come forward during the pandemic would do so now. And unless the government, which invested \u00a31bn this year, spends more money it will take up to five years for cardiac services to return to pre-Covid levels, the charity says. \nAs Wales moves into alert level zero, all businesses can reopen with risk assessments, although face masks in many indoor venues will remain. But what about GP surgeries, which have been using initial phone consultations and only holding face-to-face appointments when necessary? We've taken a look.\nKwek Yu Xuan - born at just under 25 weeks and weighing about as much as an apple - had a \"limited chance of survival\", said the hospital where she was delivered by emergency C-section four months early. Thirteen months later she's been discharged and is considered to be \"an extraordinary 'Covid-19' baby - a ray of hope amid turmoil,\" National University Hospital in Singapore says.

      "text": "Covid restrictions in Scotland have been lifted at the \"right moment\", according to the first minister.\nNicola Sturgeon admitted to feeling \"nervousness\" at the move, but said the vaccine was now giving \"significant protection\".\nLevel zero ended at midnight with almost all of the remaining anti-Covid measures now removed.\nThe legal requirement for physical distancing ends in most places and hospitality can open at full capacity.\nLarge outdoor gatherings can go ahead and nightclubs are allowed to open.\nMany clubs in Scotland opened their doors overnight for the first time since March 2020, with hundreds queuing up for the midnight reopening.\nOne clubber at the Buff Club in Glasgow told BBC Scotland: \"We are so excited for tonight. This is Freedom Day - we're ready.\"\nScotland has been under varying levels of Covid restrictions for almost 18 months.\nMs Sturgeon said in an interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain: \"I think there's always going to be nervousness when we lift restrictions after such a long period.\n\"I have to be honest that there's some butterflies in my stomach about it today, but I think it's the right moment to do this.\"\nDeputy First Minister John Swinney said care was still required when dealing with the virus, but added it was the \"right moment to act\".\n\"We've seen a sustained fall in the number of cases that we've been experiencing of Covid,\" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland.\n\"We have very high levels of vaccination as a consequence of the supremely successful vaccination programme that has been put in place, so we have a significant amount of protection.\n\"And we have the benefit that we are still in the summer period and there is an opportunity for people to be spending more time out of doors.\"\nHowever, Mr Swinney, the Scottish government's minister for Covid recovery, warned that face coverings were likely to a \"significant\" part of life in Scotland \"at least through the winter\".\n\"When I've travelled in Asia there is a common use of face coverings by individuals... and it becomes part of the cultural activity of particular countries,\" he said.\n\"I don't know if that will happen here, but I think some people will feel safer as a consequence of wearing face coverings.\"\nResponding to Mr Swinney's comments, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the threat of Covid rules lasting until 2022 would \"dismay\" people across Scotland.\n\"Nicola Sturgeon seems determined to cling on to control, even when the public health data does not support all of the government's decisions,\" he said.\n\"For instance, they have provided no evidence to explain why 12 year olds need to keep wearing face masks but 11 year olds do not.\n\"It's vital that the rules are straightforward, logical and communicated clearly. That no longer appears to be the case.\"\nThe new rules also signal the return of outdoor events of more than 5,000 people and indoor events of more than 2,000 - but they must apply for permission from local authorities and the government to go ahead.\nOn Friday it was also announced that children under 12 would no longer have to wear face coverings.\nThere are also new rules on self-isolation for close contacts of positive cases.\nDouble-vaccinated adults and all children can now avoid self-isolation if identified as a close contact so long as they are symptomless and provide a negative PCR test.\nWhole classes in schools will no longer have to stay at home if an infection is discovered, although children and adults who are higher-risk close contacts will be told to isolate.\nIn an interview with BBC Breakfast, Nicola Sturgeon said the policy of wearing face coverings in schools will be reviewed after six weeks but she doesn't know how long the requirement will be kept in place in other settings.\nThe first minister said people should be cautious, but should also \"feel positive about where we are right now\".\nEdinburgh University public health expert Prof Linda Bauld, also said caution was still needed as the Office of National Statistics infection survey showed there remained a \"reasonable amount\" of infections in the community.\n\"There are still a large number of people who are very anxious about going through this next phase. They may be clinically vulnerable and we need to think about them in our own behaviour,\" she told BBC Scotland.\n\"The virus has not gone away.\"\nHowever, Prof Bauld added she was \"really optimistic\" that Scotland was \"getting on top of the pandemic\"."

      "text": "Despite most Covid rules ending in Wales, many staff will not be back in the office on Monday - and will never return full-time in some companies.\nPrincipality and Admiral - who between them employ about 8,000 people - are developing \"hybrid\" working models, with many workers to stay at home permanently until 2022.\nWales entered alert level zero on Saturday and social distancing ended.\nIt means staff can return to the office after a risk assessment is carried out. \nHowever, Wales TUC general secretary Shavanah Taj said she was \"alarmed\" to find in a poll of workers that 25% of bosses were not complying with rules in place before the changes, and called for strong enforcement action of the new regulations. \nWhile First Minister Mark Drakeford said the country was entering the \"final lap\" of the pandemic, he warned the relaxation of rules should not be seen as a \"free-for-all\".\nThe advice to businesses remains to let staff work from home wherever possible - and it is where most of the Principality Building Society's 800 employees will stay for at least five more months, with risk assessments being carried out at its sites.\n\"We are currently upgrading our head office to develop and deliver a hybrid approach to home and office working and the majority of our colleagues will remain working from home until next year,\" said chief executive Julie-Ann Haines.\n\"There has been a fundamental shift in expectations and colleagues have told us they have seen the benefits of being able to work from home, including trading their daily commute time for increased time at home, for exercise or for personal development.\"\nThe company had surveyed its staff, Ms Haines said.\n\"The majority of colleagues answered that they would prefer a hybrid approach, where they can choose how many and what days of the week they work from home or the office. \n\"Colleagues want to be able to have the benefits that home working brings, as well as the social, training and collaboration benefits of working in the office.\"\nInsurance group Admiral - which employs 7,000 people in Cardiff, Swansea and Newport - is also being \"cautious\" and is only bringing a \"proportion\" of staff back into the office on Monday. \nThe company is another looking to embrace a hybrid model in the future, with a spokesman adding: \"We have a unique culture at Admiral and will ensure that continues to thrive, encouraging our people to spend time with their teams to work collaboratively, communicate openly and have fun.\"\nDespite the end of most Covid rules, a \"small but significant\" number of legal requirements remain - with obligations on businesses, including carrying out risk assessments before staff return. \nAnyone who has tested positive must self-isolate for 10 days, as well as close contacts who have not been fully vaccinated.\nThe rules also include ensuring good hygiene practices, that premises are well ventilated, using barriers and screens, limiting the numbers on site and controlling the use of stairs and lifts.\n\"When we last polled workers, we were alarmed that only around a quarter of bosses were fully complying with the coronavirus risk assessment law by consulting staff,\" said Ms Taj. \n\"Refreshed guidance for employers is welcome, but enforcement is key.\"\nBen Francis, policy chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses Wales, said it was \"incredibly important\" the Welsh government ran \"a strong communication campaign\" so businesses were able to \"adapt to an evolving environment\".\nHe said the return to the office was \"the very beginning of Wales' economic recovery\", adding: \"There will still be much work to do in order to shore up businesses and help them get back on track so that they can both regain ground that was lost but also continue to push forwards, pursue growth and meet their ambitions.\"\nThe country is entering a new phase of \"living with virus\", according to Ian Price, director of employers' organisation CBI Wales. \nIt represents thousands of businesses in Wales and Mr Price believes instilling a sense of confidence in the reopening process is crucial. \n\"Whether through the use of measures like face masks and risk assessments or the many processes businesses have implemented themselves to become more Covid-secure, ensuring staff and customers feel comfortable entering businesses premises is crucial to getting the Welsh economy firing again,\" he said. \nSome businesses have already changed working patterns for good - Cardiff-based IT company Zipporah moved from its large office earlier in the pandemic.\nIts new base in St Mellons can host about 15 of its 20 staff, but typically sees about five people working there each day."

      "text": "Environment Minister Zac Goldsmith has urged Conservative MPs to back the government's net zero carbon target following the publication of the UN report on climate change.\nLord Goldsmith has said today's report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \"makes appalling reading\". \nIts release comes less than three months before a key global climate summit in Glasgow known as COP26.\nBut a small group of rebel Tory MPs, led by Craig McKinlay, say they fear the costs of tackling climate change will harm poor families.\nThe environment minister told the BBC the IPCC report \"adds to the urgency and importance of making this COP a turning point.\n\"The alarm bells couldn't be clearer or louder. We really need to get behind it,\" Lord Goldsmith said.\nThe government has consistently stated that poorer households will be helped to get low-carbon, cosy homes. \nBut it hasn't yet come up with a plan to make that happen, with its Buildings Strategy delayed until the autumn.   \nThe target of net zero emissions by 2050 was in the Conservative's 2019 general election manifesto.\nBut former cabinet minister Esther McVey is one of the Tory MPs worried about the cost of changing boilers and insulating homes. \nShe said: \u201cWhat I would never want to do is bankrupt the country. We don't go green and go red as a country at the same time.\"\nLord Lawson, former Conservative chancellor and long-term climate change \u201csceptic\u201d told the prime minister:  \u201cThe [advisory] Committee on Climate Change has shown you some extraordinary estimates of the cost of decarbonising the economy \u2013 extraordinary in the sense of being highly implausible.\u201d\nLast week four articles authored by Conservatives appeared in newspapers on the same day, suggesting a co-ordinated, albeit small, anti-green initiative. \nLord Goldsmith re-tweeted an accusation by the head of Natural England, Tony Juniper, that a campaign is underway to sabotage COP26.\nSam Hall, director of the Conservative Environment Network, which says it has the support of 105 Tory MPs, said the UK has a \"huge opportunity\" to lead the world with its net zero commitment.\n\"Net zero is expected to be a net job creator overall, a way to level up Britain's industrial heartlands, and a major export opportunity for UK businesses.\n\"Investing in new industries and infrastructure to deliver net zero will be significantly cheaper than dealing with the economic damage from unchecked climate change.\n\"By supporting the next set of clean technologies, we can create economies of scale, encourage further innovation, and bring down their costs for households.\"\nSo what is the price of going green?\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has estimated the total cost of reaching net zero by 2050 could reach \u00a31.4 trillion. \nLord Lawson, says the true cost could be twice this.\nBut the OBR added that climate targets will cost the government less over the next 30 years than the price of battling the Covid-19 pandemic - if it acts quickly.\nWhat\u2019s more, it said, the costs of tackling climate change will be less than the costs of paying  for damages from climate change.\nRichard Hughes, the OBR chair, said: \u201cOur modelling of the dynamics of climate change suggests that early decisive action to tackle carbon emissions could halve the overall fiscal cost of getting to net zero.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the problem, though.\nTackling climate change requires high up-front costs in all sorts of infrastructure, including heat pumps and home insulation. \nMany of the investments will save cash in the long run \u2013 and reduce reliance on Russian gas \u2013 but the question is who will pay for the great transition. \nAlthough government sources insist they have no intention of hitting poor families, crucially ministers haven\u2019t yet agreed the details of their Heat and Buildings Strategy or their net zero Treasury strategy.\nUntil they produce policies to show how to finance the shift to net zero, they will remain vulnerable to attack.\nThere are still also questions about the scale of the costs. \nThe cost of heat pumps, for instance, should come down when they are installed at scale \u2013 as the costs of wind power have tumbled.\nThe Climate Change Committee (CCC) predicts that by 2050 the ultimate cost to the economy would be probably less than 1% of GDP.\nMembers admit, though, that there are inevitably major uncertainties in forecasting the size of the economy by then \u2013 or indeed, the cost of technology.\nThe CCC has been told by the Information Tribunal to show its workings by next month. \nIf backbench Conservatives attack the findings it will heap pressure on Boris Johnson as he prepares for the climate summit. \nHe aims to show the world that the UK can decarbonise at an acceptable cost.\nStark warnings from the new report from the IPCC of the costs of inaction will strengthen his case.\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"

      "text": "Staff at Ocado Group, the tech firm behind the online grocer, can now work abroad remotely for one month a year.\nThe move comes as firms rethink workplace policies after the pandemic.\nThe firm's chief people officer, Claire Ainscough, told the Times newspaper that its employees were still being encouraged to return to the office.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC that flexible working was \"here to stay\", but he would be urging his team to come in more.\nGovernment employees have been asked to make a \"gradual return\" to Whitehall, but Mr Kwarteng is calling for them to work from the office two to three days a week.\nUnder the Ocado Group scheme, staff who worked from home during the pandemic will be able to do their jobs remotely, subject to certain restrictions, from locations including outside the UK. \nThe scheme does not apply to Ocado Retail, the online supermarket, which is jointly owned by Ocado Group and Marks & Spencer. \nMs Ainscough said this answered a \"top question\" from staff, particularly those who had families abroad and did not want to use up their leave by spending time with them.\nOcado Group said it wanted to offer \"a balance and choice\" in response to requests from staff.\nMeanwhile, government departments have seen just a few people go back to the office, despite a recommendation that they should make a \"gradual return\" over the summer.\nAsked about home working, Mr Kwarteng told the BBC: \"I think flexible working is something that is here to stay, but I've always said that I think it's up to employers and employees to come to their own arrangements, depending on the needs of the company and the needs of the business.\n\"I don't think it makes sense to have a government diktat telling people exactly how many hours they're going to spend in the office and exactly how many hours they're going to spend at home.\nI'll be encouraging [civil servants] to come in, but of course again there'll be a degree of flexibility and that's what we're working to achieve.\"\nOne unnamed Cabinet minister told the Daily Mail that civil servants who refused to return to their offices should have their pay cut. \nBut Mr Kwarteng rejected the idea, saying it would set colleagues against each other.\nA number of other companies have announced policies on what has become known as \"hybrid working\" - allowing staff to work partly from home and partly in the office.\nSupermarket giant Asda has said it will allow staff at its head offices to \"select the best location to do their job\", including home, head office or even a store or depot.\nHowever, not all companies plan to embrace a hybrid approach. Investment bank Goldman Sachs has said it wants people to come back into the office once restrictions have ended.\nAt the same time, there is evidence that companies are facing challenges in recruiting new staff as pandemic restrictions continue to ease.\nStephen Ingham, chief executive of recruitment firm Page Group, told the BBC that in some cases, companies were now outbidding each other for staff.\n\"Talking to a lot of our clients, right the way through their businesses, from the top to the bottom, they are finding it very difficult to hire people and I think there are a lot of vacancies out there,\" he said.\nMr Ingham added that companies were also \"doing their best to keep existing staff\", so that existing salaries were being \"elevated to try to persuade staff to stay where they are\".\n\"We are now starting to see wage inflation,\" he said."

      "text": "A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit.\nIt aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough.\nThe agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade:\nEmissions\nIt was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a greenhouse gas which causes climate change.\nThis is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a \"climate catastrophe\". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. \nCoal\nFor the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.  \nHowever, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to \"phase down\" rather than \"phase out\" coal after a late intervention by China and India. \nDeveloping countries\nThe agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy.\nThere's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (\u00a372bn) a year by 2020 was missed.\nWhile some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the \"start of a breakthrough\", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. \nFossil fuel subsidies\nWorld leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas.\nHowever, no firm dates have been set.\nA flurry of other announcements were made:\nThe world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, pledged to cooperate more over the next decade in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy.\nChina has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. \nLeaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - promised to stop deforestation by 2030.\nThis is seen as vital, as tress absorb vast amounts of CO2. \nSimilar initiatives haven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed.\nA scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030 was agreed by more than 100 countries. \nMethane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. \nThe big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.\nFinancial organisations controlling $130tn agreed to back \"clean\" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries.\nThe initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets.\nHowever, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. \nMost commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed.\nOnly a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. \nCOP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 Paris Agreement. \nSix years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming \"well below\" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.\nCOP stands for \"Conference of the Parties\", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. \nThe goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach net zero by mid-century.\nNext year's COP27 summit is in Egypt.\nTop image from Getty Images.

Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "tags": "Competition and Markets Authority,Coronavirus testing,Sajid Javid",
      "text": "The health secretary has asked the competition watchdog to investigate \"excessive\" pricing and \"exploitative practices\" among PCR Covid test firms.\nIn a letter to the Competition and Markets Authority, Sajid Javid said it was time for a \"rapid high-level\" review to protect consumers.\nHolidaymakers have complained of huge prices and poor service from many of the 400-plus firms offering PCR tests.\nTests cost about \u00a375 per person on average but prices can reach hundreds.\nMr Javid wrote in his letter to CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli: \"I know that for too many people the cost of PCR testing can act as a barrier, especially for families who want to travel together. \n\"We have all experienced enormous disruption to our lives over this pandemic but it is not right if some families experience yet further disruption unnecessarily because of potentially unfair practices in the market for private travel tests.\"\nRather than wait for a long competition investigation, Mr Javid has requested immediate advice from the CMA on how to \"stamp out any exploitative behaviour in this market\".\nThe government publishes a list of companies and clinics offering testing but there have been reports that many have not got full accreditation.\nThere are reports of PCR tests being offered for as little as \u00a320, and more than \u00a3500. In addition to complaints about high charges, consumers have also reported not receiving test results or of being sent damaged PCR kits.\nAvi Lasarow, chief executive of Covid testing company Prenetics, said the decision to investigate excessive pricing was \"long overdue\". \n\"Companies on the government list must be responsible in their pricing strategies,\" he said.\n\"The list has been exploited by some testing providers luring in consumers with misleading prices and then offering tests that are up to nine times more expensive.\"\nMr Lasarow said the \"easiest way\" to make tests cheaper would be for the government to axe VAT on holiday Covid tests.\n\"If VAT was removed, a family of four flying from London to Majorca could save \u00a3166 - which would pay for the cost of the flights,\" he said.\nA spokesperson for the CMA said that as formal investigations can take a long time, in this instance it will provide advice to Mr Javid with a view to taking swift action.\n\"We are aware of concerns about the evolving markets for Covid-19 tests for international travellers. We look forward to providing the Secretary of State with advice on how best to ensure that travellers have access to tests that are affordable and reliable,\" the CMA said.\nThe government has been under pressure from the travel industry and its own MPs to ditch the costly PCR tests.\nWillie Walsh, former boss of British Airways and now director general of the International Air Travel Association, has accused PCR firms of \"profiteering\". \nAnd last week, Conservative MP Huw Merriman, chairman of the Transport Select Committee, tweeted: \"Passengers are being ripped off with expensive PCR tests.\""

      "tags": "Floods,COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change,Europe floods",
      "text": "A new study shows that the percentage of the global population at risk from flooding has risen by almost a quarter since the year 2000.\nSatellite images were used to document the rise, which is far greater than had been predicted by computer models. \nThe analysis shows that migration and a growing number of flood events are behind the rapid increase. \nBy 2030, millions more will experience increased flooding due to climate and demographic change, the authors say. \nFlooding is the environmental disaster that impacts more people than any other, say researchers. \nThat view has echoed around the world in recent weeks, with huge inundations destroying lives and property.\nIn Germany and China, record downpours overwhelmed defences, amid arguments about levels of preparation. \nOne of the challenges with flooding, according to researchers, is that most maps of where the waters will likely penetrate are based on models.\nThese simulate floods based on information such as elevation, rainfall and data from ground sensors. \nBut they have significant limitations: they fail to consider population or infrastructure changes and are unable to predict random events such as dam breaches. \nSo when Hurricane Harvey hit Texas in 2017, around 80,000 homes were flooded that were not on government risk maps. \nIn this new study, researchers looked at daily satellite imagery to estimate both the extent of flooding and the number of people exposed to over 900 large flood events between 2000 and 2018.\nThey found that between 255 and 290 million people were directly affected - and between 2000 and 2015, the number of people living in these flooded locations increased by 58-86 million. \nThis represents an increase of 20-24% in the proportion of the world population exposed to floods, some 10 times higher than previous estimates. \nThe increase was not evenly spread throughout the world. Countries with increased flood exposure were mainly in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. \nIn European and North American nations, the risk was stable or decreasing.\nAround 90% of the flood events observed by the scientists were in South and Southeast Asia, around the basins of major rivers including the Indus, Ganges-Brahmaputra and the Mekong. \n\"We were able to capture a lot of floods in Southeast Asia more than other places, because they're so slow-moving and so the clouds move, and we're able to get a really clear image of the flood,\" explained lead author Dr Beth Tellman from the University of Arizona and chief science officer at Cloud to Street, a global flood-tracking platform. \n\"But there was also just a lot of flooding, really high impactful flooding in southern Asia and Southeast Asia. There's also a large human population that settled near rivers for really important reasons [such as] agriculture,\" Dr Tellman explained. But she added that this \"also, unfortunately exposes people to a lot of flooding events\".\nOne of the puzzling aspects of the research is why people in many countries are moving into flood prone areas rather than away from them. \nWhile the global population grew by over 18% between 2000 and 2015, in areas of observed flooding, the population increased by 34%. \nDr Tellman says that one aspect of this growth is related to climate change, which is changing the locations of flood plains to encompass more people. But economics also plays an important role. \n\"Places that have flooded tend to be really cheap land for informal development, so in Guwahati, India, and Dhaka in Bangladesh, we see people moving in, and so flooded areas then become settled,\" she said.\n\"It may not be people's choice to live in those areas because they might not have a lot of agency. If there were really good public housing programmes or other options, I think people probably wouldn't choose to settle in a hazardous area.\"\nThe authors say that the key drivers of flooding are heavy rainfall, tropical storms or surges and snow and ice melt. Dam breaks represented less than 2% of floods but had the highest increased incidence in terms of population exposed. \nLooking to the future, the authors say they expect the numbers at risk of flooding to continue to rise. \nThey estimate that by 2030, there will be an extra 25 countries experiencing increasing floods in addition to the 32 being impacted at present. \n\"We estimate that an additional new 179.2 million people will be exposed to floods by 2030 in 100-year zones and most of that is due to demographic change,\" said Dr Tellman. \n\"Around 50 million people extra people will be exposed to inundation, we think, due directly to climate change explicitly.\"\nThe flooding database behind the research, said to be the largest and most accurate yet compiled, will be openly hosted here.\nThe study has been published in the journal Nature.

      "tags": "LGBT,Exeter",
      "text": "A same-sex couple who recently had their first child are calling for official forms to be more inclusive.\nKate and Gemma Fox, from Exeter, have encountered numerous forms they cannot fill in because they only offer space for the names of a mother and a father.\nThey include on Devon County Council's website, at their GP surgery and in the red book - the personal child health record given to all new parents.\nSince being contacted by the BBC, all three have said they will make changes.\nKate Fox, a lecturer at Plymouth Marjon University, said: \"It's basically everywhere. \n\"I don't think we've come across a single thing so far that has not been super heteronormative.\"\nHeteronormative is defined by Oxford English Dictionary as designating, or based on a world view which regards gender roles as fixed to biological sex and heterosexuality as the normal and preferred sexual orientation.\nAfter their son Nye was born, the couple tried to make an appointment to register his birth using Devon County Council's website but could not.\nThe council said the form had since been changed and other documentation checked to ensure this did not happen again.\nA spokesman said: \"We apologise profusely for this oversight and are grateful to the couple for alerting us to this matter.\"\nThe couple were also frustrated when they received their red book as it only offers space for the names of a mother and father.\nThe Department for Health and Social Care said: \"The red book would be updated as part of our commitment to ensuring any disparities experienced by those in the wider LGBT community are acknowledged and their needs are considered throughout the health system.\"\nThe red book is currently being updated and digitised by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and the new version is due to be made available from 2023. \nDr Fox said: \"The attempt to have a child is often a battle for same-sex couples... and then when you've had a baby and it's super celebratory and then the first pieces of paper you are given say 'mother and father' and it's just, you're almost worn out by the time you have had a baby.\n\"We certainly were exhausted with the whole thing and then you think I just don't want every little piece of official paper to have to be a battle.\"\nIn July, the couple attempted to register Nye at their local GP surgery, St Thomas Health Centre in Exeter.\nThe online form for registration only had boxes for mother and father and when they called to point this out, Dr Fox said they were told it could be sorted when they brought their son in.\nDr Fox said the paper form had the same wording and they were told to cross out father and write mother. \nShe said more shockingly, they were handed another form to register a child at the surgery and that form asked for ethnicity but only offered white ethnicities as an option and under religion, only Christian religions.\n\"I think that's what we are saying... [is] if your form does not accept or represent our family then your form doesn't work,\" she said.\n\"It's not that we're being difficult it's that your form is wrong.\"\nKayleah Logan, co-founder of the Queer Parenting Partnership, said that every month they see couples expressing their \"upset at being invalidated as a parent\".\n\"It's not just representation, it's almost erasure of LGBT families,\" Ms Logan added.\nDr Alice Godwin, GP partner at St Thomas Medical Group, said the forms were a \"serious oversight\" and added: \"We wholeheartedly agree that official forms should be fully inclusive, and we are very sorry for the distress this caused to Kate and Gemma.\"\nShe said: \"The paper version of the form they were mistakenly given was an old version, which should have been destroyed when it was updated. \n\"We have made sure that no other copies remain and are reviewing all our documentation to make sure it is inclusive.\"\nDr Godwin said the online form had also been changed and added: \"We pride ourselves on being an open and inclusive practice and these mistakes are simply not acceptable.\"\nJo Turl, from NHS Devon Clinical Commissioning Group, said it would be contacting all GP practices in Devon to ask them to review their documentation. \nShe said: \"Addressing inequalities is a priority for us so we take this matter very seriously.\"\nDr Fox called on anyone who wants to be an LGBT ally to take action by finding out what the forms at their surgery say. \nShe added: \"Don't let it be the next same-sex couple or gender non-conforming person or whoever who comes into contact with these documents who has to be the one who has the fight.\"\nSource: www.gov.uk\nFollow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "text": "David Cameron made about $10m (\u00a37m) from Greensill Capital before the finance company collapsed, documents obtained by BBC Panorama suggest.\nThe documents indicate the former prime minister received $4.5m after cashing in Greensill shares in 2019.\nGreensill, which made its money by lending to businesses, went into administration in March, leaving investors facing billions in losses.\nMr Cameron's spokesman said his remuneration was a private matter.\nGreensill collapsed after its insurer refused to renew cover for the loans it was making.\nBefore its collapse, Mr Cameron unsuccessfully tried to persuade ministers to invest taxpayers' money in Greensill loans. \nHe has since been cleared of breaking any lobbying rules, but MPs said the former prime minister showed a \"significant lack of judgement\".\nThe details about Mr Cameron's shares were revealed in a letter from Greensill Capital to the former prime minister.\nAccording to the letter, Mr Cameron was going to be paid $4,569,851.60 (about \u00a33.3m) after tax for a tranche of his Greensill shares.\nPanorama has not seen Mr Cameron's signed acceptance of the offer, but the letter records that he had already agreed to the deal.\nAs well as the shares, Mr Cameron received a salary of $1m (\u00a3720,000) a year as a part-time adviser.\nThe programme also understands that the former prime minister was paid a bonus of $700,000 (\u00a3504,000) in 2019 on top of his salary.\nIn total, it looks like he made around $10m before tax for two-and-a-half years' part-time work.\nMr Cameron's spokesman said: \"He acted in good faith at all times and there was no wrongdoing in any of the actions he took.\"\nPanorama: David Cameron and the Missing Billions is on BBC One at 19:35 BST on Monday or later on iPlayer\nPanorama has discovered how the company Mr Cameron promoted has left investors and UK taxpayers facing huge losses.\nGreensill Capital lent around $5bn (\u00a33.6bn) to GFG Alliance - a group of companies controlled by the steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta.\nGFG employs 35,000 people around the world, including more than 4,000 at steel mills in the UK.\nInternal documents reveal that Greensill Capital knew GFG was in financial trouble by the start of 2020 because it was unable to make payments on Greensill loans.\nBut Greensill used its own cash to cover repayments GFG could not afford - leaving investors unaware of the problems.\nAn email sent by a Greensill finance officer to a senior manager in April 2020 said that the unusual payments had been going on for four months.\nIt said: \"We are constantly plugging holes that GFG cannot afford to repay... It is not even robbing Peter to pay Paul, it is just recirculation of Greensill funds.\"\nA second email sent at the start of May suggests an insolvency practitioner should be sent in to review Mr Gupta's businesses. It said: \"It may well be that administration is required.\"\nInstead of raising the alarm about GFG's inability to make loan payments, Greensill Capital looked for a new investor. \nIt turned to the UK government - and David Cameron was sent in to try to make it happen.\nMr Cameron sent 56 messages lobbying ministers and senior civil servants. He wanted the Bank of England to invest more than \u00a310bn of taxpayers' money in Greensill's loans. \nThe Bank of England turned Greensill down, but in June 2020 Greensill was approved as a lender under a government scheme designed to get emergency cash to companies affected by the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan (CLBIL) scheme run by the government-owned British Business Bank allowed Greensill to make loans backed by an 80% taxpayer guarantee. \nGreensill was only supposed to lend a maximum of \u00a350m to a single borrower or group of companies under the CLBIL scheme.\nBut Greensill Capital lent Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance \u00a3350m by making seven taxpayer-backed loans of \u00a350m to seven of his companies.\nGreensill also made an eighth loan of \u00a350m to another company closely associated with Mr Gupta.\nThe companies have all failed to make repayments on the taxpayer-backed loans.\nThe government guarantee has been suspended while the loans are investigated - but that is being challenged and the taxpayer could still lose \u00a3320m.\nMr Gupta's company, GFG Alliance, and its financing arrangements with Greensill Capital, are now being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office.\nGFG Alliance said it takes the investigation seriously and that all allegations of improper conduct are denied in the strongest terms. \nThe company said it has been working tirelessly to stabilise the businesses affected by the collapse of Greensill and deliver refinancing. \nGFG said: \"We remain fully committed to UK industry and to a solution that will enable GFG to repay creditors and create a sustainable future for its UK businesses.\" \nLex Greensill, the founder of Greensill Capital, said the government guarantee on the loans should not be withdrawn.\n\"Our access to any government-backed schemes with respect to funding our clients has always drawn upon robust advice from leading law firms to ensure Greensill complied with relevant rules,\" he said.\nHe also said he was not aware his staff had recommended sending in an insolvency practitioner to GFG.\nMr Cameron's spokesman said he was not involved in lending decisions and had no knowledge of GFG's financial situation.\n\"He was a part-time adviser to the company - one of several - and had no Executive or Board responsibilities whatsoever,\" he said.\n\"He made the representations he did to the UK government not just because he thought it would benefit the company, but because he sincerely believed there would be a material benefit for UK businesses at a challenging time.\"\nPanorama has also discovered how investors were misled about Greensill Capital's investments.\nGreensill made money through supply chain finance - which involves making loans to companies that are waiting for invoices to be paid by their customers.\nWhen the invoices were paid, the cash would be there to pay investors back, with interest.\nTo fund the loans, it teamed up with Swiss bank Credit Suisse, which raised $10bn from investors.\nIt was the Swiss bank's job to market and sell the Greensill investments, and to inform investors about potential risks. \nInvestors thought their cash was safe, because it was supposed to be secured against the unpaid invoices.\nBut this year it was revealed that some of the invoices simply did not exist.\nUS court papers show how between 2018 and 2021, Greensill lent $850m of investors' cash to a US coal company called Bluestone Resources.\nOnly $70m of that money was secured against real invoices for coal that Bluestone had actually sold.\nInvestors did not know it, but the remaining $780m was only backed by predicted coal sales that may or may not happen in the future. \nLex Greensill told Panorama that this type of financing was commonplace in the financial services industry.\nHe said the predicted Bluestone business was all \"based upon future trade that is likely to occur with current customers\".\nPanorama discovered that was not true.\nThe programme obtained the names of the companies that Lex Greensill said were current customers of Bluestone.\nSix of the companies said they were not Bluestone customers and they weren't planning to buy its coal in the future.\nLex Greensill later told Panorama the coal buyers did not have to be current customers. Bluestone only had to state it expected to make the sales at some future point and Greensill was not obliged to make checks, he said.\nMr Greensill denied misleading investors. He said his company made all the appropriate disclosures to Credit Suisse and the Swiss Bank was \"solely responsible for making any disclosures to their investors\".\nHe said the loans were always secured against assets and personal guarantees, and were backed up by insurance that would pay 100% of any shortfall. \nCredit Suisse says its focus is on returning cash to investors and that 59% has been returned so far.\nPanorama: David Cameron and the Missing Billions is on BBC One at 19:35 BST on Monday or later on iPlayer"

      "text": "At least 27 children have been killed in Afghanistan in three days amid fierce fighting between the Taliban and government forces, the UN has said.\nThe UN children's agency Unicef said it was shocked by the \"rapid escalation of grave violations against children\".\nThe Taliban have been making major advances across the country as foreign troops withdraw, taking six regional capitals since Friday.\nThey have rejected international calls for a ceasefire.\nMore than 1,000 civilians have been killed as a result of the conflict in the past month. \nIn a statement on Monday, Unicef said the atrocities being committed against children were growing \"higher by the day\". \nThe 27 fatalities were recorded across three provinces - Kandahar, Khost, and Paktia. Some 136 children were also injured in these areas over the past three days, Unicef said. \n\"Afghanistan has long been one of the worst places on Earth to be a child but in recent weeks and, indeed, the last 72 hours, that's got a lot worse,\" Unicef Afghanistan's Samantha Mort told the BBC.\nChildren have been killed and injured in roadside bombs and in the crossfire. One mother told the group that her family were asleep over the weekend when their home was hit by shrapnel, which started a fire and left her 10-year-old son with \"horrific burns\". Many children are also sleeping outside after fleeing their homes. \nUnicef has called on all sides to ensure that children are protected. \nViolence has escalated across Afghanistan now that US-led forces have all but withdrawn following 20 years of military operations. \nThe Taliban have rapidly captured large swathes of countryside, and are now targeting towns and cities.\nIn their most significant gain since May, the Taliban are reported to have overrun the northern city of Kunduz. \nThe city of 270,000 people is considered a gateway to mineral-rich northern provinces. It is in a strategically important location close to the border with Tajikistan, which is used for the smuggling of opium and heroin. \nIt also holds symbolic significance for the Taliban because it was a key northern stronghold before 2001. The militants captured the city in 2015 and again in 2016 but have never been able to hold it for long. \nAfghan officials say security forces are still fighting in the city.\nThe southwestern city of Zaranj was the first provincial capital to fall to the group under their sweeping offensive. \nThe northern cities of Sheberghan, Sar-e-Pul, Taloqan and Aybak are now also reported to be under Taliban control. \nThe insurgents entered Aybak, the capital of Samangan province, without a fight after community elders asked for the city to be spared more violence, deputy governor Sefatullah Samangani told AFP news agency.\n\"The governor accepted and withdrew all the forces from the city,\" he said.\nTolo News and Shamshad TV also tweeted that Afghan forces had retreated from the city without fighting. There was no immediate word from the armed forces.\nElsewhere, US and Afghan planes have been carrying out airstrikes - the advance of the militants has not been halted, but Afghan officials say dozens of Taliban have died. \nHeavy fighting has been reported in Pul-e-Khumri and in Mazar-e-Sharif, a trading hub on the border with Uzbekistan. Army commanders say they have pushed back militants from its outskirts. \nOn Monday morning a loud explosion was heard outside police headquarters in the southern city of Lashkar Gah, where the two sides have been fighting for more than a week.\nResidents said about 20 civilians had been killed in the past two days, and a school and a clinic destroyed.\nThe capture of several cities and ongoing heavy fighting in others has led thousands of civilians to flee. Families, some including young children and pregnant women, have abandoned their homes and headed for the capital Kabul.\nThe US Department of Defense on Monday said the security situation in Afghanistan was \"not going in the right direction\", but that Afghan security forces were capable of fighting the group. \n\"These are their military forces, these are their provincial capitals, their people to defend and it's really going to come down to the leadership that they're willing to exude here at this particular moment,\" spokesman John Kirby said."

Jurors have also heard that both the police and MI5 decided against arresting Amman two days before the Streatham attack, in which a man and a woman were injured.\nThe superintendent responsible for the firearms strategy on the day Amman struck, known only as BX88 to protect his identity, told the inquest: \"In the context of an armed operation, one person lost his life and others were injured.\n\"I have reflected a great deal and I have to say, I have been back through this in my mind from a personal perspective, I don't see how we could have achieved a more effective result with the circumstances presented to us.\n\"I know that sounds harsh because Amman lost his life. We were responding to his actions, and his actions were attempting to kill people.\"\nThe witness added: \"I think the mitigation measures in place were incredibly successful to manage that risk. We don't work in a risk-free environment.\"\nThe inquest also heard that the operation's tactical firearms commander (TFC) had not been told Amman had left his probation hostel and been spotted carrying a white JD Sports bag shortly before the attack.\nJonathan Hough QC, counsel to the inquest, told jurors that logs from the day showed an officer tried to contact the TFC after the 20-year-old left his hostel, but could not get through so left a voicemail.\nThe commander, known as DS51, said she was likely to have been on a call to officers about an unrelated operation at the time but she \"never had a missed call or a voicemail\".\nDS51 added that she was in \"total disbelief\" when she learnt what had happened to Amman.\n\"I was shocked that he had stabbed members of public and had subsequently been shot by police,\" she said.\nLast week, the senior officer investigating Amman at the time of the attack denied suggestions from the lawyer of the 20-year-old's family that the undercover operation had been a \"massive failure\".\nThe officer, known as HA6, said: \"The professionalism and the bravery of those officers and what they prevented... it could have been far, far worse.\"\nWhile in prison Amman had apparently signalled his intent to strike once back in the community, the inquest jury has heard.\nPolice were so concerned about Amman's unrepentant behaviour in Belmarsh that they asked the prison governor not to release him. However, the request was turned down because the nature of Amman's conviction meant he was legally entitled to be released from prison.\nThe inquest continues."

      "text": "Vodafone has become the second UK mobile company to reintroduce roaming charges for users travelling in Europe.\nFrom January, new and upgrading customers will be charged at least \u00a31 a day to use their mobile phone in EU destinations, on several tariffs. \nIt follows similar plans from rival EE, announced in June.\nInitially, all operators said they would not reintroduce a roaming charge after Brexit, despite having the option to.\nVodafone's approach is to limit those that include roaming in Europe to \"selected plans\", including its more expensive options .\nThe rules will change for new and upgrading customers from Wednesday, 11 August, though the charges will not apply until January.\n\"Existing customers will not be impacted by these changes while they remain on their current price plan, and roaming in the Republic of Ireland will still be included for all customers,\" Vodafone said.\nAfter January, affected customers can pay \u00a32 a day to use their allowance in Europe - \u00a31 if bought in an eight or 15-day bundle.\nFair-usage limits also apply at 25GB of roaming data a month.\nSince 2017, UK consumers have, within reason, been able to use their mobile-phone tariffs - calls, texts and data - as freely in the EU as at home.\nBut when the EU trade deal was signed in December 2020, it opened the door to users being charged when travelling in Europe. \nWhile the agreement encouraged operators to have \"transparent and reasonable rates\", it did not ban the charges outright.\nEE was the first to break ranks, with its \u00a32 daily charge to 47 European destinations, which will also kick in from January. \nIts customers will also not be charged to use their phones in the Republic of Ireland.\nCurrently, O2 allows a roaming limit of 25GB, with any data used over that charged at \u00a33.50 per gigabyte.\nThree has cut its fair-use data limit from 20GB a month to 12GB when in Europe.\nIt charges \u00a33 per gigabyte above that.\nUswitch mobile analyst Ernest Doku, said: \"In the aftermath of Brexit, the UK's biggest mobile providers all said that they had no immediate plans to change their charging models for consumers roaming within the EU.\n\"It's disappointing for consumers to see that the situation looks to be shifting, with a risk that roaming at no additional cost could soon be a distant memory for UK residents.\"\nTravellers should check the small print if they were due an upgrade in coming months, Mr Doku said.\n\"Always use hotel and cafe wi-fi when on holiday, where possible,\" he added.\nBut Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said the price changes were a \"harsh reality\" of Brexit.\n\"Wholesale roaming rates will change given UK's exit, and this in turn will inevitably drive higher prices without EU protection. It's a pretty easy decision for UK telcos,\" he said.\nAll the operators \"are struggling with margins being squeezed, and are seeking ways of increasing revenue while investing billions in costly next generation fixed and mobile networks\", he added."

      "tags": "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,Effects of global warming,COP26,United Nations,Climate change",
      "text": "The world's largest ever report into climate change will be published later, setting out the stark reality of the state of the planet.\nThe study is by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - a UN group that looked at more than 14,000 scientific papers.\nIt will be the most up-to-date assessment of how global warming will change the world in the coming decades.\nScientists say it will likely be bad news - but with \"nuggets of optimism\".\nAnd environmental experts have said it will be a \"massive wake-up call\" to governments to cut emissions.\nThe last time the IPCC looked at the science of global warming was in 2013 - and scientists believe they have learnt a lot since then.\nIn recent years, the world has seen record-breaking temperatures, raging wildfires and devastating flooding. \nSome papers studied by the panel show that some of the changes humans are inadvertently making to the climate will not be reversed for hundreds or maybe thousands of years. \nThe IPCC's findings - which will be revealed at a press conference at 09:00 BST - will also be used during a major summit hosted by the UK in November.\nThe summit, COP26, which is run by the UN, is seen as a critical moment if climate change is going to be brought under control. Leaders from 196 countries will meet to try and agree action. \nAlok Sharma, the UK minister who is leading the summit, said at the weekend that the world was almost running out of time to avoid catastrophe - and the effects of climate change were already happening.\nThe intergovernmental panel brings together representatives of world governments who appraise research by scientists. That means all governments buy into the findings. \nThe last panel was in 2013 and researchers say much has firmed up since then. \nPreviously, for instance, they were reluctant to ascribe extreme events such as heatwaves and torrential rain to being at least partly down to climate change. \nNow in the case of the heatdome in the US in June, they're confident to say it would have been almost impossible without climate change. \nThey say the world will continue to get hotter. \nIt will also - especially in northern Europe - get wetter, though droughts will increase too as weather patterns shifts. \nThe panel studied papers showing that sea level would continue to rise for hundreds or possibly thousands of years because of heat already trapped in the ocean deep. \nResearch does confirm though, that if politicians can stick to holding global temperature increase down to 1.5C, on pre-industrial times, the worst catastrophes can still be avoided.\nProf Piers Forster, an expert in climate change from the University of Leeds, said the report \"will be able to say a whole lot more about the extremes we are experiencing today and it will be able to be categoric that our emissions of greenhouse gases are causing them and they are also going to get worse\".\n\"The report will come with quite a lot of bad news about where we are and where we're going, but there are going to be nuggets of optimism in there which I think are really good for the climate change negotiations,\" he told LBC.\nOne of the causes for optimism he mentioned was that there is still a chance of keeping global warming to below 1.5 degrees. \nExperts say the impacts of climate change are far more severe when the increase is greater than 1.5C. So far, global temperatures have climbed to 1.2C above pre-industrial levels.\nThe Paris climate agreement in 2015 established the goal of keeping the increase in the global average temperature to no more than 2C and to try not to surpass 1.5C. \nRichard Black, from non-profit advisory group the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: \"Coming just before COP26, this report is a massive wake-up call to all those governments that have not yet put forward realistic plans to cut emissions over the next decade.\n\"It will show that choices made now have a big effect on our future - leading to a runaway world of wild weather impacts and incalculable risks at one end, and at the other a future where climate change is constrained within manageable bounds.\"\nAccording to many observers, there have been significant improvements in the science in the last few years.\n\"Our models have gotten better, we have a better understanding of the physics and the chemistry and the biology, and so they're able to simulate and project future temperature changes and precipitation changes much better than they were,\" said Dr Stephen Cornelius from WWF, an observer at IPCC meetings.\n\"Another change has been that attribution sciences have increased vastly in the last few years. We can make greater links between climate change and extreme weather events.\" \nAs well as updates on temperature projections, there will likely be a strong focus on the question of humanity's role in creating the climate crisis. \nIn the last report in 2013, the IPCC said that humans were the \"dominant cause\" of global warming since the 1950s.\nThe message in the latest report is expected to be even stronger, with warnings of how soon global temperatures could rise 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Experts say the impacts of climate change are far more severe when the increase is greater than 1.5C.\nIt is expected that this time the IPCC will also outline just how much of an influence humans are having on the oceans, the atmosphere and other aspects of our planetary systems.  \nOne of the most important questions concerns sea-level rise. This has long been a controversial issue for the IPCC, with their previous projections scorned by some scientists as far too conservative.\n\"In the past they have been so reluctant to give a plausible upper limit on sea-level rise, and we hope that they finally come around this time,\" said Prof Arthur Petersen, from UCL in London.\nAs the world has experienced a series of devastating fires and floods in recent months that have been linked to climate change, the report will also include a new chapter linking extreme weather events to rising temperatures.  \nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a UN body set up in 1988 to assess the science around climate change.\nThe IPCC provides governments with scientific information they can use to develop policies on global heating.\nThe first of its comprehensive Assessment Reports on climate change was released in 1992. The sixth in this series will be split into four volumes, the first of which - covering the physical science behind climate change - will be published on Monday. Further parts of the review will cover impacts and solutions.\nA summary has been approved in a process involving scientists and representatives of 195 governments. \nWhat concerns do you have around climate change and this report?

Her abuser was convicted 27 years later.  \nBy the time she applied to the Criminal Injuries and Compensation Authority Ms Mitchell was told she was no longer eligible because of her own conviction.\nThe rule, which bars crime victims from compensation if they have an unspent conviction, was introduced in 2012.\nSome victims' organisations argue it disproportionately affects victims of child sex abuse. \nIn 2018, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse (IICSA) recommended the rule be revised. \nThe government said it would consult on the IICSA recommendations but then said an internal review had been conducted and the rule would not be changed.\nMs Mitchell challenged the justice secretary's decision and High Court judge Mrs Justice Lang on Monday ordered Robert Buckland to conduct a public consultation.\nThe Criminal Injuries and Compensation Authority oversees compensation awards in England, Wales and Scotland.\nMs Mitchell said: \"It shouldn't take a court case to make the government do what it has promised.\n\"But I'm pleased this decision means victims of child abuse like me can now tell policy makers directly how the rule affects us. \n\"The rule is unfair and must be changed.

      "text": "Staff at Ocado Group, the tech firm behind the online grocer, can now work abroad remotely for one month a year.\nThe move comes as firms rethink workplace policies after the pandemic.\nThe firm's chief people officer, Claire Ainscough, told the Times newspaper that its employees were still being encouraged to return to the office.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC that flexible working was \"here to stay\", but he would be urging his team to come in more.\nGovernment employees have been asked to make a \"gradual return\" to Whitehall, but Mr Kwarteng is calling for them to work from the office two to three days a week.\nUnder the Ocado Group scheme, staff who worked from home during the pandemic will be able to do their jobs remotely, subject to certain restrictions, from locations including outside the UK. \nThe scheme does not apply to Ocado Retail, the online supermarket, which is jointly owned by Ocado Group and Marks & Spencer. \nMs Ainscough said this answered a \"top question\" from staff, particularly those who had families abroad and did not want to use up their leave by spending time with them.\nOcado Group said it wanted to offer \"a balance and choice\" in response to requests from staff.\nMeanwhile, government departments have seen just a few people go back to the office, despite a recommendation that they should make a \"gradual return\" over the summer.\nAsked about home working, Mr Kwarteng told the BBC: \"I think flexible working is something that is here to stay, but I've always said that I think it's up to employers and employees to come to their own arrangements, depending on the needs of the company and the needs of the business.\n\"I don't think it makes sense to have a government diktat telling people exactly how many hours they're going to spend in the office and exactly how many hours they're going to spend at home.\nI'll be encouraging [civil servants] to come in, but of course again there'll be a degree of flexibility and that's what we're working to achieve.\"\nOne unnamed Cabinet minister told the Daily Mail that civil servants who refused to return to their offices should have their pay cut. \nBut Mr Kwarteng rejected the idea, saying it would set colleagues against each other.\nA number of other companies have announced policies on what has become known as \"hybrid working\" - allowing staff to work partly from home and partly in the office.\nSupermarket giant Asda has said it will allow staff at its head offices to \"select the best location to do their job\", including home, head office or even a store or depot.\nHowever, not all companies plan to embrace a hybrid approach. Investment bank Goldman Sachs has said it wants people to come back into the office once restrictions have ended.\nAt the same time, there is evidence that companies are facing challenges in recruiting new staff as pandemic restrictions continue to ease.\nStephen Ingham, chief executive of recruitment firm Page Group, told the BBC that in some cases, companies were now outbidding each other for staff.\n\"Talking to a lot of our clients, right the way through their businesses, from the top to the bottom, they are finding it very difficult to hire people and I think there are a lot of vacancies out there,\" he said.\nMr Ingham added that companies were also \"doing their best to keep existing staff\", so that existing salaries were being \"elevated to try to persuade staff to stay where they are\".\n\"We are now starting to see wage inflation,\" he said."

Just 21% of the blaze is contained, according to officials. \nIt is second in size only to last year's August Complex fire, which burned through more than 1m acres, and is currently around 2.5 times the size of New York City.\nFour people are missing and thousands have been evacuated, some of those now residing in tents. About 39% of Pumas County is under an evacuation order. \n\"We're seeing fire activity that even veteran firefighters haven't seen in their career,\" Edwin Zuniga, a spokesman for Cal Fire told the Washington Post. \n\"So we're just in really uncharted territory,\" he said. \nMore than 5,000 firefighters are currently tackling the Dixie Fire. \nAfter ravaging through Greenville last Wednesday, the fire is now threatening the small town of Crescent Mills, three miles (five kilometres) southeast of Greenville. \nAuthorities have warned that low moisture levels have made the area vulnerable to fast-spreading fires. \nIn a video briefing on Sunday, a California fire official said that living trees in the area now contain less moisture than a plank of wood bought at a lumberyard.\n\"It's that dry, so it doesn't take much for any sort of embers, sparks or small flaming front to get that going,\" said California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection section chief Mark Brunton.\nAccording to the National Interagency Fire Center, there are wildfires across 15 states in the country. There are about 107 large blazes that have burned through more than two million acres. \nIt warned of a \"high potential for severe wildfire activity throughout the western United States through the rest of summer and into the fall\". \nOn Saturday, California's Governor Gavin Newsom said that \"we need to acknowledge just straight up these are climate-induced wildfires\".\nClimate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires. \nThe world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions."

She really \"missed being around people\".\nShe says remote learning helped her in a way -  she lives with her grandmother and her family were very cautious - but she was upset when the exams were cancelled.\n\"There is still a part of me that thinks, I would feel more deserving if I sat the exams - but I realise it is out of my control.\"\nCollege principal Jo Maher said it may have been a challenging year, but the students have been amazingly resilient, and that her staff could not have worked harder.\nFinn says he in a state of \"slight disbelief\" that he's done so well, getting the grades to study law at Oxford University.\n\"Uncertainty has been the overriding aspect of this experience - but I like challenges,\" he says.\n\"There is a lot of talk about grade inflation and I appreciate that is a real concern - but ultimately in the circumstances that have prevailed, the alternatives would not have been fair.\" \nOur experts are on hand to answer your questions about this year's results.\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

Geronimo is the poster boy for doing a better job than what we have done in the past.\"\nThe prime minister's father has joined the campaign to save Geronimo.\nStanley Johnson said the animal should be given \"a stay of execution\".\nMr Johnson, a former Tory MEP and who writes about wildlife for The Sun newspaper, said he had spoken to Ms Macdonald over the weekend.\n\"As far as I'm concerned it is absolutely possible and necessary for the secretary of state George Eustice to have a stay of execution,\" he said.\n\"Why? Because when this animal was tested when he came to England, yes there might have been a positive result, and the owner thinks it was a false positive, but that is several years ago.\n\"An animal that is diseased would not have survived five years, that is for sure.\n\"There is a case, surely, to let this lady have one test now, she says there is a new test now, surely that is the right thing to do - not just to say 'the law must take its course'.\n\"It's really quite a simple thing to say. This animal should be tested.\n\"Good sense should prevail, and George Eustice is a man of impeccable good sense.\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "Apple has defended its new system that scans users' phones for child sexual abuse material (CSAM), after a backlash from customers and privacy advocates. \nThe technology searches for matches of known abuse material before the image is uploaded to its iCloud storage.\nCritics warned it could be a \"backdoor\" to spy on people, and more than 5,000 people and organisations have signed an open letter against the technology. \nAs a result, Apple has pledged not to \"expand\" the system for any reason.\nDigital privacy campaigners warned last week that authoritarian governments could use the technology to bolster anti-LGBT regimes, or crack down on political dissidents in countries where protests are deemed illegal.\nBut Apple said it would \"will not accede to any government's request to expand\" the system.\nIt published a question-and-answer document, saying it had numerous safeguards in place to stop its systems from being used for anything other than the detection of child abuse imagery. \n\"We have faced demands to build and deploy government-mandated changes that degrade the privacy of users before, and have steadfastly refused those demands. We will continue to refuse them in the future,\" it said.\nHowever, Apple has made some concessions in the past in order to keep operating in countries around the world. \nLast New Year's Eve, the tech giant removed 39,000 apps from its Chinese App Store amid a crackdown on unlicensed games by authorities in the country. \nApple also said its anti-CSAM tool will not allow the company to see or scan a user's photo album. It will only scan photos that are shared on iCloud.\nThe system will look for matches, securely on the device, based on a database of hashes of known CSAM images provided by child safety organisations.\nApple also claims it is nearly impossible to falsely flag innocent people to police. \"The likelihood that the system would incorrectly flag any given account is less than one in one trillion per year,\" it said. There is also a human review of positive matches.\nPrivacy advocates, however, have argued that the only thing preventing that technology being turned to other uses is Apple's promise that it will not be.\nDigital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation, for example, said that \"all it would take... is an expansion of the machine learning parameters to look for additional types of content\".\n\"That's not a slippery slope; that's a fully-built system just waiting for external pressure to make the slightest change,\" it warned.\nApple also provided reassurances regarding another new feature that will warn children and their parents using linked family accounts, when sexually explicit photos are sent or received. \nThe company says its two new features do not use the same technology, and says it will \"never\" gain access to users' private communications. \nWhile there was a backlash regarding Apple's announcement from privacy advocates, some politicians welcomed the new technology. \nUK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said it was time for others, especially Facebook, to follow suit."

      "tags": "Mobile phones,Vodafone,Brexit",
      "text": "Vodafone has become the second UK mobile company to reintroduce roaming charges for users travelling in Europe.\nFrom January, new and upgrading customers will be charged at least \u00a31 a day to use their mobile phone in EU destinations, on several tariffs. \nIt follows similar plans from rival EE, announced in June.\nInitially, all operators said they would not reintroduce a roaming charge after Brexit, despite having the option to.\nVodafone's approach is to limit those that include roaming in Europe to \"selected plans\", including its more expensive options .\nThe rules will change for new and upgrading customers from Wednesday, 11 August, though the charges will not apply until January.\n\"Existing customers will not be impacted by these changes while they remain on their current price plan, and roaming in the Republic of Ireland will still be included for all customers,\" Vodafone said.\nAfter January, affected customers can pay \u00a32 a day to use their allowance in Europe - \u00a31 if bought in an eight or 15-day bundle.\nFair-usage limits also apply at 25GB of roaming data a month.\nSince 2017, UK consumers have, within reason, been able to use their mobile-phone tariffs - calls, texts and data - as freely in the EU as at home.\nBut when the EU trade deal was signed in December 2020, it opened the door to users being charged when travelling in Europe. \nWhile the agreement encouraged operators to have \"transparent and reasonable rates\", it did not ban the charges outright.\nEE was the first to break ranks, with its \u00a32 daily charge to 47 European destinations, which will also kick in from January. \nIts customers will also not be charged to use their phones in the Republic of Ireland.\nCurrently, O2 allows a roaming limit of 25GB, with any data used over that charged at \u00a33.50 per gigabyte.\nThree has cut its fair-use data limit from 20GB a month to 12GB when in Europe.\nIt charges \u00a33 per gigabyte above that.\nUswitch mobile analyst Ernest Doku, said: \"In the aftermath of Brexit, the UK's biggest mobile providers all said that they had no immediate plans to change their charging models for consumers roaming within the EU.\n\"It's disappointing for consumers to see that the situation looks to be shifting, with a risk that roaming at no additional cost could soon be a distant memory for UK residents.\"\nTravellers should check the small print if they were due an upgrade in coming months, Mr Doku said.\n\"Always use hotel and cafe wi-fi when on holiday, where possible,\" he added.\nBut Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said the price changes were a \"harsh reality\" of Brexit.\n\"Wholesale roaming rates will change given UK's exit, and this in turn will inevitably drive higher prices without EU protection. It's a pretty easy decision for UK telcos,\" he said.\nAll the operators \"are struggling with margins being squeezed, and are seeking ways of increasing revenue while investing billions in costly next generation fixed and mobile networks\", he added."

      "text": "Almost 10 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 197 countries worldwide. \nHowever, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world.  \nSome countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population - but others are some way behind.\nWith an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. \nOverall, China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with about three billion and 1.6 billion respectively. The US is third, with more than 530 million.\nMany poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, together with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a Covid vaccine.\nCovax had planned to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of 2021, but downgraded its supply forecast as a the result of global export bans, production challenges and slow regulatory approval processes.\nThe scheme has now distributed more than one billion vaccines.\nThe vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech was the first approved by the WHO, followed by several others.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. \nUnlike Pfizer's jab - which has to be kept at an extremely cold temperature (-70C) - the Oxford vaccine can be stored in a normal fridge, which makes it easier to distribute.\nMost governments have started with doses for the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. After priority groups have been vaccinated, there is a wider rollout among younger age groups. \nThe Pfizer vaccine has been approved for 12 to 15-year-olds in the US, UK, Europe and other countries. The Sinovac vaccine is being used for children as young as three in China and Colombia.\nEarly studies suggest the newly identified Omicron variant of coronavirus is better able to evade vaccine protection than previous strains, though vaccination still offers strong protection against serious illness and hospitalisation. \nA third 'booster' dose of a vaccine does appear to offer protection against infection from Omicron and at least 96 countries have begun booster vaccination programmes.\nWorldwide, more than 100 possible vaccines are undergoing trials to test their efficacy and safety. \nOur World in Data, a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity, collated the information in the map and table above.\nPopulation figures have been sourced from the United Nations' mid-2021 estimates provided by Our World in Data."

      "title": "Climate change: Five things we have learned from the IPCC report",
      "text": "The UN report on the science of climate change is set to make a huge impact. Our environment correspondent Matt McGrath considers some of the key lessons from it. \nFor those who live in the West, the dangers of warming our planet are no longer something distant, impacting people in faraway places.\n\"Climate change is not a problem of the future, it's here and now and affecting every region in the world,\" said Dr Friederike Otto from the University of Oxford, and one of the many authors on the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.\nIt is the confidence of the assertions that the scientists are now making that is the real strength of this new publication.\nThe phrase \"very likely\" appears 42 times in the 40-odd pages of the Summary for Policymakers. In scientific terms, that's 90-100% certain that something is real. \n\"I think there's not one single kind of new surprise that comes out, it's the over-arching solidness that makes this the strongest IPCC report ever made,\" Prof Arthur Petersen, from University College London (UCL), told BBC News.\nProf Petersen is a former Dutch government representative at the IPCC, and was an observer at the approval session that produced this report.\n\"It's understated, it's cool, it's not accusing, it's just bang, bang, bang, one clear point after the other.\"\nThe clearest of these points is about the responsibility of humanity for climate change. \nThere's no longer any equivocating - it's us.\nWhen the last IPCC report on the science of climate change was published in 2013, the idea of 1.5C being the safe global limit for warming was barely considered.  \nBut in the political negotiations leading up to the Paris climate agreement in 2015, many developing countries and island states pushed for this lower temperature limit, arguing that it was a matter of survival for them.\nA special report on 1.5C in 2018 showed the advantages of staying under the limit were massive compared to a 2C world. Getting there would require carbon emissions to be cut in half, essentially, by 2030 and net zero emissions reached by 2050. Otherwise, the limit would be reached between 2030 and 2052. \nThis new report re-affirms this finding. Under all scenarios, the threshold is reached by 2040. If emissions aren't reined in, 1.5C could be gone in around a decade. \nReaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible using clean technology, then absorbing any remaining ones by, for example, planting trees.\nWhile the situation is very serious, it is not a sudden drop into calamity.\n\"The 1.5C threshold is an important threshold politically, of course, but from a climatic point of view, it is not a cliff edge - that once we go over 1.5C, suddenly everything will become very catastrophic,\" explained Dr Amanda Maycock, from the University of Leeds, and one of the authors of the new report.\n\"The very lowest emissions scenario that we assess in this report shows that the warming level does stabilise around or below 1.5C later on in the century. If that were the pathway that we would follow, then the the impacts would be significantly avoided.\"\nIn the past, the IPCC has been criticised for being way too conservative when it came to assessing the risk of sea-level rise. A lack of clear research saw previous reports exclude the potential impacts of the melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. \nNot this time. \nThe report shows that under current scenarios, the seas could rise above the likely range, going up to 2m by the end of this century and up to 5m by 2150. While these are unlikely figures, they can't be ruled out under a very high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. \nThat's bad enough - but even if we get a handle on emissions and keep temperatures around 1.5C by 2100, the waters will continue to rise long into the future. \n\"The gorilla that looms large in the background is these very scary sea-level rise numbers in the long term,\" said Prof Malte Meinshausen from the University of Melbourne and an IPCC author. \n\"In the paper it shows that even with 1.5C warming we're looking at the long-term of two to three metres. And under the highest scenarios, we could be looking at multi-metre sea-level rise by 2150. That is just scary, because it's maybe not at the end of our lifetime, but it is around the corner and it will be committing this planet to a big legacy.\"\nEven if the sea-level rise is relatively mild, it will have knock-on effects that we cannot avoid. \n\"With gradual sea-level rise, those extreme sea-level events that have occurred in the past, just once per century, will occur more and more frequently in the future,\" said Val\u00e9rie Masson-Delmotte, co-chair of the IPCC working group that prepared the new report.\n\"Those that occurred only once per century in the past are expected to occur once or twice per decade by mid-century. The information we provide in this report is extremely important to take into account and prepare for these events.\" \nThe warnings are clearer and more dire - but there is an important thread of hope running through this report. \nScientists have long been worried that the climate could be more sensitive to carbon dioxide than they thought. \nThey use a phrase - equilibrium climate sensitivity - to capture the range of warming that could occur if CO2 levels were doubled. \nIn the last report, in 2013, this ranged from 1.5C to 4.5C, with no best estimate. \nThis time round, the range has narrowed and the authors opt for 3C as their most likely figure. \nWhy is this important? \n\"We are now able to constrain that with a good degree of certainty and then we employ that to really make far more accurate predictions,\" said Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds, and an author on the report. \n\"So, that way, we know that net zero will really deliver.\"\nAnother big surprise in the report is the role of methane, another warming gas. \nAccording to the IPCC, around 0.3C of the 1.1C that the world has already warmed by comes from methane.\nTackling those emissions, from the oil and gas industry, agriculture and rice cultivation, could be a big win in the short-term.\n\"The report quashes any remaining debate about the urgent need to slash methane pollution, especially from sectors such as oil and gas, where the available reductions are fastest and cheapest,\" said Fred Krupp, from the US Environmental Defense Fund.\n\"When it comes to our overheating planet, every fraction of a degree matters - and there is no faster, more achievable way to slow the rate of warming than by cutting human-caused methane emissions.\" \nThe timing of this report, coming just a couple of months before the critical COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, means that it will likely be the bedrock of the negotiations. The IPCC has some form here: their previous assessment in 2013 and 2014 paved the way for the Paris climate agreement. \nThis new study is far stronger, clearer and more confident about what will happen if politicians don't act. \nIf they don't act quickly enough and COP26 ends in an unsatisfactory fudge, then the courts might become more involved. \nIn recent years, in Ireland and the Netherlands, environmental campaigners have successfully gone to court to force governments and companies to act on the science of climate change. \n\"We're not going to let this report be shelved by further inaction. Instead, we'll be taking it with us to the courts,\" said Kaisa Kosonen, senior political adviser at Greenpeace Nordic.\n\"By strengthening the scientific evidence between human emissions and extreme weather, the IPCC has provided new, powerful means for everyone everywhere to hold the fossil fuel industry and governments directly responsible for the climate emergency. \n\"One only needs to look at the recent court victory secured by NGOs against Shell to realise how powerful IPCC science can be.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "tags": "Flexible working,Wales business,St Mellons,Cardiff,Employment,UK economy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of people working in Cardiff city centre is 50% lower than before the pandemic, according to research. \nA study by the The Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) found the city had a lower share of workers back in the office than four other major UK cities. \nIt found some \u00a3400m less had been spent in the city centre since March 2020. \nThe Welsh government said it recognised the \"big impact\" of Covid and was working closely with sectors affected.  \nA review conducted for Cardiff council found the shift to home-working has had \"a radical impact\" for cities, but added many suggestions about the longer-term had been \"premature and shallow\".\nThe CEBR research concluded spending in shops and food and drink establishments would be about \u00a36.3m less per month than at the start of the pandemic, if workers in Cardiff worked from offices for an average of two days per week.\nHowever, the financial impact on Cardiff was found to be lower than London, Manchester, Glasgow and Newcastle, the other cities featured in the study.\nZipporah, a Cardiff-based IT company which provides resource management software, decided to move from a large site on an industrial unit to a smaller office space last year after finding home working was more useful to its employees.\nScott Burton, Zipporah's technical director, said: \"We found it was improving things to make a better environment for the team.\n\"In about August we started looking for new premises. We wanted to get a smaller space.\"\nMr Burton said the company initially looked to the city centre, so the employees could be closer to shops and hospitality, but this \"wasn't going to stack up financially\". \nInstead, the company moved to a small office in St Mellons, a suburb of Cardiff, and now has an office which can host about 15 of its 20 staff, but typically sees about five people working there each day.\nAlthough the staff are still a reasonable distance from the city centre, he said the number of shops and food options close to the new work site has improved things for the workers and the local economy. \nMr Burton said: \"There's literally nothing around [the previous office] whereas now there's a coffee van, there's a lot not far away.\n\"At lunchtime you would spend 20 minutes trying to get to the nearest Tesco so there was never any time to actually do anything.\n\"We wanted to move to the city centre to get more amenities around us but it wasn't going to stack up financially, but you come to somewhere like [St Mellons] and it's got all sorts around it. Now we're a solid line of business to the coffee van.\"\nRory Fleming, manager of the Morgan Quarter arcades in the city centre, says the environment in Cardiff has \"completely changed\" since 2019, making it hard to compare to the present day.\n\"In 2019, offices were fully staffed, people had a lot of confidence using public transport to come in. Whereas in 2021, up until last month, hospitality wasn't allowed to open indoors,\" he said.\nMr Fleming said that while trading figures were down from 2019, since 12 April to last week, there was a \"steady growth\" in figures.\n\"It's down on 2019, but if we can maintain that upward trend from now to the end of the year, that will be a success for us,\" he said.\n\"People will no doubt be anxious about coming back to the city centre and all we can do is to create an environment to make people feel safe.\"\nHe also said their creative quarter, made up of 35 office spaces above St Mary Street, had increased to 80% occupancy \"in some shape or form,\" with more people coming in to work for part of the week.\nMr Fleming added there is growing confidence of office workers returning because \"people need some human interaction\".\nCardiff council pointed to the issues and steps identified in its review of how to take the city forward after the pandemic. \nIts report said it was not clear how radical the impact of the shift to home-working would be, nor whether widespread vaccination would restore office occupancy in city centres.\nIt said the shift to home working had been \"substantive\" and predicted much of it would \"stick\", but this would create opportunities, such as attracting companies and workers who might previously have worked all week in larger cities, including London.\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \"We fully recognise the Covid pandemic has had a big impact on high streets across Wales, which is why we are working closely with the retail and hospitality sectors to respond to the challenges they face in the short, medium and long term. \n\"Since the beginning of the pandemic, we've committed more than \u00a32.5bn to businesses across Wales in addition to our business as usual support through Business Wales.\n\"In addition, our Transforming Towns programme is providing nearly \u00a3110m to help support the economic and social recovery of our town and city centres.\n\"We also have ambitious plans to help people work smart and remotely in Wales. We are trialling a series of community-based remote working hubs, encouraging people to work closer to home and driving footfall back into town centres.\""

      "text": "Coal needs to be consigned to history to limit global warming, says PM Boris Johnson, describing a UN report on climate change as \"sobering\".\nHe said the world must shift to clean energy and provide finance to help countries at risk from changing climates.\nThe landmark study found it was \"unequivocal\" that human activity was responsible for global warming.\nGreen campaigners said the UK must halt planned new fossil fuel projects.\nDespite the call to end the use of coal, the UK is considering plans for a new coking coal mine in Cumbria, as well as proposals to tap a new oil field near Shetland.\nThe report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the UN group on the science of climate change - said climate change was already here and causing chaos in some places. \nIts authors said some of the changes, including rising sea levels, would not be reversed for hundreds or maybe thousands of years. \nThe publication comes less than three months before the UK hosts a key climate summit, known as COP26, in Glasgow.\nMr Johnson said: \"Today's report makes for sobering reading, and it is clear that the next decade is going to be pivotal to securing the future of our planet. \n\"We know what must be done to limit global warming - consign coal to history and shift to clean energy sources, protect nature and provide climate finance for countries on the frontline.\"\nThe UK government, which has adopted a 2035 deadline for a 78% emissions cut, is due to publish its strategy on cutting UK emissions to zero overall by 2050 this autumn.\nNet zero means cutting carbon emissions as far as possible then balancing out any remaining releases, for example by tree planting.\n\"The UK is leading the way, decarbonising our economy faster than any country in the G20 over the last two decades,\" the prime minister said.\n\"I hope today's IPCC report will be a wake-up call for the world to take action now, before we meet in Glasgow in November for the critical COP26 summit.\"\nThe UK has already drastically reduced the use of coal, with consumption falling from 61 million tonnes in 2013 to eight million tonnes last year. But the country remains dependent on other fossil fuels such as natural gas, which provides most home heating and about 40% of electricity.\nThe Climate Change Committee, the UK's independent adviser on tackling global warming, says the UK has adequate policies for only two of 21 key areas in eliminating carbon emissions.\nThe government faces challenges both on the international stage and closer to home.\nThe biggest will be to persuade the international community to sign up to meaningful measures in Glasgow at COP26.\nSome 70% of the world's economy has signed up to a net zero target - ministers want that to be higher. They are looking at the G20 in particular to drive change.\nAt home, an increasing number of Tory MPs are worried about the cost of the UK's own targets. \nWill the infrastructure be in place to support the mass use of electric cars? Who will pay for more expensive boilers in homes? \nAnswering some of those concerns won't be easy.\nThe Treasury is said to be aware of the need to avoid \"extortionate costs\" for low-income families.\nMinisters want to bring costs down through investment, incentives and mass production.\nBut the specifics will matter to our pockets and our politics. \nThe report said the world would reach or exceed temperature rises of 1.5C - seen as a threshold beyond which the worst impacts of global warming will be felt - over the next two decades.\nAlmost every nation on Earth signed up to the goals of the Paris climate agreement in 2015, which aims to keep the rise in global temperatures well below 2C this century and to pursue efforts to keep it under 1.5C.\nAlok Sharma, COP26 president, said one of the key messages of the report was that \"the future is not yet written\" and 1.5C was still an achievable goal, although retreating fast. \nHe said based on the conversations he had had, there was \"a clear desire\" among governments to \"keep the 1.5C within reach\".\nBut he said far more was needed in terms of action, adding \"the cost of inaction on climate change is far greater than the cost of action\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the report confirmed that the extreme weather events in recent months were \"only going to become more frequent\" and urgent action was needed.\n\"The biggest threat we now face is not climate denial but climate delay,\" he said. \"Those who, like our prime minister, acknowledge there is a problem, but simply don't have the scale of ambition required to match the moment. \n\"Our communities and planet can no longer afford the inaction of this government, who are failing to treat the crisis with the seriousness it deserves.\"\nLabour wants to see a \u00a330bn investment in low-carbon industry to support 400,000 jobs.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told ITV's Good Morning Britain she would be writing to the prime minister to encourage more co-operation between the devolved UK governments in light of the IPCC publication, which she described as \"a grim wake-up call\".\nBut climate campaigners, Scottish Greens and Scottish Labour have called on her to oppose plans to extract more fossil fuels from the Cambo oil field near Shetland, which they said would result in the release of an estimated 135 million extra tonnes of carbon in its lifetime.\nThe SNP has maintained that the issue is solely a matter for the UK government.\nThe UK government also faced criticism after initially opting not to intervene in a company's plans for a new coking coal mine in Cumbria. It later reversed the decision and a minister will have the final say on the project, after a public inquiry is held next month.\nFriends of the Earth climate campaigner Tony Bosworth said the prime minister's pledge to consign coal to history \"should mean all coal\" and the prime minister must make clear the mine will not be allowed.\nLib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said that as hosts of COP26, the UK needs to lead the world in tackling the climate crisis but \"Boris Johnson's dither and delay is costing us time we cannot afford, with drastic consequences\".\nGreen Party Deputy Leader Amelia Womack said \"this must be the moment the government finally realises we are in an emergency\", urging the introduction of a global carbon tax as \"the most powerful way of rapidly eliminating fossil fuels\".\nClimate scientist Dr Michael Byrne, a contributing author to the report, said the study was \"particularly significant\" as it was the first to link extreme weather events to human activities.\n\"That evidence was inconclusive back in 2013, at the time of the previous IPCC report; now it's irrefutable.\"\nHe said to slow and stop global warming, emissions of greenhouse gases needed to be \"rapidly reduced\" to net zero, but he added: \"The UK and Scottish targets of net zero by 2050 and 2045 are not fast enough, we have to be more ambitious. \n\"Let's hope our political leaders, as they gear up to COP26 in Glasgow this November, take heed.\""

      "tags": "Alok Sharma,COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "The world is \"dangerously close\" to running out of time to stop a climate change catastrophe, the UK government's climate chief Alok Sharma has said.\nMr Sharma - who is leading COP26, the climate summit hosted by the UK this year - said the effects were already clear with floods, fires and heatwaves.\n\"We can't afford to wait two years, five years, 10 years - this is the moment,\" he told the Observer.\nBut he did not condemn the government for allowing more fossil fuel projects.\nAnd he defended his decision to travel to more than 30 countries in seven months.\nMr Sharma's interview with the Observer comes ahead of a major report being released on Monday from the United Nations' climate change researchers.\nThe report is set to be the strongest statement yet from the UN group on the science of climate change - and will likely give details about how the world's oceans, ice caps and land will change in the next decades.\nThe summary has been approved in a process involving scientists and representatives of 195 governments, which - having signed off on the findings - will be under pressure to take more action at COP26 in November.\nDoug Parr, chief scientist with Greenpeace UK, said \"world leaders have done a terrible job of listening\" to warnings about climate change.\n\"This year, this has to change. We don't need more pledges, commitments and targets - we need real action right here right now.\"\nWildfires are currently raging in Greece, forcing thousands to evacuate their homes - and fires have also been burning in Turkey and California in the US. This summer, western Europe also saw its worst flooding in decades, which killed dozens of people.\nMr Sharma said if urgent action was not taken, the consequences would be \"catastrophic\". \n\"I don't think there's any other word for it,\" he said. \"You're seeing on a daily basis what is happening across the world. Last year was the hottest on record, the last decade the hottest decade on record.\"\nHe added: \"We're seeing the impacts across the world - in the UK or the terrible flooding we've seen across Europe and China, or forest fires, the record temperatures that we've seen in North America. Every day you will see a new high being recorded in one way or another across the world.\"\nMr Sharma said the report released on Monday is \"going to be the starkest warning yet that human behaviour is alarmingly accelerating global warming\".\n\"I don't think we're out of time but I think we're getting dangerously close to when we might be out of time. We will see [from the IPCC] a very, very clear warning that unless we act now, we will unfortunately be out of time.\"\n\"Africa has been waiting for the rest of the world to catch up and act on climate change for years,\" Fredrick Njehu, Christian Aid's senior climate change and energy adviser for Africa, highlighting the \"changing rainfall patterns or overbearing heat\" endured by the continent in recent years.\nHe added: \"The important thing now is that rich world governments make up for lost time and act quickly to reduce emissions and deliver promised financial support for the vulnerable.\" \nGlasgow is set to host the COP26 summit in November - which is the UN climate change conference. \nThe summit is seen as vital if climate change is to be brought under control, and leaders from 196 countries will meet to try and agree action. \nBut campaigners have accused the UK of hypocrisy, as there are plans to tap a new oil field off Shetland. The government has also said more oil and gas wells can be drilled in the North Sea, and there are plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria.\nEarlier this year, the global energy watchdog the International Energy Agency said there cannot be any new investment in oil, gas or coal projects if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C. Experts say the impacts of climate change are far more severe when the increase is greater than 1.5C.\nMr Sharma refused to criticise the government's plan for the projects, saying: \"Future [fossil fuel] licences are going to have to adhere to the fact we have committed to go to net zero by 2050 in legislation.\n\"There will be a climate check on any licences.\"\nMr Sharma's interview comes after he was criticised for flying abroad for meetings - and visiting more than 30 countries in seven months.\nHowever, since then some environmental campaigners including Greenpeace have defended him, saying face-to-face meetings are important to persuade other nations to tackle climate change.\nMr Sharma told the Observer that in-person meetings were \"incredibly vital and actually impactful\".\n\"It makes a vital difference, to build those personal relationships which are going to be incredibly important as we look to build consensus,\" he said.\nIt also emerged in the Sunday Mirror that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab did not self-isolate after returning from France, which was on the amber plus list meaning all arrivals must quarantine.  \nA government spokesman said it was Mr Raab's job to represent the UK abroad and he followed Covid guidelines on return. \nThere is an exemption for ministers to avoid quarantine when returning from abroad."

      "tags": "Flexible working,Kwasi Kwarteng,Civil Service,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has rejected the idea that civil servants should be paid less if they continue working from home.\nIt comes after an unnamed cabinet minister told the Daily Mail it was unfair for those returning to the office not to be paid more.\nBut Mr Kwarteng said this would set colleagues against each other.\nAnd he added that flexible working - with people working from home some of the time - was \"here to stay\".\nThe government says it is aiming to \"gradually and cautiously\" increase the number of officials in its offices, as Covid restrictions are relaxed.\nHowever, it is up to individual government departments to set their own timetables and policies for increasing staff in the workplace. \nLike many private sector workers, thousands of civil servants have been working either entirely or mostly from home during the pandemic. \nBut the government is no longer advising employees in England to work from home where possible, instead leaving it up to employers to decide.\nThe Times has reported ministers are keen to increase the number of officials in the office, citing concerns over accountability and morale.\nThe Mail quoted an unnamed minister saying: \"People who have been working from home aren't paying their commuting costs so they have had a de facto pay rise, so that is unfair on those who are going into work\". \n\"If people aren't going into work, they don't deserve the terms and conditions they get if they are going into work,\" they told the newspaper.\nBut asked on Times Radio whether such a policy made sense, Mr Kwarteng replied: \"No, I don't think it does.\n\"We shouldn't really be setting people who are working from home two or three days a week against other colleagues,\" he added.\nMr Kwarteng added that \"nearly everybody\" at his department was currently coming into the office \"two to three days a week\".\nAsked whether home-workers would find it harder to get promoted, he said office-based staff \"may have an advantage\" when it comes to forming workplace relationships.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said he would be encouraging officials to return, but with a \"degree of flexibility\".\n\"I think flexible working is here to stay,\" he added, when asked whether the government wanted workers back in offices.\nAsked about the suggestion that civil servants at home would be paid less, Downing Street said: \"We have no plans for that approach.\"\nThe PM's spokesman added departments would aim to increase office working gradually, in line with \"latest government guidance\".\nIn September 2020, the government ordered Whitehall bosses to get 80% of staff to go into the office at least once a week, saying that they should set an example to the private sector.\nBut the government discarded its plans after two weeks, as coronavirus infections started soaring for a second time.\nThe exact scale of current office-working within the civil service is unclear, both at a departmental level and across the service as a whole. \nGovernment departments, which are in charge of their own policies, are not publishing information on where their employees work.\nSkills Minister Gillian Keegan recently said \"probably 20-25%\" of officials at the Department for Education are in the office on any given day.\nThe Guardian has reported the Department of Health and Social Care recently scrapped plans for all officials to return between once and twice a week from September.\nThe FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, said a mixture of office-based and remote working \"provides greater work-life balance for employees and reduced office costs for employers\".\nIts general secretary Dave Penman said anonymous briefings to newspapers from ministers were \"out of touch with their own government's priorities\".\n\"What should matter to ministers is whether public services are being delivered effectively, not where individual civil servants are sitting on a particular day or concocting a phoney war on hybrid working to a grab a cheap headline,\" he added.\nThe PCS union, which represents lower-and-middle ranking officials, said it was holding discussions with the Cabinet Office on \"how we can embrace the post-pandemic world with hybrid working\".\nA spokesman added that any attempt to \"dock pay for civil servants for any reason\" would be \"met with a swift industrial response, potentially including strike action.\" "

      "text": "Fully vaccinated people can now visit France without quarantining on their return to the UK, after travel rule changes came into force at 04:00 BST.\nBrittany Ferries said it had received a \"surge\" of bookings following the rule changes announced on Thursday.\nBut travel agents said the relaxation of quarantine for one of the UK's most popular destinations came \"too late to save the summer\".\nMeanwhile, travellers in Mexico had to rush back to avoid hotel quarantine.\nUnder the latest changes to the UK's traffic light system for travel, the rules have been relaxed for a dozen countries.\nFrance moved from its own amber-plus category on to the amber list, which means children and fully vaccinated passengers do not have to quarantine on their return, although unvaccinated travellers still have to self-isolate at home for 10 days.\nIt comes as the UK recorded 27,429 new Covid cases on Sunday, as well as 39 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. \nSunday's data means that after a consistent fall since mid-July, the weekly total of cases has shown a slight increase over the previous seven days, of 1.9%.\nAmong those to benefit from the rule changes is Emma Wood, who lives in Laon, France. Her parents, from Northallerton, North Yorkshire, are planning to visit France next week to meet Emma's six-month-old daughter for the first time.\n\"We're so pleased but we daren't get our hopes up until they're here,\" she said. \"They were going to come before but then they introduced the new amber-plus list.\"\nShe said she usually saw her parents five or six times a year but had not seen them in more than 12 months.\n\"My mum has been desperate to see her granddaughter,\" she added.\nLondoner Kyle Frank has also booked a trip after the change was announced. He plans to drive to Nice because he feels it is safer than taking a plane - and so he can bring his puppy, Indy, with him.\n\"It would have been great to book it before but everything has been changing so rapidly it's hard to understand when it will be safe to travel. So I'm trying to go now while I can,\" he told the BBC.\n\"There's no quarantine when I get back to London so I can get straight back to work.\"\nMoved from amber to green: Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Romania and Norway\nMoved from amber-plus to amber: France\nMoved from red to amber: India, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE\nMoved from amber to red: Georgia, Mexico, La Reunion and Mayotte\nChristophe Mathieu, chief executive of Brittany Ferries, said the company had seen bookings surge after it was announced travel rules for France were being relaxed.\nBut the company still only expects to carry a quarter of its usual number of passengers.\n\"Let's be realistic, we would need tens of thousands of people booking to make up for the poor season,\" Mr Mathieu said.\n\"It's more than welcome this announcement, it's good news, but it comes in a year when at the end of the day for us everything is about 2022 and making that a real, normal year.\"\nThe UK government sets the red, amber and green lists for England, while the other nations are in charge of their own lists. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland confirmed they will be adopting the same changes as England - although Wales criticised the UK government for not consulting them. \nThere are now 36 countries on the green list - from which even unvaccinated travellers do not have to quarantine - following the addition of seven more nations, including Germany, Austria and Norway.\nAnd India, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have been moved from the red list to the amber list.\nCountries have their own rules about allowing visitors - so being on the UK's green list does not guarantee travellers can visit.\nBut one travel agent said the latest changes had only made a small difference and testing requirements were still putting many Britons off booking foreign trips.\n\"It's far too late to save the summer,\" said Julia Lo Bue-Said, from the Advantage Travel Partnership.\nShe said a lot of people had already made their holiday plans and the increase in bookings had been \"marginal\".\n\"When you think that most businesses are 80% down, you need a huge volume to make up the shortfall they're experiencing,\" she said.\nFour destinations are also subject to tighter restrictions. Mexico, Georgia, and the French overseas territories of La Reunion and Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, have been added the red list.\nOnly British citizens, Irish citizens, and UK residents can travel from red list countries and they must stay for 10 days in hotel quarantine at a cost of \u00a31,750 for one adult - which increases to \u00a32,285 from 12 August.\nLotis Bautista, one of thousands of Britons on holiday in Mexico when the announcement was made, paid hundreds of pounds to cut short her trip by a week and rush back home before Sunday's deadline.\nShe said she and her husband could not have afforded the costs of hotel quarantine.\n\"I would be lying to you if I said I wasn't incredibly upset when it happened. Even though you know there are risks, you hope there might be a more responsible way of doing things from the government,\" Ms Bautista said.\n\"We're eighteen months into he pandemic and we're still being being given two, three days' notice.\"\nHave you made travel plans as a result of the changes to the rules?

      "text": "Towns and cities in Wales are getting busy, with a \"big party\" predicted after the end of most Covid regulations.\nWales has moved to Covid alert level zero, meaning social distancing rules and most other restrictions have ended.\nNick Newman of the Cardiff Licensees Forum said bars started filling up from 11:00 BST. \nMasks are still needed in shops, and First Minister Mark Drakeford has urged people to be sensible.\nThe UK government said on Saturday a further 103 people had died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, with 28,612 cases confirmed.\nCase rates in Wales are the lowest of the four nations, but chief medical officer Frank Atherton has said the country remains in a \"third wave of coronavirus infection\".\nMr Newman said customers had been \"fantastic\" and \"voted with their feet\" throughout the pandemic when restrictions allowed. \n\"A lot of people were pinning their hopes on midnight last night [for the end of restrictions] but that got cancelled,\" said Mr Newman, who is part of the Croeso Pubs chain.\n\"So what you will see tonight is an even bigger party in Cardiff central, which is what we are famous for.\"\n\"At 11am, we saw the bars start to fill up, with it the first day of the football season and then the Lions after.\"\nHowever, he said some measures remained in place.\nAt one of his pubs, The Philharmonic, thermal imagining cameras will determine who is allowed in, and there will be hand sanitisers. \nThe first minister said on Friday he was confident Wales was on the \"final lap\" of emerging from the pandemic, providing there were no \"further unexpected turns in the course of the virus\".\nHowever, he warned against a \"free-for-all\" after most restrictions ended.\nIn England, most rules were relaxed on 19 July, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson postponed so-called \"Freedom Day\" by a month when cases of the Delta variant surged.\nThe 103 additional coronavirus deaths reported in the UK on Saturday brings the total to 130,281 since the start of the pandemic.\nAcross the UK, 86,207,851 Covid jabs were administered on Friday, with 46,997,495 first doses and 39,210,356 second doses.\nBosses at Galeri theatre and cinema in Caernarfon said a questionnaire among customers showed some wanted to keep social distancing in place.\n\"We feel we need time to talk with staff and our customers and make sure that everyone feels safe moving forwards,\" said team leader Naomi Saunders.\n\"For the time being we are keeping with social distancing due to the fact that the announcement has come so last minute.\"\nThe Three Horseshoes pub in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taf, will see live acts, pool and darts return on Saturday for the first time since before the pandemic. \nLandlord Martin Barron said: \"I think people will look forward to it, you can watch an act, grab a beer and it gives people a reason to come out.\"\nHe said it would be operating at about 80% capacity because \"we are trying to get to normal but the risk is still there\".\nThe Welsh Beer and Pub Association has welcomed the end of restrictions and said it meant more than 150 pubs in Wales which had yet to reopen could now do so on Saturday. \nEmma McClarkin, chief executive, said: \"This is the good news our brewers and pubs in Wales have been waiting for.\n\"A pint on Saturday is going to taste all the sweeter.\"\nStaff at a cafe in Newport have also welcomed the relaxation of mask rules, calling it a \"huge relief\". \nLaura Leach, who owns the Restpoint Cafe, said: \"A lot of our customers come in for the social aspect, so trying to have a conversation while wearing a mask makes it impossible.\"\nShe also said it would ease pressures on her and staff to \"challenge non-mask wearers\", after \"hardly anyone was complying\" with the rules after the first lockdown.\nMs Leach said staff would be thrilled to remove their masks while in the kitchen but would still wear masks when serving and continue social distancing. \nPhilip Bottrill, of The Pen & Paper Stationery Co in Cardiff, said everyone needed to move \"steadily\" and \"gently\" toward normality. \n\"It isn't going to happen overnight,\" he said. \n\"But we do need to build our trade up because, since we've reopened, we are only taking about 60% of what we took in 2019.\"\nWhile some are excited to see restrictions eased, for others it is a more daunting prospect. \nSasha Robbins, a wheelchair user with cerebral palsy from Pontypridd said she felt \"excited\" about rules relaxing but was \"really cautious\" about the future after shielding throughout the pandemic. \nShielding advice was paused on 1 April this year, with no expectation that people would need to shield again in the future, chief medical officer Frank Atherton said.\n\"Prior to it [the pandemic] I had a really active social life but now I've noticed there's things out there that I can't control,\" she said.\nThat became more of a realisation for Ms Robbins, 32, when her father contracted Covid-19 when visiting the hospital for a routine check-up.\nHe ended up in intensive care and lost his leg. \nShe said she was worried about people's attitudes now that almost all social restrictions are being relaxed and has faced some unpleasant experiences during the pandemic. \n\"Some venomous things have been said to me just because I'm me and I don't understand it,\" she said. \nShe urged people not to \"forget\" disabled people.\nRhian Davies, chief executive of Disability Wales said she feared disabled people would be locked out of society.\nMs Davies said the unlocking of restrictions could \"exacerbate a two-tier system of people feeling like a second-class citizen\" without \"strong messaging from public bodies\". \n\"Just because someone isn't a wheelchair user, hasn't got a white cane or a guide dog, doesn't mean they're not at risk,\" she said.\nJessica Leigh, from disability charity Scope, said many disabled people would be anxious about the changes. \n\"The government's decision to lift restrictions leaves some clinically extremely vulnerable people or those not yet vaccinated at the mercy of others' goodwill,\" she said.\nCrickhowell Rugby Club will play its first competitive community match since February 2020.\nBleddyn Carrington, team manager and full-back, said \"everyone is like a coiled spring ready to go\".\n\"Players are excited, the chats on the WhatsApp group are getting a bit intense,\" he said. \n\"You get nervous thinking 'am I good enough after 18 months?'\"\nSix weeks ago the team were not able to do contact drills, train for more than one hour and use showers, but Saturday marks a return to competitive action. \nThe team played its first friendly match on 19 July against Brecon Seconds but Mr Carrington said it would not compare to being in the competitive environment.\n\"It's an electric feeling having crowds watching you, hearing your name called when you catch a ball or make a tackle\u2026 you forget what it's like.\""

      "text": "A wind turbine blade factory in Hull is to be doubled in size after the government confirmed it would provide financial support for the expansion.\nSiemens Gamesa said the \u00a3186m upgrade to its Alexandra Dock site, the UK's largest offshore wind manufacturing facility, would create 200 jobs.\nThe scheme, first outlined in February, is set to be complete by 2023.\nIt will receive a grant from a \u00a3160m fund but the government has not yet revealed the exact amount.\nThe Hull plant, which has manufactured more than 1,500 offshore wind turbine blades since it opened in 2016, currently employs about 1,000 people.\nThe giant turbines are used in wind farms being constructed in the North Sea, as well as exported around the world.\nThey are currently being supplied to the 1.4-gigawatt Hornsea Two project off the Yorkshire coast which will be the world's largest offshore wind power plant, powering the equivalent of 1.3 million homes.\nHull City Council leader Daren Hale said the decision was \"fantastic news\" for the city, which he said was at the \"forefront of the green economy revolution\".\n\"This additional \u00a3186m investment will create hundreds more jobs, and the expansion will support the recovery of the city post-Covid,\" he added.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson, who has previously pledged to power every home in the UK via offshore farms, said: \"The Humber region embodies the UK's green industrial revolution, with new investment into developing the next generation of wind turbines set to create new jobs, export opportunities and clean power across the country.\n\"With less than 100 days to go until the climate summit Cop26, we need to see more countries embracing new technologies, building green industries and phasing out coal power for a sustainable future.\"\nClark MacFarlane, Siemens Gamesa's UK managing director, said: \"Our investment in our existing offshore blade factory, logistics, and harbour facilities in Hull has been a key driver of the growth of the UK's world-leading offshore wind industry.\"\nMeanwhile, it was announced that a further \u00a378m will be invested by GRI Renewable Industries (GRI) to build a wind turbine tower factory at the Able Marine Energy Park, at Killinghome, North Lincolnshire.\nThe company said it would create 260 jobs at the site which lies on the other side of the Humber estuary.\nRob Waltham, leader of North Lincolnshire Council, said he was delighted the company had chosen Killinghome as its base.\n\"This latest development will create even more well-paid sustainable jobs - helping to create a more prosperous future,\" he said.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the Humber region was \"vitally important\" for the growth of the UK's offshore wind industry.\n\"Our announcement backed by private investment will give a boost to this important industrial heartland, creating and supporting thousands of good quality jobs across the region while ensuring it is on the frontline of developing the next generation of offshore wind turbines.\"\nThe announcement comes as the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) publishes the first of a series of reports on climate change.\nIt says humanity's damaging impact on the climate is a \"statement of fact\" and action is urgently needed to cut emissions to avert a \"climate catastrophe\".\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

      "tags": "Prince Andrew, Duke of York,Jeffrey Epstein death,Virginia Giuffre,UK Royal Family,Jeffrey Epstein,New York",
      "text": "A US woman who alleges she was brought to the UK aged 17 to have sex with the Duke of York has filed a civil case in New York claiming he abused her.\nVirginia Giuffre, who was an accuser of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, claims she was sexually assaulted by Prince Andrew in London and New York.\nA spokeswoman for Prince Andrew, 61, said there was \"no comment\" on the case, which was filed under New York's Child Victims Act.\nHe has consistently denied the claims.\nThe case alleges the prince sexually abused Ms Giuffre - then known as Virginia Roberts - at the London home of Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and at Epstein's homes in Manhattan and Little St James in the US Virgin Islands.\nIt claims the prince engaged in sexual acts without her consent, knowing how old she was and \"that she was a sex-trafficking victim\".\nThe case also says the \"extreme and outrageous conduct\" continues to cause Ms Giuffre, now 38, \"significant emotional and psychological distress and harm\".\n\"In this country no person, whether president or prince, is above the law, and no person, no matter how powerless or vulnerable, can be deprived of the law's protection,\" the documents read.\n\"Twenty years ago Prince Andrew's wealth, power, position, and connections enabled him to abuse a frightened, vulnerable child with no one there to protect her. It is long past the time for him to be held to account.\"\nSpeaking about Ms Giuffre's allegations in 2019, Prince Andrew said they \"never happened\". \n\"It didn't happen. I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened. I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever,\" he told BBC Newsnight.\nIn a later statement, Prince Andrew said: \"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\"His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure. \n\"I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.\"\nThe narratives put forward by Ms Giuffre and Prince Andrew are a hundred miles apart.\nPrince Andrew says he has no recollection of meeting Ms Giuffre, that he never had sex with her.\nHowever, there is a photo that clearly shows him with his arm around Ms Giuffre in a location that Ghislaine Maxwell's brother, Ian, has confirmed looks very much like her then London house.\nSome \"friends\" of Prince Andrew have anonymously suggested that the photo is a fake. There is no evidence that this is the case.\nOne person close to the prince told the BBC recently that there was a simpler explanation - that he met thousands of people and that whilst he may have met Ms Giuffre, he simply couldn't remember her.\nPrince Andrew has said he will help law enforcement authorities with their enquiries into Jeffrey Epstein. His team pushed back very hard against the allegation from the US Attorney for the  Southern District of New York that he had not offered assistance.\nBut they will see today's lawsuit as a legal fishing expedition and will do everything they can to see that it goes no further.\nThe new legal complaint alleges that the prince and his representatives have rejected requests to provide \"whatever facts, context or explanation he might have, and to explore alternative dispute resolution approaches\". \nNew York State's Child Victims Act was signed into law by Governor Andrew Cuomo in 2019.\nIt allowed survivors of childhood sexual abuse to file a case which had already been time-barred or expired, and gave them a year to do so.\nThat one-year window was then extended because of disruption to court services during the pandemic and ends this week, on 14 August.\nMr Cuomo called it a \"pathway to justice\" for people who allege they were abused when under-age and was intended to help \"right wrongs that went unacknowledged and unpunished\".\nMeanwhile, an independent inquiry found this month that Mr Cuomo harassed multiple women. Mr Cuomo has denied touching anyone inappropriately.\nMs Giuffre's legal action is a civil case filed by a private party for monetary damages, as opposed to a criminal case filed by the state.\nArick Fudali, a partner at New York legal firm Bloom, which has represented nine of Epstein's victims, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that \"very few\" of such cases ended up going to trial but there was a \"small chance\" this could.\nThe alternatives are that it is settled beforehand, it is struck out by a judge, or the complainant ceases the action.\nMelissa Murray, professor of law at New York University, said Prince Andrew \"could be on the hook for significant money damages\".\n\"This is not about whether or not Prince Andrew will go to jail - he has no criminal exposure from this particular case,\" she told the BBC.\nAsked how likely it was that the case would to go to trial, she said Prince Andrew's team would probably be more worried that it comes at a \"really unfortunate time\", as Ms Maxwell is due to stand trial in November.\nShe has pleaded not guilty to federal charges that she conspired with Epstein in the abuse of four under-age girls. \nProf Murray said: \"With this civil suit pending and her about to go to trial on these criminal charges, there may be even more pressure - and indeed temptation - for her to co-operate with federal prosecutors and perhaps provide more information about all of the individuals who were in the orbit of Jeffrey Epstein and that could, allegedly, include the prince himself.\""

      "text": "Chinese technology giant Alibaba will sack a manager accused of rape, according to a memo seen by the BBC.\nIn the letter sent to employees of the firm, chief executive Daniel Zhang said two other bosses who failed to act on the allegation have resigned.\nAlibaba is working with police after a female worker said her male colleague raped her in a hotel room while she was unconscious after a \"drunken night\".\nHer allegations have been widely shared on Chinese social media.\nMr Zhang said the manager accused of rape had admitted that \"there were intimate acts\" while the woman was \"inebriated\".\nThe letter went on to say: \"He will be fired and never be rehired. Whether he has committed rape or indecency that violates the law will be determined by law enforcement.\"\nThe memo also highlighted that Alibaba would take responsibility for the woman's wellbeing, saying: \"We will do everything we can to take care of her.\"\nOn Sunday, police in the eastern city of Jinan, where the incident took place, said they are investigating the allegations.\nThe woman's account of the incident, which was published in an eleven-page document, has prompted a social media storm on China's Twitter-like platform, Weibo.\nThe woman alleged that the manager coerced her into travelling to the city of Jinan, which is around 900km (560 miles) from Alibaba's head office in Hangzhou, for a meeting with a client.\nShe has accused her superiors of ordering her to drink alcohol with co-workers during dinner.\nShe said that on the evening of 27 July the client kissed her. She then recalls waking up in her hotel room the next day without her clothes on and with no memory of the night before.\nThe woman said she obtained surveillance camera footage that showed the manager had gone into her room four times during the evening.\nAlibaba said it is \"staunchly opposed to forced drinking culture\" in its memo to employees.\nAfter returning to Hangzhou, the woman said the incident was reported to Alibaba's human resources (HR) department and senior management and that she had requested the manager be fired.\nShe said that human resources initially agreed to the request but took no further action.\nIn reference to this, the memo to employees said: \"In the entire incident handling process, the HR function did not pay enough attention and care to our people.\"\n\"They were rational but lacked empathy and care. At the same time, an emergency response system was absent, and a severe misjudgement was made,\" it added."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.  \nThere were cheers in Glasgow as the clock struck midnight to mark the reopening of Scotland's nightclubs. It was the moment clubbers were finally able to hit the dancefloor after 16 months of Covid restrictions. Among those in Glasgow was 19-year-old Luke Dunsmuir who predicted the next few weeks would be \"busy, busy\". New rules say that face coverings can be removed while dancing, drinking and dining. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was the \"right moment\" to lift restrictions.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has rejected the idea civil servants should be paid less if they continue working from home after an unnamed cabinet minister told a newspaper it was unfair for those returning to the office not to be paid more. Mr Kwarteng said this would set colleagues against each other, adding flexible working was \"here to stay\". It comes as online grocer Ocado said staff could work remotely from abroad for one month of the year.\nOne of the biggest providers of PCR Covid test kits has said it will increase the number of drop boxes and frequency of collections after pictures of boxes overflowing with coronavirus samples were shared online. At least one PCR test is required for all arrivals from international destinations within two days of landing in the UK. Randox, the firm which makes the kits, said all the pictured tests would be processed and it was expanding and improving its capacity and logistics network to meet \"rapidly growing demand\".\nPupils across England are preparing to collect their A-level results and some may be wondering what awaits them if they choose to go to university. Three siblings from Swindon have shared their experiences of university life during the pandemic. For Danielle Herbert, 22, the pandemic meant a cancelled graduation and \"massive gaps\" in learning. Older sister Jess, 24, says the pandemic \"stripped away\" her independence. But for their brother Ryan, 21, learning online during the pandemic gave him the \"ability to openly ask questions\" and \"learn in my own time\".\nMusicians including Annie Lennox, Ed Sheeran and Sir Mick Jagger will join with Bollywood stars to raise funds for Covid relief work in India. A virtual fundraising event, called We For India: Saving Lives, will take place on Sunday, in both London and Mumbai. The event, which will be livestreamed over Facebook, will feature more than 80 Indian performers including composer AR Rahman. Nile Rodgers, Sister Sledge, and Nancy Ajram will also take part in the event, hosted by Rajkummar Rao, star of Oscar-nominated film The White Tiger.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nWith A-level results day coming up in England here is a guide to all you need to know before the big day.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Covid rules for travelling to the UK will be relaxed for thousands of delegates attending the UN COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November.\nUp to 25,000 government representatives, media and campaigners from around the world are expected.\nThey will not be required to be fully vaccinated but officials said it would be strongly encouraged.\nVaccines have been offered to registered delegates unable to get a jab by other means. \nUnder the regulations specifically for COP26, delegates from red list countries will only have to quarantine in hotels for five days if they have been fully vaccinated. \nThose who have not received their jabs will have to isolate for 10 days.\nThere will be no requirement for COP26 attendees coming from amber or green list countries to isolate on arrival to the UK whether vaccinated or not, officials said. \nMost people are expected to travel to the conference via London.\nUnder current rules, people cannot travel to England from red list countries unless they are British or Irish citizens or have the right to live in the UK, with the same rules applying to Scotland with some other limited exceptions.\nThose who do arrive from red list countries have to quarantine for 10 days in quarantine hotels, even if they are double jabbed.\nThere are also requirements to self isolate for 10 days for those coming from amber countries who are not fully vaccinated via approved programmes in the UK, US or Europe.\nThe red list can change but it currently includes dozens of countries, all of whom are expected to send delegates to COP26, and some of which are among the most vulnerable to climate change.\nA UK government spokesperson said COP26 was a necessary event, as the science was clear for the need to take immediate and far-reaching action to have any chance of avoiding the devastating impacts of rising temperatures.\nThey added: \"We know that achieving the ambitious global action needed to tackle climate change requires everyone sitting around the same table. To achieve this, we have been working tirelessly to make arrangements for an in-person event.\n\"Hosting it safely is of the utmost importance to the UK. Like many recent international events, COP26 will have to adapt in line with Covid.\"\nThe spokesperson said details of how the summit would run were progressing after close collaboration with all partners, including public health officials in Scotland and England, the Scottish government, Glasgow City Council and the UN's climate body, the UNFCCC.\n\"We believe these arrangements strike a balance between allowing critical climate talks at this exceptional event to continue with representation from around the globe, while continuing to have measures in place to protect public health,\" they said.\nDelegates will also be subject to a strict testing regime and they will have to sign a charter agreeing to abide by the protocols for the summit. \nThe UK is recognising all Covid-19 vaccinations as valid for the event, but officials also said they would not prevent people attending who had not been vaccinated.\nThe issue of who pays for the regime, including testing and quarantine hotels, has yet to be finalised. Isolation protocols during the event for those who test positive for the virus are also being finalised.\nThe rules have been signed off by the UK and Scottish governments, but Covid-19 protection measures for the summit could still change, officials said.\nA Scottish Government spokesperson said:  \"COP26 represents the world's best chance - and possibly one of our last chances - to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. \n\"The circumstances make this a unique event and exceptional arrangements will be needed to ensure it can be delivered safely and successfully. \n\"Following close discussions with the UK government and other delivery partners, we are pleased to have agreed measures that will support the full and active participation of international delegates and protect public health.\""

I think my dad was surprised,\" she said.\n\"I mean you don't expect that, do you? It happened so quick. He said he would ring the Apollo.\n\"I feel really honoured that he chose to dedicate his first comeback performance to me.\"\nThe shows, which sold out within 30 minutes last week, marked a rare public appearance for one of the nation's best-loved comedians. \nKay described getting back on stage as like \"getting in a hot bath\".\nIn late 2017, the Phoenix Nights star cancelled a tour and all future work projects due to \"unforeseen family circumstances\". \nMs Nuttall said the show had been \"hilarious and it was just amazing to see all these people turn out and have a laugh\". \n\"He has such natural talent. It is just amazing to be around him,\" she added.\nThe University of Manchester student was diagnosed with having an aggressive form of brain cancer in October 2018, during her first term at King's College London.\nSince then, Ms Nuttall, who was in the audience on Saturday, has been undergoing immunotherapy in Germany as one of the few avenues of treatment available, alongside a costly complex cell vaccination programme, with each jab costing \u00a327,000.\nShe told BBC Breakfast she was 18 \"when I was told I maybe had another 18 months to live\".\n\"When you are that young and you are told that news, you have to resort to positivity and laughter because sometimes that is all you have.\"\nAt the Apollo, her sister Gracie introduced Kay and told the audience their family was \"eternally grateful\" to them for \"potentially saving my sister's life\".\n\"It has been really hard. It is a really bizarre concept to know that the person who you really love most in the world might not be there at some point,\" Gracie said.\n\"But, as we say, laughter is the best medicine and you have to keep going.\"\nNicola Nuttall said her daughter was \"an exceptional person and she deserves to have a long life\", adding: \"She deserves just to get old.\"\nFunds raised from the event will go mostly towards Ms Nuttall's treatment, with some cash going to the Brain Tumour Charity.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "title": "Climate change: Have countries kept their promises?",
      "tags": "Climate change",
      "text": "Agreed by 196 parties in the French capital in December 2015, the Paris climate deal aims to keep the rise in global temperatures this century \"well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C.\" We look at five key countries and how well they have kept their promises.\nEvery one of the signatories to the Paris climate agreement has had to lodge a climate action plan with the UN to spell out what steps they are taking to curb carbon. \nOverall, according to a new assessment from global consultancy Systemiq, low-carbon solutions have been more successful in this period than many people realise.  \nThe growth in coal for energy outside of China has declined significantly. \n\"We have to translate what we can do into what we will do,\" said Lord Nicholas Stern, from the London School of Economics (LSE).\n\"But a big part of that is understanding what is happening and that's why I think this report is important. It will change people's perspectives of what is possible and translate that into action.\"\nSo the big picture might be improving, but what about individual nations? We looked at how five key countries have lived up to their promises under the pact.\nAs well as being the world's fifth largest economy, the UK is the incoming president of the Conference of the Parties or COP, the main UN climate negotiating forum, which will take place in Glasgow in November 2021. \nThis global gathering of world leaders will try and work out how to improve the collective effort to tackle climate change, and take the next steps.  COP26 in Glasgow will be the most important meeting since the Paris climate agreement was signed five years ago. \nThe president of the meeting is a key influence on the success or failure of the event. \nIn Paris in 2015, French foreign minister Laurent Fabius was seen as a hugely effective, impartial leader who gained the trust of nations rich and poor.  \nUK Business Secretary Alok Sharma has already been tasked with the job by Boris Johnson, but already there are worries that he has too much on his plate. \nHas the UK lived up to its promises? \nThe answer to this is mostly yes. \nSince 2008, the UK government has had to set five-year greenhouse gas targets by law, based on advice from the independent Climate Change Committee (CCC).\nTargets set under the first three carbon budgets have been met.\nWhile it was part of the EU, the UK's target for 2020 was a reduction of 16% on 2005 emissions. \nThe UK easily achieved this. In fact, right now, Britain's total output of warming gases has gone down by around 45% from 1990 levels.\nAs a result of leaving the EU, the UK has to register its own standalone plan to cut carbon with the UN. \nThis is known as a \"nationally determined contribution\" or NDC.\nIt focuses on targets for 2030, which are meant to show the pathway to net zero emissions by 2050.\nReaching net zero requires that any carbon emissions are balanced by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere by, for example, planting trees.\nThe new 2030 plan, released on 3 December, won plaudits for its ambition. But critics said there were major hurdles ahead.\nUnder the NDC, around 87% of UK electricity would need to come from low carbon sources by the end of this decade, up from over 50% now.\nAlmost half the cars on the road would need to be electric, up from around 6% at present.\nAs well as making major changes to transport, energy and food emissions, the UK will have to take a tough stand internationally so that it doesn't simply substitute carbon cuts at home with emissions-laden products from abroad.\n\"It's what you do at home, but it's also what you invest in internationally,\" Dr Alison Doig, from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), told BBC News. \n\"The UK needs to ensure with our export finance credits and with our Brexit deals, that we are strongly signalling overseas, what we're doing domestically.\"\nNevertheless, in April 2021, the government announced that it would speed up its emissions-cutting plan. Boris Johnson said carbon releases would be reduced by 78% by 2035 - taking the country more than three quarters of the way to net zero.\nAustralia matters because not only is it one of the biggest sources of fossil fuels, it is also a country highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\nThe nation is now the world's largest exporter of coal and gas, according to a recent study.\nEmissions of greenhouse gases from Australian exports are responsible for 3.6% of global emissions according to research.\nOn a per capita basis, and including exports, Australians are responsible for four times as much CO2 as people living in the US.\nPolitically, Australia is also very important in climate change terms as well. \nOver the past five years, it has moved further away from the majority of nations in the UN, which have been urging rapid cuts in carbon. Prime minister Scott Morrison was criticised by other politicians for downplaying the role of climate change after recent, devastating wildfires.\nHas Australia lived up to its promises?\nNot really.\nWhile it is set to hit a rather low 2020 target set under a previous global agreement, its actions under the Paris climate agreement are not measuring up, according to experts. \nAustralia set a target for 2030 of making a 26-28% reduction in its emissions compared with 2005 levels.\nProjections published at the end of 2019 suggested Australian emissions will be only 16% lower than 2005 levels in 2030.\nThis year's UN Emissions Gap report says that, right now Australia is projected to fall short on what should be a very easy target.\n\"That 26% reduction needs to be at least double that to be in the Paris Agreement pathway,\" says Dr Bill Hare, who's part of the Climate Action Tracker group of scientists who have rated Australia's plans as \"insufficient\".\n\"There's very little going on whether you're talking about electric vehicles, motor vehicle standards, it's alone in the OECD in not having fuel efficiency standards, it has virtually nothing on energy efficiency, and virtually nothing on building efficiency.\"\n\"It is really an embarrassment actually.\"\nThere's a lot of focus on Australia now because of changing world politics. \nA dispute with China has threatened its exports of coal, while the result of the recent US election has taken away a climate ally of the Australian government.\nThere's even been some talk in recent weeks that the country might soon set a long-term net-zero emissions goal.\nAnd according to newspaper reports, Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison is set to announce that the country will no longer use carbon credits carried over from a previous international climate agreement. \nAustralia had planned to use these questionable credits as a way of making up the shortfall in its 2030 target. \n\"I think if Trump had won the election then Australia would see themselves as part of a gang with Brazil and Saudi Arabia and a few others,\" said Dr Alison Doig, from the ECIU.\nBut with the dawn of the Biden era, \"they know are in a position that's becoming more outcast. So that might be why there's some softening on local language and the rhetoric\".\nWhile action at the federal level in Australia might be slow, lower down there's a good deal of movement. \n\"Our energy market operator has said that for the power sector in Australia, we're looking at the fastest transition in the world,\" said Dr Bill Hare.  \n\"Everyone knows that we're famous for our sunshine, our wind and our space. And that means that renewables are cheap, they are rapidly outcompeting coal and gas, and those technologies are going to be replaced very quickly.\"\nThe EU represents about a fifth of the world's economy - and was responsible for around 9% of the global share of CO2 emissions in 2019, the third largest emitter. \nClimate change is seen as a key issue for Europe, because it's an international problem where acting together makes sense to many citizens.\nEurope's political leaders also see tackling climate as important in showing the global relevance of the Union.\nDuring the Trump administration, the EU stepped into a leadership role, attempting to build bridges with China on how to tackle the challenge. \nThe EU is well-regarded generally among developing countries and small island states because they are seen as wanting to push for greater ambition in terms of cutting carbon. \nIn terms of building a global alliance of rich and poor countries the EU is key.  \nHas the EU lived up to its targets?\nMostly, yes.\nBut back in 2007, EU leaders set a goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20% of their 1990 levels by 2020. \nBy 2018, the collective efforts had cut warming gases by 23.2%. \nThis over-achievement caused many to think that the initial targets had been set far too low. \nThe EU subsequently announced a target of 40% for 2030, but this too came to be viewed as too easy to meet.\nThe bloc has now adopted the aim of having a carbon-neutral economy by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement.  \nAnd in the European Green Deal, announced in September 2020, the European Commission proposed a new target for cuts of around 55% by 2030.\nIn April 2021, ahead of President Biden's climate leaders' summit, the EU adopted the goal.\nThe European Parliament and many environmentalists had wanted them to go further and aim for a 60% cut.\nBut the proposal ran into trouble with Eastern European member states who argued this was too much, too soon.\nChina is key to solving the global problem with climate change, because it is the world's biggest contributor to the root cause, CO2 emissions. \nAs China's economy rapidly expanded over the past two decades, using coal as their main energy source, their emissions have overtaken the US and now comprise around 28% of the global CO2 output. \nBut China is also the reason for a recent burst of optimism that has spread through the international community since September, when China's President Xi Jinping told the UN that his country would reach carbon neutrality by 2060.\nHas China lived up to its promises?\nThe answer is mostly, yes, but with some caveats.\nSeeing itself as a developing country, China has always been reluctant to take on targets to cut carbon, arguing that the West should go first and farthest to rein in CO2. \nInstead, China has focussed on carbon intensity rather than cuts. This means limiting the amount of CO2 used per unit of economic activity. \nThis is easier to achieve than outright emissions reductions but the downside is that as GDP increases so does the overall total of carbon used.\nBefore the Copenhagen conference of the parties meeting (COP) in 2009, China pledged to cut its carbon intensity by 40-45%, compared to 2005 levels. \nAt the end of 2017, China had cut carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 46% from the 2005 level.\nIn the Paris Agreement, China promised to cut carbon intensity by 60-65%, and to peak its emissions by 2030. \nThe country remains on course to meet these goals. In fact, according to some research, it could meet them years ahead of schedule. \n\"I think China took the conservative approach to the Paris Agreement, they only proposed something that they were very sure that they could meet,\" says Niklas H\u00f6hne from the Climate Action Tracker. \n\"It was also clear that at, the moment when they proposed their 2030 target, that they would over-achieve it. And that doesn't mean that that it's a bad target, per se, but that's their way of approaching it.\"\nWhen President Xi Jinping told the UN in September that China would reach net-zero in 2060 and peak its emissions well before 2030, the statement was welcomed all over the world.\nBut observers said targets contained in the country's five-year plan, released in March 2021, could lead to emissions continuing to increase.\nA new Chinese national commitment is to be submitted to the UN in the run up to the Glasgow COP26 meeting.\nBut there are significant challenges.\n\"The nature of the peaking in the 2030 target can be only measured in a 100% certain way after the fact,\" said Dr Shuwei Zhang, from the Draworld Environment Research Centre in Beijing.\n \"The 2060 neutrality goal is theoretically possible, but could become unfeasible in reality, if action is continuously delayed.\"\n \"From now, there is no leeway to accommodate coal any longer.\" \nChina will have to limit coal for energy, not just inside the country but outside as well. \nThe financing of overseas coal power plants will have to wind down.\nRight now, the country's emissions have rebounded in the wake of the pandemic, as coal continues to burn brightly.\nBut many remain optimistic that, if China says it can do something, then it will get there.\nThe Philippines is one of the countries suffering the most from the impacts of climate change. \nLike many other developing economies, the country is very keen to use energy to bring people out of poverty and raise living standards. \nIn the past, the Philippines has looked to significantly increase investment in coal to foster development. \nBut its current approach seeks to move away from coal, and experts say the country could be a role model for many developing nations in similar situations. \nHas the Philippines lived up to its promises?\nUp until the Paris Agreement, the Philippines had not had any international requirements to curb its carbon.\nBut in the Paris pact, it committed to cut its emissions by 70% below \"business as usual\" by 2030.  According to the Climate Action Tracker analysis, its actions to date are compatible with keeping warming well below 2C this century.\nIn 2019, around half the country's electricity came from coal - and plans in the pipeline would have more than doubled the country's coal fired capacity.\nBut in October 2020, the government announced a moratorium on new coal plants, preferring instead to pursue a more mixed energy strategy.\nAccording to the Climate Action Tracker, this could curb emissions from the Philippines by 35% on top of their current policy projections by 2030.\n\"I think that one of the most critical factors is that the market has been very important in the power sector,\" said Dr Bill Hare. \n\"In other countries in Southeast Asia, we have what's called political economy, vested interests dominate in places such as Vietnam or Indonesia.\"\n\"But in the Philippines, the market has been really important in determining investments for quite some time. And I think that's what we're seeing unfolding, multiplied by a government predisposition now towards renewables, and a realisation that, as a very vulnerable country, they really need to be getting their act together.\"\nThe expectation of observers is that with funding from the UN's Green Climate Fund and more focus on sustainability from international banks, the move away from fossil fuels in the Philippines in the longer term will likely speed up. \nThe Philippines has not yet set a long-term goal, but it says it is committed to submitting a new national climate plan with enhanced targets. \nThe country will also likely push for further action on a concept known as \"loss and damage\" within the UN negotiation process.\nFor developing nations, this means financial recompense for the impacts of climate change that cannot be avoided or adapted to.\nBut richer countries are strongly resistant, believing that because they contributed the most to carbon emissions, they will be on the hook for compensation for centuries to come.\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "title": "Who are the Taliban?",
      "tags": "Pakistan,Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "The Taliban were removed from power in Afghanistan by US-led forces in 2001, but the group has seized control of the country once again following a rapid offensive.\nThe capital, Kabul, was the last major city to fall to the offensive that began months ago but accelerated as the hardline Islamists gained control of territories.\nThe group entered direct talks with the US back in 2018, and in February 2020 the two sides struck a peace deal that committed the US to withdrawal and the Taliban to preventing attacks on US forces. Other promises included not allowing al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas it controlled and proceeding with national peace talks.\nBut in the year that followed, the Taliban continued to target Afghan security forces and civilians, advancing rapidly across the country.\nThe Taliban, or \"students\" in the Pashto language, emerged in the early 1990s in northern Pakistan following the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. It is believed that the predominantly Pashtun movement first appeared in religious seminaries - mostly paid for by money from Saudi Arabia - which preached a hardline form of Sunni Islam.\nThe promise made by the Taliban - in Pashtun areas straddling Pakistan and Afghanistan - was to restore peace and security and enforce their own austere version of Sharia, or Islamic law, once in power.\nFrom south-western Afghanistan, the Taliban quickly extended their influence. In September 1995 they captured the province of Herat, bordering Iran, and exactly one year later they captured the Afghan capital, Kabul, overthrowing the regime of President Burhanuddin Rabbani - one of the founding fathers of the Afghan mujahideen that resisted the Soviet occupation. By 1998, the Taliban were in control of almost 90% of Afghanistan.\nAfghans, weary of the mujahideen's excesses and infighting after the Soviets were driven out, generally welcomed the Taliban when they first appeared on the scene. Their early popularity was largely due to their success in stamping out corruption, curbing lawlessness and making the roads and the areas under their control safe for commerce to flourish.\nBut the Taliban also introduced or supported punishments in line with their strict interpretation of Sharia law - such as public executions of convicted murderers and adulterers, and amputations for those found guilty of theft. Men were required to grow beards and women had to wear the all-covering burka.\nThe Taliban also banned television, music and cinema, and disapproved of girls aged 10 and over going to school. They were accused of various human rights and cultural abuses. One notorious example was in 2001, when the Taliban went ahead with the destruction of the famous Bamiyan Buddha statues in central Afghanistan, despite international outrage.\nPakistan has repeatedly denied that it was the architect of the Taliban enterprise, but there is little doubt that many Afghans who initially joined the movement were educated in madrassas (religious schools) in Pakistan.\nPakistan was also one of only three countries, along with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which recognised the Taliban when they were in power in Afghanistan. It was also the last country to break diplomatic ties with the group.\nAt one point, the Taliban threatened to destabilise Pakistan from areas they controlled in the north-west. One of the most high-profile and internationally condemned of all Pakistani Taliban attacks took place in October 2012, when schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai was shot on her way home in the town of Mingora.\nA major military offensive two years later following the Peshawar school massacre greatly reduced the group's influence in Pakistan though. At least three key figures of the Pakistani Taliban had been killed in US drone strikes in 2013, including the group's leader, Hakimullah Mehsud.\nThe attention of the world was drawn to the Taliban in Afghanistan in the wake of the 11 September 2001 World Trade Center attacks in New York. The Taliban were accused of providing a sanctuary for the prime suspects - Osama Bin Laden and his al-Qaeda movement.\nOn October 7, 2001, a US-led military coalition launched attacks in Afghanistan, and by the first week of December the Taliban regime had collapsed. The group's then-leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, and other senior figures, including Bin Laden, evaded capture despite one of the largest manhunts in the world. \nMany senior Taliban leaders reportedly took refuge in the Pakistani city of Quetta, from where they guided the Taliban. But the existence of what was dubbed the \"Quetta Shura\" was denied by Islamabad.\nDespite ever higher numbers of foreign troops, the Taliban gradually regained and then extended their influence in Afghanistan, rendering vast tracts of the country insecure, and violence in the country returned to levels not seen since 2001.\nThere were numerous Taliban attacks on Kabul and, in September 2012, the group carried out a high-profile raid on Nato's Camp Bastion base.\nHopes of a negotiated peace were raised in 2013, when the Taliban announced plans to open an office in Qatar. But mistrust on all sides remained high and the violence went on.\nIn August 2015, the Taliban admitted they had covered up Mullah Omar's death - reportedly of health problems at a hospital in Pakistan - for more than two years. The following month, the group said it had put aside weeks of infighting and rallied around a new leader in the form of Mullah Mansour, who had been the deputy of Mullah Omar.\nAt around the same time, the Taliban seized control of a provincial capital for the first time since their defeat in 2001, taking control of the strategically important city of Kunduz.\nMullah Mansour was killed in a US drone strike in May 2016 and replaced by his deputy Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada, who remains in control of the group.\nIn the year following the US-Taliban peace deal of February 2020 - which was the culmination of a long spell of direct talks - the Taliban appeared to shift their tactics from complex attacks in cities and on military outposts to a wave of targeted assassinations that terrorised Afghan civilians.\nThe targets - journalists, judges, peace activists, women in positions of power - suggested that the Taliban had not changed their extremist ideology, only their strategy. \nDespite grave concerns from Afghan officials over the government's vulnerability to the Taliban without international support, the new US president, Joe Biden, announced in April 2021 that all American forces would leave the country by 11 September - two decades to the day since the felling of the World Trade Center. \nHaving outlasted a superpower through two decades of war, the Taliban began seizing vast swathes of territory, before once again toppling a government in Kabul in the wake of a foreign power withdrawing.\nThey swept across Afghanistan in just 10 days, taking their first provincial capital on 6 August . By 15 August, they were at the gates of Kabul.\nTheir lightning advance prompted tens of thousands of people to flee their homes, many arriving in the Afghan capital, others heading for neighbouring countries.\nThe Taliban's return to rule brings an end to almost 20 years of a US-led coalition's presence in the country."

      "text": "Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has condemned the fashion industry over its \"huge\" contribution to climate change, in a magazine interview.\nMs Thunberg told Vogue Scandinavia that fashion brands needed to take responsibility for the environmental impact of their products.\nIn a tweet, she accused some companies of \"greenwash\" ad campaigns designed to make their clothes appear sustainable.\nVogue Scandinavia featured Ms Thunberg, 18, on the cover of its first issue. \nIn the interview, Ms Thunberg said she last bought a new item of clothing three years ago and \"it was second-hand\".\n\"I just borrow things from people I know,\" Ms Thunberg said.\nOn Sunday she tweeted a picture of Vogue Scandinavia's front cover, which showed her wearing an oversized trench coat while petting a horse in a forest.\nIn the tweet Ms Thunberg - one of the world's best-known climate campaigners - criticised \"fast fashion that many treat as disposables\".\nThe term \"fast fashion\" is used to describe the rapid, low-cost production of clothing to service demand for seasonal trends.\nCalling for a \"system change\", Ms Thunberg said fashion could not be mass produced and consumed \"sustainably as the world is shaped today\".\nThe United Nations says the fashion industry is \"widely believed to be the second-most polluting industry in the world\".\nIt accounts for more than 20% of wastewater globally, the UN says. About 93bn cubic metres of water - enough for five million people to survive - is used by the fashion industry every year.\nAs for carbon emissions, the industry is responsible for about 8% of the total worldwide. That's more than all international flights and shipping combined, the UN says.\nIn response to this, fashion brands have started to take action to reduce their environmental footprint.\nBut environmental campaigners like Ms Thunberg say many of these brands are promoting solutions that only appear to address the problem.\nThese companies are often accused of greenwashing, which is a form of marketing spin designed to mislead consumers about the environmental merits of a product.\nKnown for her impassioned speeches, Ms Thunberg has become a figurehead for the global climate change movement.\nHer solo protest outside Sweden's parliament in 2018 inspired millions of young people to join her school climate strike campaign, Fridays for Future.\nSince then, she has received Nobel Peace Prize nominations and travelled across the Atlantic on a yacht to attend a UN climate conference in New York."

      "tags": "Wildfires,Environment",
      "text": "In our monthly feature, Then and Now, we reveal some of the ways that planet Earth has been changing against the backdrop of a warming world. In recent years, the devastating impact of wildfires has been dominating headlines around the world. Although fires have long been part of natural history, scientists are voicing concern that recent fires are becoming more frequent, more intense and more widespread.\nIn recent years, the widespread devastation of wildfires has dominated headlines around the world, as millions of acres were destroyed and thousands of people left homeless.\nFires in the western US and Australia have been among the most deadly.\nIn the first few hours of the new year in 2020, a devastating bushfire arrived in the New South Wales village of Cobargo. Within hours, the fire had ripped through the main street, leaving little but smoky, charred ruins in its wake.\nThe destroyed village became one of the defining symbols of what is now being referred to as Australia's Black Summer, which killed at least 34 people, an estimated three billion animals, and scorched 46 million acres (186,000 square kilometres).\nAlthough wildfires have long been part of the landscape, they are becoming more frequent, more widespread, and more intense.\nEach summer, parts of the world are gripped by these natural infernos, with flames travelling at speeds similar to the bulls rampaging through the Spanish streets of Pamplona. \nAt these speeds, it becomes almost impossible for firefighters to stop and control the spreading fire, and to protect homes and properties in its path.\nHowever, it is worth noting that wildfires have long been part of the natural cycle in many habitats. Without these natural fires, we would not have many of the species that thrive in these environments.\nThere are trees that actually need fire in order to germinate and produce the forests of the future. \nFor example, a species of gum (eucalyptus) tree has seeds that are coated in a resin requiring them to be exposed to fire in order to melt the resin and expose the seed within. There are other trees with thick barks which act as heat shields to protect the vital sapwood that transports nutrients and water throughout the tree.\nWithout fire, many of the trees that depend on, or have adapted to, this \"fire ecology\" would struggle to reproduce, changing the habitat. This would make life difficult for the species that depend upon them to survive.\nHowever, there is real concern that the fires that once were the saviour of these landscapes are now becoming too frequent and too intense.\nA 2017 report by the US Global Change Research Program recorded a \"profound increase in forest fire activity\" in recent decades.\nIt cited warmer, drier conditions, increased drought, and a longer fire season as reasons for boosting the wildfire risk.\nAnother factor is the emergence of new pests and diseases that cause widespread dieback of plants and trees. \nFor example, the emerald ash borer has killed millions of trees throughout the US. \nThis results in a vast volume of dead wood remaining in the landscape, which - in turn - acts as a fuel to feed any wildfires that do break out.\nIn its fourth assessment report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said: \"Disturbances such as wildfire and insect outbreaks are increasing and are likely to intensify in a warmer future with drier soils and longer growing seasons.\" \nIt added: \"Warmer summer temperatures are expected to extend the annual window of high fire ignition risk by 10-30%.\"\nWhile some wildfires are caused by lightning strikes, the vast majority are believed to be started by people - either accidentally or intentionally.\nScientists say it is necessary to develop measures to help local communities to become more resilient to the increased risk of wildfires - primarily through land management of areas surrounding settlements, and through an education programme of how to reduce the risks of fires being started in the first place.\nOur Planet Then and Now will continue each month up to the UN climate summit in Glasgow, which is scheduled to start in November 2021"

      "text": "Wildfires are continuing to rip through the Greek island of Evia, prompting residents to flee to safety by sea. \nMore than 2,000 people have been evacuated, with elderly residents carried on to ferries.\nLocal officials said more help was needed to fight the fires that have destroyed parts of the island.\nThe EU said it was mobilising one of its biggest responses to tackle the wildfires affecting Greece and a number of other European nations.\nGreece and neighbouring Turkey have been battling devastating blazes for nearly two weeks as the region suffers its worst heatwave in decades. Temperatures have risen to 45C (113F) in Greece. \nA number of wildfires have struck the country in recent days. One blaze in the northern suburb of Athens is said to have subsided.\nHeatwaves such as this are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. The subsequent hot, dry weather is likely to fuel wildfires.\nOn Evia, a large island to the north and east of Athens, two fire fronts have destroyed thousands of hectares of land, along with a number of houses and businesses. \nFirefighters have been struggling to keep fires at bay in a number of villages on the island.\nImages on Sunday show more people being evacuated including elderly people who were pictured being carried on to ferries. \nWith no sign of the fire subsiding, residents and officials are calling for more help. \nGiannis Kontzias, mayor of the municipality of Istiaia in the northern part of Evia, told local news: \"It's already too late, the area has been destroyed.\"\nHe appealed for more help from water-bombing planes and helicopters. \nBut Civil Protection Chief Nikos Hardalias said the planes faced a number of difficulties including poor visibility caused by the fires. \nBy Bethany Bell, BBC News, Evia, Greece\nSome people are finding it hard to breathe because there is so much smoke and ash in the air. \nYesterday we were in one of the villages that was evacuated and the whole place was covered in a pall of orange smoke. One Serbian tourist who was waiting on the beach for a ferry said it was like an apocalyptic movie. \nPeople here are on alert and there is a lot of distress. There is a feeling that the authorities are letting people down and not helping enough but the government says it is doing all it can.\nA number of countries have responded to Greece's call for help including France, Germany and the UK.\nThe EU said member countries have now deployed nine planes, close to 1,000 fire fighters and 200 vehicles to Greece.\nLate on Sunday, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis expressed his \"heartfelt gratitude\" to countries that had sent assistance. \n\"We thank you for standing by Greece during these trying times,\" he wrote on Twitter.\nOn Monday, Mr Mitsotakis was due to chair a ministerial meeting to discuss relief measures for those who lost property in the fires.\nElsewhere in Greece, fires in the Peloponnese region are said to be stable and fires in the northern Athens suburb have subsided. \n\"The situation in Attica (which encompasses Athens) is better but we are afraid of the danger of flare-ups,\" Mr Hardalias said.\nThe military are patrolling the area amid concerns that the fire could re-start. \nTurkey is also battling a series of wildfires, which have been labelled the worst in the country's history. \nEight people have died and thousands have been forced to flee their homes.\nOn Sunday the country's Agriculture and Forestry Minister, Bekir Pakdemirli, said 235 fires had been contained and five were ongoing.\nAre you in Greece?

      "text": "One of the bigger providers of Covid PCR test kits has responded after images of overflowing drop boxes were shared online.\nThe firm, Randox, said it was increasing the number of drop boxes and the frequency of box collections.\nThe move comes after people posted pictures of returned test kits piled high on top of drop boxes in Sutton and Hampstead over the weekend.\nOne MP said the \"pointless\" tests were \"becoming a bad joke\".\nAt least one PCR test is required for all arrivals from international destinations within two days of landing in the UK. \nThose returning from green listed countries, or who are fully vaccinated and returning from amber list countries, are required to take only one.\nHowever, those not fully vaccinated from amber list destinations must take at least two tests, one on day two and one on day eight. \nOne of those affected, Gavin Marshall, said he had to drop off a test kit on behalf of his daughter, who had completed a PCR test two days after returning from a holiday in Portugal.\nDespite the fact that the box was full, he said: \"I had no choice but to leave the sample at that site, because there wasn't enough time to get to another drop box before collection deadline.\" \nMr Marshall called it a \"Covid travel rip-off\".  \nRory Boland, Which? Travel Editor, said he had seen problems with several testing firms and an increase in every type of complaint. Complaints included tests not arriving on time, people being unable to book tests and misleading prices. \n\"It's particularly frustrating as Which? raised this with government a few months ago,\" he added.\n\"The system isn't set up for large numbers of people travelling and now many people are travelling the system is not working properly. The government might now say it is looking into the prices of tests, but it's very late in the day and these problems were foreseeable.\"\nLabour MP Ben Bradshaw tweeted in reaction to the photos: \"These pointless rip-off day two PCR tests for people returning from amber and green list countries, most of which have a fraction of our Covid-19 rates, are becoming a bad joke.\"\nA government spokesperson said health secretary Sajid Javid had asked the competition watchdog to investigate excessive pricing and said it was working with testing providers to reduce costs.\nNancy Diaz was due to fly to Barcelona on 21 July. When her test arrived, she registered it and delivered it to a Randox Health drop box in Edinburgh, two days before her flight.\nHowever, Ms Diaz said she only received confirmation that her test had arrived at the company's laboratory the following evening, meaning she knew her results were not going to come through in time for her flight.\nDue to the delay, Ms Diaz rebooked her flight for 24 hours later, however, when she received her negative test result at 13:26 BST on 21 July, the day she had originally planned to fly on, she was required to do another test at Edinburgh Airport as her original test results were now outside of the 72-hour window.\n\"I was given no refund, as they (Randox) claim the 24 hours promise is from when the test arrives at their lab, which can be whenever, apparently,\" said Ms Diaz. \n\"The fact that the test can take more than 24 hours to arrive to their lab was not mentioned.\"\nLizzy Merrall ordered tests for her parents and for herself on 19 July, ahead of a family holiday to Spain on 27 July. \nHer parents' tests arrived, but her pre-departure test she needed to take with her on holiday to do before flying back to the UK did not.\n\"I contacted Randox on the 26 July asking where my tests were,\" she told the BBC.\n\"I asked them if they could at least offer me a refund for one of the tests but they never replied to me and I had to pay \u00a380 for a last minute test.\"\nMs Merrrall said her test pack only arrived once she was already on holiday in Spain.\nRandox has not responded to requests for comment in relation to Ms Diaz's and Ms Merrall's experiences.\nA spokesperson for the Northern Ireland-based company said it was \"constantly expanding and improving its Covid-19 testing capacity and associated logistics network, which is already the largest in the United Kingdom, to meet the rapidly growing demand resulting from the loosening of travel restrictions\". \n\"Randox continues to increase the number of drop boxes across the United Kingdom, which already totals over 200, and is increasing the frequency of box collections which are already occurring multiple times per day,\" they added.\n\"Randox is providing premium testing services in dynamic and rapidly changing circumstances and is committed to continuously improving its logistics network, to ensure that international travellers receive their results in time.  All of the sample kits pictured will be processed.\"\nPCR tests are more expensive than lateral flow tests and have been criticised by some in the travel industry for pricing many potential travellers out. \nThe government has previously defended their use, saying they are useful as they can be sequenced to check for variants of concern, unlike lateral flow tests. \nBut some have criticised the government, saying they are not sequencing enough tests. \nLast week, Conservative MP Huw Merriman, chair of the Transport select committee, said they should be dropped. \n\"PCR tests can be two to three times the cost of lateral flow testing. It's pricing out holidays for those that don't have the means to pay for those tests,\" he said.\n\"I wouldn't mind if the tests were going to be used for sequencing, so we can find all variants of concern, but if only 5% of PCR tests are being sequenced, then surely it's a complete waste of money.\"\nThe Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) has highlighted that as the vast majority of travellers into the UK do not test positive, their tests are not sent for sequencing. \nOf those sent for sequencing, a minority contain insufficient virus, but more than 95% of viable green and amber tests are sequenced, it said.\nA DHSC spokesperson said: \"All positive tests for arrivals from red list countries are sequenced and there is a legal requirement for private testing providers to sequence positive PCR tests for amber or green country travellers.\n\"We are already a world leader in genomics, with over 600,000 positive Covid-19 samples having been sequenced during this pandemic.\""

The waterfall at Ao Yon is not far from the coast and a popular tourist spot in Phuket's Wichit area.\nHer death came just weeks after Thailand launched its so-called \"Phuket Sandbox\" scheme. She reportedly arrived in Thailand on 13 July.\nUnder the programme, vaccinated tourists can come to the island without the need to quarantine, but cannot travel to the mainland within 14 days.\nMs Sauvain-Weisskopf's death has prompted local officials to step up security on the island amid concerns that it is a huge setback to the sandbox scheme. \nGovernor Narong Woonciew said officials would survey unsafe areas in each community and put them under surveillance.\nA spokesman for Thailand's foreign minister Don Pramudwinai said on Twitter he had sent his condolences to the Swiss ambassador for the \"murder of a Swiss woman in Phuket\". \nAnd government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri said that Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha had ordered police \"to expedite the investigation to identify and arrest the culprit\".\nHe also ordered officials to increase security in Phuket. \nSwitzerland's foreign ministry meanwhile released a statement on Thursday saying Thai authorities had contacted them about the death of an \"apparent Swiss citizen\" but gave no more details, citing privacy concerns.\nLocal reports have said she was a Swiss diplomat, although officials have not yet commented on her job.\nBefore the pandemic, tourism accounted for about one-fifth of the Thai economy. \nYou may also be interested in...\nYoung Thais in Phuket share their hopes and fears about future employment in the country's tourist industry."

He has pleaded not guilty. \nPotential jurors are being questioned over whether they can keep an open mind in the case.          \nFollowing jury selection, the trial is due to begin on 18 August and could last several weeks.

As I said to the committee, I accept that communications of this nature should be done in future through only the most formal of channels.\n\"I agree that the guidance on how former ministers engage with government could be updated and was pleased to provide some suggestions on this to the committee.\"\nA Treasury spokesman said: \"This report is clear that the Treasury was right to consider Greensill's proposals, right to ultimately reject their proposals, and concludes that the Treasury behaved with absolute integrity throughout the process.\"\nDeputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said Mr Cameron being cleared of breaking any rules \"proves that the rules that are supposed to regulate lobbying are completely unfit for purpose\".

      "text": "Belarus's president has denied claims that his security services were involved in the death of dissident Vitaly Shishov, who was found hanged in neighbouring Ukraine last week.\n\"Who was he for me and for Belarus? For us he was simply a nobody,\" President Alexander Lukashenko told reporters. \nVitaly Shishov was organising help for Belarusians who fled to Ukraine from Mr Lukashenko's post-election crackdown.\nThe UK and US are tightening sanctions on Belarus, hitting economic sectors.\nThey include potash and petroleum products - key sources of income for Mr Lukashenko's regime - as well as financial services and transport. He and his top aides are already under Western sanctions. \nWhen asked by the BBC about the latest British measures he said: \"You can go choke on your sanctions... You are American lapdogs!\"\nThere were anti-Lukashenko rallies after the disputed vote a year ago. The weeks of mass protests were the biggest challenge yet to Mr Lukashenko's 27-year rule as president. \nLast year police detained thousands of anti-Lukashenko protesters as they broke up the demonstrations, using batons and tear gas. The opposition says more than 600 political prisoners are still in jail.\nMonday's news conference, televised live, was his first such appearance during the political crisis - an event officially named \"the big conversation\".\nSupport from Russian President Vladimir Putin has proven a lifeline for the embattled president. But Western governments, like the Belarusian opposition, denounced the vote as fraudulent and tightened sanctions.\nBelarusian opposition leaders are either in jail or were forced into exile. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who claimed victory in the election, is based in Lithuania.\nUkrainian police probing Shishov's death are investigating whether it was suicide or a murder made to look like suicide. He was found hanged in a park near his home in the capital Kyiv.\nColleagues in his organisation, Belarusian Home in Ukraine, suspect that Lukashenko agents were involved, and say Shishov had been under surveillance.\nHis partner Bazhena Zholudzh told the BBC: \"Lukashenko won't be here forever, and this will all be over and they will have to answer for what they have done.\" \nThe case of Belarusian Olympic sprinter Krystina Timanovskaya also grabbed world attention last week. She flew to Poland - not home to Belarus - after a row with Belarusian team coaches.\nMr Lukashenko mocked her, saying \"she took 36th place in her discipline - say no more!\" \"Why did we include her? The IOC [International Olympic Committee] recommended her!\"\nIn Tokyo she said there was an attempt to force her onto a flight back to Belarus - a claim denied by Mr Lukashenko, who said there was \"not a single\" KGB agent at the Olympics.\nLooking back to the election, Mr Lukashenko said: \"This was not an easy year for us\", adding that Belarus had \"passed a serious test of national unity\".\nHe said that last year \"some were preparing for fair and honest elections, while others were calling for a coup\". \nBefore the latest Western sanctions were announced he warned that he could withdraw co-operation on preventing the smuggling of radioactive materials. \"This is the issue of issues for the Americans... but I have warned them - if you cross the red line too far, we'll stop talking to them on this subject.\""

      "text": "Withdrawing troops from Afghanistan is a strategic mistake that risks a resurgence of terrorism, a former top UK general has said.\nGen Sir Richard Barrons, who was head of UK Joint Forces Command, told the BBC the UK and Western allies have \"sold the future of Afghanistan\".\nMost British troops left last month and the Taliban have captured five cities in three days.\nA senior Tory backbencher called it a \"shabby withdrawal\".\nFighting in Afghanistan intensified in recent weeks after President Joe Biden ordered the withdrawal of US forces, followed by allies such as the UK.\nTwo decades after they were removed from power by the US over their support for Osama Bin Laden in the wake of the 11 September attacks, Taliban militants are advancing across the country and have seized five regional capitals since Friday.\nGen Barrons told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: \"The withdrawal now is a strategic mistake. I don't believe it's in our own interest.\"\nHe said the decision had \"sold the future of Afghanistan into a very difficult place\" and sent a \"really unfortunate message\" to allies in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\nIt suggests \"we don't have the stomach to see these things through, and we would rather leave than ensure that a humanitarian or political crisis doesn't occur\", Gen Barrons said.\n\"We will run the risk of terrorist entities re-establishing in Afghanistan, to bring harm in Europe and elsewhere,\" he said. \"I think this is a very poor strategic outcome.\"\nThe UK government advised all British citizens to leave this week because of the worsening security situation.\nBut Gen Barrons said an exodus of the international community \"as fair weather friends\", followed by the Afghan elite, could undermine the government and its military, accelerating the crisis.\nHe said he feared the country could split in two or be plunged into a decades-long civil war unless political discussions could resume.\nTory MP Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the House of Commons Defence Committee, wrote in the Mail on Sunday that the UK was making a \"shabby withdrawal\" and \"abandoning the country to the very insurgency that drew us there in the first place\".\n\"Unless we wake up to the reality of what is taking place, Afghanistan might once again become a terror state. This, remember, is the country that brought us 9/11,\" he said.\nThe UK and its allies should retain an assistance force of 5,000 troops to give ground, air and intelligence support to the Afghan army in their fight against the Taliban, Mr Ellwood said.\nBy withdrawing, the UK was also giving up a \"strategically crucial space to an expansionist China\", he said.\nBut Gen Barrons suggested China would be key to any political resolution, because of its influence on Pakistan - which was one of the few countries to recognise the Taliban when it last held power.\nHe said because China shared a border with Afghanistan it would want to avoid any instability that could mean refugees - or militants - flowing over the border.\nA UK Government spokeswoman said: \"We recognise that the security situation in Afghanistan is serious, and reports of the escalating violence are extremely disturbing.\n\"We do not believe there is any military solution to Afghanistan's conflict, and call on the Taliban to end their campaign of violence and engage in meaningful dialogue with the Afghan government.\n\"There needs to be a negotiated solution to ensure a lasting peace.\" "

      "text": "The number of people waiting for heart surgery in England could rise by more than 40% by next spring, a charity has warned.\nThe British Heart Foundation said more government money was needed - or it will take up to five years for cardiac services to return to pre-Covid levels.\n\"Even before the pandemic began, waiting lists for vital heart care were far too long,\" said the BHF.\nThe government said it had invested \u00a31bn this year to reduce waiting lists.\nThe charity's warning about heart care comes just a day after new analysis suggested nearly 14 million people could be on NHS waiting lists in England by next autumn.\nA backlog is predicted as patients who did not come forward during the pandemic now seek treatment and join waiting lists for routine operations.\nThe BHF said the number waiting for heart surgery - such as a heart bypass or transplant - in England is predicted to rise from 11,000 to more than 15,000 by February. \nThe number waiting for more general heart care - for example diagnostic scans and treatment such as stents - could reach 500,000 by early 2024, it said. This would be double the levels seen before the pandemic in February 2020.\nThe BHF said it had carried out modelling for its worst case scenario - and estimated that cardiology waiting lists might not return to early 2020 levels until the end of 2026.\nAround 7.6 million people live with heart and circulatory diseases in the UK, the BHF said. \n\"Delay in diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases is not just about improving symptoms, however important that is - it is about saving lives,\" Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, medical director at the BHF, said.\n\"Tragically, we have already seen thousands of extra deaths from heart and circulatory diseases during the pandemic, and delays to care have likely contributed to this terrible toll.\"\nThe charity said it wanted to see an above-inflation rise in health spending and a plan to recruit more heart specialists. \n\"At this critical moment, the government must act now to avoid more lives lost to treatable heart conditions. Addressing the growing heart care backlog is only the start,\" said Prof Samani.\n\"We must also see a clear plan, alongside significant and ongoing investment, to build capacity back into the NHS and address the pandemic's impact on health workers. Getting this right would avoid preventable heartbreak for many families.\"\nThe government pointed to data from May this year that showed services were already recovering - and the number of new referrals for cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery had returned to similar levels seen prior to the pandemic.\n\"The NHS has faced huge challenges over the past year due to Covid-19 and we continue to support our incredible health and care staff who have kept services open for thousands of patients,\" a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said.\n\"This includes dedicated investment of \u00a31bn this year to tackle the backlog and reduce waiting lists.\""

      "text": "In 2017, National Trust colleagues Stacey Fordham, 43, and Lidia Rueda Losada, 37, had a casual chat about how they wished everything they bought wasn't packaged in so much plastic.\nThe conversation spurred an idea to open a shop selling food and household items entirely without packaging, and in March 2018 they took the plunge.\nThey opened Zero Green, believed to be the second store in the country and first in Bristol. \nZero Green sells more than 1,000 product lines: including pasta, grains and pulses in dispensers; frozen vegan pasties; eco-cleaning products; cosmetics and sustainable non-plastic toiletries. \nConsumers are encouraged to bring their own containers or use recycled jars and packaging to take their shopping home. \n\"We put in just over \u00a330,000 to start from our own savings,\" says Ms Fordham, who also previously worked for Sainsbury's.\n\"You have to really believe in what you're doing in order to do this, otherwise it's very hard.\"\nThe UK's first organic zero-waste shop was Earth.Food.Love in Totnes, set up by former Manchester United footballer Richard Eckersley and his wife Nicola in 2017. \nThe pioneering couple are credited by the zero-waste community with sharing how they established their business, offering full supplier lists, business plans and pricing lists for free, online. \nMs Fordham and Ms Rueda Losada used their tips. But there was a lot of trial and error, they say, plus additional challenges as they were determined to live by their green principles.\n\"It was really important for us to not buy virgin wood or racking off a shelf - everything we used in the shop was upcycled. \n\"We went to electrical companies and got big cable drums, upcycled pallets and salvaged scaffolding boards,\" says Ms Fordham.\nThey were \"really lucky\", she adds, as within six months Zero Green had broken even and eventually moved to a retail space four times bigger. \n\"The popularity of it all was more than we expected... demand was so high we physically couldn't fit people into the shop.\"\nBefore the pandemic, the store was taking in \u00a312,000 a week in sales, but now revenues have fallen by two thirds and they have had to lay off half their staff.\nThe online community of zero-waste shop owners estimates there are now roughly 320 zero-waste shops in the UK, but this also includes community interest companies (CICs) and organic wholefood shops. \nAccording to consumer expert Kate Hardcastle, it is difficult to collect official data because many shops go bust and fail. However, the community is growing steadily online and free advice is given to new entrepreneurs on a popular Facebook group. \nVita Viskackaite, 43, opened the Art of Zero Living store in Greenwich, London, in April.\nShe left a successful career in logistics with restaurant chain Itsu to run the shop, while her partner Justas pays the bills with his earnings. They have invested \u00a355,000 from savings.\n\"Two years ago, I read a book called Zero Waste Home by Bea Johnson and it captured me, as it wasn't just about saving the environment - it was also about saving money and improving your life,\" she says.\nInspired, Ms Viskackaite got rid of 30% of everything she owned and began shopping at a zero-waste shop in north London, but she had to take two buses each way to do her weekly shopping. \n\"Then coronavirus came and I was very sad because I didn't have anyone locally to buy from,\" she says.\n\"So, my husband said to me, 'If you feel so strongly about this, why don't you open your own shop?'\" \nIn June, the couple made \u00a310,000 in sales. After paying \u00a39,000 in overheads including stock and rent, they have a \u00a31,000 profit. \n\"I hope that one day, there will be many more people who join the zero-waste lifestyle and avoid buying products using single-use plastic just because it's convenient,\" stresses Ms Viskackaite.\n\"We were never planning to become rich out of this, we just wanted to have peace of mind.\"\nResearch from environmental consultancy, Eunomia, shows mean annual turnover for EU zero-waste shops is around \u20ac170,000 (\u00a3144,000) based on a sample size of 268 packaging-free shops in 10 EU countries. And there is evidence shop turnover has increased over the past three years.\n\"Covid has jolted social consciousness, a retailer told me,\" says Ms Hardcastle. \"In our survey of 140 people, 85% of people said they care more about the environment than they did 12 months ago.\"\nIn Sussex, Burgess Hill mayor Anne Eves and council leader Robert Eggleston say there is definitely a movement to rejuvenate high streets with green businesses, like zero-waste shops and eco-fashion retailers.\nSince being elected in 2019, they have negotiated rent reductions with commercial landlords and divided up large empty retail units. Start-ups pay lower rents and some avoid business rates altogether.\n\"We want to nurture these businesses. At some point they will spread their wings and fly, and we want to support them so they have a chance,\" says Mr Eggleston.\nMs Eves, a Green councillor, says sustainability matters a lot to her constituents. She set up a monthly repair cafe to help people fix their electronic gadgets, clothes and bedding that has been very popular, and thinks every High Street should have one. \n\"We are gradually changing things... we'd like to see this town thriving as it was 20 years ago.\"\nArchitecture graduate Lydia Wilson, 26, started Waste Not Want Not in Bridport, Dorset, three years ago. \n\"I wanted something which enabled people to live waste-free but also [to] start a conversation on a much wider scale on ethics and organic living,\" she says.\nMs Wilson took out \u00a345,000 in personal loans to start her business. She offers more than 700 products and her biggest customer base is in the 35-50s age group. \nIt took 18 months for her to break even. Prior to Covid she took \u00a312,000 a year in salary, but now everything is being ploughed back into the store.\nShe says the journey has been really hard, running the business all by herself, and is thankful that her customers have rallied round. \n\"I know now that I've got a community of people who really want the shop to be here, and would do what they could to make sure the shop stays.\n\"That's something I might call upon - it's a limited company but I want to transition it into a community benefit society or a co-operative.\"\nMs Fordham and Ms Viskackaite both agree that their communities are crucial.\n\"I've learned it's OK to ask for help and be honest and open with your customers and staff,\" says Ms Fordham. \n\"Coming from the big bad business world you never admitted those things, but it's lovely to get advice and help.\"\nHowever, there are not yet enough such businesses to enable consumers to \"shop economically\" in the UK and many consumers lack information about them, stresses Ms Hardcastle.\nYet she still thinks zero-waste shops have an edge on supermarkets, some of which are now trialling similar ideas.\n\"The community is incredibly important to the success of zero waste shops and difficult to replicate,\" she says.\n\"Is it a sustainable business model? Yes because interest is beginning to grow but it has to be run by people who are committed to the cause.\""

Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.\nThe rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. \nWhen these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.\nThe world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.\nTemperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100. \nHowever, unless further action is taken, the planet could still warm by more than 2C by the end of this century. A report in 2021 by the Climate Action Tracker group calculated that the world was heading for 2.4C of warming by the end of the century.\nIf nothing is done, scientists think global warming could exceed 4C in the future, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels and irreversible loss of plant and animal species. \nExtreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods. \nWith further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as farmland turns into desert. In other regions, the opposite is happening, with extreme rainfall causing historic flooding - as seen recently in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nPeople in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse.\nOur oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already lost half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change.\nWildfires are becoming more frequent as climate change increases the risk of hot, dry weather. \nAnd as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change.\nIn a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.\nScientists believe at least 550 species could be lost this century if action is not taken. \nClimate change has different effects in different areas of the world. Some places will warm more than others, some will receive more rainfall and others will face more droughts. \nIf temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:\nCountries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C. \nThe UK is hosting a summit for world leaders, called COP26, in November, where countries will set out their carbon reduction plans for 2030. \nMany countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.\nExperts agree that this is achievable, but it will require governments, businesses and individuals to make big changes.\nMajor changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives can limit our impact on the climate:\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nTop image from Getty Images.
