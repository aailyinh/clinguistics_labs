      "text": "Boris Johnson has spoken to French President Emmanuel Macron for the first time since a row broke out between London and Paris over a military pact between the UK, US and Australia.\nThe UK prime minister and Mr Macron had agreed to \"continue working closely together around the world\", Downing Street said.\nA French government source said the two countries shared \"common interests\".\nThe Aukus pact cost France a submarine contract worth billions of dollars.\nThe row between Paris and London started after Australia signed up to the Aukus pact with the US and UK, to provide it with nuclear-powered submarines.\nThis involved Australia pulling out out of an existing $37bn (\u00a327bn) deal with France to build 12 conventional diesel-powered submarines.\nAs a result, the French defence minister cancelled talks with her UK counterpart, while the French government recalled its ambassadors in Washington and Canberra.\nOne minister called the Aukus deal a \"stab in the back\", but Mr Johnson has accused the French of over-reacting, urging Mr Macron: \"Donnez-moi (give me) a break.\"\nIn an effort to smooth out differences, a Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Johnson and Mr Macron had spoken by telephone on Friday and discussed \"a range of issues of mutual interest\".\n\"They reaffirmed the importance of the UK-France relationship and agreed to continue working closely together around the world on our shared agenda, through Nato and bilaterally,\" they added.\nThe two leaders also discussed migrant Channel crossings.\nThe spokesperson also said Mr Johnson and Mr Macron had \"noted in particular the strategic significance of our long-standing cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and in Africa\".\nAnd they had discussed how to \"break the business model of people smugglers who put lives at risk\" in the English Channel and resolved to \"keep talking on other issues, such as fisheries licences and the Northern Ireland Protocol\".\nA French government source told the BBC the two leaders had spoken at Mr Johnson's request.\nThey added: \"Mr Boris Johnson expressed his intention to re-establish cooperation between France and the United Kingdom, in accordance with our values and our common interests.\""

I understand why; it is about being practical and signing up to the situation across the UK. But it doesn't come without risk.\n\"Even though we will still have PCR testing for red-list countries, there is no guarantee you won't detect variants of concerns in any other country. They are not just restricted to countries on the red list, so I think it's a worry.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow.\nSenior government ministers have been meeting to discuss supply problems at petrol stations across the country. Fuel is the latest sector to be affected by a UK shortage of lorry drivers - with driver gaps made worse by the coronavirus pandemic and Brexit. Despite government reassurances over supplies, motorists have been seen queuing at some petrol stations, with social media reports suggesting some waiting up to 30 minutes. Earlier, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC nothing was being ruled out to help deliver petrol from refineries to stations.\nLast week we heard about the government's plans for tackling Covid during autumn and winter in England - amid warnings that too much pressure on the NHS could lead to tighter restrictions. Now, a critical care consultant working within England's biggest NHS trust - the University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB) NHS Trust- has said staff at his hospital are already \"hanging on by a thread\" as the winter approaches. Dr Dhruv Parekh said medics at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital were having to make difficult daily decisions on what they could and could not do due to the increased workload from Covid and non-Covid patients.\nThe Scottish government and Northern Ireland's Executive are to drop the requirement for fully vaccinated arrivals from non-red list countries to take a pre-departure Covid test - bringing their rules in line with those coming into force in England on 4 October. Wales has not decided whether to follow suit - with First Minister Mark Drakeford saying his ministers face a \"difficult decision\".\nSchools in two districts with high Covid-19 rates have brought back the requirement for face masks. At least four schools in Corby and two in Kettering, both in Northamptonshire, have asked for face masks to be worn in communal areas. Kettering has the second-highest case rate in England, while Corby has the third. At the start of term, schools in England were advised face coverings were no longer routinely needed for staff or pupils. But the Department for Education said schools could temporarily reintroduce bubble groups and face masks in communal spaces in areas with higher Covid rates.\nA woman who became the first person in the world to get the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus jab as part of a mass vaccination programme has had her booster dose. Margaret Keenan, 91, from Coventry, got her third injection at University Hospital in the city on Friday, the same place she was first vaccinated. Booster jabs are being offered to the over-50s, younger adults with health conditions and frontline health and care workers. The recommendation came from the JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) amid concern about waning immunity.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWondering about the flu vaccine, as the NHS braces for a difficult winter?

      "text": "Householders in the UK will find out in the next few weeks how much their gas bills are likely to increase in the coming year.\nThe energy regulator is due to announce the new energy price cap - the maximum amount that suppliers can charge in Great Britain.\nIt's expected to rise steeply, because global wholesale prices have gone up so much.\nEvery six months, Ofgem, the energy regulator, reviews the maximum price that suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThis is called the energy price cap. \nAbout 15 million households saw their energy bills increase by 12% when it was last updated in October. \nThe next review is due at the beginning of February, and the new cap will come into effect in April. Industry predictions suggest gas prices could go up by as much as 50%.\nThere is a separate energy market in Northern Ireland, with two gas suppliers, and prices have risen sharply for consumers there too.\nThere's been a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies over the past year.\nAs a result, wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. At the end of December, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about \u00a32,000 next year.\nReasons for the increase include:\nThere are a number of technical and geopolitical issues at play as well, which mean many countries across Europe are grappling with the same problems.\nHowever, the UK is hit relatively hard-hit because it is one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas. Around 85% of homes have gas central heating, and it also generates a third of the country's electricity. \nStorage capacity in the UK is also lower than in some other European countries.\nSince wholesale gas prices started to spike, more than 20 retail energy suppliers have collapsed in the UK. \nThis is largely because the energy price cap prevented retailers from passing on higher wholesale prices to their customers.\nSeveral smaller companies, with fewer reserves, could not weather this.\nFailed firms include Bulb Energy, with 1.7 million customers. Because of its size, it was put into \"special administration\", and is now run by the government, through Ofgem.\nNearly four million customers have been affected. Many households saw their energy prices rise when their supplier went bust, and they were switched over to a more expensive deal with another supplier.\nThe government faces calls from energy companies, the opposition, and even some of its own MPs, to do more to prevent prices from rising too much.\nSuggestions include:\nIn the past, consumers have been encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise.\nBut at the moment better offers - including fixed deals - are simply not available.\nPeople already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, householders are being encouraged to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.\nThe Energy Saving Trust says that simple changes to our homes and habits could offset the current price rises.\nMany companies face a considerable rise in their bills. That could mean they have to: \nEnergy-intensive industries are particularly exposed, but the problem affects every company that has to pay energy bills - even if it is just to heat an office or shop."

      "text": "Several supermarkets have closed petrol stations in Wales due to demand for fuel, amid panic buying.\nIt comes despite assurances from the UK government that people should carry on buying petrol as normal.\nTesco and Sainsbury's both confirmed closures, but Tesco said it had a \"good availability\" with deliveries arriving every day.\nAsda had to close some stations to temporarily refuel to meet demand, but did not report any fuel shortages. \nSainsbury's said its Thornhill store in Cardiff had shut on Friday afternoon, adding: \"All our sites are receiving more fuel and we'll reopen again as soon as possible.\"\nA Tesco Extra petrol station on Cowbridge Road, in Bridgend, was also closed as of 12:00 BST on Friday and at a Tesco in Bridgend, diesel was not available and only two pumps out of eight on its forecourt were open to motorists.\nCardiff Gate services off junction 30 of the M4 ran out of fuel at about 19:45 BST, according to Traffic Wales. \nThe Asda petrol station at Leckwith, near Cardiff City FC Stadium, was closed on Friday evening to refuel after the increased demand.\nSion Jones, of Valley Services, Llandysul in the Teifi Valley, said he would have to \"consider rationing fuel sales\" to customers if panic buying continues. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC the Army could be brought in to drive fuel tankers if it would help. \nSouth Wales Police appealed on Twitter for drivers to keep roads clear.\n\"We are aware of drivers queuing at petrol stations across South Wales,\" the force wrote.\n\"Keeping highways clear is essential for emergency services, & other public service functions, and hindering them poses a public safety risk.\"\nBus company Stagecoach South Wales also wrote on Twitter: \"All our services are experiencing severe delays due to traffic queues at petrol stations. We are working to maintain services.\"\nStagecoach apologised to passengers because it was unable to use the bus stop at Asda in Dowlais, Merthyr, due to the amount of vehicles queueing for fuel at the superstore.\nCardiff Bus said in a statement: \"We would like to apologise for the current delays we are experiencing across our network.\n\"The roads are extremely busy due to the panic buying of fuel - we would like to thank you for your patience, our driver will be with you asap.\"\nIt is estimated that the UK is short of about 100,000 HGV drivers - with gaps made worse by the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit.\nOutside Wales, some stations owned by BP and Esso-owned Tesco Alliance were shut on Thursday because of a lack of delivery drivers.\nSteve Coombe, of the Petrol Retailers Association, said: \"There were no supply outages last week but there are some sites that are confirming delay in deliveries... they appear confined to London and the south-east [of England] and one or two in the Midlands, but they appear to be temporary in nature.\"\nHe added: \"Sometimes newspaper headlines can sensationalise... everyone keep calm, there is plenty of stock. \n\"Those sites that have had problems are getting their fuel replenished.\"\nWill Young, who queued for half an hour for petrol at Morrisons in Llanishen, said:  \"You could see it coming really because on the news yesterday, it said it's going to happen over the next couple of weeks.\n\"It's not my problem but it is a problem for people who use their cars for every day purposes like business and taking their children to school.\"\nTony Fundell, another shopper, told BBC Wales: \"I think people are panicking. I've got enough to last me a few days so I'll top up as and when I need it.\n\"I'm retired so I've got enough time on my hands but I feel sorry for those who are in business.\"\nChris Bird, director of C J Bird Transport in Llantrisant, told BBC Radio Wales that petrol panic buyers are \"creating their own problem\".\n\"If you don't need it, don't bother. Unfortunately as humans we tend to panic and be very selfish in these times,\" he said.\nHe added that turning to European drivers to fix the HGV driver shortage is no solution.\n\"The eastern European drivers have been the band aid for the job for the last 10 years I would say.\n\"It's solvable, the market will find its feet, the wages will go up to a point where people will become more attracted to it.\"\nThe Welsh government said: \"The shortage of HGV drivers is of significant concern as they are critical to effective and timely distribution of goods across the country. \n\"We are monitoring the situation very closely but responsibility lies with UK government and we continue to raise our concerns with them.\"\nSome senior UK government ministers will meet later to discuss supply problems at petrol stations.

Other proposals include:\nLabour's deputy leader also confirmed social care would be the first sector to go through the fair pay process.\nMs Rayner - who is also Labour's shadow secretary for the future of work - argued that fair pay agreements would \"stop bad bosses from exploiting their workers and driving down pay\".\nShe also told BBC Breakfast that better pay and working conditions would ease pressure on employers by boosting staff retention and cutting the number of working days lost to sickness.\n\"Having good employment practices... means that you have good staff retention (and) those skills are retained within the organisation,\" she said.\nIn her speech, she also said the fair pay agreements would \"drive up pay, improve conditions in the workplace and stop bad bosses from exploiting their workers\", and that that ending \"poverty wages and insecure work\" would be the \"driving mission of the next Labour government\". \nWelcoming the proposal, TUC leader Frances O'Grady said: \"Giving workers and their unions more power to bargain collectively is the best way to improve pay and working conditions across Britain.\"\nMs Rayner's speech marked the beginning of Labour's annual conference  - Sir Keir's first in-person conference since he became leader in 2020."

Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is accused of grooming and sexually abusing women and underage girls.\nThe charges include one count of racketeering and eight counts of illegally transporting people across state lines for the purpose of sex.\nOver the past five weeks, the jury in Brooklyn, New York, has heard from a number of men and women who said the star stripped them of control, enforcing draconian rules over when they could eat, sleep and go to the bathroom, and pressured them into sexual acts, which he would often videotape.\nProsecutors have portrayed him as a predator who exploited his fame to attract fans into his circle, where he would demand strict obedience or else punish them. \n\"For decades, the defendant recruited and groomed women, girls and boys for his own sexual gratification,\" Elizabeth Geddes, a lawyer for the prosecution, told the jury. \"With the help of his inner circle, he slowly isolated his victims, set rules and exacted punishment.\"\nShe continued: \"It is time to hold the defendant responsible for the pain he inflicted on each of his victims. It is now time for the defendant to pay for his crimes. Convict him.\"\nNine women and two men have appeared in court, saying R. Kelly sexually abused them.\nThe defence lawyer said R. Kelly was living a \"playboy life\" because his record label painted him as a sex symbol. \"Where's the crime in that?\" said Mr Cannick, dismissing alleged victims as groupies. \n\"You heard about a man who treated these women like gold,\" Mr Cannick added. \"He bought them bags more expensive than cars.\"\nHe invoked King's \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\" speech: \"Somewhere I read of the freedom of assembly. Somewhere I read of the freedom of speech. Somewhere I read of the freedom of the press.\" \nKing upheld the Constitution to try to make the government \"be true to what's on paper\", he said, adding: \"That's all Robert is trying to do.\"\nOn Wednesday, R. Kelly declined to testify in his own defence. \nCourt reporters said he was shaking his head during the prosecution's final arguments.\nThe jury is expected to retire to consider its verdict later on Thursday.\nIf convicted, R. Kelly faces up to 15 years in prison."

      "tags": "David Lammy,Oil,BP,Fuel,Brexit,Grant Shapps,Haulage",
      "text": "People should carry on buying petrol as normal, despite supply problems that have closed some stations, the government has said.\nA \"handful\" of BP stations, and a small number of Esso-owned Tesco Alliance stations, were closed on Thursday because of a lack of delivery drivers.\nBut Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said refineries had \"plenty of petrol\".\nHe told the BBC that the government could bring in the army to drive fuel tankers if it would help.\nIt is estimated that the UK is short of about 100,000 HGV drivers - with gaps made worse by the pandemic and Brexit.\nOther industries such as food processing have been impacted. Britain's biggest baker Warburtons has confirmed that the company is facing challenges recruiting lorry drivers and that the shortage is causing some disruption to its supply chain. \nThe baker delivers to around 18,500 stores and says it can't deliver to a number of them. \n\"The national driver shortage continues to place a strain on the Warburtons distribution network but we are working incredibly hard to maintain a good level of service for our customers nationwide.\"\nReports in several newspapers have suggested that the government is considering getting soldiers to drive fuel tankers under emergency plans.\nWhen questioned about this on BBC Breakfast, Mr Shapps said: \"If it can actually help, we will bring them in.\"\nHowever, he said there would be \"technicalities\" as to whether military personnel could switch to driving civilian vehicles.\nThe AA said that most of the UK's forecourts were working as they should.\n\"There is no shortage of fuel and thousands of forecourts are operating normally with just a few suffering temporary supply chain problems,\" said AA president Edmund King.\n\"Fridays and the weekend always tend to be busier on forecourts, as drivers either combine filling up with shopping runs, prepare for weekend trips or refuel for the start of the new working week.\"\nMr King said drivers should not fill up outside their normal routines, because even if the occasional petrol station was temporarily closed, others just down the road would be open.\n\"It is now clear that there have been occasional delays over recent weeks that have been managed with hardly anyone noticing. This was a manageable problem.\"\nThere are about 8,380 petrol stations in the UK, according to the Petrol Retailers Association. Of these, about 1% are believed to be closed at the moment.\nIt is understood that about 50 to 100 BP forecourts are affected by shortages, while Esso said \"a small number\" of its Tesco Alliance retail sites had been hit.\nHelena Wright, transport manager for Norfolk-based firm W's Transport, told the BBC her company had sold two lorries after advertising for HGV drivers and not getting a single applicant.\n\"Normally we would have people on record to call who had left their details,\" she said. \"This is the first time for our firm that that's happened, but it's a problem that has been a long time coming.\n\"I've got a lot of drivers that are over the age of 50, 55 and looking to retire and we are not attractive as an industry for the younger generation.\"\nShe said younger people were not prepared to spend four to five nights a week away from home and were not ready to put up with \"inhumane\" conditions.\nThe Road Haulage Association (RHA) has urged the government to relax visa restrictions for foreign workers in the short term to ease the driver shortage.\nBut Mr Shapps told the BBC he did not want UK lorry drivers to \"drop out\" because of being \"undercut\" by cheaper EU labour.\nHe said there were \"systemic problems\" in the haulage industry that needed to be resolved, pointing out that the profession was \"99% white male\" with an average age of 55, facing poor conditions and wages.\nNow, he said, pay was rising and there was \"a gradual increase\" in new drivers.\nWhile the UK does not lack petrol and diesel at refineries, getting it to forecourts has been difficult in some areas.\nIt is the latest problem caused by driver shortages, which have already led to supply squeezes in other industries, including supermarkets.\nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: \"The supply issues affecting a small number of petrol forecourts shouldn't impact the prices drivers pay to fill up. \n\"But unfortunately the price of oil, which has the biggest influence on what drivers pay at the pumps, is continuing to rise at the moment. \n\"This may lead to fuel prices going up in the coming days, which would be yet more bad news for drivers, as a litre of unleaded is already over 21p a litre more expensive than a year ago.\"\nThe RHA's Rod McKenzie told BBC Breakfast more lorry drivers were leaving the profession each week than joining it.\nHe said: \"It's as simple as this: everything we get in Britain comes on the back of a truck. \n\"So if there is a shortage of HGV drivers - and there is by 100,000 - then it is inevitable that we are not going to get all the things we want when we want them.\"\n\"It is not a case of running out - and people should not panic buy,\" he added.\nHe warned there would be glitches \"because the supply chain on which we all depend is creaking\".\nSupermarket Iceland - which is about 100 drivers short - joined Morrisons and Ocado in calling for the government to add HGV drivers to the list of shortage occupations.\nThat would allow foreign workers to apply for skilled worker visas to fill the current gaps.\n\"I think the solution - even if it's temporary - is very, very simple,\" said Iceland managing director Richard Walker. \"Let's get HGV drivers on to the skilled worker list.\"\nThe RHA's Mr McKenzie said that on top of a historic shortage of drivers, the industry had lost 20,000 European drivers because of Brexit, while the pandemic had forced 40,000 driver training tests to be cancelled.\nIn a recent RHA survey of 616 hauliers, retiring colleagues and Brexit topped the list of reasons behind the driver shortages.\nRespondents also cited tax changes to rules known as IR35, which have made it more expensive for hauliers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK.\nBusinesses across the food, fuel and construction sectors have been warning about driver shortages for months.\nBP temporarily closed a number of petrol stations earlier in summer, when driver shortages also caused short-term supply problems for McDonald's, Nandos, and the pub chain Wetherspoons.\nSpeaking on BBC Question Time on Thursday, Mr Shapps suggested visa changes would not solve the problem, but said nothing had been ruled out.\nBut shadow justice secretary David Lammy said visas were needed in various sectors, telling Mr Shapps: \"You promised that immigration would come down and you know that it will need to go up if we are to deal with these problems.\"\nConservative MP Andrew Bridgen said there was \"an endemic problem with retention and recruitment\" in the industry.\n\"We're actually not short of HGV drivers per se - we've got 600,000 people who are qualified to drive those big trucks, but only 300,000 people chose to work in the industry,\" he told the BBC. \nMr Bridgen suggested the industry needed to modernise and improve working conditions to retain young drivers.\nIn recent weeks, the Department for Transport has made it quicker for HGV drivers to get their licences, but the RHA criticised the changes as a risk to road safety."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps insists the pandemic is the \"principal cause\" of the UK's lorry driver shortage, which has left some petrol stations closed as pumps have run dry. He's been facing calls from supermarkets and the Road Haulage Association to relax visa restrictions for foreign workers to ease the driver shortage. The industry body says 40,000 driver training tests were cancelled during the pandemic, while another 20,000 European drivers left the UK because of Brexit. And a survey of hauliers by the association only listed Covid as the sixth biggest factor for the problem. The number of older drivers choosing to retire was identified as the biggest issue,\nThe cancer treatment backlog in England caused by the pandemic could take more than a decade to clear, with 19,500 people having gone undiagnosed because of missed referrals, estimates the Institute for Public Policy Research. The think tank says if hospitals could complete 15% more treatments over pre-pandemic levels, backlogs could be cleared by next year, but it says this would require more cash for new equipment and more staff.\nThe UK's policy of not recognising Covid-19 vaccine certificates from Africa could increase vaccine hesitancy, the head of Africa's health agency is warning. Dr John Nkegasong says the UK's stance of sending vaccines to Africa but not recognising their administration is confusing. The British High Commission in Kenya says it's working with the government there on a system to recognise each other's vaccine certificates.\nStudents attending universities in Wales during freshers' week are being urged to get a Covid-19 jab, with pop-up vaccination centres available on campuses across the country. We hear how students are planning to stay safe, while making the most of uni life.\nHeartwarming stories continue to emerge from the difficult days of lockdown. Stu Prince was recovering from chemotherapy when the pandemic took hold. And it gave him time for a new mission - reuniting old postcards he'd found at online auctions with their owners.

They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation.

      "text": "The government has said it has to \"prepare for the worst\" as the UK's energy firms continue to come under pressure from soaring gas prices.\nSmall business minister Paul Scully told the BBC his department was working closely with regulator Ofgem to protect customers if more firms went bust.\nNearly 1.5 million customers have been hit in just two weeks by energy firms collapsing under soaring gas prices.\nAmong them are Avro Energy and Green, which ceased trading on Wednesday.\nTheir 830,000 combined customers face being switched to a new, potentially more expensive, provider.\nAll affected customers will still receive energy while a new supplier is appointed by Ofgem.\nSmaller providers launched in recent years have been overwhelmed by a global spike in wholesale gas prices, as economies have reopened from lockdowns and high demand from Asia has pushed down supplies to Europe.\nMr Scully said he would not speculate about what might happen to gas prices next.\nBut when asked what the government would do if prices did not come down again, he said: \"We have to prepare for the worst... We need to plan for that situation.\"\nHe added: \"We will work with each company and look at their particular circumstances to make sure we can get through this difficult time.\"\nDespite Mr Scully's comments, the government has cooled on the idea of loans to the industry, says BBC business editor Simon Jack.\nHe says that while the government had been talking of state-backed loans for larger energy firms, that idea is now \"very much on the back burner\" and its intention is to \"tough this one out\".\nThe BBC has been told that ministers believe the current system for managing the failure of energy companies, which allows companies to recoup losses through an industry-wide levy, is working satisfactorily, even though it will add costs to millions of customers' bills.\nOur business editor says ministers do accept that the existing system of reallocating customers would not work if one of the bigger challenger firms went bust. \nIn that case, the government has the power to appoint a special administrator, in what would be a quasi-temporary nationalisation.\nThe plight of Avro customers is a good illustration of what may befall hundreds of thousands of people in the coming weeks.\nAn Avro customer in a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity, who got a fixed rate deal in August, would have been paying \u00a31,087 a year, according to price comparison site Uswitch. In March, they could have got a deal costing \u00a3920 a year.\nNow Avro has collapsed, they are likely to be paying \u00a31,277 a year at their new supplier from 1 October, in line with Ofgem's price cap.\nThe price cap does not mean it is impossible to pay more than \u00a31,277 a year. It is a cap on the price, not the final bill.\nThat figure is an illustration of the cap's effect on a gas and electricity customer's annual bill, assuming they have an average level of energy consumption. So, a household with heavy energy use will have a higher annual bill.\nThe boss of failed firm Green, Peter McGirr, told the BBC he had done nothing wrong and said bigger firms would soon face problems and \"come cap in hand for a bailout.\"\nBut his firm faced criticism from one angry customer, 52-year-old Sara Pilgrim of North Lincolnshire, who switched to Green just a week ago.\n\"Green weren't the lowest, but I decided to go with them.\n\"How can they have been allowed to take on new contracts that close to them going bust? They must have known something was going on six days ago,\" she told the BBC.\nPrice comparison site Uswitch has acknowledged there is currently no point in energy customers shopping around.\nJustina Miltienyte, the site's energy policy expert, said: \"If you are coming to the end of your fixed deal, our advice is to hold tight, stay put and be rolled over on to your supplier's standard variable rate.\"\nOfgem's price cap protects customers on some tariffs by limiting how much firms can charge per unit of gas.\nBut providers have complained that this means they are unable to pass on their rising costs to customers.\nIn the past two weeks, the number of firms which have collapsed account for more than 5% of the UK energy market.\nOther small companies could fold in the coming days and weeks.\nIgloo, for example, has said it is working with restructuring consultants Alvarez & Marsal, although it told the BBC it had not appointed administrators. \nBulb, the UK's sixth largest energy company with 1.7 million customers, is also seeking additional financing.\nDorset-based Utility Point, which had already ceased trading, said it had now gone into administration. Its 220,000 customers have been transferred to EDF. \nRead more about the next best steps to take here.\nGas prices are rising all across Europe, but Britain has also been affected by lower winds than usual - denting renewable energy supplies - as well as a recent fire at a National Grid site in Kent.\nIn the UK, firms had already been hit by a jump in costs even before the recent spike. From more than 70 suppliers in 2018, there are just over 30 now.\nIndustry sources fear there may be as few as 10 suppliers left by the end of the year.\nHas your energy firm collapsed?

      "title": "Gas crisis leaves Europe searching for solutions",
      "tags": "Spain,Norway,Italy,European Union,Natural gas,Electricity,Poland",
      "text": "A surge in gas prices has hit consumers and energy firms in the UK, with knock-on effects for the food industry and supplies of carbon dioxide.\nElsewhere in Europe, consumers are also facing a steep rise in energy bills, and governments are scrambling to help. The crisis has highlighted the difficulty for Europeans in funding the move to renewable energy. Here, five correspondents explain how different countries are responding.\nConsumers' bills have spiralled here in recent months, with the cost of electricity increasing 35% over the last year and nearly 8% in August alone.\nEnergy prices in Spain are closely tied to the wholesale gas market, so the price per megawatt hour for consumers has repeatedly hit new highs recently. \n\"I was paying about \u20ac40 (\u00a334) per month and now I'm paying around \u20ac60,\" said Amparo Vega, who has a newspaper kiosk in central Madrid.    \nEarlier this month, the coalition government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez unveiled a series of measures aimed at bringing bills back down. \nThey include tax cuts and a temporary reduction in extraordinary profits made by energy companies. The latter move has drawn criticism from the industry, although the government has clarified that renewable energy providers will be exempt.  \nThe government says its aim is to reduce electricity bills by over 20% by the end of the year. As winter approaches, consumers such as Ms Vega hope that happens.\n\"The outlook isn't very rosy,\" says Michele Fiorita, taking some air outside his shop in central Rome.\n\"My energy bills have gone up by about 15% but I've heard they'll rise by around 40% in the next few months.\"\nItaly is particularly exposed to gas price hikes: 40% of its energy comes from natural gas and around half of that is imported from Russia. \nSo lower Russian gas exports to Europe and an increase in the price of raw materials have hit hard. \nThe Italian government has already spent some \u20ac1.2bn to cut the increase in energy prices for households and this week pledged another \u20ac3bn to help further in the coming months. \nPrime Minister Mario Draghi says for the next three months \"system costs\" will be eliminated from gas and electricity bills. They're the tariffs added to bills to help fund the transition to renewable energy.\nIt's a short-term sticking plaster to help reduce the jump in energy prices for struggling households but removes an important financial incentive to help the switch to renewables. \nFundamentally, Italy will need to diversify its energy sources, moving away from its dependence on gas and more towards green energy. \"That's surely the future,\" says Michele, \"it's the only way to reduce costs in the long-term.\"\nAs soaring energy costs present huge personal difficulties for families, they also pose some tricky politics for Brussels. \nEU leaders have been busy pushing their sweeping climate plan to cut carbon emissions by 55% by 2030 - a drive known as \"Fit for 55\".\nIt's wide-ranging but includes proposals that, critics say, could lead to huge further price hikes.  \nEven backers of the measures quietly admit the transition to a greener economy inevitably, one way or another, hits people in the pocket. On the current crisis, the European Commission says that price rises are a combination of several factors, particularly the global surge in demand. \nIncreases in the price of CO2 permits under the EU's carbon pricing scheme are blamed for some of the rises, but the Commission says it's only a \"small percentage\". It wants to expand that scheme under \"Fit for 55\". \nBut with calls from the Spanish government for the energy crisis to be on the table at the next EU leaders' summit, Brussels is facing questions over what it can or will do to help. \nGuidance is being worked on in terms of the mitigation measures member states can individually take within EU rules. But there's no sign of any significant, centralised intervention. \nThe more the crisis heats up, the greater the backlash may be over the EU's climate plans. However, those in favour would argue that the faster the move to a green economy, the faster member states can escape this kind of volatility.  \nSurging European gas prices have been felt by Polish consumers because the country's energy regulator has approved three price hikes this year, raising bills by more than 20%.\nBut household gas bills are still regulated here, so customers are insulated from any sharp changes in market prices. Also, about half of Poland's gas demand is met by domestic production, which is typically cheaper than imported gas. \nThat cheaper, domestic gas is used to cover the needs of households first, while industry is mostly supplied with more expensive imports. But here again, energy-intensive Polish companies are shielded from sky-rocketing market prices because they have long-term supply contracts with a fixed price. \nIn Poland, coal is still the main fuel driving the economy, with gas a long way behind. That is starting to change. \nThe solar power market is one of the fastest growing in Europe and state-controlled power companies are planning huge investments in offshore wind. \nGas will become more important then, because the government sees natural gas as a bridging fuel to replace ageing coal plants and ensure the lights remain on when the wind drops under cloudy skies. \nIn Poland, the origin of the gas is a political issue. The government plans to cease its decades-old dependence on Russian gas next year and replace it with US and Norwegian gas, arguing it will no longer suffer Gazprom overcharging it for gas, because it can abuse its position as a monopoly supplier.\nPOLAND'S COAL: The vast European mine infuriating the neighbours\nNon-EU Norway is one of the biggest producers of oil and natural gas in Europe, though very little of it is used for its own needs.\nOnly 1.4% of electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels and waste, 5.8% by wind power and the remaining 92.9% is produced by hydroelectric power. \nNorway's Equinor energy company has agreed to allow a 2bn-cubic-metre increase in gas exports for the next year to support increased European and UK demand. Formerly known as Statoil, Equinor is two-thirds owned by the state. \nWhile bills are not as high as elsewhere in Europe, Norwegians are not immune from increasing energy prices.\n\"We currently pay 750 NOK (\u00a363) a month for energy and warm water, but in Oslo prices are relatively low,\" says Magnus, 26, who lives in a studio apartment in the capital with his girlfriend.\nThe couple are moving to a bigger flat in Bergen on the west coast and expect their bills to go up: \"When you live somewhere where fewer people are, then electricity is more expensive. That's why I'm thinking of just getting solar panels.\"\nFrom 1 October, Norway will be able to export electricity to the UK via a \"North Sea link\" of underwater high-voltage electric cables connecting the two power grids.\nThere have been concerns the recent UK price surge could spread to Norwegian households and industries. But one proposal to impose a tax on outgoing energy has been rejected, as Norway also needs to import energy in certain periods of the year."

      "text": "Compensation payments for hundreds of civilian deaths linked to the British armed forces have been revealed for the first time.\nThe Ministry of Defence paid out \u00a3688,000 for 289 civilian deaths between 2006-14, an average of \u00a32,380.\nBut in one case, a family was paid just \u00a3104.17, less than others received for the deaths of a herd of donkeys.\nThe MoD said compensation was set by legal principles, including past and future losses and local customs.\nAlmost 7,000 compensation claims paid out by the British military during combat operations in Helmand, in Afghanistan, up until 2014 were analysed by the charity Action on Armed Violence (AOAV).\nThe youngest casualty was a three-year-old boy who, according to records, was \"killed by shock\" during a British mine clearance operation. At least 16 children were among the 289 civilian deaths. \nUsing data obtained under Freedom of Information requests, this is the first attempt to scrutinise the impact of British military forces on civilian lives in Afghanistan in this way.\nMurray Jones from AOAV said: \"The fact that a charity has had to scrutinise this data, rather than the British military themselves, is hugely concerning.\"\nCompensation payments for civilians killed varied widely. In February 2008 a family received just \u00a3104.17 for a confirmed fatality and property damage. \nThere is no more detail given, but it is the lowest recorded sum for a civilian death.\nIn contrast, British forces paid out \u00a3110 for a lost mobile phone in Camp Bastion, \u00a3662 for the death of six donkeys after they \"wandered on to a rifle range \", and \u00a3240 for damage caused to a property by an armoured vehicle.\nOther payments linked to civilian deaths include \u00a3586.42 for the death of a 10-year-old boy in December 2009. \nBritish forces also paid out \u00a34,233.60 for four children \"shot and killed by ISAF (International Security Assistance Force)\" in the same month. There is no record of this incident in the English language media.\n\"So few of these deaths were reported on at the time that these casualties could easily be forgotten,\" said Mr Jones.\nOne payment for an incident which did receive media attention was significantly higher. Five Afghan children injured by stray bullets fired from a British army Apache helicopter received \u00a37,204.97. \nOverall, \u00a3397,000 was paid out by the British for 240 injuries - an average of \u00a31,654.\nThe largest single payment awarded was \u00a354,347 for a single fatality in Kabul in 2007. No more details of the incident are recorded.\nThe records show that the majority of claims for compensation were rejected. In total 885 claims of death and 285 claims of injury were denied by the MoD.  \nAOAV said: \"It's likely that the deaths recorded are an underestimation of deaths caused by British forces.\"\nThe US military also paid out more than 1,600 \"condolence payments\" between October 2006 and September 2014 for deaths, injuries and property damage.\nThe payments cost the US nearly $4.9m, according to a report by the Center for Civilians in Conflict.\nThe MoD said the amount of compensation paid is \"determined by legal principles which consider the degree of injury and both past and future losses; settlements also reflect local customs and practice\".\n\"Every civilian death is a tragedy and the UK always seeks to minimise the risk of civilian casualties through our rigorous targeting process, but that risk can never be removed entirely,\" an MoD spokesperson said."

      "text": "Thirty nine people have been arrested after climate activists blocked Dover port, causing queues of vehicles attempting to cross the Channel.\nInsulate Britain, which has brought chaos on the M25 five times in the past fortnight, said more than 40 people had gathered.\nThe Kent port - Europe's busiest ferry terminal -  said passengers should take extra time for their journeys.\nThe main protest began at 08:20 BST and was cleared by police two hours later.\nOne lane of the A20 remained blocked afterwards, as two protesters were sitting on top of a tanker with their hands glued to the vehicle.\nWhile she was on the tanker with her hand stuck to the railing, one protester who gave her first name as Stephanie said she did not want to be there.\nShe said: \"I want to be home with my family spending time with them but if we don't do this they aren't going to have a future.\n\"The government are not doing enough. On the current trajectory we are heading for chaos.\"\nBoth Stephanie, 27, and her fellow protester Josh, 28, were later lifted down by police. \nKent Police said the protest caused \"traffic disruption in Dover\", with queues forming on the A20 and the A2 approaching the port.\nAll those detained on Friday were arrested on suspicion of causing a public nuisance and obstructing a highway, the force said.\nPolice said all those arrested remained in custody on Friday afternoon, when roads were again clear.\nDover TAP, short for Traffic Assessment Project, was implemented by National Highways, due to the congestion.\nIt enforces a 40mph speed restriction on the A20 approaching Dover, and lorry drivers heading for the port must remain in the left lane.\nThe Port of Dover said at 11:21 BST that traffic had resumed and was flowing in and out of the site.\nThe protest followed a court ruling won by the government which means climate change protesters can be jailed if they continue their campaign of blocking the M25.\nHundreds of campaigners previously forced the closure of the motorway in parts of Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent and Surrey.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government would take further action.\nHe wrote on Twitter: \"We won't tolerate reckless behaviour on motorways or ports (Dover this morning). I'm therefore seeking a further injunction to prevent this disruption.\"\nLater, the government confirmed a further injunction had been approved by the High Court to prevent protesters from occupying the A20 and strategic roads linked to the Port of Dover.\nMr Shapps said: \"We are absolutely committed to protecting the right to peaceful protest, but it is unacceptable that people cannot go about their day-to-day businesses and that businesses, or critical supplies should be put on a knife's edge because of the reckless actions of a few protesters.\"\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said: \"The British public are rightly furious that the behaviours of a selfish minority have been putting lives at risk and causing untold disruption on our roads and now at Dover.\"\nSeveral drivers remonstrated with activists in Dover.\nInsulate Britain also held a demonstration outside the Home Office's Westminster headquarters.\nCh Supt Simon Thompson, from Kent Police, thanked people affected for their patience, and said: \"The impact this disruption had on the local community and port-bound traffic is not lost on us.\"\nDover MP Natalie Elphicke called the protesters \"hooligans\".\nWriting on Twitter, she added: \"The port is the vital artery of our nation's trade - about one-fifth of all trade comes through Dover. We simply cannot afford further disruption to food and goods at this time.\"\nInsulate Britain, which is calling for government action on home insulation, said: \"We are blocking Dover this morning to highlight that fuel poverty is killing people in Dover and across the UK.\n\"We need a Churchillian response: We must tell the truth about the urgent horror of the climate emergency.\"\nThe Port of Dover handles 17% of the UK's trade in goods. It was used by an average of 6,200 road haulage vehicles every day last year.\nDoug Bannister, chief executive of the port, said it \"implemented its tried and tested resilience plans in order to deal with the impact of the protest\".\nHe apologised to travellers for the \"disruption\" but said the situation was \"not of our making\". \nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Lambeth,South Shields,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Covid debate has recently centred on whether teenagers should have the vaccine and when the most vulnerable will receive booster jabs. But a third group is of real concern among scientists and politicians - the five million or so adults yet to have a first dose.\n\"Amelia\", 34, has had about four months to get a coronavirus vaccine but so far has quietly refused. She does not want her identity revealed, because she is worried she will receive abuse.\n\"I do feel guilty,\" Amelia says. \"I never mention it to anyone, because I think they'll judge me or think I'm an anti-vaxxer. It does feel like I'm hiding from everyone.\n\"I am healthy and young and I don't like putting things in my body,\" she says, recalling refusing a flu jab when pregnant. \"I was fine, so I guess I think it'll be the same with coronavirus.\n\"I know I should get a vaccine. I thought I had built up the courage to do it on a few occasions. But then I saw something on social media which scared me and I couldn't - I'm petrified.\"\nThe UK has administered more than 48 million first doses so far.\nBut attention is increasingly falling on those who haven't had it. Speculation has centred on which dancers on Strictly Come Dancing have so far not taken up the offer, as well as how many Premier League footballers are potentially unvaccinated.\nExactly how many are yet to receive a Covid jab is unknown, but it's estimated it is more than five million people aged 16 and over in the UK.\nMultiple studies show coronavirus vaccines are highly effective at preventing serious illness and side-effects are rare. Immunologists say even if you have been infected naturally, vaccination will boost your immunity further.\nThe reasons for not having the jab vary.\nA \"very small number\" of people are unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons, according to the government, while behavioural psychologists say \"committed vaccine opponents\" who believe in conspiracy theories are unlikely to change their minds.\nBut it's argued the unvaccinated who have safety concerns, or distrust institutions, those who are sceptical or indifferent, such as Amelia, could still be reached with the right support and access. \nSo how do you convince someone to have the vaccine? \nIdentifying a person's \"trigger\" motivation is seen as a highly effective way of tackling vaccine scepticism or indifference. \n\"This can be a wide range of things,\" says cognitive psychologist Stephan Lewandowsky, from Bristol University. \nResearch suggests reminding people of the common good - protecting a grandparent or parent - helps them realise \"they have a social responsibility - and they may be more willing\".\n\"Some can't be bothered - but if it's around the corner and you give them a free hotdog, like in Germany, then that can be really successful.\"\nAmelia says her trigger would be not being able to go on holiday without having had a vaccine. \nAnd in some areas of the UK, schemes have been running to find people like Amelia and work out what their trigger points may be.\nIn South Tyneside, teams spent the summer going door to door and stopping people in the street to try to maximise vaccine take-up and reduce high coronavirus rates.\nThey quickly noticed those failing to come forward were mostly young men from poorer areas.\nIn one of the most deprived wards, Simonside and Rekendyke, only 48% of men aged 18-29 and 39% of men aged 16-17 have had a first dose. \nBut in the least deprived, Cleadon and East Boldon, the proportions are 83% and 79%.\n\"The lesson is clear - there is a clear, direct relationship between the level of deprivation and vaccine uptake, among young men at least,\" Matt Brown, from the South Tyneside Clinical Commissioning Group, says.\n\"The gap between young women is far less dramatic. These young men don't understand Covid-19 can cause them serious harm and are also perhaps in jobs where you can't take an hour off work to get a vaccine.\"\nTo reach this group, pop-up vaccine sites have been set up in places such as pubs and outside Newcastle United's football stadium, St James' Park.\nThe team also tries to have people on hand who can speak foreign languages, including Urdu and Polish, as well as clinicians who can deal with medical questions. \n\"Our focus is to help young people understand the risks,\" Matt says.\nA team in south London is also trying to locate the elusive vaccine hesitant. \nLambeth is a young and diverse borough and data for England shows vaccine take-up is lower among younger age groups and those belonging to certain ethnic minorities.\nHowever, staff on the ground prefer to take a more universal approach.\n\"This is not about just one ethnicity,\" Lambeth Clinical Commission Group community pharmacist Ash Soni says. \"This is not about just one age - this is about reaching our entire population.\"\nOne of the borough's pop-up vaccine services is a blue bus with the word \"welcome\" dotted on it in different languages.\nNicknamed the \"worry bus\", it parks outside mosques, Tube stations and supermarkets. Trained staff speak to passers-by who have not yet been vaccinated and ask them why, without judgement or pressure.\n\"We've heard so many reasons,\" Mr Soni says. \"Some people fear the vaccine is too new, so we talk about how it has been created and rigorously tested. \n\"We hear from people who fear the vaccine puts a microchip in them and we explain that is false - where would we even fit it?\"\nThis \"cycle of change\", or finding a person's trigger, can take time, patience and multiple conversations - but experts say most do eventually come round.\nEarlier this month, the prime minister and his advisers announced their winter plan, emphasising the importance of reaching those who had so far not taken up the offer of a jab.\nPushing vaccination levels up was the key to maintaining lighter controls, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said. \"Trying to persuade those people it is the right thing to do to get vaccinated would make a significant difference.\"\nFor Amelia, \"the cons outweigh the pros\" - at least for now.\n\"If they said I couldn't go on holiday to Disneyland with my kids without a vaccine then that would sway it for me,\" she says. \"One morning I think I will wake up and decide to do it. I'm just not there yet.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Money,Ofgem,Personal finance,UK economy",
      "text": "Hundreds of thousands of people are facing uncertainty over their household energy bills after the collapse of suppliers in recent days.\nCustomers are awaiting announcements by the regulator, Ofgem, about which surviving company will take on their supply and which tariff they must pay.\nMany will face the prospect of an annual bill hundreds of pounds higher than they had expected.\nAvro Energy and Green ceased trading on Wednesday, with others likely to fold. \nThose two firms were the latest to collapse, following a string of other failures of small providers in recent weeks.\nAvro and Green had 830,000 customers between them who are now waiting to be automatically switched to a new, potentially more expensive, provider.\nThey include Daniel Cooke, from Taunton, who said: \"I am deeply concerned as a young family of five how we are going to cope with what could be a huge rise in cost when we are allocated a new energy supplier.\n\"Where we have boxed clever for the last few years with Avro energy we are now going to be punished over the next few months running into winter.\n\"I know there are millions of people trying to balance the books. If the bills go up we'll have to find extra money.\"\nUnder Ofgem rules, any customer of a collapsed firm is moved automatically to a new supplier which it appoints. The new provider is required to honour any credit a customer has built up in their energy account. It pays for that through an industry-wide levy, which itself is likely to add to every customer's bill. \nThe new provider must also pay any credit that is owed to a customer who recently switched away, but has not yet been refunded their overpayments.\nThat process can take a few weeks, and customers are advised to wait until they are contacted by their new supplier before doing anything.\nWhile continuation of their supply is guaranteed, their tariff - in other words, the price they pay - is not. Customers of collapsed firms will be placed on a new dedicated tariff by their new supplier for those in the same position. It is likely to be priced in line with Ofgem's price cap.\nAn Avro customer in a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity, who got a fixed rate deal in August, would have been paying \u00a31,087 a year, according to price comparison site Uswitch. In March, they could have got a deal costing \u00a3920 a year.\nNow Avro has collapsed, they are likely to be paying \u00a31,277 a year at their new supplier from 1 October, in line with Ofgem's price cap.\nThe price cap does not mean it is impossible to pay more than \u00a31,277 a year. It is a cap on the price, not the final bill. So, a household with heavy energy use will have a higher annual bill.\nOnce switched to the new supplier, they are free to move to a different supplier. However, it is basically impossible to find a better deal at the moment as suppliers grapple with the rapidly increasing cost of wholesale gas.\nThe same problem faces customers of surviving energy firms who are coming to the end of their fixed rate term. When that expires, they are automatically shifted on the supplier's more expensive standard rate, which will be at the price cap level. They, too, will be unable to find a better deal at present.\nThere could also be complications for pre-payment meter customers who are automatically switched.\nPeter Smith, from National Energy Action, which lobbies for action for warm and dry homes, said: \"We are very concerned about legacy pre-payment customers, people in debt and those eligible for energy discounts who may miss out when they transfer over to their new suppliers. \n\"The government and Ofgem's key urgent priority must be to ensure vulnerable households are protected when their supplier fails.\"\nRead more about the next best steps to take here."

More than 200 homes have been destroyed and about 6,000 people evacuated. \nThe lava from the Cumbre Vieja volcano is still advancing and scientists are not sure how long the eruption will last. \nThe image by photographer Alfonso Escalero shows the house surrounded by rivers of lava from the Cumbre Vieja volcano. \nIt is owned by a retired Danish couple, Inge and Ranier Cocq, who have not visited since the pandemic began, according to El Mundo. \nAda Monnikendam, who built the house with her husband, said she had spoken with the couple who told her: \"Even though we can't go now, we're relieved that it's still standing\". \nAccording to Ms Monnikendam, the couple have friends in the area who have lost everything due to the volcano. \nThe lava has engulfed houses, schools and some banana plantations. \n\"They don't want to talk to anyone because they won't stop crying,\" Ms Monnikendam said. \nReflecting on the image, Ms Monnikendam said that it was \"sad to know that the house is there alone without anyone being able to take care of it\". \nLocal officials say the lava could trigger a chemical reaction that causes explosions and the release of toxic gases if it reaches the sea. \nHowever on Thursday, experts said the lava was currently moving \"very slowly\". It is now not clear if the flow will reach the sea.\nThe Canary Islands government has announced plans to buy two housing developments for those made homeless. \nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has flown directly from La Palma to New York for a shortened trip to address the UN General Assembly, and will immediately return to the Canary Islands to oversee emergency operations.

      "text": "Humans reached the Americas at least 7,000 years earlier than previously thought, according to new findings.\nThe topic of when the continent was first settled from Asia has been controversial for decades.\nMany researchers are sceptical of evidence for humans in the North American interior much earlier than 16,000 years ago.\nNow, a team working in New Mexico has found scores of human footprints dated to between 23,000 and 21,000 years old.\nThe discovery could transform views about when the continent was settled. It suggests there could have been great migrations that we know nothing about. And it raises the possibility that these earlier populations could have gone extinct.\nThe footprints were formed in soft mud on the margins of a shallow lake which now forms part of Alkali Flat in White Sands. The research has been published in the journal Science.\nA team from the US Geological Survey carried out radiocarbon dating on seeds found in sediment layers above and below where the footprints were found. This gave the researchers remarkably precise dates for the impressions themselves.\nBased on their sizes, scientists think the tracks were made mainly by teenagers and younger children travelling back and forth - along with the occasional adult.\nThey offer a fascinating window into what life was like for these early occupants of what is now the South West US.\nThe scientists don't know for sure what the teenagers were doing, but it is possible they were helping the adults with a type of hunting custom seen in later Native American cultures. This was known as the buffalo jump and involved driving animals over a shallow cliff edge.\nThe animals \"all had to be processed in a short period of time,\" explained Dr Sally Reynolds, co-author from Bournemouth University. \"You'd have to start fires, you'd have to start rendering the fat.\" The teenagers could have been helping out by collecting firewood, water or other essentials.\nThe age of the discovery is key, because there have been countless claims of early human settlement in the Americas. But virtually all are disputed in some way.\nIt often comes down to a debate over whether stone tools found at an ancient site are in fact what they appear to be, or are simply rocks broken through some natural process - such as falling from a cliff.\nThe proposed artefacts at early locales are sometimes less clear-cut than the exquisitely crafted spear-points found in North America from 13,000 years ago onwards. This leaves the door open for doubt about their identity.\n\"One of the reasons there is so much debate is that there is a real lack of very firm, unequivocal data points. That's what we think we probably have,\" Prof Matthew Bennett, first author on the paper from Bournemouth University, told BBC News.\n\"Footprints aren't like stone tools. A footprint is a footprint, and it can't move up and down [in the soil layers].\"\nWhile the nature of the physical evidence here is harder to dismiss, the researchers had to ensure the dating evidence was - quite literally - watertight.\nA potential complication flagged up by the journal during the early stages of review was the \"reservoir effect\". This refers to the way that old carbon can sometimes get recycled in aqueous environments, interfering with radiocarbon results by making a site seem older than it is.\nHowever, the team members say they have accounted for this effect and believe it is not significant here.\nProf Tom Higham, a radiocarbon dating expert at the University of Vienna, said: \"They've undertaken some checks on the dates of material from near to the footprint location and found that fully terrestrial samples (charcoal) produced ages similar to those of the aquatic species they dated from nearer to the footprints. \n\"They've also argued, I think justifiably, that the lake must have been shallow at the time people walked there, mitigating the effect of reservoir effects introduced by old carbon sources.\" The consistency of the results and the support from a different dating technique applied to the site both supported the validity of the results, he added.\n\"I think taken together this is a 21,000-23,000-year-old sequence,\" Prof Higham told BBC News.\nThe controversies in early American archaeology have much to do with the historical development of the field.\nDuring the second half of the 20th Century, a consensus emerged among North American archaeologists that people belonging to the Clovis culture had been the first to reach the Americas.\nThese big game hunters were thought to have crossed a land bridge across the Bering Straits that connected Siberia with Alaska during the last ice age, when sea levels were much lower.\nAs the \"Clovis First\" idea took hold, reports of more ancient settlement were dismissed as unreliable and some archaeologists actually stopped looking for signs of earlier occupation.\nBut in the 1970s, this orthodoxy was challenged.\nIn the 1980s, solid evidence turned up for a 14,500-year-old human presence at Monte Verde in Chile.\nAnd since the 2000s, other pre-Clovis sites have become widely accepted - such as the 15,500-year-old Buttermilk Creek Complex in central Texas and the 16,000-year-old Cooper's Ferry site in Idaho.\nNow, the footprint evidence from New Mexico suggests humans had made it to the North American interior by the height of the last Ice Age, when massive ice sheets covered much of what is today Canada. This would have blocked entry to humans crossing from Asia, perhaps suggesting that humans arrived even earlier when a path - or \"corridor\" - through the ice was open.\nGary Haynes, an emeritus professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, said: \"I cannot find fault with the work that was done or with the interpretations - the paper is important and provocative.\n\"The trackways are so far south of the Bering land connection that we now have to wonder (1) if the people or their ancestors (or other people) had made the crossing from Asia to the Americas much earlier, (2) if people moved quickly through the continents after each crossing, and (3) if they left any descendants.\"\nDr Andrea Manica, a geneticist from the University of Cambridge, said the finding had important implications for the population history of the Americas.\n\"I can't comment on how reliable the dating is (it is outside my expertise), but firm evidence of humans in North America 23,000 years ago is at odds with the genetics, which clearly shows a split of Native Americans from Asians approximately 15-16,000 years ago,\" he told BBC News.\n\"This would suggest that the initial colonists of the Americas were replaced when the ice corridor formed and another wave of colonists came in. We have no idea how that happened.\"\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "text": "It could take more than a decade to clear the cancer-treatment backlog in England, a report suggests.\nResearch by the Institute for Public Policy Research estimated 19,500 people who should have been diagnosed had not been, because of missed referrals.\nIf hospitals could achieve a 5% increase in the number of treatments over pre-pandemic levels, it would take until 2033 to clear the backlog.\nBut if 15% more could be completed, backlogs could be cleared by next year.\nIncreasing activity levels would require more cash for new equipment and more staff, however.\nAnd all this is dependent on those who have not come forward for checks seeking help.\nBetween March 2020 and February 2021, the number of referrals to see a specialist dropped by nearly 370,000 on the year before, a fall of 15%.\nBehind these figures are thousands of people for whom it will now be too late to cure their cancer, the report, with the CF health consultancy, warns. \nAnd it estimates the proportion of cancers diagnosed while they are still highly curable - classed as stage one and two - has fallen from 44% before to pandemic to 41%.\nIPPR research fellow Dr Parth Patel said: \"The pandemic has severely disrupted cancer services in England, undoing years of progress in improving cancer survival rates.\n\"Now, the health service faces an enormous backlog of care, that threatens to disrupt services for well over a decade.\n\"We know every delay poses risks to patients' chances of survival.\n\"Clearing the cancer care backlog before the next general election looks unlikely with the way the NHS is currently resourced, staffed and organised.\""

      "text": "The FBI has issued a federal arrest warrant for Gabby Petito's boyfriend for his \"use of unauthorized devices\" following her death.\nThe indictment says Brian Laundrie used a debit card and PIN number for accounts that did not belong to him between 30 August and 1 September.\nMs Petito's body was found on Sunday inside a park the couple had visited.\nMr Laundrie is currently missing. His family say he was last seen on 14 September.\nOfficials are searching for him at a Florida nature reserve. \nThe couple had been travelling for several weeks before 23-year-old Mr Laundrie returned home to Florida alone with their white van on 1 September. He did not contact police or the Petito family on his return.\nMs Petito's family reported her missing 10 days later. On Sunday, the body of the 22-year-old was found in the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. The coroner ruled her death a homicide but gave no indication as to how she died.\nThe indictment issued on Wednesday by the US District Court of Wyoming says Mr Laundrie obtained over $1,000 (\u00a3730) with the debit card transactions.\n\"While this arrest warrant allows law enforcement to arrest Mr Laundrie, the FBI and our partners across the country continue to investigate the facts and circumstances of Ms Petito's homicide,\" FBI Special Agent in Charge Michael Schneider said in a statement.\nMr Laundrie's lawyer, Steve Bertolino, told Fox News that it was his \"understanding that the arrest warrant [was] related to activities occurring after the death of Gabby Petito and not related to her actual demise\".\nMr Laundrie's family reported him missing over the weekend. They claim he left for a hike and never returned. He is considered a \"person of interest\" in the disappearance but had refused to speak with investigators before disappearing.\nThe search for Mr Laundrie has focused on a 24,000-acre nature reserve near his home in North Port, Florida. Police are using dogs, drones, and all-terrain vehicles for the search, which officers say is complicated by difficult, swampy terrain.\nEarlier this week, investigators also searched the Laundrie family home. Agents were seen removing several boxes from the house and towing away a silver Ford Mustang.\nIt is still unclear what happened when Ms Petito went missing. Two weeks earlier, on 12 August, police in the southern Utah town of Moab were called to a possible domestic violence incident involving the couple.\nPolice released bodycam footage which showed Ms Petito crying and complaining about her mental health to officers. She also said the couple had been arguing more frequently.\nThe officers recommended they spend the night apart but did not file any charges.\nMs Petito last video-called her mother on 24 August to say she was leaving Utah and heading to the Teton mountain range in Wyoming, according to Rick Stafford, the family's lawyer."

One was sentenced to 13 years and the other to 12 years. \nThe girl, 14, admitted manslaughter and was given three years and two months. \nNone of them can be identified for legal reasons.\nThe two boys were given life sentences, meaning they will serve minimum terms of 12 and 13 years respectively. \nJudge Heather Norton told the three teenagers: \"Whatever part each of you played - great or small - what you did that day was utterly cruel and totally pointless. \n\"You have taken one life, damaged your own futures and you have caused so much pain to so many people. \n\"The effects of what you did will stay with you and with Olly's family forever.\"\nThe judge said the sentences would seem \"unbearably short\" to Olly's family, but \"unbearably long\" for the defendants. \nOlly's killers believed he \"grassed\" on them to the brother of a boy they had mocked in a social media group chat, the trial heard. \nVoice notes and text messages were presented to the jury in which the boys talked about taking revenge. \n\"He's actually getting banged when I see him,\" one message said.\nAnother added: \"I actually hate the kid with a passion, like if I was to see him right now I'll probably end up killing him or something.\"\nThe girl was recruited to lure Olly to Bugs Bottom fields, near his home in Emmer Green, as part of a \"set-up\", the jury was told.\nShe suggested in messages exchanged before the killing that he deserved what was coming,  describing it as \"karma\", the court heard.\nOlly was filmed on a doorbell camera leaving his family home for the last time, looking at his phone as he walked to meet the girl.\nHe was stabbed twice when he arrived - one blade penetrated 17cm (6.5in) into his back, and another wound in his chest was 9cm (3.5in) deep, the jury heard.\nOlly's parents have described receiving a knock on the door to tell them Olly had been stabbed. \nThey both rushed to the fields where they found their fatally injured son receiving CPR. \n\"The thing that sticks in my mind is when I went up to the field and everybody turned round - the horror was just written all over their faces,\" said Stuart Stephens, Olly's father. \nMr Stephens said he believed \"social media has a lot to answer for\" and claimed \"it played a massive part in Olly's death\". \nHe also criticised the \"gangster mentality\" of the killers who he said must have felt like they \"were in a video game\". \nPaying tribute to Olly, he said: \"He had such a big heart - he was very generous, very loving, very caring.\"\nSpeaking on the steps of the court after sentencing, Mr Stephens said: \"We relaxed for a few moments, preoccupied with getting on with life, and took our eyes of him for just a moment. \n\"It cost us and him dearly.\"\nMr Stephens added that  he would like to see laws changed \"to protect our children to empower the investigative police and to help parents and support them to navigate the dangers of online victimisation\".\n\"If it was up to me no child under 16 would have a mobile phone,\" he said. \nBoth boys were also convicted of perverting the course of justice. \nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Scottish government,Energy industry,Michael Matheson,Electricity,SNP (Scottish National Party)",
      "text": "As many customers face uncertainty over their household energy bills, we take a look at why plans for a state-owned energy company in Scotland fell by the wayside. \nIn 2017 the Scottish government pledged to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit company to sell gas and electricity to customers at low prices by 2021. Why has this plan not come to fruition? \nWhen the plan was announced at the 2017 SNP conference in Glasgow, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said energy would be bought wholesale or generated in Scotland - and sold to customers \"as close to cost price as possible\".\nShe said the company would not pay shareholders or corporate bonuses and that its only job would be to secure the lowest price for consumers\nMs Sturgeon added that it would give people - particularly those on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use.\nAt the time, energy market firm Schneider Electric told the BBC that independent suppliers had reduced the dominance of the Big Six suppliers but they could not always beat them on price because of the way the wholesale market worked.\nThey said independent suppliers did well when the wholesale market fell because they were tracking the market more closely and their tariffs were more responsive - but the flip side was that when wholesale markets rose they did less well and had to increase prices.\nNow, nearly 1.5 million customers have been hit in just two weeks by energy firms collapsing under soaring gas prices.\nNot in so many words.\nIn their 2021 manifesto, the SNP said that work on the public energy company had been \"halted\" during the pandemic, and efforts were being \"refocused\" on a public energy agency.\nIt said the agency would \"coordinate and accelerate\" the delivery of heat and energy efficiency work as well as \"informing and educating\" the public on required changes.\nThere have been fresh calls to revive the plan by SNP activists, but when asked if the Scottish government had dropped it altogether, Energy Secretary Michael Matheson said the party \"had not anticipated\" as great a need for decarbonisation in 2017.\nHe told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"The reality is a public energy company will not resolve what are very serious systemic problems in the UK energy network and the UK energy system that the UK government have failed to address over many decades.\n\"There's been a significant change in both the market and what we now need to do to meet our climate change targets.\"\nRather than having a state-owned company, Mr Matheson said the Scottish government hoped to move to a model based on district heating - taking heat energy from a number of different sources and passing it to consumers through insulated pipes.\nHe said this would help meet the target of decarbonising the heating of more than one million homes and 50,000 businesses.\nA worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies has now pushed up gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia. Since January, they have risen 250% and prices have soared 70% from August alone.\nOutside the Bix Six energy companies, firms are struggling and some have already folded.\nMost recently Avro Energy and Green ceased trading on Wednesday and their 830,000 combined customers face being switched to a new, potentially more expensive, provider.\nEarlier this month Edinburgh-based People's Energy, which supplies gas and electricity to about 350,000 homes and 1,000 businesses, also ceased trading.\nThe government has said it is considering offering emergency state-backed loans to surviving energy companies to encourage them to take on customers from bust firms.\nFounder and CEO of Green Energy Peter McGirr said the decision to close was not because they did not have enough money in the bank, but because of \"a number of extra pressures\" as a result of the pandemic.\nThese pressures, he said, include people not paying bills due to financial issues, extended payment holidays for bills and additional demand due to people being at home during lockdown.\nHe said: \"If you start lending money out and you have no mechanism to recover that, that is going to put your business under financial pressure.\n\"We could see this future event - this winter - which we couldn't make it through due to a cash flow shortage. We've been aware of this for several months, yet we talk about this gas crisis as if it's came about in the last week or two.\"\nMr McGirr also predicted about 30 smaller companies would also cease trading due to pressure over the winter - a fate he believes could have been avoided with financial support from the UK government, as CO2 supplier CF Industries has received.\n\"I don't see why the government has chosen to put \u00a350m into a fertiliser plant for CO2,\" he said. \"We'd still have food on the shelves.\n \"We might not have had meat, we might not have had some bubbles in our lemonade, but here and now if the shelves were empty that would look bad. \n\"But how is it going to look over winter when people cannot heat their homes, when come 1 April we increase people's bills by hundreds of pounds and people cannot afford to heat their homes?\""

      "title": "What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust?",
      "tags": "Energy customer switching,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry,Bulb",
      "text": "Together Energy is the latest UK supplier to collapse due to rising gas prices. \nTwenty-eight energy companies have stopped trading in the UK since August, including Bulb, which is being managed separately because of its size. \nMore than three million customers have seen their energy firm collapse since the summer, though most suppliers are tiny compared to Bulb. \nOfgem said a new supplier will be found for Together Energy's 176,000 domestic customers, whose supply will continue without interruption. \nThe other companies which have already gone out of business are: \nAmpoweruk Ltd, Avro, Bluegreen, CNG Energy Limited, Colorado Energy, Daligas, Enstroga, Entice, Goto, Green, Hub, Igloo Energy, MA Energy Limited, Money Plus, Neon Reef, Omni Energy Limited, Orbit Energy, People's Energy, PFP, Pure Planet, Social Energy Supply, Symbio Energy, Utility Point, Zebra Power Limited and Zog Energy.  \nFirms have struggled because they offered customers cheap fixed deals. That meant they couldn't pass on the cost of soaring gas prices.\nIf your energy provider goes bust, you still receive gas and electricity. \nBecause of its size, Bulb has been put into an arrangement called \"special administration\". \nThe company is being run as normal by administrators Teneo, until a buyer can be found or its customers can be moved elsewhere. In the short-term, it means Bulb customers haven't been been transferred to another provider, and don't have to do anything. \nThe accounts held by the other failed firms are automatically moved to a new supplier by energy regulator Ofgem.\nYou can't choose the provider and may end up on a more expensive tariff.\nOfgem has sent customers to the following suppliers: \nOfgem and Citizens Advice both recommend making a note or taking a photo of your meter reading and downloading any bills, while waiting for your new supplier to get in touch.\nThere's no need to cancel direct debits.\nIf you're in credit, the balance will be added to your account with your new supplier. However, this may take several weeks.\nIf you're in debt to a company which has stopped trading, you still have to pay the money you owe. You will be contacted by its administrators, or the supplier which takes over its business.   \nIt's unlikely. \nUsually, consumers are encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise. \nBut at the moment better offers simply aren't available. In particular, people already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nThose coming to the end of fixed deals will be moved on to higher standard tariffs.\nA tariff set at the price cap limit - the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard deal - will be the most competitive.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, the Energy Saving Trust says simple changes to our homes and energy habits could help offset the current price rises.\nThe price cap sets the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The level of the cap is reviewed every six months.\nIt's the reason energy suppliers haven't been able to pass on all of the recent wholesale gas price increases.\nAbout 15 million households in England, Wales and Scotland saw a 12% rise in their energy bills on 1 October, when a higher price cap took effect.\nOfgem has now said it will review how the price cap is calculated to make sure it accurately reflects the risks faced by companies. \nIt will publish its conclusions in February, and a new price cap will be announced before it is implemented in April 2022.\nIn Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market, a number of suppliers have also announced price increases in recent months.\nA worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies has meant gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia have risen dramatically. \nSupplies of renewable energy in Great Britain were also reduced by the least windy summer since 1961. \nA fire at a National Grid site in Kent closed a power cable supplying electricity from France. \nRising gas prices also led to a shortage of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is widely used in the food and drink industry."

      "text": "People should carry on buying petrol as normal, despite supply problems that have closed some stations, the government has said.\nA \"handful\" of BP stations, and a small number of Esso-owned Tesco Alliance stations, were closed on Thursday because of a lack of delivery drivers.\nBut Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said refineries had \"plenty of petrol\".\nHe told the BBC that the government could bring in the army to drive fuel tankers if it would help.\nIt is estimated that the UK is short of about 100,000 HGV drivers - with gaps made worse by the pandemic and Brexit.\nOther industries such as food processing have been impacted. Britain's biggest baker Warburtons has confirmed that the company is facing challenges recruiting lorry drivers and that the shortage is causing some disruption to its supply chain. \nThe baker delivers to around 18,500 stores and says it can't deliver to a number of them. \n\"The national driver shortage continues to place a strain on the Warburtons distribution network but we are working incredibly hard to maintain a good level of service for our customers nationwide.\"\nReports in several newspapers have suggested that the government is considering getting soldiers to drive fuel tankers under emergency plans.\nWhen questioned about this on BBC Breakfast, Mr Shapps said: \"If it can actually help, we will bring them in.\"\nHowever, he said there would be \"technicalities\" as to whether military personnel could switch to driving civilian vehicles.\nThe AA said that most of the UK's forecourts were working as they should.\n\"There is no shortage of fuel and thousands of forecourts are operating normally with just a few suffering temporary supply chain problems,\" said AA president Edmund King.\n\"Fridays and the weekend always tend to be busier on forecourts, as drivers either combine filling up with shopping runs, prepare for weekend trips or refuel for the start of the new working week.\"\nMr King said drivers should not fill up outside their normal routines, because even if the occasional petrol station was temporarily closed, others just down the road would be open.\n\"It is now clear that there have been occasional delays over recent weeks that have been managed with hardly anyone noticing. This was a manageable problem.\"\nThere are about 8,380 petrol stations in the UK, according to the Petrol Retailers Association. Of these, about 1% are believed to be closed at the moment.\nIt is understood that about 50 to 100 BP forecourts are affected by shortages, while Esso said \"a small number\" of its Tesco Alliance retail sites had been hit.\nHelena Wright, transport manager for Norfolk-based firm W's Transport, told the BBC her company had sold two lorries after advertising for HGV drivers and not getting a single applicant.\n\"Normally we would have people on record to call who had left their details,\" she said. \"This is the first time for our firm that that's happened, but it's a problem that has been a long time coming.\n\"I've got a lot of drivers that are over the age of 50, 55 and looking to retire and we are not attractive as an industry for the younger generation.\"\nShe said younger people were not prepared to spend four to five nights a week away from home and were not ready to put up with \"inhumane\" conditions.\nThe Road Haulage Association (RHA) has urged the government to relax visa restrictions for foreign workers in the short term to ease the driver shortage.\nBut Mr Shapps told the BBC he did not want UK lorry drivers to \"drop out\" because of being \"undercut\" by cheaper EU labour.\nHe said there were \"systemic problems\" in the haulage industry that needed to be resolved, pointing out that the profession was \"99% white male\" with an average age of 55, facing poor conditions and wages.\nNow, he said, pay was rising and there was \"a gradual increase\" in new drivers.\nWhile the UK does not lack petrol and diesel at refineries, getting it to forecourts has been difficult in some areas.\nIt is the latest problem caused by driver shortages, which have already led to supply squeezes in other industries, including supermarkets.\nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: \"The supply issues affecting a small number of petrol forecourts shouldn't impact the prices drivers pay to fill up. \n\"But unfortunately the price of oil, which has the biggest influence on what drivers pay at the pumps, is continuing to rise at the moment. \n\"This may lead to fuel prices going up in the coming days, which would be yet more bad news for drivers, as a litre of unleaded is already over 21p a litre more expensive than a year ago.\"\nThe RHA's Rod McKenzie told BBC Breakfast more lorry drivers were leaving the profession each week than joining it.\nHe said: \"It's as simple as this: everything we get in Britain comes on the back of a truck. \n\"So if there is a shortage of HGV drivers - and there is by 100,000 - then it is inevitable that we are not going to get all the things we want when we want them.\"\n\"It is not a case of running out - and people should not panic buy,\" he added.\nHe warned there would be glitches \"because the supply chain on which we all depend is creaking\".\nSupermarket Iceland - which is about 100 drivers short - joined Morrisons and Ocado in calling for the government to add HGV drivers to the list of shortage occupations.\nThat would allow foreign workers to apply for skilled worker visas to fill the current gaps.\n\"I think the solution - even if it's temporary - is very, very simple,\" said Iceland managing director Richard Walker. \"Let's get HGV drivers on to the skilled worker list.\"\nThe RHA's Mr McKenzie said that on top of a historic shortage of drivers, the industry had lost 20,000 European drivers because of Brexit, while the pandemic had forced 40,000 driver training tests to be cancelled.\nIn a recent RHA survey of 616 hauliers, retiring colleagues and Brexit topped the list of reasons behind the driver shortages.\nRespondents also cited tax changes to rules known as IR35, which have made it more expensive for hauliers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK.\nBusinesses across the food, fuel and construction sectors have been warning about driver shortages for months.\nBP temporarily closed a number of petrol stations earlier in summer, when driver shortages also caused short-term supply problems for McDonald's, Nandos, and the pub chain Wetherspoons.\nSpeaking on BBC Question Time on Thursday, Mr Shapps suggested visa changes would not solve the problem, but said nothing had been ruled out.\nBut shadow justice secretary David Lammy said visas were needed in various sectors, telling Mr Shapps: \"You promised that immigration would come down and you know that it will need to go up if we are to deal with these problems.\"\nConservative MP Andrew Bridgen said there was \"an endemic problem with retention and recruitment\" in the industry.\n\"We're actually not short of HGV drivers per se - we've got 600,000 people who are qualified to drive those big trucks, but only 300,000 people chose to work in the industry,\" he told the BBC. \nMr Bridgen suggested the industry needed to modernise and improve working conditions to retain young drivers.\nIn recent weeks, the Department for Transport has made it quicker for HGV drivers to get their licences, but the RHA criticised the changes as a risk to road safety."

      "tags": "LGBT",
      "text": "A public consultation into a proposed ban on so-called conversion therapy has been delayed by at least a month, until possibly the end of October.\nThe consultation will invite the public to give their input over what the terms of the ban should be.\nThis includes how to safeguard therapists and religious freedom, while protecting people from harm.\nLGBT groups have expressed frustration at the delay, with the founder of one calling it \"incredibly disappointing\".\nConversion therapy seeks to change or suppress someone's sexual orientation or gender identity, health bodies say.\nIn practice, it means trying to stop or suppress someone from being gay, or from living as a different gender to their sex recorded at birth.\nIn 2018, Theresa May's government promised to end conversion therapy as part of its LGBT action plan. Last summer, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said plans for a ban would be brought forward.\nBut earlier this year, the government said it would instead open a public consultation in September around what that ban would look like.\nThis was, it said, to make sure the legislation addresses the practice while \"protecting the medical profession, defending freedom of speech, and upholding religious freedom\". \nHowever, the public consultation will not commence now until late October.\nCampaigners and conversion therapy survivors have expressed their frustration at the news.\nMatt Hyndman, the co-founder of the Ban Conversion Therapy campaign, said: \"Every single day the government delay, more and more LGBT people are at risk of being subjected to conversion therapy.\"\nStonewall chief executive Nancy Kelley agreed, and added: \"We urge the government to set a new deadline for the public consultation as soon as possible, as part of their commitment to a ban.\"\nCampaigner and conversion therapy survivor Jayne Ozanne, also expressed her frustration.\n\"What is needed is a far greater sense of urgency and a commitment to a timetable that will reassure us that legislation will soon be passed,\" she said.\nThe government is understood to be keen to avoid a repeat of the consultation process around reforming the Gender Recognition Act, which stretched to almost three years.\n\"As a global leader on LGBT rights, this government is committed to banning the practice of conversion therapy,\" a spokesperson for its Equality Hub said.\n\"We will be launching a consultation seeking views on our plans to ban the practice in a manner that is effective. More details will be announced shortly.\"\nIt is understood that a report into people's experiences of conversion therapy will be published alongside the consultation. It was commissioned by the government more than two years ago and the results given to ministers last December.\nThe government has already received input from LGBT, religious and other interested parties ahead of the public consultation.\nSome of these groups say they are concerned its wording may mean they won't be able to fully engage with people questioning their sexuality or gender identity, who need their support. \nThe Association of Christian Counsellors (ACC) is one of the organisations that has been in discussions with the government.\nKathy Spooner, its chief executive, argues that the existing memorandum of understanding (MOU) on conversion therapy, which was signed by major health organisations, works well in terms of safeguarding in counselling.  \n\"The way the MOU is written at the moment means any counsellor can work with people who have conflicts about different sections of their identity,\" she said. \nShe says the ACC is not against the conversion therapy ban and can see that it gives clarity. But the organisation has told the government the wording of the legislation may accidentally isolate some LGBT Christians.\n\"Those giving the support won't know what they can do and what is disallowable, and when people are confused they tend to withdraw,\" she said.\nMinister-in-training Justin Kennedy was subjected to conversion therapy in his early 20s.\nAfter unsuccessfully trying to bury his sexuality in his early teens, he says he became suicidal and asked for prayer to help change his sexuality.\nThe then-minister at his church found two people who specialised in what they called \"deliverance\" - \"getting demons out of people and setting them free\".\nHe would attend sessions and weekends away with the couple several times a year where they would make him go back through his family history, sexual history and his childhood. \n\"I spent about five years going to prayer, having hands laid on me, reflecting on my sins. The more I went to those sessions, the more shame came into my life, the more suicidal I became. I learnt to split my life into very different parts - the gay Justin and the Christian Justin. \n\"It was very manipulative, the deliverance therapy, because I wasn't really ever allowed to say no.\"\nAs a minister, others now approach him to discuss struggles with their sexuality. But the difference, he says, is that he embraces who they are.\n\"If a gay person said to me, 'I've accepted who I am but I'm getting out of control with my sex drive and I'm doing things I'm not happy with', I would say, 'we are going to pray together so you can gain control of your life' while acknowledging their sexuality,\" he says.\nHe believes a blanket ban would help to start a wider conversation in religious settings.\n\"It would be like a dam bursting,\" he says. \"All of a sudden it gives people like me and other affirming ministers an avenue with which to be frank with their congregation that we are living in a completely different world now.\""

      "text": "Screenwriter Russell T Davies is to take charge again of Doctor Who, the sci-fi show he helped revive in 2005.\nDavies, who was the fantasy drama's showrunner until 2009, will take over when Chris Chibnall departs next year. \n\"I'm beyond excited to be back on my favourite show,\" said Davies, who resumes his role as the show prepares to mark its 60th anniversary in 2023.\nOne of his first responsibilities will be to decide who takes over the Tardis following Jodie Whittaker's exit.\nThe actress is set to hang up her Sonic Screwdriver after one more six-part series and three 2022 specials.\nIn a statement, however, Davies said it would be \"time-travelling too fast\" to speculate on what will happen when he returns.\n\"There's a whole series of Jodie Whittaker's brilliant Doctor for me to enjoy, with my friend and hero Chris Chibnall at the helm,\" he continued. \"I'm still a viewer for now.\"\nChibnall said it was \"monumentally exciting and fitting\" that Davies would be back in charge for the series' 60th birthday.\n\"Russell built the baton that is about to be handed back to him,\" the writer and producer continued.\nDavies revived Doctor Who in its current incarnation with Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor and remained for David Tennant's time as the Doctor.\nSteven Moffat took over when Matt Smith took on the role, staying to supervise Peter Capaldi's stint as TV's indefatigable Time Lord.\nThe success of Doctor Who's relaunch led Davies to create two spin-off shows, Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures.\nIt's nearly 18 years to the day since the BBC announced that Doctor Who was returning, more than a decade after it was axed. No Doctor or companion had yet been cast, but it was confirmed that Russell T Davies would be in charge of the show. At the time, the lifelong Doctor Who fan was best known as the writer of Queer As Folk (he even managed to briefly squeeze robot dog K9 into the series).\nFew predicted how huge it would become upon its return, and Davies is the man credited with much of that success. As showrunner he oversaw every creative aspect of the science fiction drama, wrote many of its scripts, and was an exceptionally hands-on executive producer - the book The Writer's Tale, a diary of daily emails and text messages between Davies and journalist Benjamin Cook. details the attention to detail he gave to almost every part of the show, from approving merchandise designs to overseeing the plans for media events.\nHis unexpected return to the show has delighted many, because if there is a recent golden era of Doctor Who, it's arguably when Davies was in charge, with the programme attracting huge viewing figures and racking up awards and critical acclaim.\nWith the exception of the Doctor Who TV movie with Paul McGann, Doctor Who has always been produced purely by the BBC. But from 2023 it will be a co-production with Bad Wolf. The production house was founded by Jane Tranter and Julie Gardner who worked alongside Davies during his time on Doctor Who. Tranter was the BBC's head of drama, Gardner was an executive producer on the show. Both are seen as less high profile, but still crucially important parts of Doctor Who's previous success.\nAfter leaving the show in 2009, Davies enjoyed more acclaim with TV dramas Years and Years, A Very English Scandal and It's A Sin.\nPiers Wenger, the BBC's director of drama, said the news of Davies' return would \"delight Doctor Who fans across the globe\".\n\"We are thrilled that Russell is returning to Doctor Who to build on the huge achievements of Chris and Jodie,\" he continued. \"Russell, it's wonderful to have you back.\"\nDavies' return was also welcomed by Bad Wolf, the production company founded in 2015 by former BBC executives Julie Gardner and Jane Tranter.\nGardner and Tranter both worked with Davies on the Doctor Who relaunch and will collaborate with him again when he returns as showrunner.\n\"We are delighted to be joining Russell T Davies on a looped ontological paradox,\" said the Bad Wolf Twitter account. \"Where Russell goes, we are proud to follow.\n\"With BBC Studios, Bad Wolf will be producing the all-new series of Doctor Who. It is a privilege to be asked to support him in Doctor Who's future.\"\nActor Matt Lucas, who played companion Nardole during Capaldi's time as the Doctor, was evidently delighted with the news.\n\"Russell T Davies back in the Tardis! What a coup! I'm buzzing!\" wrote the Bake Off presenter and Little Britain comic on Twitter.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Hospitality industry,UK economy,Restaurants",
      "text": "Restaurant, caf\u00e9 and pub bosses are set to be banned from keeping tips left for staff by customers in Britain.\nThe government plans to make it illegal for hospitality firms to withhold tips from workers, who often rely on them to top up their income.\nLabour Markets Minister Paul Scully said the plans would \"ensure tips will go to those who worked for it\".\nIf an employer breaks the new rules they can be taken to an employment tribunal.\nIn that instance, bosses may be forced to compensate workers or face fines.\nIn a statement, the Department for Business said that the new legislation would help about two million people working in the hospitality industry.\nIt is expected to come into force within the next year.\nBut it comes some time after the practice was reported to have taken place at High Street chains such as Pizza Express, Cote Brasserie and Bill's.\nIn 2015, the restaurants were accused of keeping tips or charging 10% \"administrative costs\" on processing the service charge payments if they were made by debit or credit card.\nAlthough they denied any wrongdoing, the reports drew a huge backlash from unions and the public.\nConservative MP Paul Scully said on Tuesday: \"Unfortunately, some companies choose to withhold cash from hardworking staff who have been tipped by customers as a reward for good service.\n\"Our plans will make this illegal and ensure tips will go to those who worked for it\".\nHe added that the move would also reassure customers that their money is going to \"those who deserve it\".\nMinisters also pointed towards research that suggests most tips are now paid by card in the UK, rather than in cash.\nCurrently, businesses who receive tips by card have the choice of whether to keep it or pass it on to workers. Cash tips, on the other hand, are legally the property of staff.\nAs well as requiring all employers to pass on all tips, service charges and gratuities in full without any deductions, the new legislation will introduce a code of practice, which will set out exactly how tips should be distributed fairly.\nWorkers will also get the right to request information on their boss's tipping record, in case they want to bring a claim to an employment tribunal.\nWhile the move was welcomed by the Living Wage Foundation, it said that the focus should be on improving wages in lower-paid sectors instead.\nIts interim director, Graham Griffiths, said: \"If this work is to be truly valued we need to see more people lifted onto a real Living Wage. \n\"To build a stronger and more dynamic economy, our focus should be on increasing the number of businesses doing the right thing and committing to pay a Living Wage\".\nKate Nicholls, UKHospitality chief executive, added the new rules would strengthen the sector's ability to create jobs.\nBut she pointed out: \"For hospitality businesses, though, customers tipping with a card incurs bank charges for the business, and many also employ external partners to ensure tips are fairly distributed among staff. \n\"With restaurants, pubs and other venues struggling to get back on their feet... we urge the government to continue to work closely with the sector as it introduces this legislation to ensure this works for businesses and employees.\"\nHave you worked somewhere that kept your tips?

      "text": "The influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un says they are willing to resume talks with the South if it ends its \"hostile policies\".\nKim Yo-jong was responding to a renewed call from the South to officially declare an end to the Korean War.\nThe conflict, which split the peninsula into two, ended in 1953 with an armistice and not a peace treaty.\nThe two countries have technically been at war ever since, and locked in a sometimes tense relationship.\nThis week, South Korean president Moon Jae-in called for the two Koreas and their allies - the US which backs the South, and China which is the North's biggest economic partner - to declare a formal end to the conflict and bring peace to the peninsula.\nThe idea was initially dismissed by a top North Korean minister as \"premature\".\nBut in an unexpected statement released on Friday through state media, Ms Kim said the idea was \"admirable\".\nHowever she added that the North would only be willing to discuss the proposal if the South stopped what she called \"hostile policies\" towards them.\n\"What needs to be dropped is the double-dealing attitudes, illogical prejudice, bad habits and hostile stand of justifying their own acts while faulting our just exercise of the right to self-defence,\" she said in a statement. \n\"Only when such a precondition is met, would it be possible to sit face to face and declare the significant termination of war.\"\nI remember on the day that Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in first met, I said that when it comes to inter-Korean relations, hope can be a difficult thing to manage.\nThe prospect of ending a more than 70-year war on the Korean peninsula has been the hope of this administration in Seoul for nearly 5 years.\nBut President Moon is running out of time. His successor will be elected in March.\nHe took a gamble on meeting Kim Jong-un and holding his hand on the sacred summit of Mount Paektu. But since then, relations between the two Koreas have soured.\nNorth Korea even blew up an office which was purpose built to house talks between the two sides. It looked like all hope of peace talks were over.\nBut here we are, another small sliver of hope breaking through in the form of a statement from Kim Yo-jong.\nNote all the caveats and pre-conditions. There are a lot of \"ifs\" and \"buts\" in there.\nSo, does she mean it? Kim Yo-jong doesn't say things lightly. But she's also batting everything back to Seoul. \nIt might as well say: \"Talks will only follow if you behave in a way we deem worthy\".\n And who knows when that may be. \nSouth Korea earlier this month tested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile, just hours after the North tested their own weapon. \nNorth Korea has also often criticised South Korea's annual military drills with the US. \nRelations between the two countries have not improved much since denuclearisation talks between Mr Kim and US president Donald Trump soured in 2019. \nMr Moon, who has made engagement with the North a cornerstone of his presidency, has previously argued that a declaration to end the war would encourage the North to denuclearise. \nNorth Korea in turn has called for crippling economic sanctions to be lifted first.\nBut the US has repeatedly said that North Korea must abandon its nuclear weapons first before any sanctions can be lifted."

      "tags": "Transport,UK economy,BP,Fuel,Freight transport,Brexit,Grant Shapps,Haulage",
      "text": "Ministers are working on plans for a temporary visa scheme to make it easier for foreign lorry drivers to come to the UK. \nFinal details of exactly how the initiative will work are expected to be announced this weekend.\nAny changes to immigration rules will be temporary, with a cap on the number of workers allowed to enter the UK.\nThe shortage of hauliers threatens more disruption to deliveries of petrol, food and other goods. \nIt is estimated that the UK is short of about 100,000 HGV drivers - with existing shortages made worse by the pandemic and Brexit.\nBP and Esso have shut a number of petrol stations due to a lack of tanker drivers, while EG Group has said it will introduce a limit of \u00a330 per customer on all grades of fuel.\nThe company, which operates 400 filling stations in the UK, said the move was due to the \"current unprecedented customer demand for fuel and associated supply challenges\".\nAll of EG Group's UK sites remain open and operational to serve customers.\nHGV drivers and emergency services will be excluded from the \u00a330 limit due to \"their vital role at this time\", according to the firm.\n\"This is a company decision to ensure all our customers have a fair chance to refuel and to enable our sites to carry on running smoothly,\" a spokesperson from the firm said. \n\"We kindly ask everyone visiting our sites to treat our colleagues, supply chain partners and customers with respect during these very challenging times.\"\nA Downing Street spokesperson said: \"We have ample fuel stocks in this country and the public should be reassured there are no shortages.\n\"But like countries around the world we are suffering from a temporary Covid-related shortage of drivers needed to move supplies around the country.\"\nThe spokesperson explained that ministers are looking at temporary measures to \"avoid any immediate problems\", but added that any measures introduced will be \"very strictly time limited\". \n\"We are moving to a high-wage, high-skilled economy and businesses will need to adapt with more investment in recruitment and training to provide long-term resilience,\" the spokesperson added. \nThe European Road Haulers Association said temporary visas would be a \"good idea\" but are \"only part of the solution\". \nThe association said it is still easier to drive within the EU than driving between the EU and the UK, meaning that staying within the EU may still be more appealing for drivers.\nDespite reassurances, large queues formed at many petrol stations on Friday. On social media, people reported queues lasting for up to 30 minutes, while there were also reports of drivers filling jerry cans.\nThe AA said that most of the UK's forecourts were working as they should.\n\"There is no shortage of fuel and thousands of forecourts are operating normally with just a few suffering temporary supply chain problems,\" said AA president Edmund King. \"Fridays and the weekend always tend to be busier on forecourts.\"\nMr King said drivers should not fill up outside their normal routines, because even if the occasional petrol station was temporarily closed, others just down the road would be open. \"This was a manageable problem,\" said.\nThere are about 8,380 petrol stations in the UK, according to the Petrol Retailers Association. Of these, about 1% are believed to be closed at the moment.\nIt is understood that about 50 to 100 BP forecourts are affected by shortages, while Esso said \"a small number\" of its Tesco Alliance retail sites had been hit.\nAllan Davison, managing director of Hoyer Petrolog UK - one of the country's leading fuel logistics companies and BP's transport contractor - told the BBC that European drivers should be offered temporary visas to help ease the situation. \n\"If this was a permanent request, I would understand the political and practical challenges with that, but it's not. It's a temporary request,\" he said. \nHelena Wright, transport manager for Norfolk-based firm W's Transport, told the BBC her company had sold two lorries after advertising for HGV drivers and not getting a single applicant.\n\"Normally we would have people on record to call who had left their details,\" she said. \"This is the first time for our firm that that's happened, but it's a problem that has been a long time coming.\n\"I've got a lot of drivers that are over the age of 50, 55 and looking to retire and we are not attractive as an industry for the younger generation.\"\nShe said younger people were not prepared to spend four to five nights a week away from home and were not ready to put up with \"inhumane\" conditions.\nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: \"The supply issues affecting a small number of petrol forecourts shouldn't impact the prices drivers pay to fill up. \n\"But unfortunately the price of oil, which has the biggest influence on what drivers pay at the pumps, is continuing to rise at the moment. This may lead to fuel prices going up in the coming days\"\nSupermarket Iceland - which is about 100 drivers short - joined Morrisons and Ocado in calling for the government to add HGV drivers to the list of shortage occupations.\nThat would allow foreign workers to apply for skilled worker visas to fill the current gaps.\n\"I think the solution - even if it's temporary - is very, very simple,\" said Iceland managing director Richard Walker. \"Let's get HGV drivers on to the skilled worker list.\"\nThe  UK's Road Haulage Association (RHA) said that on top of a historic shortage of drivers, the industry had lost 20,000 European drivers because of Brexit, while the pandemic had forced 40,000 driver training tests to be cancelled.\nIn a recent RHA survey of 616 hauliers, retiring colleagues and Brexit topped the list of reasons behind the driver shortages.\nRespondents also cited tax changes to rules known as IR35, which have made it more expensive for hauliers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK."

Sabina Nessa. \nThis is the square the 28-year-old teacher was walking to this time last week. She never made it. \nNow Londoners from across the city, many of them holding candles and laying flowers, are listening on this quiet, still autumn evening to the vigil speakers. \nDozens more silhouetted figures observe from the tower blocks overlooking Pegler Square. \nMany observers are crying, listening to the speakers including Sabina Nessa's sister who says her family's world has been shattered.\nBut while a community joins together in grief, just behind the vigil, police have sealed off an area. Yellow evidence markers dot the road. \nAs one person spoke emotionally of Sabina Nessa, a forensics officer combed the bushes, a reminder that this is still very much an ongoing investigation.\nCrowds also gathered in Hackney, Newham, Bristol and in Brighton, to pay tribute to Ms Nessa.\nA spokesperson for Brighton and Hove Council said: \"Every woman and girl should feel safe in their streets, in their parks and open spaces and in their homes. \n\"We have today lowered the flags at Hove Town Hall and Brighton Town Hall in memory of Sabina Nessa and to raise awareness of violence against women and girls.\"\nAre you taking part in a vigil for Sabina Nessa?

      "text": "China's central bank has announced that all transactions of crypto-currencies are illegal, effectively banning digital tokens such as Bitcoin.\n\"Virtual currency-related business activities are illegal financial activities,\" the People's Bank of China said, warning it \"seriously endangers the safety of people's assets\". \nChina is one of the world's largest crypto-currency markets.\nFluctuations there often impact the global price of crypto-currencies.\nThe price of Bitcoin fell by more than $2,000 (\u00a31,460) in the wake of the Chinese announcement.\nIt is the latest in China's national crackdown on what it sees as a volatile, speculative investment at best - and a way to launder money at worst.\nTrading crypto-currency has officially been banned in China since 2019, but has continued online through foreign exchanges.\nHowever, there has been a significant crackdown this year.\nIn May, Chinese state intuitions warned buyers they would have no protection for continuing to trade Bitcoin and other currencies online, as government officials vowed to increase pressure on the industry.\nIn June, it told banks and payment platforms to stop facilitating transactions and issued bans on \"mining\" the currencies - the trade of using powerful computers to make new coins.\nBut Friday's announcement is the clearest indication yet that China wants to shut down crypto-currency trading in all its forms.\nThe statement makes clear that those who are involved in \"illegal financial activities\" are committing a crime and will be prosecuted.\nAnd foreign websites providing such services to Chinese citizens online is also an illegal activity, it said.\nThe technology at the core of many crypto-currencies, including Bitcoin, relies on many distributed computers verifying and checking transactions on a giant shared ledger known as the blockchain.\nAs a reward, new \"coins\" are randomly awarded to those who take part in this work - known as crypto \"mining\".\nChina, with its relatively low electricity costs and cheaper computer hardware, has long been one of the world's main centres for mining. \nThe activity is so popular there that gamers have sometimes blamed the industry for a global shortage of powerful graphics cards, which miners use for processing crypto-currencies.\nThe Chinese crackdown has already hit the mining industry.\nIn September 2019, China accounted for 75% of the world's Bitcoin energy use. By April 2021, that had fallen to 46%."

      "text": "Children and young people living with Tourette's syndrome in Wales say they need more support from the Welsh government.\nMegan Jones, 17, from Carmarthenshire, told BBC Wales there is a \"lack of knowledge and a lack of help\" for people like her.\nThere is currently only one specialist in Wales, who does not treat children.\nThe Welsh government said it was reviewing services and a new framework will improve access to support.\nHywel Dda Health Board, which covers Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire, has been asked to comment.\nMegan, from Llandysul, started experiencing tics in February last year.\n\"Head jerks... I whistle loads, when I say 'whitwoo' people know it's me. I punch things, I fall, I have loads of bruises... I click, I chat, I swear,\" she said.\nIn May she started experiencing seizures, which now occur on a daily basis and are \"frustrating\".\n\"They're really bad, and it's really dangerous,\" she said.\n\"School don't let me go down town and off campus until I'm on the bus, and then on the bus I have friends who know everything they're supposed to do, and the bus driver knows everything too.\n\"It's really annoying, all of my friends are learning to drive, and I'm desperate but I can't, and that's the one thing I really want to do - I want to travel more, see the world, and I can't do that, I have no independence.\n\"It makes me sad and angry, I haven't asked for this.\"\nMegan said she had been for \"loads\" of tests, but months later has had \"no answers\".\n\"I've had loads of tests, I ring and I ring and I ring, and there's no information,\" Megan explained. \n\"They still haven't had the results of my tests that I had months ago, and it took five months for me to even get the tests.\"\nHelen Reeves-Graham, from Pembrokeshire, has started a petition calling for a children's Tourette's syndrome specialist in Wales.\nShe decided to start the petition after her 13-year-old daughter developed the condition during the first lockdown.\n\"Watching your child hitting themselves or not being able to hold a cup, or you know, be able to go to school, it's horrifying,\" she said.\n\"At the very least, we need access to a specialist in Wales.\n\"Our paediatrician is great, but she's asking me questions... I'm not a medical professional, I don't know what's what.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, she said that \"for children, there is no specialist for Tourette's in Wales\".\n\"There is one for adults, he actually works part time as a GP and part time as an adult neurologist.  \n\"Most of my information comes from trawling the internet, from charities and from other families who are going through the same thing.\"\nShe added she would like to see specific guidelines: \"I think that's probably the first thing that needs to happen, so people know where to go and what's going to happen - it doesn't matter where you live.\"\nMs Reeves-Graham has started a Facebook support group for people living with or caring for people with Tourette's syndrome in Wales.\n\"There's absolutely nothing,\" she said.\n\"I set up my own group... so I've got different other families that are willing to share their experiences, to help us and we'll help them.\n\"I don't know what to do without them.\"\nMegan said a lack of support was stopping her from living the life she wanted to live.\n\"I want help really, I want a solution, to move forward, to go to university, and to go out into the world knowing what's wrong, knowing how to deal with it, especially when I'm on my own. It's really hard.\"\nThe Welsh government said: \"We are committed to ensuring all children with a neurodevelopmental condition, including Tourette's syndrome, can access the services and care they need. \n\"Regional Partnership Boards are rolling out a new framework to improve access to the right support.\n\"As pressures on assessment and support services continue to increase, we are reviewing all children's and adults neurodevelopmental services, to identify where there are gaps in provision and the demand, capacity and design of services for children, young people and adults.

      "title": "R. Kelly trial: A look at the key moments after star found guilty",
      "tags": "R. Kelly,Music",
      "text": "A jury in New York has found R. Kelly guilty of running a scheme to sexually abuse women, men and children over two decades and the former music star could now be facing the rest of his life behind bars.\nThe 54-year-old was found guilty on all counts - one charge of racketeering, which positioned him as the head of a criminal enterprise that preyed on young women, and eight counts of trafficking girls and women across state lines for prostitution.\nOnce one of the world's biggest pop stars, Kelly was initially arrested on these charges in July 2019, but his trial was delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic and scheduling issues with separate cases he faces in other states.\nFollowing the verdict, Jacquelyn M Kasulis, the acting US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said:  \"Today's guilty verdict forever brands R. Kelly as a predator who used his fame and fortune to prey on the young, the vulnerable and the voiceless for his own sexual gratification.\n\"A predator who used his inner circle to ensnare underage girls and young men and women for decades in a sordid web of sex abuse, exploitation and humiliation. To the victims in this case, your voices were heard, and justice was finally served. We hope that today's verdict brings some measure of comfort and closure to the victims.\"\n\"Today my voice was heard,\" wrote Jerhonda Pace on Instagram, one of the women who testified at his trial.\n\"For years, I was trolled for speaking out about the abuse that I suffered at the hands of that predator. People called me a liar and said I had no proof. Some even said I was speaking out for money. Speaking out about abuse is not easy, especially when your abuser is high-profile,\" Pace wrote.\nThe MuteRKelly campaign, founded by two women in 2017 to try to remove the singer's music from the air waves, said on Twitter they hoped the verdict \"brings some sense of justice to the brave survivors who came forward.\"\nKelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, had pleaded not guilty on all counts but refused the opportunity to testify in his defence. \nHere are the key moments from the trial, many of which readers may find upsetting.\nKelly was not charged with rape or assault, but prosecutors were allowed to present evidence of potential crimes related to the racketeering charge, regardless of when they occurred.\nAs such, they called more than half a dozen witnesses who said they were abused by Kelly while they were underage.\nBoth male and female, they described being approached by the star or one of his associates after a concert, in a shopping mall, or in a McDonald's, and being slipped a phone number. Often, Kelly would offer to mentor their music career, they alleged, in return for sexual favours. \nSeveral witnesses claimed Kelly kept them in a constant state of fear, demanding they follow his stringent rules,and ordering them to call him \"Daddy\". Those who disobeyed were punished, sometimes with degrading sexual acts, they claimed. Two women accused the star of rape.\nKelly's defence portrayed the women as \"groupies\" and jilted lovers, who were seeking revenge after falling out of favour with the star. \n\"You heard about a man who treated these women like gold,\" Mr Cannick told the jury.\nJerhonda Pace testified over the first two days of the trial, giving an account of her time with the singer.\nShe said Kelly controlled what she wore, when she could eat, and whether she could use the bathroom. \nOn one occasion, she recalled breaking \"Rob's rules\", after which the star \"slapped me and choked me until I passed out,\" she alleged.\nMs Pace, now 28, was one of several women who spoke to the Surviving R. Kelly documentary in 2019. \nIn her testimony, she said she started having sex with the singer when she was 16. She initially told him she was older, but when she revealed the truth, he continued the relationship, instructing her to call him \"Daddy\".\n\"He wanted me to put my hair up in pigtails and dress like a girl scout,\" she told the court.\nMr Kelly's lawyers tried to portray Ms Pace as a \"superfan\" who reacted badly when the star lost interest in her.  In cross-examination, Deveraux Cannick accused her of fabricating her story for money and fame; and of \"stalking\" his client. She denied the claims.\nThe prosecution's second witness said she began a five-year relationship with Kelly when she was 17 years old. Like Ms Pace, she alleged that the singer sought to control every detail of her life, demanded that she called him \"Daddy\", and would punish her if she did not comply. \nThe physical abuse took place \"nearly every two to three days,\" she alleged.\nIdentified only as Jane Doe 5, the 23-year-old also told the court that Kelly urged her to get an abortion she didn't want, after she became pregnant in 2017.\n\"He said, 'You need to look into that abortion stuff because you need to keep that body,'\" she said.\nKelly's former tour manager testified that he bribed a government worker to obtain a fake ID for R&B star Aaliyah - who was then aged 15 - so the singers could marry.\nDemetrius Smith, 65, said he was informed Aaliyah might be pregnant after a concert on Kelly's 1994 tour, and that they planned to get married so Kelly could avoid potential prosecution for having sex with a minor. \nAlthough Mr Smith initially objected to the plan, he says he eventually told Kelly, \"'I know how to get her an ID,' and that's what I did.\"\nOne of the star's former backing dancers later testified that she had accidentally disturbed Kelly and Aaliyah in a sexual situation in 1993, a year before the marriage. \nThe woman, who testified under the name Angela, said Aaliyah would have been 13 or 14 at the time, making her the youngest of his alleged victims.\nThe minister who officiated the wedding, Nathan Edmond, also testified, saying he was unaware of who the couple were at the time.\nMr Edmond, now 73, said he was asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement after the ceremony but refused. Instead, he promised Kelly he would never speak about the wedding. He only testified at the trial under subpoena.\nThe marriage was annulled a year after it took place. Aaliyah died in a plane crash in 2001.\nKelly's lawyers described much of the testimony regarding Aaliyah as \"fluff\". The marriage and Aaliyah's alleged pregnancy are not relevant to the charges he is facing, argued Mr Cannick. \nThe only pertinent question was whether Kelly tried to bribe an Illinois employee for a fake identification. \n\"Robert knew nothing about it,\" he said.\nSeveral women claimed they had contracted herpes after sexual intercourse with Kelly, who failed to disclose he carried the virus. \nOne witness, known only as Jane Doe, said the condition became so bad it got to \"the point where I couldn't walk\". \nShe alleged the star \"purposely gave me something he knew he had\".\nAnother witness, Kate, said she had reached a $200,000 (\u00a3145,000) settlement with Kelly after contracting the disease in 2001.\nKelly's longtime physician, Kris McGrath, testified that he first suspected the singer had herpes in 2000. \nAlthough tests came back negative, Dr McGrath noted the possibility of a false negative and said he told the star to \"inform your sexual partners so they can make a decision whether or not to have sex with you\".\nThe physician also testified that, between 2007 and 2019, Kelly was treated for genital herpes at least five times. In that time, he said he had prescribed herpes medication \"so often that I memorised the phone number\" of the star's local pharmacy.\nThe star's defence challenged Dr McGrath's diagnosis, and argued that, as herpes is not life-threatening, any related charges should not be considered.  \nA woman identified as Abbie claimed that Kelly pinned her down and raped her in his dressing room after a concert in 1994 - just two days after his wedding.\nAt the time she was 17, and had been invited backstage to meet the star with a friend. She claimed he had cleared the room before assaulting her, telling the court: \"I just went blank.\"\nNow 44, Addie said she had waited until now to report the assault \"because I didn't want more victim-shaming and more trauma at that time\".\nThe court heard a second allegation of rape in the fourth week of a trial, by a reporter who said she was invited to Kelly's house for an interview in 2003.\nInstead, she claimed she was locked in a room for several days and lost consciousness after being drugged. When she woke up, she saw the star pulling up his trousers in the corner of the room.\n\"It felt like something had been inside of me,\" she told the jury, saying later: \"I was sexually assaulted.\"\nThe defence accused her of fabricating the account, noting that Kelly had paid for her trip to Chicago.\n\"The kidnapper paid her way to get there? The kidnapper paid her way to come?\" Mr Cannick asked the jury. \"I mean, come on.\"\nHe added that there was no physical evidence or police report to corroborate either rape accusation. \nA woman named Anna testified that the star would spank her if she broke his rules, and claimed that he often videotaped the punishment on an iPad.\nOn another occasion, he forced her to parade naked in front of a camera, calling herself \"stupid\" and a \"slut\", she alleged. \nAnna also testified that Kelly made her be \"sexual and seductive with bodily fluids\", echoing claims by Jane Doe 5, who said the singer once forced her to smear faeces on her face and \"put it in my mouth and act like I liked, enjoyed that\". \nAgain, he is alleged to have taped this scene, and threatened to make her film another take because she didn't seem \"into it enough.\"\nA male witness also described how the star coerced him into sexual encounters with women, which he would then film.\nDuring the encounters, the women, whose names he did not know, appeared \"zombie-ish,\" he said.\nIn closing arguments, Kelly's team portrayed the star's conduct as the consequence of a \"playboy lifestyle\".\n\"It's not a crime to like kinky sex,\" argued Mr Cannick, adding that \"some people just like\" relationships between an older man and a \"younger female.\"\nHe also dismissed the repeated claim that Kelly ordered his girlfriends to call him \"Daddy\" as irrelevant, suggesting it was an affectionate term.\n\"Daddy! It's almost a crime to call a man a Daddy. I guess people can't do that anymore,\" Mr Cannick said. \"Ho is good, daddy is bad.... The former Vice President [Mike Pence] called his wife Mother.\"\nR. Kelly's former assistant Anthony Navarro testified that working for the singer was \"almost like the Twilight Zone\". \n\"You went into the gate, and it was like a different world, just a strange place,\" he told the court.\nMr Navarro worked for the star between 2007 and 2009, and said he was issued with a list of \"Rob's Rules\" - the same phrase used by Ms Pace in her testimony. Among the most prominent: \"I wasn't supposed to be talking to any of the girls - the guests - who were coming into the house,\" he recalled. \nMr Navarro also claimed to have driven one of Kelly's girlfriends across state lines, from Alabama to Atlanta - a key piece of evidence for the prosecution's trafficking case.\nThe defence dismissed the charge as absurd. \n\"They are in relationships,\" Mr Cannick told the jury. \"This is just like you taking your girlfriend, your wife, your husband on business.\"\nAnother assistant, Diana Copeland, confirmed that women were confined to their rooms inside Kelly's various homes, offices, and studios.\nShe described a state of paranoia within his compound, saying she was once asked to change into a robe to demonstrate she was not wearing a wire.\n\"He could get pretty heated,\" said Copeland, who was Kelly's assistant for 15 years. She told jurors he made her cry at times.\nHowever, she said she did not witness any sexual or physical abuse during her time with the star.\nFive months after Kelly was arrested, investigators opened a safe and discovered a stash of the star's personal papers. Among them were several letters written by the women he is now accused of abusing, that appeared to absolve him of guilt.\nOne handwritten note began, \"At the age of 17 I never had sex with Robert Kelly,\" before listing a series of specific sexual acts that the author said she had not participated in with the singer.\nAnother woman, who testified as Jane, wrote that she spanked herself \"really hard\" until she had bruises in an effort to blackmail Kelly. \nOn the witness stand, several of Kelly's accusers said they had been coerced into writing these messages. \n\"He wanted us to include letters saying that we had stolen money from him, that we had stolen watches from him, that we had been molested by family members, that we had been abused and neglected by family members and so forth,\" testified one anonymous witness.\nPsychologist Dawn M Hughes told jurors that letters like these gave Kelly leverage if his alleged victims attempted to leave or testify against him. \nShe added that such power dynamics were common in cults, and had the effect of \"slowly sucking the oxygen out of the room and once you realise it, you can't get out.\"\nKelly's lawyers dismissed the allegations, saying Kelly and his girlfriends functioned like a \"family\".\nKelly's defence was swift by comparison to the prosecution's forensic, weeks-long case. \nThey called just half-a-dozen witnesses, mainly former employees of the star, who said they did not recognise the behaviour described by his accusers.\nAmong them was Larry Hood, a former Chicago police officer who worked as Kelly's security guard for a number of years. \nMr Hood testified that he never saw the star with underage girls and never witnessed him hit a woman or lock a woman in a room.\n\"As a police officer, I would have had to take action against that,\" he told the court.\nA former accountant for Kelly also testified, saying that girls in the singer's entourage dressed \"appropriately\", and that he did not recall Kelly angrily raising his voice in their presence.\nDhanai Ramnanan, an aspiring singer who has worked with Kelly since 2005, added that women in the star's entourage were never prevented from eating or using the bathroom.\n\"Whenever we'd go to a restaurant, they'd sit down first, they'd order first, they got to eat first,\" he said of the star's girlfriends. \"I mean, chivalry, basically.\"\nProsecutors tried to show that the witnesses were not as close to Kelly as they claimed, and would not have been present during any alleged abuse.\nUnder cross-examination, several of the witnesses admitted their careers were tied to Kelly, and that they had a vested interest in seeing him acquitted.\nSentencing is due on 4 May and he could spend the rest of his life behind bars.\nThe singer also faces a separate trial in Chicago accused of producing child sexual abuse images and obstruction charges, in addition to sex abuse charges in Illinois and Minnesota.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Unemployment benefits,Department for Work & Pensions,Disability",
      "text": "Seven out of ten people who appealed in court against a decision to deny them disability benefits were successful, analysis shows.\nIn total, more than 293,000 people across the UK have overturned a government decision at tribunal in the past three years.\nMost hearings centred on Personal Independence Payment (PIP), the main disability benefit.\nThe government said it made millions of PIP decisions and 5% were overturned.\nFigures released under the Freedom of Information Act also reveal more than 1,000 people across the UK have died while formally challenging their benefit award. \nDaphne Hall, the vice chair of the National Association of Welfare Rights Advisers, said: \"It is heart-breaking that people die without having resolution.\"\nKeith Jones died weighing six stone (38kg) days before he was due to appeal a decision to refuse him benefits.\nThe former electrician, from Wrexham, was awarded Disability Living Allowance (DLA) in 1997 after mouth cancer left him unable to eat solid food and struggling to walk more than 20 metres.\nIn 2016, Mr Jones was told to apply for PIP - the benefit being introduced to replace DLA - but was refused. \nHe never heard judges rule on his case as he died two days before his original tribunal date in August 2017. The eventual hearing ruled he had been entitled to PIP.\n\"I didn't really care about the money afterwards,\" his daughter Kerry Jones said. \"It was more justice for my dad and to prove them wrong.\"\n\"It's heart-breaking for people to have to go through [tribunals] when they are so ill and they don't even know the ending. It needs highlighting.\"\nJames Oliver, from Hastings, East Sussex, had chronic liver disease caused by alcohol dependency but was refused PIP in May 2018.  His mandatory reconsideration was also refused.\nA letter inviting Mr Oliver to appeal the decision to deny him PIP was found by one of his children at his home four months after his death.\nIt was not until October 2020 that his brother David Smith won a tribunal on his behalf.  It led to a payment backdated to when Mr Oliver first applied, up until the date of his death.\n\"The government know most people don't have the patience or the strength to keep going to tribunal,\" Mr Smith said.  \n\"I was so worn down after 18 months - it was soul-destroying to be honest - but it was for the principle; his assessment defied belief.\"\nThe backdated benefit award covered the cost of Mr Oliver's funeral and for a bench in his memory in Alexandra Park, Hastings.\nThe BBC's Shared Data Unit analysed figures from from HM Courts and Tribunals Service, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and Northern Ireland's Department for Communities (DfC).\nIt found:\nIn July the BBC reported how the DWP had held at least 268 internal reviews into cases where people claiming benefits died or came to serious harm since February 2012. The Labour Party then called for an \"urgent independent investigation\".\nInitial benefits assessments are carried out on behalf of the DWP by the private contractors Capita, the Independent Assessment Services (formerly called Atos) and Maximus.\nSince 2013, people seeking to overturn a benefits decision must start their challenge within a month, known as a mandatory reconsideration. If unsuccessful, people can take their appeal to a tribunal.\nThe DWP said mandatory reconsiderations were introduced to ensure claimants received the right decision without having to go to court.\nCritics say the process is distressing, does not give claimants enough time to gather evidence to support their appeal and many wrong decisions continue to be made.\nBoth the DWP and Northern Ireland's DfC said their decisions were overturned on appeal mainly because of new evidence submitted to tribunals but charities said that evidence should have been captured earlier in applications.\n\"Narrow questions and a sense of being under suspicion [during assessments] can make it hard for people to give a full account of the barriers they face,\" former DWP senior mental health policy adviser Tom Pollard said.\nMark Jackson, policy and public affairs manager at the end of life charity Marie Curie, said the system was \"clearly broken\".\nHe said: \"It is driving people into financial hardship at the end of their lives and forcing bereaved relatives to fight an injustice at the most difficult time of their lives.\"\nThe DWP said it supported \"millions of people a year\" and \"the vast majority of PIP cases were not appealed\".\nRecent changes included giving decision-makers more time to contact people to ask for further information to support their benefit claim.\nA spokesperson said the PIP assessment process was carried out by experienced health professionals, who consider how people are affected by their disability, rather than just the disability itself.\nThey said more than double the proportion of PIP claimants received the top rates of support compared to those who received Disability Living Allowance.\nNorthern Ireland's DfC said the most recent report received from the President of Appeal Tribunals on the standard of decision-making by the department showed decisions about PIP were correct in 96% of cases.\nThe DfC said it was \"not aware of any evidence to suggest there was a correlation between the number of people who had died before their tribunal hearing and the standard of the original assessment\".\nThe Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.\nFor more information on methodology, click here.

      "tags": "Companies,Money,Ofgem,Personal finance,UK economy",
      "text": "Hundreds of thousands of people are facing uncertainty over their household energy bills after the collapse of suppliers in recent days.\nCustomers are awaiting announcements by the regulator, Ofgem, about which surviving company will take on their supply and which tariff they must pay.\nMany will face the prospect of an annual bill hundreds of pounds higher than they had expected.\nAvro Energy and Green ceased trading on Wednesday, with others likely to fold. \nThose two firms were the latest to collapse, following a string of other failures of small providers in recent weeks.\nAvro and Green had 830,000 customers between them who are now waiting to be automatically switched to a new, potentially more expensive, provider.\nThey include Daniel Cooke, from Taunton, who said: \"I am deeply concerned as a young family of five how we are going to cope with what could be a huge rise in cost when we are allocated a new energy supplier.\n\"Where we have boxed clever for the last few years with Avro energy we are now going to be punished over the next few months running into winter.\n\"I know there are millions of people trying to balance the books. If the bills go up we'll have to find extra money.\"\nUnder Ofgem rules, any customer of a collapsed firm is moved automatically to a new supplier which it appoints. The new provider is required to honour any credit a customer has built up in their energy account. It pays for that through an industry-wide levy, which itself is likely to add to every customer's bill. \nThe new provider must also pay any credit that is owed to a customer who recently switched away, but has not yet been refunded their overpayments.\nThat process can take a few weeks, and customers are advised to wait until they are contacted by their new supplier before doing anything.\nWhile continuation of their supply is guaranteed, their tariff - in other words, the price they pay - is not. Customers of collapsed firms will be placed on a new dedicated tariff by their new supplier for those in the same position. It is likely to be priced in line with Ofgem's price cap.\nAn Avro customer in a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity, who got a fixed rate deal in August, would have been paying \u00a31,087 a year, according to price comparison site Uswitch. In March, they could have got a deal costing \u00a3920 a year.\nNow Avro has collapsed, they are likely to be paying \u00a31,277 a year at their new supplier from 1 October, in line with Ofgem's price cap.\nThe price cap does not mean it is impossible to pay more than \u00a31,277 a year. It is a cap on the price, not the final bill. So, a household with heavy energy use will have a higher annual bill.\nOnce switched to the new supplier, they are free to move to a different supplier. However, it is basically impossible to find a better deal at the moment as suppliers grapple with the rapidly increasing cost of wholesale gas.\nThe same problem faces customers of surviving energy firms who are coming to the end of their fixed rate term. When that expires, they are automatically shifted on the supplier's more expensive standard rate, which will be at the price cap level. They, too, will be unable to find a better deal at present.\nThere could also be complications for pre-payment meter customers who are automatically switched.\nPeter Smith, from National Energy Action, which lobbies for action for warm and dry homes, said: \"We are very concerned about legacy pre-payment customers, people in debt and those eligible for energy discounts who may miss out when they transfer over to their new suppliers. \n\"The government and Ofgem's key urgent priority must be to ensure vulnerable households are protected when their supplier fails.\"\nRead more about the next best steps to take here."

He described the situation at Heathrow as a \"human logjam\".\nOther arriving passengers said they were being held on board aircraft due to the problem.\nOfficials said the UK's border security was not affected.\nPassengers arriving at Heathrow endured lengthy queues over the summer as staff struggled to cope with Covid-19 documentation as well as passports and visas.\nThe Home Office, which has responsibility for Border Force, said earlier this month that the waiting times being endured by passengers were \"unacceptable\". \nIt said Border Force was \"rapidly reviewing its rosters and capacity and flexibly deploying our staff across the airport to improve waiting times\"."

      "text": "It could take more than a decade to clear the cancer-treatment backlog in England, a report suggests.\nResearch by the Institute for Public Policy Research estimated 19,500 people who should have been diagnosed had not been, because of missed referrals.\nIf hospitals could achieve a 5% increase in the number of treatments over pre-pandemic levels, it would take until 2033 to clear the backlog.\nBut if 15% more could be completed, backlogs could be cleared by next year.\nIncreasing activity levels would require more cash for new equipment and more staff, however.\nAnd all this is dependent on those who have not come forward for checks seeking help.\nBetween March 2020 and February 2021, the number of referrals to see a specialist dropped by nearly 370,000 on the year before, a fall of 15%.\nBehind these figures are thousands of people for whom it will now be too late to cure their cancer, the report, with the CF health consultancy, warns. \nAnd it estimates the proportion of cancers diagnosed while they are still highly curable - classed as stage one and two - has fallen from 44% before to pandemic to 41%.\nIPPR research fellow Dr Parth Patel said: \"The pandemic has severely disrupted cancer services in England, undoing years of progress in improving cancer survival rates.\n\"Now, the health service faces an enormous backlog of care, that threatens to disrupt services for well over a decade.\n\"We know every delay poses risks to patients' chances of survival.\n\"Clearing the cancer care backlog before the next general election looks unlikely with the way the NHS is currently resourced, staffed and organised.\""

      "text": "Stacey Stothard followed all the advice. Aware that energy prices were rising, she shopped around to find a decent fixed deal for her gas and electricity.\nShe saved \u00a3300 - or so she thought. \nHer new energy supplier went bust and now she will be switched automatically to another one, and she is facing much higher bills, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds more a year.\n\"It is just like watching the meter go up and up,\" she says. \"I did the right thing - not going for the cheapest deal, but choosing a company with a decent customer service record.\n\"I tried to protect myself from this turbulence. Now I've just had to order a lot of logs for the burner.\"\nShe is in a position already faced by hundreds of thousands of people, and which could also be the fate of many, many more homeowners and renters.\nMs Stothard's supplier was Dorset-based Utility Point which had 220,000 customers and was among four to have ceased trading in recent weeks.\nAt the beginning of 2021 there were 70 energy suppliers in the UK, but industry sources have said there may be as few as 10 left by the end of the year.\nCustomers, like Ms Stothard, of collapsed firms are automatically transferred to another supplier. At present, given the crisis, it is likely that they will go to one of the UK's biggest energy companies.\nTheir old deal is cancelled. When they are moved, the new supplier comes to an agreement with the regulator Ofgem about which tariff they will be placed on which, in all likelihood at the moment, will be more expensive. That is because the wholesale cost of gas has soared recently.\nThey can switch again to another supplier of their choice to find a better deal, but only after initial the transfer is complete. \nCustomers like Ms Stothard, who lives in Skipton, are seeing any decent deals disappear, leaving them without much of a choice. Some comparison sites have even suspended their service.\n\"In that time the nearest comparable deal has become significantly higher. I've been instructed that I must wait to hear from my new supplier. With each passing day, the energy prices are increasing,\" she says.\nThere is a backstop in place, called the energy price cap, which is set by the regulator Ofgem under government policy.\nThe energy cap is the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThat cap will rise from its current level on 1 October.\nEven though it is rising - a move that will affect an estimated 15 million people - it does mean suppliers cannot just charge customers as much as they like as their own costs rise.\nCurrent fixed rate deals for remaining suppliers must also be honoured.\nGeoff Ravenhall, from Rugby, faces paying a tariff at the price cap level. He switched away from British Gas, only to become a customer again after his supplier went bust.\n\"They are ridiculous prices. As people have less and less income, it is getting more expensive,\" he says.\n\"It will be a while before another supplier is brave enough to offer a competitive rate.\"\nThe vast majority of households pay their gas and electricity bills by direct debit. They pay the same amount each month, irrespective of how much energy they use.\nIn the summer, they tend to pay for more than they use, so their credit balance builds up. Their supplier temporarily holds onto the overpayments until the winter when monthly payments tend not to cover the extra energy being used in the colder, darker months.\nCustomers of firms which have collapsed at the end of the summer are worried that they might lose the credit which they have built up. The same is true among customers of firms on the brink, like John who contacted the BBC.\n\"I am about \u00a3500 in credit, I am concerned if they go bust and I lose my \u00a3500 credit,\" he says.\nA new supplier taking on customers of a collapsed firm will honour that credit, under Ofgem rules. The regulator, and Citizens Advice, recommend keeping evidence of statements and payments.\nBut that may become expensive for surviving suppliers taking on the burden of new customers, which is why the big energy companies are lobbying the government to provide financial support.\nRead more about the next best steps to take here"

      "tags": "Human rights,Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "The Taliban's notorious former head of religious police has said extreme punishments such as executions and amputations will resume in Afghanistan.\nMullah Nooruddin Turabi, now in charge of prisons, told AP News amputations were \"necessary for security\".\nHe said these punishments may not be meted out in public, as they were under previous Taliban rule in the 1990s.\nBut he dismissed outrage over their past public executions: \"No-one will tell us what our laws should be.\"\nSince taking power in Afghanistan on 15 August the Taliban have been promising a milder form of rule than in their previous tenure.\nBut there have already been several reports of human rights abuses carried out across the country.\nOn Thursday, Human Rights Watch warned that the Taliban in Herat were \"searching out high-profile women, denying women freedom of movement outside their homes [and] imposing compulsory dress codes\".\nAnd in August, Amnesty International said that Taliban fighters were behind the massacre of nine members of the persecuted Hazara minority.\nAmnesty's Secretary-General Agn\u00e8s Callamard said at the time that the \"cold-blooded brutality\" of the killings was \"a reminder of the Taliban's past record, and a horrifying indicator of what Taliban rule may bring\".\nDays before the Taliban took control of Kabul, a Taliban judge in Balkh, Haji Badruddin, told the BBC's Secunder Kermani that he supported the group's harsh and literal interpretation of Islamic religious law.\n\"In our Sharia it's clear, for those who have sex and are unmarried, whether it's a girl or a boy, the punishment is 100 lashes in public,\" Badruddin said. \"But for anyone who's married, they have to be stoned to death... For those who steal: if it's proved, then his hand should be cut off.\"\nThese hardline views are in tune with some ultra-conservative Afghans.\nHowever, the group are now balancing this desire to appeal to their conservative base with a need to form connections with the international community - and since coming into power, the Taliban have tried to present a more restrained image of themselves.\nTurabi, notorious for his harsh punishments for people caught listening to non-religious music or trimming their beards in the 1990s, told AP that although harsh forms of punishment would continue, the group would now allow televisions, mobile phones, photos and videos. \nTurabi - who is on a UN sanctions list for his past actions - said the Taliban's cabinet ministers were now discussing whether or not punishments should be public, and that they would \"develop a policy\".\nBack in the 1990s, executions were held in public in Kabul's sports stadium, or on the vast grounds of the Eid Gah mosque.\nAt the time Turabi was justice minister and head of the Ministry of Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice - the Taliban's religious police. \n\"Everyone criticised us for the punishments in the stadium, but we have never said anything about their laws and punishments,\" he said in the latest interview.\nEarlier this week, the Taliban also requested to speak at the UN General Assembly, which is being held in New York City.\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that while it was important to communicate with the Taliban, \"the UN General Assembly is not the appropriate venue for that\". \nThe US, which sits on the credentialing committee, also said it would not make a decision before the end of the summit next week."

      "tags": "Sarah Everard murder,Murder of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman,Kidbrooke,Metropolitan Police Service,London violence,Sabina Nessa murder,Long Reads",
      "text": "The safety of women as they go about their daily business has once again been thrust into the spotlight. And once again it's because a woman has been killed in apparently \"safe\" conditions.\nSabina Nessa, a 28-year-old primary school teacher, was on her way to meet a friend for a Friday evening drink. She set out on what should have been a five-minute walk through a well-used public park at about 20:30 BST and never reached her destination. She was discovered by a member of the public the following morning.\nSpeaking at a news conference in relation to Ms Nessa's death, Det Ch Supt Trevor Lawry from the Met Police said: \"The streets are safe for women - people should be free to walk around free from fear\".\nLater, a community group handed out information sheets printed from the Met's website, giving \"tips for staying safe on the street\". Women are told not to wear headphones. We are told to stick to busy places, to hide our valuables. We must walk where there is good lighting and pre-book our taxi home.\nSix months ago, Sarah Everard was abducted, raped and murdered by a stranger. She followed a number of the protocols with which women are often issued: she walked along a main road, at the relatively early hour of 21:00, wearing sensible clothes.\nAnd she trusted a police officer. One of the people we are told to seek out if we feel we are in danger.\nNine months before that, sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman were murdered by a stranger. The theory of \"safety in numbers\" did not save the sisters, who were together when they were stabbed multiple times in a public park. Staying in contact with partners via text and organising a cab to pick them up did not stop a man deciding to kill them in a so-called deal with a so-called devil.\nTheir friends found them in undergrowth two days later.\nAs Det Ch Supt Lawry says, of course women \"should\" be able to walk around free from fear. And of course the problem is with the men who murder them rather than the women wearing headphones. And of course women should not have to modify their behaviour in order to not be attacked or abducted or raped or killed. \nBut \"worrying about our safety is an integral part of our existence as women,\" said Kelly Grehan, a director of 50:50 Parliament, a cross-party campaign group promoting gender equality.\n\"It is drummed into us from a young age that our actions determine our safety: when we were only allowed to go in public toilets in pairs, given rape alarms at secondary school and told we were 'asking for it' or 'jailbait' when we tried to dress like the pop stars we idolised before some of us had even started menstruating.\"\nThe killings of Ms Nessa, Ms Everard, Ms Henry and Ms Smallman create an extra frisson of fear because their randomness indicates all women are at risk. If Ms Nessa arranged to meet her friend at a different bar or at a different time; if Ms Everard had left her friend's house 10 minutes earlier or later; if Ms Henry and Ms Smallman had chosen a different part of the park to have their picnic, it could have been different women facing the final few hours of their lives. It could be any woman - even if she had followed the rules.\nAcademic studies have examined the ways in which women and girls trade their freedom to feel safer. One of the largest studies conducted on sexual harassment in Europe found that almost half of the 42,000 women surveyed had restricted their freedom of movement based on the fear of gender-based violence.  \nProf Liz Kelly, the director of the child and woman abuse studies unit at London Metropolitan University, coined the term \"safety work\", to describe the strategies women develop in response to their experiences in public. Often done without thinking, these precautions become ingrained as habit, or \"common sense\". \nAnd we all do it. We all make sure we have a fully-charged phone and do that spikey weapon-grip with our door keys at the same time as checking nobody is following us inside. We text when we are \"home safe\" and wait up until we hear the same from our companions. This is normal. This is accepted. This is part of being a woman.\nThe tips offered by police and other organisations perpetuate the idea of safety work: take a longer route if it's busier and better lit; search for a Tube carriage with other women in; wear flat shoes for the walk home (in case you have to run).\nAs Prof Kelly says, the \"necessity of safety work steals our time and our energy - being vigilant means it is seldom possible to just be in public space, to feel joy in exercise or notice the changing seasons\".\nAfter Sarah Everard went missing, Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick tried to reassure women that incidences of abduction and murder were \"incredibly rare\". \nAnd it's true - women account for about a third of all murders and of those, only 13% are killed by a stranger. Most are victims of a partner or ex-partner. It is far more likely that we will be killed at home than in a park. \nSo it's a balancing act - women have to take the precautions society deems reasonable while also trying not to overreact to dangers we're told are uncommon enough to be negligible. \nDr Fiona Vera-Gray, an assistant professor at Durham University, uses the term \"the right amount of panic\". \n\"This won't ever happen to you. Except if it does, because for some of us it will, it will be your fault for not being scared enough. Don't panic enough and it's your fault, but panic too much and you're hysterical.\"\nAnna Birley, a co-founder of campaign group Reclaim These Streets, said: \"We often get told when the worst happens that the murder of a woman by a stranger in a public place is very rare and we are very safe. \n\"But the thing is, our lived experience of street harassment - cat-calling, a man exposing himself to us - tells us we're not safe, and murder is rarely the first crime someone commits.\n\"We shouldn't be looking to solutions that require women to change their behaviour.\n\"Women should be able to walk five minutes across a park at any time of day or night without fear of violence.\"\nIn an ideal world, everyone would live their lives unmolested. It would be safe to amble down dark alleys or across parks, whether sporting a diamond-encrusted miniskirt and platinum noise-cancelling headphones or a sackcloth boiler suit and an air of high alert.\nBut until we get to that utopia, if it is even achievable, is the advice offered by police and various safety charities actually something that protects women? If we disregard the hugely problematic narrative of victim-blaming, are they pragmatic - if unpalatable - tips that would keep us safe from stranger danger?\nThe deaths of Ms Nessa, Ms Everard, Ms Henry and Ms Smallman would suggest not.  \nThey followed the \"rules\" and still got murdered. Ms Everard's killer wasn't put off by a brightly-lit busy road and plenty of CCTV cameras. The man who murdered Ms Henry and Ms Smallman was untroubled by the women not being alone and defenceless.\nThe cases above are the high-profile ones. There will have been a strata of incidents in which women were attacked but not fatally. In which someone tried to pull or persuade them into a car but were shaken off. In which a man said something sexually aggressive that didn't lead to a physical assault but did leave the woman upset and frightened and angry.\nThe women affected would have stuck to the guidelines, would have done their safety work. Very few women actively decide to put themselves in situations they are repeatedly told are dangerous.\nA report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) was commissioned by Home Secretary Priti Patel after the murder of Ms Everard.\nIt was published the day Ms Nessa was killed.\nIt called for \"fundamental cross-system change\" after identifying continuing failings, and suggested tackling violence against women and girls should be \"as much of a priority as countering terrorism\".\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan said there should be a \"fully joined-up policy to address this issue, from school with boys being taught to respect girls; and proper healthy relationship education\". He urged the government to \"outlaw misogyny\" and \"make the harassment of women in a public place a criminal offence\".\nEven if all those policies were put into place tomorrow, how long would it take to see real change? Until we get to the point that the concept of a \"healthy relationship\" is the norm, not something to be taught squeezed in between double maths and lunch?\nWomen are not attacked because of our route home; we are not attacked because our walk was not \"purposeful\" enough, or because of what we were wearing. If a woman is murdered by a man she doesn't know, it is because he wanted to murder her. There is no other reason.\nSociety as a whole - and women as individuals - owes him no excuse. No matter how well-meant, perhaps safety hints for women run the risk of offering one. \nAnd in the words of Prof Kelly - what will it take to move the conversation from protecting women's safety to protecting their freedom?\nHave you been affected by this story?

      "tags": "China,Huawei,United States,Canada",
      "text": "A Chinese technology executive held in Canada on US fraud charges has left the country after a deal with prosecutors, following years of diplomatic tensions over her fate.\nMeng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei, was detained on fraud charges in December 2018 at the request of the US.\nOn Friday, the US Department of Justice dropped an extradition request for her.\nThe case infuriated China and strained relations with the US and Canada.\nIt also prompted accusations that China had detained Canadian citizens in retaliation, which China denied.\n\"My life has been turned upside down. It was a disruptive time for me,\" Ms Meng told reporters after being freed from Canadian detention.\n\"Every cloud has a silver lining,\" she continued, adding: \"I will never forget all the good wishes I received from people around the world.\" \nShortly afterwards she boarded an Air China flight bound for the Chinese city of Shenzhen, AFP news agency reports.  \nDetails of a possible deal for Ms Meng's release have been the subject of intense negotiations between US and Chinese diplomats.\nThe US alleged Ms Meng misled the bank HSBC over the true nature of Huawei's relationship with a company called Skycom, putting the bank at risk of violating US sanctions against Iran.\nOn Friday the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said it had reached a deferred prosecution agreement. \nThis means the DOJ would hold off from prosecuting Ms Meng until December 2022. If she complied with conditions set by court, the case would eventually be dropped.\nThe deal, which recommended she be released, allowed her to formally deny guilt for key charges while also acknowledging the allegations laid out by the Americans.\nLater on Friday, Canadian prosecutors told a court in Vancouver that they had withdrawn efforts to extradite her to the US and that she should be discharged from detention. \nShe had been under house arrest in her multimillion-dollar Vancouver home for nearly three years.\nAhead of the court appearance, Ms Meng was seen entering the building accompanied by Chinese consular officials. \nThe judge subsequently ordered that she go free.\nAs part of the deal, Ms Meng agreed to a \"statement of facts\" admitting that she knowingly made false statements to HSBC. \nThe DOJ said Ms Meng had \"taken responsibility for her principal role in perpetrating a scheme to defraud a global financial institution\". \nThe DOJ also said said it was continuing to prepare for trial against Huawei. \nFor months there have been extensive behind-the-scenes contacts, with senior Huawei executives sent to Washington by the company to try to resolve a case which has fuelled international tension. \nFor Huawei's boss, the issue has been deeply personal, with his daughter being held, but for the whole of China it has also turned into a major cause of anger. It has also poisoned relations between China and Canada, with the latter believing two of its citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, have been held as pawns in the negotiations. \nA deal has the ability to reduce some of the tensions that have emerged. But there will still be questions - what does the US gain out of it? And what kind of link might there be between events in North America and the status of the two Michaels in China?\nMs Meng is the elder daughter of billionaire Ren Zhengfei, who set up Huawei in 1987. The company is now the largest telecom equipment maker in the world.\nHe served in the Chinese army for nine years, until 1983, and is also a member of the Chinese Communist Party. \nHuawei has faced accusations that the Chinese authorities could use its equipment for espionage - allegations it denies. \nIn 2019, the US imposed sanctions on Huawei and placed it on an export blacklist, cutting it off from key technologies. \nThe UK, Sweden, Australia and Japan have also banned Huawei, while other countries including France and India have adopted measures stopping short of an outright ban. \nA few days after Ms Meng was arrested, China detained two Canadian citizens, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, on suspicion of spying. \nCritics have accused China of treating them as political bargaining chips, held as part of what is known as \"hostage diplomacy\". China denies this.\nLast month, a Chinese court convicted Michael Spavor, a businessman, of espionage and sentenced him to 11 years in prison. \nCanada condemned the sentence, saying his trial did not satisfy even the minimum standards required by international law. \nMs Meng's agreement with the US may pave the way for the two Canadians' release, but tensions in China-Canada relations will not quickly dissipate, experts say.\nThe bilateral relationship has plunged to historic lows since Meng's arrest.\nThe US charges against Huawei remain, and the company is still on a trade blacklist. Other Chinese tech companies with operations in the US, such as social media company TikTok, are also facing scrutiny.\nChinese tech sector analyst Rui Ma told the BBC that many Chinese companies were hopeful that Ms Meng's deal with the US might mean no further deterioration of US-China relations, \"but no one is taking it to mean that there is a reversal in tensions\".

      "text": "The head of Africa's health agency has warned that the UK's policy of not accepting Covid-19 vaccine certificates from the continent could increase vaccine hesitancy.\nDr John Nkengasong said the UK's stance was confusing and had far-reaching implications for vaccination campaigns. \nHe warned that some people would question why they should get a jab if it was not accepted internationally.\nMany Africans are furious, and have called the policy discriminatory.\nThere has also been an outcry in India, which produces most of the AstraZeneca vaccines distributed in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n\"We do not understand why the UK has taken this position\" said Dr Nkengasong, head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).\nHe told a news briefing it was \"a message that creates confusion within our population... creating more reticence, reluctance for people to receive vaccines\".\nHe also questioned why the UK was sending vaccines to Africa but would not recognise those who have had them as being vaccinated. \n\"This message doesn't really speak to solidarity and co-operation that we all believe are the cornerstone and ingredients for us to emerge from this pandemic together,\" he said.\nDr Richard Mihigo, from the World Health Organization's Africa region, said countries should now find a way of coming up with a mutual system that would recognise vaccine certificates from different countries. \nLast week the UK government removed several countries from its so-called \"red list\", from where travellers would need to quarantine if they visited England. \nHowever, it said those who had been vaccinated  in most countries outside the UK, EU and US would still need to quarantine because the UK would not accept the certificates. The other UK nations - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - set their own health policies.\nInitially, the UK refused to recognise the AstraZeneca vaccines produced in India, even though they are exactly the same as those made in Europe. On Wednesday, it said those vaccines were approved but it still does not accept the certificates from most countries.\nThe British High Commission in Kenya says it is working with the government there on a system to recognise each other's vaccine certificates.\nLess than 4% of people in Africa are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, compared to around 54% in the US and 65% in the UK.\nA shortage of vaccines is a problem in most African countries but in some, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Africa, vaccine hesitancy is a major issue and the government is trying to persuade more people to get jabs."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "text": "An 82-year-old climate change protester says she is prepared to go to prison for blocking motorways.\nJudy Bruce, from Swansea, is a member of the Insulate Britain group, which has blocked parts of the M25 five times in the last fortnight.\nShe said she had already spent three nights in custody but \"nothing has got the impact that disruption does\".\nEarlier this week police said the protests were putting drivers at a \"very high risk of death\".\nOn Thursday the UK government won a court ruling against Insulate Britain, which wants the installation of heat-saving measures in social housing by 2025, and all homes by 2030.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted the activists faced \"possible imprisonment if they flout\" an injunction.\nProtesters have also targeted other motorways, including the M11 near Stansted Airport in Essex, and the M3 in Surrey.\nMs Bruce said as well as well as sitting on the motorway she had been \"de-escalating\" by \"talking to angry drivers and explaining why we're doing it\".\nShe said: \"[I've been] trying to help people who are really stuck with an urgent appointment, trying to get them to ring an ambulance which will always get through.\"\nShe said she understood why they were angry, adding: \"If I was in a traffic jam, I'd be angry too.\n\"We've actually tried everything else... nothing has really got the impact that disruption does. \n\"We've got the notice of the whole country now and everybody is talking about it.\" \nWhen asked by BBC Radio Wales Breakfast if she was prepared to go to prison for protesting, she said: \"Well yes I am actually, and I've spent three evenings and into the early morning in police custody already - it is not very comfortable, I can tell you.\n\"But this is such a serious matter - I don't happen to have any children but other people are thinking of their grandchildren.\"\nShe said Prime Minister Boris Johnson was \"saying all the right things\" on climate change but \"not actually putting them into practice\", and called for the billions being spent on new roads and HS2 to be redirected to insulating homes. \nMr Johnson has said the COP26 summit in Glasgow will be the \"turning point for humanity\".\nThe civil court action was taken by National Highways, the government body which runs motorways.\nIn his High Court order, Mr Justice Lavender ruled it should last until 21 March, but there would be a hearing to review the situation on 5 October.\nThe order covers every part of the M25 and the Dartford Crossing, including slip roads and bridges, and states demonstrators are banned from \"causing damage to the surface of or to any apparatus on or around the M25 including but not limited to painting, damaging by fire, or affixing any item or structure thereto\".\nThe order means that breaching it could lead to a civil court hearing.\nIn a statement, Insulate Britain said it would continue its protests and \"as soon as the government makes a meaningful statement that we can trust, we will leave the motorway\".\nDuring the recent protests, the government said it was \"investing \u00a31.3bn this year alone to support people to install energy efficiency measures, and our upcoming Heat and Buildings Strategy will set out how we decarbonise the nation's homes in a way that is fair, practical and affordable\"."

      "title": "Gas crisis leaves Europe searching for solutions",
      "tags": "Spain,Norway,Italy,European Union,Natural gas,Electricity,Poland",
      "text": "A surge in gas prices has hit consumers and energy firms in the UK, with knock-on effects for the food industry and supplies of carbon dioxide.\nElsewhere in Europe, consumers are also facing a steep rise in energy bills, and governments are scrambling to help. The crisis has highlighted the difficulty for Europeans in funding the move to renewable energy. Here, five correspondents explain how different countries are responding.\nConsumers' bills have spiralled here in recent months, with the cost of electricity increasing 35% over the last year and nearly 8% in August alone.\nEnergy prices in Spain are closely tied to the wholesale gas market, so the price per megawatt hour for consumers has repeatedly hit new highs recently. \n\"I was paying about \u20ac40 (\u00a334) per month and now I'm paying around \u20ac60,\" said Amparo Vega, who has a newspaper kiosk in central Madrid.    \nEarlier this month, the coalition government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez unveiled a series of measures aimed at bringing bills back down. \nThey include tax cuts and a temporary reduction in extraordinary profits made by energy companies. The latter move has drawn criticism from the industry, although the government has clarified that renewable energy providers will be exempt.  \nThe government says its aim is to reduce electricity bills by over 20% by the end of the year. As winter approaches, consumers such as Ms Vega hope that happens.\n\"The outlook isn't very rosy,\" says Michele Fiorita, taking some air outside his shop in central Rome.\n\"My energy bills have gone up by about 15% but I've heard they'll rise by around 40% in the next few months.\"\nItaly is particularly exposed to gas price hikes: 40% of its energy comes from natural gas and around half of that is imported from Russia. \nSo lower Russian gas exports to Europe and an increase in the price of raw materials have hit hard. \nThe Italian government has already spent some \u20ac1.2bn to cut the increase in energy prices for households and this week pledged another \u20ac3bn to help further in the coming months. \nPrime Minister Mario Draghi says for the next three months \"system costs\" will be eliminated from gas and electricity bills. They're the tariffs added to bills to help fund the transition to renewable energy.\nIt's a short-term sticking plaster to help reduce the jump in energy prices for struggling households but removes an important financial incentive to help the switch to renewables. \nFundamentally, Italy will need to diversify its energy sources, moving away from its dependence on gas and more towards green energy. \"That's surely the future,\" says Michele, \"it's the only way to reduce costs in the long-term.\"\nAs soaring energy costs present huge personal difficulties for families, they also pose some tricky politics for Brussels. \nEU leaders have been busy pushing their sweeping climate plan to cut carbon emissions by 55% by 2030 - a drive known as \"Fit for 55\".\nIt's wide-ranging but includes proposals that, critics say, could lead to huge further price hikes.  \nEven backers of the measures quietly admit the transition to a greener economy inevitably, one way or another, hits people in the pocket. On the current crisis, the European Commission says that price rises are a combination of several factors, particularly the global surge in demand. \nIncreases in the price of CO2 permits under the EU's carbon pricing scheme are blamed for some of the rises, but the Commission says it's only a \"small percentage\". It wants to expand that scheme under \"Fit for 55\". \nBut with calls from the Spanish government for the energy crisis to be on the table at the next EU leaders' summit, Brussels is facing questions over what it can or will do to help. \nGuidance is being worked on in terms of the mitigation measures member states can individually take within EU rules. But there's no sign of any significant, centralised intervention. \nThe more the crisis heats up, the greater the backlash may be over the EU's climate plans. However, those in favour would argue that the faster the move to a green economy, the faster member states can escape this kind of volatility.  \nSurging European gas prices have been felt by Polish consumers because the country's energy regulator has approved three price hikes this year, raising bills by more than 20%.\nBut household gas bills are still regulated here, so customers are insulated from any sharp changes in market prices. Also, about half of Poland's gas demand is met by domestic production, which is typically cheaper than imported gas. \nThat cheaper, domestic gas is used to cover the needs of households first, while industry is mostly supplied with more expensive imports. But here again, energy-intensive Polish companies are shielded from sky-rocketing market prices because they have long-term supply contracts with a fixed price. \nIn Poland, coal is still the main fuel driving the economy, with gas a long way behind. That is starting to change. \nThe solar power market is one of the fastest growing in Europe and state-controlled power companies are planning huge investments in offshore wind. \nGas will become more important then, because the government sees natural gas as a bridging fuel to replace ageing coal plants and ensure the lights remain on when the wind drops under cloudy skies. \nIn Poland, the origin of the gas is a political issue. The government plans to cease its decades-old dependence on Russian gas next year and replace it with US and Norwegian gas, arguing it will no longer suffer Gazprom overcharging it for gas, because it can abuse its position as a monopoly supplier.\nPOLAND'S COAL: The vast European mine infuriating the neighbours\nNon-EU Norway is one of the biggest producers of oil and natural gas in Europe, though very little of it is used for its own needs.\nOnly 1.4% of electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels and waste, 5.8% by wind power and the remaining 92.9% is produced by hydroelectric power. \nNorway's Equinor energy company has agreed to allow a 2bn-cubic-metre increase in gas exports for the next year to support increased European and UK demand. Formerly known as Statoil, Equinor is two-thirds owned by the state. \nWhile bills are not as high as elsewhere in Europe, Norwegians are not immune from increasing energy prices.\n\"We currently pay 750 NOK (\u00a363) a month for energy and warm water, but in Oslo prices are relatively low,\" says Magnus, 26, who lives in a studio apartment in the capital with his girlfriend.\nThe couple are moving to a bigger flat in Bergen on the west coast and expect their bills to go up: \"When you live somewhere where fewer people are, then electricity is more expensive. That's why I'm thinking of just getting solar panels.\"\nFrom 1 October, Norway will be able to export electricity to the UK via a \"North Sea link\" of underwater high-voltage electric cables connecting the two power grids.\nThere have been concerns the recent UK price surge could spread to Norwegian households and industries. But one proposal to impose a tax on outgoing energy has been rejected, as Norway also needs to import energy in certain periods of the year."

      "tags": "Catalonia,Spain,Carles Puigdemont,Italy",
      "text": "An Italian court has ordered the ex-president of Spain's Catalonia region to be freed following his arrest in Sardinia, his lawyer said. \nCarles Puigdemont is free to leave the island but must return for a hearing in October. \nHe was arrested on a Spanish arrest warrant on Thursday. \nMr Puigdemont fled Catalonia after leading a breakaway independence vote in the region in 2017. He later became a member of the European Parliament. \nItalian police were waiting for the former Catalan president at Alghero airport in Sardinia on Thursday and he was taken to a nearby prison.\nHe travelled to the Italian island on Thursday for a Catalan folklore festival, his lawyer said, and was held overnight in Sassari prison, a short distance from the airport.\nSpain accuses him of sedition but his lawyers say the European arrest warrant is no longer valid. Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said \"it's clear that Carles Puigdemont must be brought to justice and stand trial\".\nHundreds of protesters rallied outside the Italian consulate in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia, on Friday morning demanding his release.\nThe 2017 breakaway referendum prompted Spain's deepest political crisis for decades, with the Catalan regional parliament declaring independence, and Madrid then imposing direct rule over the region.   \nAfter Mr Puigdemont and two ministerial colleagues fled, Spain jailed nine other Catalan leaders for sedition for their role in the breakaway vote. They were pardoned by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez in June.\nThe former Catalan president now lives in Belgium and his lawyers have successfully fought off a Spanish extradition bid in the past.\nCRISIS IN CATALONIA: A brief guide to Spain's regional crisis\nWhen he became an MEP in 2019, the Catalan ex-leader initially had immunity from prosecution but the Parliament voted to strip him of that last March. He appealed against the decision but in an initial ruling at the end of July the EU's general court said there was no immediate risk of arrest.\nThere are at least two questions facing the Italian judiciary: the validity of the Spanish extradition request, and the powers of Italian judges when the case is yet to receive a ruling by the EU's general court.\nSpanish authorities say the European arrest warrant was \"never deactivated\". And Mr Puigdemont's lawyers say that no court within the EU can execute a European arrest warrant until a final ruling has been made.\nThis arrest is awkward for Spain's leftist coalition government. \nAlthough the administration of Socialist Pedro S\u00e1nchez insisted that the Italian authorities' actions should be respected and that \"nobody can avoid justice\", this comes at a sensitive time. \nEarlier this month, Mr S\u00e1nchez resumed negotiations with the pro-independence Catalan government aimed at finding a solution to the longstanding territorial crisis. \nAlthough both sides in the talks are still extremely far apart, the Spanish government hopes that the process will eventually lead to a lasting solution in the north-eastern region. The government has already pardoned nine jailed independence leaders. \nMr Puigdemont embodies a relatively uncompromising strain of Catalan separatism, and his detention fuels claims by pro-independence Catalans that their leaders, and ideology, are being persecuted. It all inhibits the Spanish leader's attempts to calm tensions surrounding the Catalan issue. \nPrime Minister S\u00e1nchez said although Mr Puigdemont had fled while Spain was under another government, the current left-wing administration respected and stuck to judicial decisions.\nCatalonia's new president Pere Aragones - also a separatist - condemned the \"persecution\" of Mr Puigdemont.\nCatalonia is one of Spain's richest regions and already has a high degree of autonomy. But many Catalans feel they pay more to Madrid than they get back, and there are historical grievances too, in particular Catalonia's treatment under the dictatorship of General Franco."

      "tags": "BP,Fuel,Oil & Gas industry,Haulage",
      "text": "BP has warned it has had to \"temporarily\" close some of its petrol stations due to a shortage of lorry drivers.\nThe oil firm said only \"a handful\" of sites were affected by the fuel supply issues, which have led to a lack of unleaded and diesel fuel.\nThere are around 1,200 BP branded petrol stations around the UK, of which 300 are operated by BP themselves.\nThe company said it was working hard to address the issues.\nSupply chain delays had been \"impacted by industry wide driver shortages across the UK\" and that the company was working hard to address the issues, BP said in a statement.\n\"We continue to work with our haulier supplier to minimise disruption and to ensure efficient and effective deliveries,\" the company added.\nOther petrol station operators have been approached by the BBC for comment.\nEsso said that a \"small number\" of its 200 Tesco Alliance retail sites have been affected.\n\"We are working closely with all parties in our distribution network to optimise supplies and minimise any inconvenience to customers. We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience,\" a spokesperson from Esso added. \nHowever, supermarket Morrisons, which operates 338 petrol stations across the UK, said it was not seeing any similar issues at the moment. \nCo-op runs 130 petrol stations in the country, and said it has a \"full complement\" of fuel delivery drivers. \nTesco also said that they have a \"good availability of fuel\" and both Sainsbury's and Asda said there are no current issues in their fuel supplies. \nDowning Street has said people should continue buying fuel as normal.\nA spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was no shortage of fuel in the UK, adding: \"We obviously recognise the challenges faced by the industry and we're taking steps to support them.\"\nHe pointed to changes made by the Department for Transport to make it quicker for HGV drivers to get their licences and said that this is a problem several countries are facing.\nGrant Shapps also told the BBC's Question Time on Thursday that he believed the shortages had also been caused because of working conditions that \"hadn't been pleasant\" and that higher salaries offered to drivers was something the government was \"happy to see\".\nHe also said that improvements in the availability of tests were \"coming in prior to Christmas\u2026 so these are things that will resolve the issues in the lead up to Christmas\".\nThe temporary closures come just months after BP had to close a \"handful\" of its UK sites in July because of lorry driver shortages. At the time, BP said its supply chain issues had also been exacerbated by the closure of a distribution terminal due to staff being told to isolate.\nPaul Cheema has run a petrol station in Coventry since 2013, and says he's never experienced a situation like this before.\n\"We used to be able to put orders in for next day delivery. Now we have to do it a week in advance, but we're ordering blind. We don't know how much fuel we're going to sell in that time. If we'll have enough, or even too much,\" says Paul.\n\"Last week we put in an order for a delivery to arrive today. That was pushed back until tomorrow, and now we've been told it won't arrive until Saturday.\"\n\"So that means we won't have any unleaded petrol to sell tomorrow,\" he said.\nPaul says that fuel delivery delays have been happening all summer, but it's been particularly bad in the last couple of weeks. \n\"We're a petrol station. We should have availability 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I'm not blaming our fuel supplier. It's not their fault. It's the bigger driver shortage problem behind it.\"\nHe sells thousands of litres of unleaded every day, so the cost implications for him are huge.\n\"There could be a 40% impact on sales with this week's delivery problems. If I haven't got any liquid in the ground, I'm not making money. I can't operate the site at a loss.\"\n\"If I haven't got fuel to sell, that customer isn't coming into my petrol station shop either, so I'm losing money there too,\" says Paul.\nThe Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents petrol station operators across the UK, said that some sites across the UK were seeing delivery delays, but that they were largely confined to London and the South East, and were \"temporary by nature\".\nGordon Balmer from the PRA said that petrol station closures were rare, and that the fuel supply chain was resilient enough to cope.\n\"Fuel demand is still only at 92% of pre-pandemic levels so we believe there should be ample stock available at refineries and delivery terminals throughout the UK.\"\nMany businesses have been complaining about the UK's shortage of lorry drivers, which is still causing serious supply chain problems.\nThe coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and tax changes have all contributed to a lack of qualified drivers. Industry bodies estimate there is a shortfall of about 100,000 workers.\nLogistics UK, which represents the haulage industry, said it was \"aware of reports that petrol supplies are currently being affected\" by the lack of drivers.\n\"The driver shortage is a very serious issue that needs urgent government and industry action to resolve, however, we urge people not to panic buy; the logistics industry is resilient and has proven capable of supporting shops, families and businesses during Covid-19, border closures and the first stages of Brexit, and will continue to serve the needs of the nation,\" the industry body said."

      "tags": "Television,Doctor Who",
      "text": "Screenwriter Russell T Davies is to take charge again of Doctor Who, the sci-fi show he helped revive in 2005.\nDavies, who was the fantasy drama's showrunner until 2009, will take over when Chris Chibnall departs next year. \n\"I'm beyond excited to be back on my favourite show,\" said Davies, who resumes his role as the show prepares to mark its 60th anniversary in 2023.\nOne of his first responsibilities will be to decide who takes over the Tardis following Jodie Whittaker's exit.\nThe actress is set to hang up her Sonic Screwdriver after one more six-part series and three 2022 specials.\nIn a statement, however, Davies said it would be \"time-travelling too fast\" to speculate on what will happen when he returns.\n\"There's a whole series of Jodie Whittaker's brilliant Doctor for me to enjoy, with my friend and hero Chris Chibnall at the helm,\" he continued. \"I'm still a viewer for now.\"\nChibnall said it was \"monumentally exciting and fitting\" that Davies would be back in charge for the series' 60th birthday.\n\"Russell built the baton that is about to be handed back to him,\" the writer and producer continued.\nDavies revived Doctor Who in its current incarnation with Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor and remained for David Tennant's time as the Doctor.\nSteven Moffat took over when Matt Smith took on the role, staying to supervise Peter Capaldi's stint as TV's indefatigable Time Lord.\nThe success of Doctor Who's relaunch led Davies to create two spin-off shows, Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures.\nIt's nearly 18 years to the day since the BBC announced that Doctor Who was returning, more than a decade after it was axed. No Doctor or companion had yet been cast, but it was confirmed that Russell T Davies would be in charge of the show. At the time, the lifelong Doctor Who fan was best known as the writer of Queer As Folk (he even managed to briefly squeeze robot dog K9 into the series).\nFew predicted how huge it would become upon its return, and Davies is the man credited with much of that success. As showrunner he oversaw every creative aspect of the science fiction drama, wrote many of its scripts, and was an exceptionally hands-on executive producer - the book The Writer's Tale, a diary of daily emails and text messages between Davies and journalist Benjamin Cook. details the attention to detail he gave to almost every part of the show, from approving merchandise designs to overseeing the plans for media events.\nHis unexpected return to the show has delighted many, because if there is a recent golden era of Doctor Who, it's arguably when Davies was in charge, with the programme attracting huge viewing figures and racking up awards and critical acclaim.\nWith the exception of the Doctor Who TV movie with Paul McGann, Doctor Who has always been produced purely by the BBC. But from 2023 it will be a co-production with Bad Wolf. The production house was founded by Jane Tranter and Julie Gardner who worked alongside Davies during his time on Doctor Who. Tranter was the BBC's head of drama, Gardner was an executive producer on the show. Both are seen as less high profile, but still crucially important parts of Doctor Who's previous success.\nAfter leaving the show in 2009, Davies enjoyed more acclaim with TV dramas Years and Years, A Very English Scandal and It's A Sin.\nPiers Wenger, the BBC's director of drama, said the news of Davies' return would \"delight Doctor Who fans across the globe\".\n\"We are thrilled that Russell is returning to Doctor Who to build on the huge achievements of Chris and Jodie,\" he continued. \"Russell, it's wonderful to have you back.\"\nDavies' return was also welcomed by Bad Wolf, the production company founded in 2015 by former BBC executives Julie Gardner and Jane Tranter.\nGardner and Tranter both worked with Davies on the Doctor Who relaunch and will collaborate with him again when he returns as showrunner.\n\"We are delighted to be joining Russell T Davies on a looped ontological paradox,\" said the Bad Wolf Twitter account. \"Where Russell goes, we are proud to follow.\n\"With BBC Studios, Bad Wolf will be producing the all-new series of Doctor Who. It is a privilege to be asked to support him in Doctor Who's future.\"\nActor Matt Lucas, who played companion Nardole during Capaldi's time as the Doctor, was evidently delighted with the news.\n\"Russell T Davies back in the Tardis! What a coup! I'm buzzing!\" wrote the Bake Off presenter and Little Britain comic on Twitter.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Companies,Flexible working,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Employment,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland will follow England's example and lift its working from home guidance. \nPeople across the rest of the UK are still advised to work remotely wherever possible. \nFrom Monday 31 January, the government will no longer recommend home working wherever possible.\nInstead, employers are being asked to let workers return gradually. It wants workers to spend some time in the office and some time at home. \nA wholesale \"mass return\" to offices next week could risk pushing up infection levels, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on 19 January, Boris Johnson said that the government was no longer asking staff to work from home.\nHe said people \"should now speak to their employers about arrangements for returning to the office\". \nThe government had reintroduced its guidance to work remotely when it tightened Covid regulations on 8 December to help tackle the spread of Omicron. \nHowever, that guidance did also say that people should continue travelling to work if they needed \"to access equipment necessary for their role, or where their role must be completed in person\".  \nEmployers were also told to consider letting people come to work if they had a \"challenging home working environment\".\nIn Northern Ireland, ministers said that more people working from home would help to reduce the risk of infection both inside and outside the workplace. However, they didn't tell employers to impose home working, but instead asked them to support it \"where possible\".\nIn Wales, employers are also encouraged to let people work from home where possible. Guidance says staff should not be \"required or placed under pressure to return\" to the workplace unless there's a clear business need. Employers could be fined up to \u00a310,000 for failing to allow staff to work from home where it is \"reasonably practicable to do so\".\nFrom 28 January, the requirement to work from home moves from law to guidance. \nLatest figures suggest that 37% of working UK adults did at least some work from home in 2020, up from 27% the previous year.\nIn the last week of November 2021, seven in 10 travelled to work at least once. \nIn the same week, one in seven said they had been working at home and travelling to work.\nAlthough social distancing limits no longer apply across most UK workplaces businesses still have a legal duty to manage the risks to staff and customers. \nEmployers must follow official safety guidance and carry out Covid risk assessments for those staff who are in the office. \nSafety measures can include:\nFace-coverings remain mandatory for staff and customers in shops and on public transport across the UK, apart from England, where they will cease to be required in any public space on 27 January. \nRegular lateral flow testing remains widespread across the NHS and other parts of the public and private sector.\nNorthern Ireland, Wales and Scotland have already introduced Covid passport schemes which are partly designed to protect staff who work in hospitality and events. \nHowever, England will scrap its mandatory Covid certification scheme from Thursday 27 January, although venues will be able to keep checking customers' status on a voluntary basis if they wish. \nThere is more detailed advice for some industries - including construction, hospitality and manufacturing, plus specific advice for employers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIf employees feel unsafe, they can raise concerns with their local authority, Citizens Advice or the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). \nWorking from home is one of the most effective ways to reduce social exposure, according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). \nIt greatly limits face-to-face contact both with colleagues and on public transport.\nAs such, Sage says it has a \"strong impact\" against virus transmission and the R number, which represents a disease's ability to spread.\nMuch of the risk depends on how crowded it is and your distance from other people.\nWearing a mask helps, as does keeping windows open, and avoiding peak journey times where possible."

      "text": "The environment secretary has said the government is looking at different options on how to fix labour shortages in the food sector.\nGeorge Eustice said the government was considering whether changes could be made to the Seasonal Agricultural Workers' Scheme (SAWS).\nSAWS is a quota-based scheme that allows farmers to recruit overseas.\nTrade bodies have warned of panic-buying this Christmas unless action is taken to address the lack of staff.  \nThose shortages have been made worse by Covid and Brexit.\nMr Eustice acknowledged \"the reality that there is an acute labour shortage at the moment across the UK economy\".\nThe SAWS scheme saw 30,000 temporary workers admitted to the UK this year to fill vacancies in agriculture - mostly working on fruit and vegetable farms - helping with the picking and packing of produce. \nSpeaking on a visit to an agricultural show in Northern Ireland, Mr Eustice said there are \"some real concerns about how we'll deal with that spike in demand in the two weeks up to Christmas\".\n\"We have SAWS and we're looking at options as to how we can change the focus of that and we hope to be able to say something on this shortly,\" he continued. \nWhen asked if he would be looking at changes to visas to address workforce shortages, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday: \"If that was actually the solution, I'm sure we would move to it quickly and I don't rule out anything.\"\nThe National Farmers' Union (NFU) has called for another emergency visa to allow firms to recruit from outside the UK.\nEarlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he does \"not believe people will be short of food\" this autumn and winter, amid reports of some gaps on supermarket shelves.\nGovernment sources told the BBC discussions were ongoing to \"look at where the gaps are\".\nAsked if that meant action might be taken before Christmas they indicated \"realistically, yes, before Christmas\". \nEarlier this month, Mr Eustice said the government wanted to monitor whether workers who may be made redundant when the furlough schemes finish at the end of September could instead enter the labour market where there are shortages. Those include areas such as lorry driving or meat processing.\nHowever, he said if that did not happen \"then the beauty of a controlled immigration system is you can take steps to allow people to come in on temporary visas should you want\". \nNFU head Minette Batters wrote to the prime minister on Wednesday, warning that the food and farming sector is on a \"knife edge\" because of labour shortages across the entire supply chain.\nThe letter, signed on behalf of a number of food and drink trade bodies, called for the introduction of a Covid-19 recovery visa to open up new recruitment opportunities.\n\"Without it, more shelves will go empty and consumers will panic buy to try to get through the winter,\" Ms Batters wrote.\nReferring to an earlier NFU report, Ms Batters said that there were an estimated 500,000 unfilled vacancies in the industry.\nDue to the shortages, some farmers have resorted to giving fruit and vegetables away rather than let it rot in their fields."
