      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Healthcare,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A nurse who cared for Boris Johnson when he was in intensive care with Covid has quit the NHS and criticised the government's handling of the pandemic and nurses' pay.\nJenny McGee said she was \"taking a step back\" from the NHS after her \"toughest year\" in the job, but hoped to return.\nShe told a Channel 4 documentary that nurses were not getting \"the respect and now pay\" they deserve.\nThe government has recommended a 1% pay rise for NHS staff this year.\nMs McGee also told the programme, The Year Britain Stopped, that \"a lot of nurses\" felt the government \"hadn't led very effectively\" and that there had been \"indecisiveness\" and \"so many mixed messages\".\nShe said it had been \"very upsetting\".\nMs McGee, originally from New Zealand, now plans to work abroad and spend time in her home country.\nShe told the documentary: \"Yes, we have put ourselves on the line and we have worked so incredibly hard, and there's a lot of talk about how we're all heroes and all that sort of stuff.\n\"But at the same time, I'm just not sure if I can do it. I don't know how much more I've got to give to the NHS.\n\"We're not getting the respect and now pay that we deserve. I'm just sick of it. So I've handed in my resignation.\"\nShe gave the comments to the programme recently and a spokeswoman for the hospital confirmed she has now left.\nIn a statement released through Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, Ms McGee said: \"After the toughest year of my nursing career, I'm taking a step back from the NHS but hope to return in the future.\n\"I'm excited to start a nursing contract in the Caribbean, before a holiday back home in New Zealand later in the year.\n\"I'm so proud to have worked at St Thomas' Hospital and to have been part of such a fantastic team.\"\nMs McGee also told the documentary, being broadcast on 24 May, that Mr Johnson was surrounded by sick patients, \"some of whom were dying\", when he was admitted to hospital in April last year.   \n\"I remember seeing him and thinking he looked very, very unwell,\" she said. \"He was a different colour really.\"\nShe described it as a \"surreal\" time, and added that as Covid patients are complicated to look after, \"we just didn't know what was going to happen\". \nAfter his release from hospital, Mr Johnson gave a statement in which he praised Ms McGee and fellow nurse Luis Pitarma for staying by his bedside all night. \nShe was invited to Downing Street in July for a garden party to celebrate 72 years of the NHS. In the documentary, the nurse said she was asked to take part in the clap for carers alongside the prime minister. \nIt would have been a \"good photo opportunity\" but she said she wanted to \"stay out of it\", adding: \"Lots of nurses felt that the government hadn't led very effectively - the indecisiveness, so many mixed messages.\"\nDowning Street said in a statement: \"Our NHS staff have gone above and beyond over the past year and this government will do everything in our power to support them.\n\"We are extremely grateful for the care NHS staff have provided throughout the pandemic in particular.\"\nBut Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the nurse's decision to leave the NHS was a \"devastating indictment of Boris Johnson's approach to the people who put their lives on the line for him and our whole country\". \nPat Cullen, acting general secretary and chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said it was warning of \"an exodus\" from the profession. She said the government should \"demonstrate its respect by giving nurses a fair pay rise for the skilled work they do\". \nSara Gorton, head of health at the Unison union, said many more staff could quit \"unless the prime minister sees sense over pay\".

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There is \"nothing conclusive\" in the data that means England \"would have to deviate from the roadmap\" out of lockdown, Boris Johnson has said.\nThe government plans to end remaining legal limits on social contact from 21 June, but there is increasing concern about the Indian variant.\nThe situation, including data from hotspots such as Bolton, was \"under close review\", the prime minister said.\nMinisters will \"let people know in a few days' time\" after data is studied.\nSpeaking on a visit to a vaccination centre in London, Mr Johnson continued to urge people to be cautious.\nHe said the situation with the Indian variant was \"under very careful, close review\", saying: \"We're looking at all the data as it comes in from places like Bolton, Blackburn, Bedford, Sefton.\"\nMr Johnson said they were trying to understand if the Indian variant was more transmissible and \"to what extent our vaccine programme has sufficiently fortified us\".\n\"We've got a few more days of looking at that data,\" he said.\nIt comes as the UK recorded another seven deaths within 28 days of a positive test and 2,412 new cases. \nOn Monday the government said 86 local councils in England had five or more cases of the variant first discovered in India, which is thought to be more transmissible. \nIn Bolton, a new vaccine centre has opened up and ministers have been stepping up calls for people to book vaccinations as soon as they are offered appointments.\nElsewhere, regional public health directors are concerned about rising cases of the variant in London. Cases have spread across a number of boroughs, although currently most are linked to foreign travel. \nThe prime minister's official spokesman said that while the government was not ruling out measures such as local lockdowns at this stage, it was \"too early to speculate\" on what future measures it may need to take.\nAsked if a decision was expected sooner than 14 June on progressing to the final step of England's roadmap, the spokesman said that in relation to certification and social distancing, ministers \"do want to update pubs and businesses, if possible, before 14 June\".\nBut he added they needed to \"allow the experts to do their work\" and \"couldn't be more specific on timings\".\nDay by day the scientists are learning more about the Indian variant - and the implications for the UK.\nOn Friday it was reported the variant could be 50% more transmissible than the UK variant, which was responsible for the deadly winter wave.\nBut confidence in that figure was always a little shaky. In the past few days there are some tentative signs its advantage over the UK variant may not be so great.\nThat's important. There's estimated to be an eight-fold difference between the impact in terms of hospital admissions a variant with a 20% advantage will have compared to one with a 50% advantage.\nThat clearly has a major implication for what restrictions are needed while the vaccination programme continues to be rolled out.\nThe next significant update is expected on Thursday. It will be too soon for a definitive answer, but it should help us understand more about what the variant means for the UK.\nRead more from Nick\nThe government has already warned its next review of social distancing rules - set to take place by the end of May - may be delayed because of concern over the variant.\nOn Monday millions of people were able to enjoy new freedoms - such as drinking indoors in pubs, hugs with loved ones and foreign holidays - for the first time in months, under the latest relaxation of rules across England, Wales and most of Scotland.\nHowever, Labour has accused the government of \"giving out conflicting and confused advice\" about travel to countries on the amber travel list, where people must quarantine for up to 10 days on their return to the UK. \nGovernment guidance states people should not travel to amber list countries. \nBut earlier Environment Secretary George Eustice suggested in a BBC interview that people could travel to such destinations if they \"feel the need\" to visit family or friends. \nAsked about the issue, Mr Johnson said it was \"very important people grasp what the amber list is - not somewhere to go on holiday\".\nHe said travellers should only go to these countries for \"pressing family or business reasons\". Those who break their self-isolation period on returning to the UK from these destinations face \u00a310,000 fines, he added. \nYvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said the current traffic light system was \"very messy\" and \"clearly isn't working\", adding that it should be linked to legal restrictions. \n\"We all seem to be in a position where the government has opened up to summer holiday travel by accident, by making it possible, but at the same time, a day later, saying 'no, people should not be travelling to amber countries,'\" the Labour MP told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme.\nMeanwhile, Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, which developed the AstraZeneca vaccine, has said it feels \"morally wrong\" that children in some richer countries are being offered a Covid-19 jab before some high-risk people in poorer countries.\nHe told the All Party Parliamentary Group on coronavirus: \"There are many unvaccinated people in the world whilst people whose risk is extremely low are being vaccinated, including children who have near to zero the risk of severe disease or death.\n\"That inequity is absolutely plain to see at this moment in a very troubling way.\""

      "tags": "Social media,Ofcom,Pornography",
      "text": "Campaigners are \"astonished\" that the government's draft Online Safety Bill does not contain long-promised age verification checks for pornography.\nCompanies have invested heavily in the technology in recent years to prepare for legally-required checks.\nBut an earlier law requiring them was never enforced.\nThe government says the new bill will focus on online platforms where children are more likely to find pornography by chance.\nThis includes social media, but the law may not apply to many commercial adult sites because the current draft only covers websites containing user-generated content. \n\"I was completely astonished when I saw the bill,\" said John Carr, Secretary of the Children's Charities' Coalition on Internet Safety.\n\"Pornhub, xHamster, all of the big commercial pornography sites - the largest single source of pornography in the world - are outside the scope of the bill or could easily put themselves outside of the scope of the bill.\".\nThey could do so by easily removing all user-uploaded content, he said - as Pornhub recently did within days of an investigation being launched into its user-generated content.\n\"They could do that and it would not affect their core business model in any way, shape or form,\" Mr Carr said. \nProposals to make all UK pornography users confirm their age before accessing explicit content was first mooted in 2016.\nIt was made law in the 2017 Digital Economy Act - but that was never brought into force after repeated delays, and fears it would not work.  \nIt was officially dropped in 2019, but the government pledged \"other measures\" would achieve the same results.\nCulture Secretary Oliver Dowden told a meeting of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee that the Online Safety Bill was designed to deal with social media sites, where he believed the biggest risk with pornography was \"kids stumbling across it\". \nHe also suggested that most commercial porn sites \"do have user-generated content on them, so most of them will be in scope\". \nBut he left the door open to firm up the rules.\n\"I don't have a closed mind on this. If we could find a commensurate way of providing wider protection for children within it... I think there is a strong case for doing that,\" Mr Dowden said. \n\"Companies hosting user-generated content, video-sharing or live-streaming will need to prove to an independent regulator they can stop children accessing harmful content,\" a spokeswoman for DCMS said. \n\"Our new laws will therefore go further than the Digital Economy Act,\" she added.\nJohn Carr said there were \"two scurrilous rumours\" circulating about the omission; that either it was a tactical move by the government, or that the authorities simply did not want to enforce it.\nBut Baroness Floella Benjamin, a House of Lords member who has campaigned on issues around pornography, said she believes parliamentary review will \"add back the essential elements\" of the older law.\n\"It was obvious that adult sites would simply drop interactive functionality to evade age verification,\" she said. \n\"The elephant in the room is what happens to protect children over the next three to four years,\" she warned, because of the time it would take to develop and implement the rules. \n\"A seven-year-old will be a teenager before this new law comes into force,\" she said.\nThe Support Network for Adult Professionals - the UK adult industry body - said it had also been expecting the new law to cover age verification.\n\"We still think in time that it will happen. We believe Brexit and Covid made the government put it to one side,\" the group said.\nAfter the years of back-and-forth, most companies have been set up to handle it - \"but we think that some businesses are pleased it's not in yet,\" it added.\nThe Age Verification Providers Association, which represents firms providing the technology, said it interpreted Mr Dowden's comments as having \"agreed to accept an amendment... to extend it to commercial pornographic websites\". \nIt also said that the Online Safety Bill has greater commitments to privacy, which would benefit age verification systems.\nCo-chair Alastair Graham said: \"It is great to see within the new bill a clear legal duty for data security. We can protect children from harmful or age-inappropriate content online, while not interfering with the privacy and freedoms of adults.\"\nMindgeek - the parent company behind Pornhub and many other adult websites - warned that \"internet regulation is a difficult task that must balance user privacy with judicious enforcement\".\n\"The challenge of age verification requires a global solution in order to ensure child protection laws are met, while avoiding the pitfalls of invasion of privacy and haphazard implementation,\" it said."

many businesses and some Conservative MPs are desperate the final shackles on our liberties are thrown off, on time. \nOne former minister, Conor Burns, said the country had tolerated \"the most profound curtailment of our freedoms in peacetime\" and \"it wouldn't be right to do so again\" because some people had refused the offer of a vaccine.\nProf Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College London, told BBC Radio 4 Today's programme that, so far, the evidence was that the vaccine was still effective against the Covid variant first found in India.\nHe said \"the messaging we're hearing\" is about getting people vaccinated, including those at-risk \"who for whatever reason they may have decided not to, it may have been very difficult for them for logistical reasons\".\n\"Now really is the time to reach as many of those people as we can in case we do have a little bit of a wave of infection now, and that will give them the best chance of getting protection,\" he said.\nOn Monday millions of people were able to enjoy new freedoms - such as indoor pints, hugs with loved ones and foreign holidays - for the first time in months, under the latest relaxation of rules across England, Wales and most of Scotland.\nBut amid concern over the variant first found in India the government has warned its next review of social distancing rules - set to take place by the end of May - may be delayed.\nAs part of its road map out of lockdown, the government's plan was to end all remaining restrictions on social contact by 21 June - which would mean unlimited numbers of guests at weddings, and venues such as nightclubs being allowed to reopen.\nMinisters are said to be considering contingency plans for local lockdowns if the variant cannot be brought under control, according to the Times newspaper.\nNHS England national medical director Stephen Powis said yesterday that there had been 930,000 appointments made since the vaccination programme was opened up to 38 and 39-year-olds, and he encouraged people to accept a jab when they are offered one.\n\"Getting vaccinated is the most important step we can take to protect ourselves, our families and our communities against Covid-19, so when it is your turn to get your first or second dose please do so,\" he said.\nA further 1,976 new infections were reported in the UK on Monday, and another five deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test."

      "text": "Dominic Cummings has claimed that government \"secrecy\" in its handling of the Covid crisis \"contributed greatly to the catastrophe\".\nThe prime minister's former adviser tweeted that its performance had been \"part disaster, part non-existent\".\nMr Cummings, who will appear before a committee of MPs next week, also called for more scrutiny of policy to ensure the Indian variant is dealt with.\nThe government said it was always guided by the \"best scientific data\".\nThis had \"allowed us to secure early development of vaccines\", a spokesman added.\nMore than 127,000 people diagnosed with coronavirus have died in the UK since the start of the pandemic, but 36.7 million people have now received a first vaccine dose.\nAccording to the government's \"roadmap\", the remaining restrictions on social contact in England are set to end on 21 June.\nIn a series of tweets Mr Cummings posted, apparently while in the waiting room for his first Covid jab, he attacked his former colleagues in government and the Civil Service (abbreviations he used have been turned into full words here).\nLooking back at the start of the pandemic last year, he wrote: \"One of the most fundamental and unarguable lessons of February to March is that secrecy contributed greatly to the catastrophe.\n\"Openness to scrutiny would have exposed government errors weeks earlier than happened.\"\nMr Cummings claimed he and the UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, had \"supported opening up\" the Sage committee - the scientists who advise ministers on handling emergencies - earlier to greater scrutiny.\nHe wrote that delaying the release of its minutes until late May last year had been due to a \"cultural hostility to openness\" in Whitehall.\nAnd \"human challenge\" trials, where individuals are deliberately infected with the the virus, should have begun as soon as it was detected in the UK, he added.\nThis could have meant \"jabs in arms\" by last summer, Mr Cummings argued.\nMr Cummings quit his government job after a Downing Street power struggle in the autumn, and has been critical of the government since his departure.\nHe is expected to express further thoughts when he appears before the Commons Health and Social Care Committee and Science and Technology Committee - holding a joint inquiry into \"lessons learnt\" about coronavirus - on 26 May.\nCovid restrictions eased in England, whose health policy is overseen by the UK government, on Monday, but there are concerns about the spread of the Indian variant.\nIt is feared this could be 50% more transmissable than the UK-originated strain involved in the deadly second wave of infections this winter, although this claim is still being investigated.\nMr Cummings urged MPs to push the government for details on how variants are to be tackled with vaccines, writing: \"The best hedge re: a variant escaping current vaccines is PUBLIC SCRUTINY of government plans.\n\"This will hopefully show it's been taken seriously. If not, better learn now that the government has screwed up again than when 'variant escapes' news breaks.\" \nHe also called for a review of contingency plans to prepare for \"more dangerous things than Covid\" in the future.\nOn a visit to a vaccination centre in London, Mr Johnson said there was \"nothing conclusive\" in the available data which might change plans to end restrictions on 21 June.\nBut information from Indian variant hotspots, including Bolton, and elsewhere was being analysed, meaning the situation would remain \"under close review\".\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said the government's \"approach to the pandemic throughout\" had been \"guided by the best scientific data\".\nThis had \"allowed us to secure early development of vaccines, allowing us to move through\" the easing of restrictions, he added.\nAsked about what Mr Cummings might tell MPs next week, the spokesman also said he would \"not speculate about what individuals may have and may or may not decide to present\".\nScotland and Wales, like England, eased Covid restrictions on Monday, while Northern Ireland is set to do so next Monday.\nThese changes will be subject to review."

      "text": "Some of the world's biggest firms have signed up to a campaign which aims to tackle prejudice towards disabled people in the business world. \nCompanies with combined sales of more than $8 trillion and 20 million staff, including Apple, BP and Coca-Cola have joined the Valuable 500 initiative.\nBut founder Caroline Casey said the campaign was not just about employing more people with disabilities.\nFirms are losing $13tn in sales by ignoring disabled consumers, she said.\nMs Casey told the BBC: \"As we move out of this pandemic and we need to recover, why would any business look at leaving $13trn on the table?\" \nShe told the BBC that in the UK one third of FTSE companies did not have a website that was \"acceptable to people with disabilities and their families. Why would you do that?\" \nValuable 500 was launched at the 2019 World Economic Forum Meeting in Davos, with a goal of getting 500 international companies to commit to putting disability inclusion on their board agenda.\nAt the time, it published research which said 56% of global company boards had never had a conversation about disability and this was \"leading to leaving disabilities on the sidelines of business\".\nAccording to figures released on Tuesday, there are no executives or senior managers at FTSE 100 companies who have disclosed a disability, and only 12% of firms report the number of their employees who are disclosed as disabled.\nThe figures also show the average representation of people with disabilities among staff reported by FTSE 100 firms is just 3.2%. \nOther companies which have joined the Valuable 500 initiative include Google, Deloitte, Nestle, Microsoft and Unilever. \nAll of them have have made a public commitment to advancing disability inclusion within their organisations, either among staff, customers or their supply chains.\n\"We have an inequality crisis facing the disability community which is just huge and it can't be resolved without business meeting meaningfully at the table,\" said Ms Casey. \nHowever, she stressed Valuable 500 was not just about recruiting. \"We're looking at driving systematic change in the business system [in terms of] customers and suppliers and talent.\" \n\"If you want to be able to have access to that market you need to have that talent in your business and I think when we speak about disability business inclusions we always speak about employment and we forget the huge, huge value of this market globally.\"\nOver the last year or so, Ms Casey said lockdown had helped show that the group's objectives were achievable. \n\"It's proved the business system can change, hasn't it? Look how quickly our systems had to change because they wanted to and we can't unknow what we now know. \n\"Our systems can flex and they can change and as we move out into recovery why would any business, an intelligent business leader, leave behind 15-20% of the global population. It would be madness absolute madness.\" "

      "text": "\"We run businesses, we can't go on holiday and then come home and self isolate for 10 days.\"\nLast year, Sandra Norman and her family spent nearly \u00a35,000 booking a package deal for a villa in Rhodes for the end of May 2021, to celebrate family birthdays. \nBut Greece is still an amber-rated country under the government's traffic light system and the advice is to not travel to amber countries for leisure.\nSandra asked the travel agent if they could move the booking to the same dates in 2022.\nShe says the company refused to move the booking or issue a credit note, so if they didn't go on the holiday then they stood to lose everything.\nBBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme has been contacted by people who booked holidays last year for summer 2021, or had holidays moved from 2020 by tour operators, who now feel they cannot travel due to government advice. \nHowever, the travel companies are refusing refunds or delays to the holidays.\nInternational travel restrictions for British holidaymakers were eased on Monday. 12 countries or territories have been given a green rating, meaning you can travel to them for tourism. But many tourist hotspots, such as France, Greece, Italy, Spain and Croatia, are amber countries. \nThe government's traffic light system is guidance rather than a legal requirement, and some travel companies have opted to still offer holidays to amber destinations if the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has not advised against all but essential travel.\nHowever, when you return from an amber country you have to self isolate at home for 10 days and take Covid-19 PCR tests on day two and day eight.\nFor Sandra and her family, it's not an option.\n\"My husband and son run a plumbing business, they have jobs booked in for the day we get back. I work, and we picked this time because the boys have an extra week off school. Now, when we come back they have to isolate, that's another week off school for the boys\".  \nThe company who Sandra booked through, Villa Plus, told You & Yours: \"Government advice on amber destinations is not legislation and whilst we empathise with those that may now choose not to travel due to the entry requirements they face upon return to the UK, we cannot provide them with a refund or credit for monies paid and they should seek compensation from their travel insurance provider.\"\nThe company has agreed to make an exception in Sandra Norman's case, and has now offered to move the flights to the same dates next year and to issue a voucher for the value of the villa, which they can use to rebook once 2022 dates become available. \nThe UK's largest tour operator, Tui, is currently offering holidays to amber countries such as Cuba, Barbados and Antigua, and to some Greek and Spanish islands. \nLauren Bower and her family are due to fly to Gran Canaria on 4 June with Tui. They booked their holiday last summer, expecting things would be back to normal by now. \n\"I've got a five and a seven year old, we haven't got the option to quarantine when we get back, obviously with school and with my husband's work and my work.\"\nThe Bower family checked with their travel insurance provider and were told that their holiday insurance would be invalid if they travelled to an amber country against government guidance. Tui can offer the family travel insurance, but it will mean paying twice. \nThe company is offering customers free changes to holiday bookings if they don't want to travel, but they will be required to pay any price difference for the new dates, which can be more expensive because demand is high.\nLauren says her family would rather have a refund as their options to rebook are limited, having to use most of their annual leave from work to cover childcare in the school holidays. \n\"We can't do that because the one week we get off together as a family, my mother-in-law is getting married, so to go on holiday next year is not an option. And the price of holidays for next year have gone up already. If we were to go in the six-week holidays it would be an extra \u00a32,200 on top of the price we've already paid.\"\nIn response to Lauren Bower's case, Tui said: \"We're sorry to hear that the Bower family will not be able to take their holiday to Gran Canaria as planned.\n\"We're offering as much choice and flexibility as possible; all customers due to depart before the end of August can change their holiday to another time for free before the end of October 2022. \n\"Unfortunately in line with our Tui Holiday Promise, their booking does not qualify for a refund or voucher. This would only happen if we have to cancel their booking for operational reasons, there's a change in FCDO travel advice, or their destination is on the red list prior to travel.\""

      "tags": "Bolton,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than 6,200 people were vaccinated in Bolton at the weekend amid concerns over the Indian Covid-19 variant. \nThe town has seen a sharp spike in infections since mid-April and the B.1.617.2 variant now makes up the majority of new cases.\nPrior to the push, about 10,000 people in the highest priority groups were yet to be vaccinated. \nDr Helen Wall, who is leading the town's vaccine rollout, said it had been \"emotional\" to see.\nShe said many who had been eligible for some time came for a jab over the last two days and she now hoped the programme had \"made a big dent\" in the list of outstanding eligible residents. \nBolton recorded 733 new cases of Covid-19 in the seven days to 11 May - the highest anywhere in the UK, the latest data shows. \nHowever, the rate of new cases among people in the town aged 60 and over is just 59.9, up from 35.3 a week earlier.\nBy contrast, the rate for those aged 10-19 in Bolton currently stands at 486.2 per 100,000, up sharply from 200.7 one week earlier, while for those aged 20-29 the rate has jumped from 147.9 to 310.\nThe efforts to get everyone eligible vaccinated saw long queues form at vaccination hubs.\nBBC presenter and comedian Paddy McGuinness shared a video of the queues in his \"strong\" hometown on social media.\nDespite the concerns over the Indian variant, the easing of lockdown rules has gone ahead as planned in England.\nThe easing allows people to socialise indoors in limited numbers, hug loved ones and visit pubs and restaurants inside.\nAlex McVey, who runs Odessa cafe in Bolton, said trade had been OK since reopening at 7:00 BST but, due to Covid measures, he had reduced the number of seats from 72 to 22. \n\"It has been a lot different this morning. It has taken ages and ages to get set up and everything in place,\" he said. \nMr McVey, who has been forced to make four members of staff redundant during the pandemic, said he was \"a little bit nervous\" about the reopening but remained hopeful. \nIn Bolton, a big push to get more people vaccinated is bearing fruit. \nHealth officials are targeting about 10,000 people who are eligible but have yet to come forward, but know that take-up of the vaccine in some parts of the town is lower than the national average.\nAnd they reject the charge that they are flouting the national rules on who can get a jab.\nIn February, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation - which sets the guidelines for the UK's vaccination roll-out - announced factors other than just health and age could be taken into account.\nSo deprivation, ethnicity and living in a multi-generational household with older, vulnerable relatives could mean that younger people are eligible.\nThis is not bending the rules, local leaders say. Rather, it is exactly what the rules are for. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said on Sunday that a local lockdown in Bolton had not been ruled out due to a rise in cases. \nHe added that the \"vast majority\" of locals who had been hospitalised in recent days had not taken up the offer of a vaccine.\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Dr Wall said the vaccination hubs were \"seeing people coming forward that clearly had the option to have the jab for some time - older people, disabled people - and they've chosen to come forward now\". \n\"I think in part that's because we brought this into the community as a trusted place, but also the things that are going on in Bolton are quite worrying for people,\" she said.\n\"I think that's given some push to people coming forward now for the vaccine.\"\nSurge testing has already begun in other areas of north-west England where cases involving the Indian variant are on the rise.\nThe \"variant of concern\" has also been detected in Blackburn, Lancashire, which neighbours Bolton, and in Sefton on Merseyside.\nBlackburn with Darwen's public health director said everyone over-18 should book a Covid vaccination in the area.\nBut the prime minister's official spokesman said local areas should not vaccinate young people earlier than planned to stem the spread of the Indian variant of coronavirus.\nHe told a Westminster briefing  the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation had said the best way to protect against the new variant was to ensure vulnerable groups got their second dose of the vaccine.\nDo you live in Bolton?

      "tags": "Peatlands,Wildlife,Nature,Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "The government has promised to \"halt the decline of nature\" as part of a new drive to improve the environment. \nMore trees are to be planted, the sale of peat will be banned and new targets will be set to return species such as wildcats and beavers to the countryside.\nThe measures include a legally binding 2030 target to address wildlife loss.\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice described the move as \"a huge step forward\".\nIn a speech from Delamere Forest, in Cheshire, he said: \"We hope that this will be the net zero equivalent for nature, spurring action of the scale required to address the biodiversity crisis.\" \nThe legally binding target will apply to England only, with devolved administrations able to set their own policy.\nWildlife groups have welcomed the proposals as \"an important milestone\".\nRichard Benwell, CEO of Wildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of 57 nature groups, said: \"If the legal detail is right, and the targets are comprehensive and science-based, then this could inspire the investment and action needed to protect and restore wildlife, after a century of decline.\"\nThe government has also set out new proposals to protect England's peatlands as part of a drive to achieve its goal of bringing greenhouse gas emissions to zero overall - known as net zero - by 2050.\nIt plans to ban sales of peat compost to gardeners in England by 2024 and provide funding to restore 35,000 hectares (86,000 acres) of degraded peatlands in the next four years, about 1% of the UK's total.\nHealthy peatlands play an important role in storing carbon - three times as much as forests. However, peatlands damaged by draining, planting with trees, or farming, start to leak carbon, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.\nOnly a fifth of the UK's 2.6 million hectares (6.4 million acres) of peat are in good condition. Estimates suggest the habitat - which ranges from upland moors to rich agricultural lowland - could give off as much as 23 million tonnes of carbon emissions a year.\nThe Wildlife Trusts' chief executive Craig Bennett said the government's initial target to restore 35,000 hectares of peatland was disappointing and called for a commitment to restore all upland peatland and at least a quarter of lowland peat.\nHe said: \"It's essential that we stop nature's decline and restore 30% of land and sea by 2030 - doing so will help wildlife fight back and enable repaired habitats to store carbon once more.\"\nThe Wildlife Trusts said it could be \"embarrassing\" for the UK - as hosts of the key climate summit in Glasgow in November - to allow carbon-rich peat to be \"dug up and sold\".  \n\"Peatland is so important for carbon sequestration and for wildlife. And, currently, we're wrapping it in plastic and selling it in garden centres,\" said Elliot Chapman-Jones.\nThe government also plans to treble tree planting rates in England to 7,000 hectares of new woodland a year by 2024. \nThere will also be funding to provide incentives for landowners and farmers to plant and manage trees, and at least three community forests will be created.\n\nThe plan to treble tree-planting rates in England by 2024 sounds like an awful lot, but it is starting from a very low level. \nWe've looked at previous tree planting pledges made by the various parties at the last general election. Tree planting is a devolved issue, so there are different policies across the UK.\nAt least three community forests will be created as part of the new England Trees Action Plan, but the government's UK-wide goal is for 30,000 hectares of trees to be planted annually by 2024.\nThat means most of the planting will still be of non-native trees on commercial conifer plantations in Scotland, which deliver fewer benefits for wildlife and biodiversity.\nThe government hopes to increase tree cover from 10% to 12% of total land area in England, and the aim is to increase the UK-wide figure to 17% by 2050 to help the country reach net zero carbon emissions. \nThe average tree cover across the rest of Europe is about 35% of land area. So, the UK target - and England's in particular - is actually quite modest.\nAbi Bunker, director of conservation and external affairs at the Woodland Trust, said the UK's woodland cover had nearly tripled since 1900, but much of the increase has been low diversity forestry plantations.\n\"Native woods and trees are fragmented, at risk from development, and too many are in poor condition, with half of UK wildlife and plant species that depend on woodland in decline,\" she said.\n\"Government's targets for new woodland should be met by integrating UK sourced and grown native trees into our landscapes, helping to deliver for nature and people.\" "

So we're watching that very carefully\n \"If there is a vaccine that gets that licence for use here in Wales, then I think we are very likely to want to take advantage of that,\" he said.\n\"It may be that you know later this year, even, we will be able to have a programme in our secondary schools offering those young people a vaccination which would make schools even safer than they are now.\"\nHe said it might allow \"us to lift some of the other restrictions that we have, wearing masks in classrooms all the time for example, which inevitably makes that learning experience less comfortable than it would otherwise be\".\nWelsh government guidance says face coverings should be worn where social distancing is not possible, \"including in the classroom by staff at primary schools, and by staff and learners in secondary schools\".\nIt comes as all over-18s in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan will have been offered the chance to have their first Covid vaccine by the end of May.\nCardiff and Vale University Health Board said it had arranged appointments for all adults by then.\nIt is two months ahead of the Welsh government's target of the end of July.\nMore than two million people have received their first Covid vaccine in Wales.\nIn Wales, 2,035,905 people have been given their first dose, 64.5% of the population.\nData published on Tuesday showed Scotland has given first doses to 55.7% of its population, England 54.5% and Northern Ireland 52.8%.\nWales is also beginning to reach younger adults, with 42% of 18-24 year olds vaccinated.\nThe UK government is responsible for buying the vaccines but only for rolling them out in England.\nMr Hancock told the Commons: \"I have been closely following the results of the clinical studies from Pfizer that show that the vaccine is safe and effective among children between the ages of 12 and 18. We have procured enough Pfizer to be able to offer that jab to children should that be clinically approved here.\""

An investigation is under way.\nThe 20-year-old building houses an electronics market and offices.\nIt stands in the heart of Shenzhen, a sprawling city of more than 12 million people known for its shopping and booming tech industry.\nFootage shared on social media showed hundreds of people running away from the skyscraper shortly after it was evacuated.\nChina's Global Times newspaper said the local government of Shenzhen's Futian district, where SEG Plaza is located, received reports of shaking from staff inside the building at 12:31 local time (05:31 GMT).\nBy 14:00, everyone inside the building had been evacuated, the newspaper reported.\nIn a later statement, the local government said a preliminary investigation found \"no cracks in the ground surrounding the building\" and no damage to \"pieces of outer wall\".\nCompleted in 2000, the SEG Plaza is the 104th-tallest building in China and the 212th-tallest in the world, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, an online database.\nShenzhen, which links Hong Kong to China's mainland, is at the cutting edge of technology and innovation in the country.

      "text": "The UN, US and UK have called for more protection for the civilians caught in intense violence between Israel and Palestinian militants.\nFootage of children being pulled from the rubble in Gaza and people running for shelter in Israel have sparked international alarm.\nThe conflict is now in its second week, with little sign of a ceasefire.\nMore than 212 people, including 61 children, have died in Gaza, and 10, including two children, in Israel.\nIsrael says most of those killed in Gaza are militants and that any civilian deaths are unintentional. \nHamas, the militant group that runs the territory, does not acknowledge this. \nSirens were sounding again on Monday night in Israel, with rockets incoming in the south and north, close to the Lebanese border. \nIsraeli leaders have also, again, vowed to keep up their campaign. \nThere is mounting international concern over the violence, with world leaders and humanitarian organisations urging for measures to be taken to avoid residents being hurt, killed, or having their lives upended by the destruction. \nIn the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said Israel must avoid civilian causalities, but expressed concern that \"Hamas is again using civilian infrastructure and populations as cover for its operations\".\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged both sides to protect civilians, especially children, while reiterating that Israel \"as a democracy has an extra burden\" to do so. \nThe United Nations has also expressed concerns about the damage to infrastructure in the already impoverished Gaza Strip, home to two million people. It said that 40 schools and four hospitals had been \"completely or partially destroyed\" in recent days. It also warned that fuel supplies there were running out, threatening basic services. \nThe World Health Organization's emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, said all attacks on healthcare needed to stop immediately.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for an end to the fighting, while speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nHowever, she reaffirmed Israel's right to defend itself against the attacks, according to her spokesman. \nFrance and Egypt are among the other nations calling for an immediate ceasefire. \nThe outbreak in violence began after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem that culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas, which controls Gaza, began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes.\nBy Paul Adams, BBC diplomatic correspondent, Jerusalem\nIsrael is not done in Gaza. There is every sign that its military strikes will continue for some time.\nOfficials describe a phased series of attacks, with the overall aim of destroying as much of Hamas's infrastructure and manpower as possible in the time available.\nAnd how much time is available? Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last night that \"the violence must end immediately\".\nBut President Joe Biden has so far backed Mr Netanyahu, saying Israel has the right to defend itself. And the US has - for the third time - blocked efforts at the UN Security Council to issue a statement calling on Israel to stop.\nMr Netanyahu knows that he still has time to achieve more in Gaza, provided Israel can avoid killing too many more civilians.\nAs many as 40,000 civilians have been forced from their homes and the UN is warning of a worsening humanitarian situation. The clock is ticking.\nIn the early hours of Monday, Israel conducted dozens more air strikes on the Gaza Strip, after Palestinian militants fired barrages of rockets at southern Israeli cities. \nA teacher from Gaza told the BBC that life there is \"extremely frightening\".\n\"The first thing we do is gather together as a family and find the safest place, but there's no safe place when there's an air strike,\" said Hanan, 26. \"We gather together and my mother says all the time, 'if we're going to die let us die together'.\"\nThe Israeli military said it struck 35 \"terror targets\" and destroyed more than 15km (nine miles) of an underground tunnel network belonging to Hamas.\nIsrael said a senior commander of the separate Islamic Jihad group, Hussam Abu Harbeed, was killed in one of the strikes and later said it had also hit the headquarters of Hamas's internal security operations.\nPalestinian officials in Gaza, meanwhile, said the strikes had caused widespread power cuts and damaged hundreds of homes and other buildings. They have upped their overall injury toll to 1,400 people. \nIn southern Israel, one rocket hit an apartment building in the city of Ashdod and several people were reportedly hurt.\nAn Israeli tech executive and father of three, Eitan Singer, told the BBC: \"It is not easy - seven days in a row when we go to sleep and almost every evening, every night, we get the kids out of bed, run to shelters. We have 30 seconds to 60 seconds to find a shelter.\"\nIsrael said more than 3,000 rockets have been fired into the country over the past week and called this an unprecedented number. \nThe country's Iron Dome defence system is said to have intercepted 90% of the rockets. \nIsraeli emergency services have reported an overall total of 311 injuries, six of them severe. \nOne person has also died of wounds sustained during riots in Israel. Clashes between Arab and Jewish Israelis have left an additional 193 people injured, 10 seriously."

It is vital to our hopes of a better summer and of continuing progress against the virus. It has been central to the progress we have made.\n\"I would again urge everyone to get their first and second jabs when their turn comes. I am certainly looking forward to getting my second AstraZeneca jab in the coming weeks.\"\nUptake of the vaccine has been high in Northern Ireland, especially among older groups with 100% of those aged 80 and over having received it.\nIn the 70-79 age group about 96% have been inoculated while almost three-quarters (74.8%) of people aged 50 to 59 have received a jab.\nEarly booking for 30 to 39-year-olds opened this month and to date about 52% have had a vaccine.\nAlthough uptake has been high, it has slowed.\nIt is not clear whether this is to do with supplies or a reluctance among some people to get the vaccine."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nMinisters are stepping up calls for people to accept a coronavirus vaccination as soon as they are offered one, especially in Indian variant hotspots. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is urging people to \"look at... Bolton\" where he says most people in hospital had chosen not to have the jab. MP Yasmin Qureshi argues her area was slow to receive appropriate vaccine infrastructure.\nThe UK's unemployment rate fell to 4.8% in the three months to March, from 4.9% previously, amid \"early signs of recovery\" in the jobs market, the Office for National Statistics says. Its figures also show the number of workers on payrolls increased by 97,000 between March and April, although the total is still 772,000 fewer than before the pandemic.\nA number of UK universities are preparing to keep lectures online into the autumn term, it's emerged, with many anticipating a blend of online and in-person study. It will prompt more questions about fee refunds, with students calling the plans \"unacceptable\". \nA decision on whether key workers with \"long Covid\" should get compensation could take more than a year, government advisers say. More than 120,000 healthcare workers are thought to remain ill months after contracting coronavirus. Asad Khan tells us he's been off work for nearly six months with a number of debilitating symptoms, having treated patients using an \"abysmal\" level of personal protective equipment.\nThe easing of restrictions has paved the way for some emotional reunions. Front-line NHS worker Viv Hudson hadn't hugged her daughter, Theresa, for over a year. She describes how it felt.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nIf you're worried about not being able to go on your planned summer holiday, here are the rules around getting your money back.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Carbon capture and storage,COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change,Renewable energy",
      "text": "The International Energy Agency (IEA) says that no new fossil fuel boilers should be sold from 2025 if the world is to achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of this century.\nIt's one of 400 steps on the road to net-zero proposed by the agency in a special report.\nThe sale of new petrol and diesel cars around the world would end by 2035. \nThe IEA says that from now, there is no place for new coal, oil or gas exploration or supplies.\nThe report has been welcomed as an important contribution on the road to COP26 in Glasgow, when countries will attempt to agree the measures needed to put the Paris climate agreement into practice. \nIn that context, tackling the issue of how the world produces and consumes energy is the most critical endeavour.\nThe energy sector, according to the IEA, is the source of around 75% of the emissions of greenhouse gases that are driving up global temperatures. \nModels designed so they could switch to burn hydrogen could be an option - and will probably be around \u00a3100 more than the \u00a32,000 standard gas boiler.\nThis will help the climate because hydrogen from renewables burns with no emissions.\nBut climate advisors say it will probably only heat around 11% of homes, because hydrogen supply will be limited.\nSo most are expected to be warmed by heat pumps, which extract warmth from the air or the ground, or from water - a bit like a fridge operating in reverse which sell for between \u00a36,000 and \u00a318,000. \nThey're subsidised, but MPs say the government needs to offer more help to home owners. What's more, heat pumps need high levels of insulation which aren't always possible.\nThere are other technologies being considered. Geothermal heat may warm places such as Cornwall. Nuclear might figure, too.\nBut the great task of shifting heating from gas will be expensive and difficult. \nTo keep the world safe, scientists say that global heating has to be limited to 1.5C by the end of this century. \nTo keep close to that mark, emissions of warming gases need to drop by half by 2030, and essentially hit zero in 2050. \nThe IEA's new study sets out what it believes to be a realistic road map to achieve that aim, while at the same time creating millions of jobs and boosting economic growth. \nBy 2050 it envisions a global economy that is twice as big as today, with two billion extra people but with the demand for energy dropping by 8%.\nThe authors say their plan achieves this with no carbon offsets and a low reliance on technologies to remove carbon from the air. \nCrucially, it sees no place for new supplies of coal, oil or gas.\nHowever, the IEA's route to net-zero will require massive investments and international co-operation on an unprecedented scale. \nIt will also have direct impacts on consumers all over the world. \nHome heating with gas or oil is currently a major source of carbon emissions in many countries, responsible for around 20% of CO2 in the US and the UK.\nThe IEA path to net-zero says that in just four years' time, there should be no new fossil fuel boilers sold, except where they are compatible with hydrogen.\nThis will not be an easy shift for the building sector.\n\"It will be very difficult, because it means a massive turn in the consumption behaviour,\" said Maria Pastukhova, from the E3G environmental think tank. \n\"The building sector is maybe one of the toughest ones because aside from the emphasis that the IEA has put on efficient buildings, all the old existing infrastructure has to be retrofitted. And that's a particular challenge for governments.\"\nThe IEA says that as well as greening the energy system it will need to be expanded to provide electricity to the 785 million people in the world who have no access at present.\nTo meet this challenge the world will need to install four times the amount of wind and solar energy than it did in 2020. \nThis equates to adding a massive solar park every day over the next nine years.\nBy 2035 the report says there would be no more sales of new cars with petrol or diesel engines. All of the world's electricity would be emissions free by 2040. \nWhile the scale of the change is unprecedented, the IEA believes it will create around 14 million jobs by 2030, while investments in energy production soar to $5tn, boosting global GDP.\n\"The scale and speed of the efforts demanded by this critical and formidable goal - our best chance of tackling climate change and limiting global warming to 1.5C - make this perhaps the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced,\" said Fatih Birol, the IEA Executive Director. \n\"The IEA's pathway to this brighter future brings a historic surge in clean energy investment that creates millions of new jobs and lifts global economic growth. Moving the world on to that pathway requires strong and credible policy actions from governments, underpinned by much greater international co-operation.\" \nOne issue that has caused concern among environmentalists is the reliance in the report on unproven technologies, such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). \nThere are also worries about bioenergy which involves the use of trees, crops and plants to make liquid fuel or to generate electricity. \nThe IEA path to net-zero sees a significant increase of around 60% in this energy source, with an estimate that energy crops and forestry plantations will take up 25% more land than is used today for bioenergy production.\n\"Burning forests for energy is the latest in a parade of false climate solutions,\" said Hannah Mowat from Fern, a Brussels-based NGO campaigning to protect forests and people.\n\"Sadly, the IEA has bought into it by proposing wholly unrealistic levels of bioenergy, which will damage forests the world over and worsen climate change. Instead of burning trees for energy, we should focus on cutting fossil fuel use, maximising energy efficiency and increasing renewables such as solar, wind, heat pumps and geothermal.\"\nThe IEA Net Zero by 2050 report can be found here. \nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."

      "tags": "Environment",
      "text": "Older farmers in England will be paid to retire under a UK government scheme to bring new blood into the trade.\nThe average farmer could receive a lump sum payment of \u00a350,000 - capped at \u00a3100,000 for farmers with most land.\nIt is part of a massive overhaul of farm grants, incentivising farmers to protect the environment.\nSome older farmers are resistant to new \"green\" methods, Environment Secretary George Eustice believes, and he wants them to move on.\nNext steps in England's rural revolution unveiled\n\u2018Radical\u2019 changes to farming in post-Brexit plan\nUK farmers to need 'thousands of foreign workers'\nCurrently, under the old EU system, farmers receive grants based largely on the amount of land they farm.\nThe average farmer currently receives about \u00a321,000 in grants - although those who own large amounts of land, such as the Queen, have been receiving more than half a million pounds each year.\nFarmers in Wales are expected to be able to benefit from a similar scheme to the England plans announced by Mr Eustice. Plans in Scotland and Northern Ireland will be different.\nMr Eustice says the EU's grants system encourages some farmers \"to coast, to take no risks\" and hold on to their land in order to collect the subsidy.\nHence the need for help for older farmers to move on.\nAt the Oxford Farming Conference earlier this year, Mr Eustice said some veteran farmers were \"standing in the way of change\" and coasting along on state subsidies. \nHe said: \"I understand the burden of expectation that can exist to loyally continue the family tradition (of farming) and how this sometimes stands in the way of change.\"\nBut, he said: \"A fresh perspective can make a world of difference. New entrants are the lifeblood of any vibrant industry and farming is no exception.\"\nA spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), told BBC News: \"There's evidence that farmers who wish to leave farming can find it difficult to generate capital to do so.  \n\"So, a lump sum payment could help contribute to the costs of moving somewhere new or moving into an alternative sector.\"\nNearly four in 10 UK farmers are over the age of 65, with an average age of 59.\nThe Tenant Farmers' Association sought the views of 360 farmers and reported that three-quarters of them were seriously interested in the proposed retirement scheme, which is launched in a consultation today.\nThe organisation's chief executive, George Dunn, told BBC News he supported the plan for a lump sum for farmers based on the grants they would have received if they'd stayed in business.\nBut he warned: \"The government have got to make it easy enough for people to take up the scheme - not drown them in bureaucracy.\n\"The payments on their own won't be enough - but when you tie in other factors such as selling livestock, some farmers will want to take it up.\n\"For people on larger holdings, it won't be very attractive - but a lot of owner-occupiers might find it attractive.\"\nAt the launch of today's consultation, Mr Eustice explained: \"We need to address the twin challenges of helping new entrants fulfil their dream and gain access to land, while also helping an older generation retire with dignity.  \n\"Our exit scheme will offer farmers real incentive to confront what can often be a difficult decision and will help them clear bills and settle debts.\"\nA spokesperson for the National Farmers' Union (NFU) said: \"As our agricultural support is overhauled, farm businesses across the country will be making life-changing decisions about the future of their farm.\"\nThey added: \"We want to see a fair transition which allows farmers who are considering leaving the industry to have sufficient time and information to make those life-changing decisions.\"\nAbout \u00a33bn of state subsidy is paid to UK farmers each year, but this will be phased out. An estimated 61% of farm income comes from subsidy.\nUnder the new post-Brexit scheme, grants will be used to incentivise so-called \"public goods\", such as protecting water supplies; holding floodwater on land; capturing carbon in soil and trees, and increasing wildlife.\nThe government believes that younger farmers will be more open to new nature-friendly ideas and more inclined to seek income by diversifying into businesses such as camping or glamping.\nFollow Roger on Twitter."

But I move forward with the commitment that I wasn't going forward as first minister... if in the future members think it would work better with me as first minister, then we will have that discussion. But for this time, I don't have any interest or intent to do that.\"\nMr Poots also signalled he has no intention of collapsing Stormont over the Northern Ireland Protocol, which places a border in the Irish Sea. \nHe said Stormont is an asset in making the arguments against the protocol. \n\"It gives us authority to make arguments. It takes us right to the centre of government in the United Kingdom and I have made these arguments.\"\nHe said the arguments would be put forward forcibly and that legally, every course that can be taken to tackle the protocol will be taken. \n\"We will take every reasonable exercise that we can to ensure that we can inflict damage to the protocol,\" he said. \nMr Poots has said he is keen to ensure a smooth transition when Mrs Foster steps down. \nHe has been holding individual meetings with DUP assembly members, seeking their views before beginning any shake-up.\nHis plans are thought to include changing the ministerial team, as well as the DUP chairs and vice-chairs of Stormont's committees.\nHe also met Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis on Tuesday."

      "tags": "Plastic,Pollution,Environment",
      "text": "Just 20 companies are the source of more than half of all the single-use plastic items thrown away globally. \nThat's the conclusion of analysis of the corporate network behind plastic production. \nThe study looked at approximately 1,000 factories that make the raw materials needed for single-use products. \nPlastic bottles, food packages and bags are among billions of items that are used once and then thrown away, often ending up in the oceans.  \nThe research - carried out by a consortium including the London School of Economics - looked at which companies are at the base of the plastic supply chain and make polymers, the building blocks of all plastics.\nIt names 20 petrochemical companies which it says are the source of 55 per cent of the world's single-use plastic waste. The companies include ExxonMobil, Dow and Sinopec.\nThe study also assesses which countries generate most single-use plastic waste, based on per head of population. \nThe UK comes in fourth, with more than 40kg of plastic waste generated per person per year, the authors state, while Australia is top and the United States second.\nPart of the increase in demand for plastic stems from the need for masks and other protective and medical equipment to deal with the Covid crisis. \nPrevious research has focused on the impact of plastic waste on the natural world, or on the consumer companies making and selling consumer products packaged in plastic. \nBy contrast, this analysis tracks the flow of plastic through the supply chain, starting with the manufacturers of the basic ingredients that go into making single use items.\nThose ingredients, known as polymers, are mostly produced by processing fossil fuels including oil, gas and coal.\nThe research was led by Australia's Minderoo Foundation and a consortium including LSE, market researchers Wood Mackenzie and the Stockholm Environment Institute.\nUS-based ExxonMobil is the biggest producer of single-use plastic, the report says, followed by: Dow, Sinopec, Indorama Ventures, Saudi Aramco, PetroChina, LyondellBasell, Reliance Industries, Braskem, Alpek SA de CV, Borealis, Lotte Chemical, INEOS, Total, Jiangsu Hailun Petrochemical, Far Eastern New Century, Formosa Plastics Corporation, China Energy Investment Group, PTT and China Resources.\nAccording to the foundation's director of finance and transparency, Dominic Charles, the research highlights \"how the future of the plastic waste crisis is in the hands of just 20 companies\". \nHe says: \"It's an extraordinary point of leverage for regulators, for finance institutions, to influence them in order that rather than producing from fossil fuels, they produce plastic that's recycled.\"\nHe adds that until now the emphasis of efforts to curb plastic pollution has been on the individual choices that consumers can make. \n\"But we need to go after the tap, to turn off the tap of fossil fuel plastics and we need to create plastics from recycled material.\"\nThe report finds that plastic production is set to expand by 30% in the next five years, increasing carbon emissions as well as creating more plastic waste. \nOne of the contributors is Prof Sam Fankhauser, a specialist in climate change economics at the University of Oxford and the London School of Economics. \nHe observes: \"Our reliance on oil and gas is not only fuelling climate change, but as the primary material used in the production of throwaway plastics also devastating our oceans. \n\"It is critically important petrochemical companies move towards circular economy-based alternatives if we are going to successfully tackle these interlinked crises. \n\"The benefits on offer are transformative and hugely beneficial, not only for our environment and ecosystems but also the communities living with the realities of plastic pollution.\"\nThe world's largest producer of plastic polymers, ExxonMobil, says it shares society's concerns about plastic waste. \nIn a statement, it said: \"ExxonMobil is taking action to address plastic waste by increasing plastic recyclability, supporting improvements in plastic waste recovery - for example, through our founding membership in the Alliance to End Plastic Waste - and minimizing plastic pellet loss from our operations. \n\"We are also working on advanced recycling solutions that create and capture value from plastic waste with opportunities for lower overall greenhouse gas emissions over the full life cycle of the plastic.\"\nAnother large polymer producer, Ineos, was also asked for comment. \nAccording to its website, the company is working on ways to chemically recycle plastic, adding that \"the holy grail of plastic recycling is fast becoming a reality and will mean we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels to make our products\".\nIt comes as Greenpeace reported yesterday that plastic waste collected for recycling from British households had been found dumped in Turkey."

      "text": "An expert has joined calls for action on potential links between concussion and dementia in women's rugby.\nWillie Stewart, a consultant neuropathologist, said \"sex-specific\" guidance could reduce brain injury. \nIt comes after BBC Wales Investigates found a lack of knowledge meant players, coaches and officials were sometimes unaware of safety protocols.\nThe game's governing body, World Rugby, said it was \"committed\" to further research. \nProf Stewart, who works at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, leads an international team of scientists who study traumatic brain injury (TBI), including in former sports professionals, such as football players.\nHe said: \"Research published recently demonstrated that where the rules are comparable - such as in football or rugby - female athletes are about twice the risk of concussion that male athletes are, for reasons that aren't terribly clear.\"\nHe and others, including former players, are calling for fewer contact sessions in rugby training, due to the risk of a link between repeated concussions and dementia.\nBut are the messages about concussion getting through at grass roots level, and do they think more female-specific research is needed?\nMegan, 15, has been playing with West Swansea Hawks for seven months.\n\"You all know the risks when you join the game, but you've got to give girls a fair chance as well to have tests and us knowing what exactly is going to happen to us in future.\"\nOlivia, also 15, has played since primary school, and has played for the Hawks for the past three years.\n\"I actually had concussion myself, but obviously I don't know much about it. I was really well looked after, and I wasn't allowed to play for weeks afterwards.\n\"I think the women are hitting as much as the men, so they should do tests equally, and I think that would put people's minds at ease.\"\nMolly, 17, has studied concussion in sport as part of her Welsh Baccalaureate.\n\"There were big differences in female and male cases\u2026 it's still relatively early in the women's game compared to men, so now is the best time to start researching.\"\nProf Stewart told BBC Wales the current \"one size fits all\" approach to concussion was based almost exclusively on research in men, and that sex-specific recognition and management of concussion was needed urgently. \n\"None of what we're trying to do is to put people off sport, far from it\u2026 but what we're recognising is there is a specific risk related to head injury and head impact,\" he said.\n\"We don't want to lose players because they can't play because of brain injury or come back in forty years and find there's a bunch of players with dementia or other problems that we've done nothing to prevent.\"\nHe claimed that working with sports authorities and teachers in Scotland over the past five years had already delivered results with minimal funding, by working to the same concussion protocols.\nFormer Wasps and Wales international flanker Nic Evans agrees.\n\"We've been playing the same rugby now for years, we're nearly forty years in women's rugby, so we are also putting our bodies at the same risk, yet there is hardly any research on women,\" she said.\nWhile some small scale research at Swansea University has started to look at the impact of concussion on women, Evans feels more needs to be done.\n\"We have always historically been a second-class citizen in the game, but I think we are becoming more vocal - I think people are starting to listen to us more.\n\"I think people are realising this is deadly serious.\n\"We have to keep the game safe for everybody if we want to continue for our game to grow.\n\"What I want is world rugby\u2026 and the WRU to really consider research in the women's and girls' game and look at how can we make us safer.\" \nPrav Mathema, national medical manager at the Welsh Rugby Union, said: \"We are engaging in a global women's programme from an injury surveillance perspective and that's actually imminent and that'll be undertaken.\"\nA spokesman for World Rugby, which is responsible for the governance and rules of the game, said: \"While research does not demonstrate significant differences in concussion incidence and burden, World Rugby recognises the potential differences in concussion behaviour between men and women and earlier this year announced that women's rugby research would be prioritised within its annual research application call which has a heavy focus on women's rugby.\"\nWorld Rugby said it had also partnered with the University of Otago in New Zealand on research into head impacts on the community game, and was assisting with the Swansea University research.\nBBC Wales Investigates: Rugby - The Cost of Concussion is on the BBC iPlayer"

There are 343 local authorities in England.\nMr Hancock said the Indian variant was now the dominant strain of the virus in Bolton as well as Blackburn and Darwen and was rising in all age groups. \nHe said most people in hospital in those areas had been eligible for a vaccine but had chosen not to have it - and urged anyone not sure whether to get jabbed to \"look at what's happening in Bolton\".\nBedford was also fast becoming a hotspot for the variant, Mr Hancock said, and surge testing would begin there.\nScientists believe the Indian variant does spread more easily, but early data suggests vaccines still work. The exact impact on vaccine efficacy - if any - is yet to be confirmed.\nPeople aged 37 and over in England will be able to get the vaccine from Tuesday, he said - and the rollout would continue to be expanded later in the week.\nThe lockdown changes on Monday - which are different in England, Wales and Scotland - have seen thousands of people heading off on foreign holidays, flocking to bingo halls and drinking inside pubs again.\nPeople have also taken the chance to finally hug loved ones as the guidance on close contact were changed. Hospital ward manager Viv Hudson, 58, wept with joy as she finally hugged her daughter, Theresa Fox, for the first time in more than a year.\n\"It's a bit weird - but a good kind of weird. I've missed this so much,\" said Theresa, 38, who also works for the NHS.\n\"While we can take this step today, we must be humble in the face of this virus,\" said Mr Hancock.\nHe pointed out that fewer than 1,000 people were now in hospital with the virus - the first time this has happened since last September.\nLatest figures show another 1,976 cases have been recorded across the UK and a further five people have died.\nMeanwhile, the number of people who have received their first vaccine dose has topped 36.7 million, and more than 20.2 million second doses have been given.\nShould we be celebrating the easing of restrictions or worried by the continued spread of a new variant?\nThe big picture is we are in a much better place than the start of the year - when around 1.25 million people were estimated to have the virus and the NHS was feeling the pressure. \nNow there are fewer than 1,000 people in hospital with Covid - 97% lower than the peak. \nHowever, we are in a transitional phase as the burden of suppressing the virus is shifting from lockdowns to the vaccine. That process is not yet complete. \nIt means there is still the potential for a more transmissible variant to cause a spike in cases and people needing hospital treatment.\nThere is still uncertainty about how transmissible B1617.2 is and in turn how great a threat it poses. \nHowever, the planned easing in mid-June is already in significant doubt. \nThe government's plan was to end all remaining limits on social contact from 21 June - which would mean unlimited numbers of guests at weddings and nightclubs allowed to reopen.\nAhead of this happening, a review was set to happen by the end of May.\nBut earlier, the prime minister's official spokesman said: \"The Indian variant could pose a threat to this process - our decision will be based on latest data. We will set out plans as soon as the data allows.\"\nAsked whether ministers would consider a return to a tier system of rules, the spokesman said they did not want to talk about hypothetical situations but \"we don't want to rule anything out\"."

      "tags": "Spain,Morocco,Migration",
      "text": "Spain has deployed troops after record numbers of migrants entered its north African enclave of Ceuta from Morocco.\nSome 8,000 people have reached Ceuta in two days, Spanish officials say.\nThey say the migrants - who include about 1,500 minors - either swam around the border fences that jut out into the sea or walked across at low tide.\nSpain's Prime Minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez has vowed to restore order. Spain says around half of the migrants have been sent back to Morocco.\nBy Tuesday evening, footage of the beach showed that nearly all migrants had been cleared.\nMr S\u00e1nchez travelled to Ceuta and Melilla to deal with the crisis, which exacerbated diplomatic tensions with Morocco.\nMorocco withdrew its ambassador for consultations after Spain's foreign minister told the envoy of her \"disgust\" at what had happened.\nMost of the migrants are said to be from Morocco. The Spanish troops have been deployed to the beach to help border police at Ceuta's main entry point - Tarajal, on the enclave's south side. \nDramatic scenes were captured offshore as families waded through the water and officers from Spain's Guardia Civil went into the sea to rescue young children.\nInterior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said 200 troops, plus 200 extra police were going to assist Ceuta's normal 1,100-strong border force. The enclave has some 80,000 residents. \nBy evening reports said the number of people trying to enter by sea had decreased. Some migrants were voluntarily returning to Morocco while others could be seen being carried away by soldiers. \nSpain's Ceuta and Melilla enclaves have become magnets for African migrants trying to reach Europe.\nAlso on Tuesday, Moroccan security forces at Fnideq, the adjacent town to Ceuta, fired tear gas to disperse a large crowd of migrants at the border fence, AFP news agency reported. \nMr S\u00e1nchez has received support from senior EU officials, with European Council President Charles Michel tweeting: \"Spain's borders are the European Union's borders.\"\nEU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson described the number of arrivals in Ceuta as \"unprecedented\" and \"worrying\", noting that \"a big number of them [are] children\".\nAt the other enclave, Melilla, 86 sub-Saharan Africans entered on Tuesday via its southern jetty.\nMelilla has a formidable border fence, and several hundred more migrants were blocked by security forces, Spain's Efe news agency reports.\nSpanish officials quoted by Efe said Moroccan guards had helped the Spanish forces in Melilla. \nSpanish media said it was different in Ceuta, where Moroccan border guards stood by and watched as migrants took to the sea to try to reach the enclave.\nMost of the migrants were said to be young men, but there were also several families. Many had used inflatable rings and rubber dinghies. \nThey started arriving in Ceuta in the early hours of Monday. At least one died during the crossing.\nLast month, more than 100 migrants arrived at Ceuta's Tarajal entry point. Most were sent back, except about 30 minors whose ages were confirmed by medical tests.\nSince the 17th Century Ceuta and Melilla have been under Spanish rule, though they are long claimed by Morocco. They have semi-autonomous status, like some regions of mainland Spain.\nThe influx comes amid renewed tension over Western Sahara, a territory occupied by Spain until 1975, when Morocco annexed it. Since then it has been disputed between Morocco and the indigenous Sahrawi people, led by the Polisario Front.\nIn April, Spain allowed Sahrawi leader Brahim Ghali, 73, to be treated in hospital for Covid-19, reportedly in Logro\u00f1o. He leads the Polisario Front, fighting for Western Saharan sovereignty against the claims of Morocco. The Moroccan government responded angrily and warned Spain that harbouring Mr Ghali would bring \"consequences\".\nSpanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez said she was not aware of Morocco using the border issue to exert political pressure. But many see Monday's events, when Moroccan border guards appeared not to stop migrants from crossing, as evidence of a reprisal.\nSuch difficulties are likely to complicate the two neighbours' normally tight co-operation on the migrant issue. However, Spain says it has already repatriated about half of the migrants, following talks with Morocco. \nThe vast majority of those who reached Ceuta were Moroccan. Local police have clamped down on sub-Saharan migrants in northern Morocco in recent years, meaning they have sought other routes to Spain, such as across the Atlantic to the Canary Islands.\nThe EU border force Frontex reports that illegal migration to Spain's Canary Islands - off the Moroccan coast - has surged this year.\nHowever, the overall number of undocumented migrants reaching Europe so far this year remains far below the levels seen in 2015-2016.\nRead more on migrants reaching Spain:"

      "title": "Indian variant: Why is UK taking a risk with the variant?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A Covid variant first identified in India and spreading in parts of the UK, has threatened to derail Britain's plans for a return to normality. In allowing the latest lockdown easing, the government stands accused of recklessness. So why has it taken the risk?\nLast Thursday 39 of the country's leading scientists and health experts gathered - via video conference - to discuss the escalating situation. \nAt the Sage meeting they were presented with a paper by the government's modelling committee, that made alarming reading. \nThere was, the document said, a \"realistic possibility\" that the Indian variant was 50% more transmissible than the UK variant which had been responsible for the deadly winter wave.\nIf this was the case, the modellers said, there was the potential for a summer wave that would be even worse. It could not have been more alarming. \nOne of those present, Sir Jeremy Farrar, said they faced the \"hardest policy decision\" of the pandemic - but in the end moving ahead with the roadmap was a reasonable call considering the context.\nDig beneath the headlines and a more complex picture emerges than the 50% figure which grabbed headlines. The term \"realistic possibility\" is actually a defined phrase, one of several on a sliding scale used by these committees.\nIt means there is basically a 50:50 chance the modellers are right about the variant being as much as 50% more infectious. \nAlong with the modelling presented on Thursday, several other pieces of evidence were looked at. Public Health England (PHE) had been gathering data on what had been happening on the ground as part of the test-and-trace programme. It cast doubt on the 50% figure.\nA number of things did not add up to its analysts. \nSome of the data on \"secondary attack rates\" - the chances of an infected individual passing the virus on to someone - suggested the variant may be much less infectious than feared.\nAnd it did not seem to be behaving in the same way in every region. A significant cluster has been found in London, but that had not risen at the same speed as it had in Bolton. \nThe degree of extra transmissibility makes a big difference. A variant that is 20% more transmissible has a much smaller impact on hospital cases.\nThe sheer volume of imported cases from travellers returning from India - it was argued - could have caused a spike, and explain a big chunk of what appeared to be the extra infectiousness.\nOne of the problems in nailing how infectious a variant is, is the lag between getting a positive diagnosis from a patient and establishing which variant of the virus caused it. It takes about a week.\nSo the picture we are looking at is, in fact, out of date.\nAnother sign being analysed is the latest raw infection rates in hotspot areas - before samples are sequenced. There are now some tentative signs the rapid rises may have started slowing, offering support to the hope the 50% extra transmissibility figure is too high.\nWhat is more, some at the meeting believe the models were too pessimistic - suggesting the vaccination programme will stem the rise in infections or at least limit the scale of serious illness more than the modellers predicted.\n\"There is a huge degree of uncertainty with this - we have spotted this early and we are still trying to work out what exactly is going on with this variant,\" said one of those working on analysing it.\nNaturally with so much unknown, there was much debate both at Sage and in other meetings that took place on Friday, about how to respond. \nThe nuclear option of delaying indoor mixing, due to re-start on 17 May, was discussed. Doing so could buy more time to study the emerging data on the Indian variant, while allowing for more vaccine rollout. \nBut the government was already committed - it had been confirmed last Monday - and so it was ruled out, although in Scotland extra restrictions have stayed in place in Glasgow and Moray. \n\"It was agonising. There was just not enough evidence there to justify the move,\" said one of the people close to the decision-making. \"But keeping restrictions comes with a cost too.\"\nThere have been plenty of experts questioning whether Monday's unlocking was worth the risk, including members of Independent Sage and the British Medical Association.\nBut it is worth noting that these are the same critics who warned against the full re-opening of schools in March, saying it would lead to a surge. They also said the January lockdown was not tough enough to bring cases of the UK variant down and objected to delaying the gap between vaccine doses to 12 weeks with the BMA calling for the gap to halved.\n\"We know if it goes wrong the critics will say 'we told you so'. But... those people criticising now have been wrong before,\" another of those involved in the meetings last week said. \nThat, of course, is the price that comes with power - and if cases and, crucially, hospitalisations do take off it will look like a mistake. \nBut this is unlikely to be the last time the UK is faced with such a situation. \nMuch has been made, understandably, of the decision not to put India on the red list sooner. But this is not just a UK problem - the Indian variant has been found in 50 countries across the world, including Australia. \nYes, the UK has identified the most cases after India, but it does do nearly half the world's genomic sequencing. Another of the scientists who took part in the Sage meeting last week, Prof John Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, has said the spread of the variant could not have been stopped, only delayed \"a little bit\".\nProf Mark Woolhouse, an expert in infectious diseases, at Edinburgh University, agrees. \"This situation was entirely expected. In six months time I'm sure we will be talking about another variant,\" he says.\nHe is more worried about the South Africa variant given it seems more able to escape some of the effect of the vaccines - although the evidence is pointing to a rather more limited escape than was originally feared.\nVariants, unfortunately, will be a fact of life in this pandemic until the virus is brought under control across the world. But that does not mean there is no way out or that the UK, with its progress with vaccination, cannot keep moving towards a more normal way of life."

      "text": "Google has unveiled a tool that uses artificial intelligence to help spot skin, hair and nail conditions, based on images uploaded by patients.\nA trial of the \"dermatology assist tool\", unveiled at the tech giant's annual developer conference, Google IO, should launch later this year, it said.\nThe app has been awarded a CE mark for use as a medical tool in Europe.\nA cancer expert said AI advances could enable doctors to provide more tailored treatment to patients.\nThe AI can recognise 288 skin conditions but is not designed to be a substitute for medical diagnosis and treatment, the firm said.\nIt has taken three years to develop, and has been trained on a dataset of 65,000 images of diagnosed conditions, as well as millions of images showing marks people were concerned about, and thousands of pictures of healthy skin, in all shades and tones.\nAs well as using images, the app also requires patients to answer a series of questions online.\nIt is based on previous tools developed by Google for learning to spot the symptoms of certain cancers and tuberculosis.\nCurrently none of these tools is approved as an alternative to human diagnosis.\nGoogle says there are some 10 billion searches for skin, hair and nail issues on its search engine every year.\nDermatology Assist has not yet been given clearance by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the US, but a similar machine-learning model built by British firm Optellum was recently approved by the FDA for use as an assistant in the diagnosis of lung cancer.\nProfessor Tim Underwood, head of cancer sciences at the University of Southampton, said such tools had the potential to provide more tailored treatments to patients.\n\"The application of AI, both in cancer and in other areas of medicine, informs the conversation around what the diagnosis might be and what treatment to offer to an individual,\" he said.\nThis is not the first AI in healthcare, but it is significant for putting the tool in the hands of the public rather than doctors. \nGoogle views this AI as better than searching for the information yourself, rather than a substitute for medical advice. \nWhether people use it like that is another matter - we already know the internet is a source of both medical panic and false reassurance. How people might use the AI has fed into a design that aims to prioritise safety. \nMedical tools like this, yes even those with an AI at the helm, have to strike a balance. Do you focus on catching everyone who has a disease or on ruling out those who are healthy to avoid unnecessary worry or treatments? \nOne always comes at the cost of the other. \nThe doctors and developers involved told me the AI has been optimised to avoid missing \"alarming or scary\" conditions such as skin cancer. The flip side is some people will be advised to check out something that will turn out to be benign. "

      "text": "Police searching a cafe for a suspected victim of serial killer Fred West have found six voids in the building they want to excavate.\nMary Bastholm went missing in Gloucester in 1968 and officers have been searching the cellar of the premises where she used to work.\nSix parts of a toilet area are to be excavated, Gloucestershire Police said.\nThe force is in contact with West's son Stephen, who said his father admitted killing the 15-year-old.     \nOfficers were contacted on 7 May by a TV production company who were filming at The Clean Plate cafe in the city. \nWest, who took his own life in 1995 before he could stand trial for the murders of 12 women and girls, was a regular at the cafeteria, then called the Pop-In Cafe.\nInitial searches of the cellar had revealed what looked like blue material. Miss Bastholm was wearing a blue coat, blue and white dress and was carrying a blue bag on the day she went missing, the force said. \nDet Ch Insp John Turner said the excavations, due to begin on Wednesday, would reveal \"once and for all\" if the teenager's remains were buried there.\nThe deepest of the structural anomalies - thought to be voids or empty spaces in the building - is half a metre below the floor.\nEach will be dealt with \"carefully and painstakingly\" one at a time by archaeologists and anthropologists over the next two weeks, Det Ch Insp Turner said.\nHe said: \"My job as an investigator is to search for the truth and that's why we're here now, on behalf of Mary's family, to look in the basement and find out what is in there.\n\"I'm not saying that Mary is in there, what I am saying is, there was sufficient evidence from the production team to justify the search.\"\nHe dismissed media reports circulating on Monday evening that bones had been found as untrue and \"unhelpful and hurtful to Mary's family\".\nDet Ch Insp Turner said since West and his wife Rose were arrested in 1994, there had \"always been a story\" in Gloucester about a link between Miss Bastholm's disappearance and the cafe basement.\n\"The trouble is we [the police] have to pick out fact from fiction,\" he said.\nThere are no immediate plans to interview Rose West, who was convicted of 10 murders in November 1995 and is serving life, but officers have spoken to Stephen recently, Det Ch Insp Turner, said.\nIt \"could be a line of inquiry\" if any significant finds are made.\n\"His father did say he killed Mary, just before his death,\" he said.\n\"However, Fred told a lot of lies to police during the investigation and this is the problem we have - picking out fact from folklore and conspiracy theories.\"\nDet Ch Insp Turner said he had had lengthy discussions with Miss Bastholm's family in the past 24 hours.\n\"I cannot promise them what I am or am not going to find, but I have assured them I will do everything I can so that when we leave that basement, we will know for sure if Mary is or isn't there,\" he added."

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has voiced his support for a ceasefire after eight days of violence between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza.\nMr Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the US was working with Egypt and other countries on halting hostilities.\nBut the US again blocked a UN Security Council statement calling for a cessation of violence.\nThe conflict is now in its second week, with little sign of ending.\nIsrael conducted further air strikes on Gaza early on Tuesday. Its army said dozens of rockets were fired into its territory overnight.\nAt least 212 people, including almost 100 women and children, have been killed in Gaza, according to its health ministry. In Israel 10 people, including two children, have been killed, its medical service says.\nOn Tuesday Israel said at least 150 militants were among those killed in Gaza. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs the territory, does not give casualty figures for fighters.\nAccording to a White House statement on Monday, Mr Biden \"encouraged Israel to make every effort to ensure the protection of innocent civilians\".\n\"The two leaders discussed progress in Israel's military operations against Hamas and other terrorist groups in Gaza,\" it added.\nPresident Biden \"expressed his support for a ceasefire and discussed US engagement with Egypt and other partners towards that end\", it said. \nThe violence has prompted increasing concern internationally. \nWorld leaders and humanitarian organisations have called for measures to prevent the deaths of residents and the chaos wrought by the destruction of buildings and infrastructure. \nThe US - which is one of Israel's strongest allies - has once again blocked efforts at the UN Security Council to issue a statement calling on Israel to stop its military offensive, stressing instead its own diplomatic efforts.  \n\"Our calculation at this point is that having those conversations behind the scenes... is the most constructive approach we can take,\" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters.\nThe UN Security Council is due to hold its fourth emergency meeting on the violence on Tuesday.\nJoe Biden is a traditional pro-Israel Democrat. That's different from Donald Trump who actually changed US policy to adopt Israel's positions in its conflict with the Arabs. Biden has quietly begun to reverse some, although not all, of that.  \nBut when it comes to air wars with Palestinian militants, he is following a familiar pattern. All US administrations strongly support Israel's right to defend itself against rocket fire. \nAnalysts say in the initial phase they generally refrain from public criticism of Israeli air strikes, including at the United Nations, apparently allowing a window of time for Israel to take out militant leaders and infrastructure. However, if the conflict goes on and civilian deaths mount, sometimes they become more critical and start pressing Israel to wind down its military campaign. \nIn this case Hamas' firepower has been more sustained and intense than before. But President Biden has now publicly expressed support for a ceasefire in his call with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and discussed with him \"progress in Israel's military operations against Hamas.\" \nSo perhaps this is the beginning of new phase. \nThe United Nations has also expressed concerns about the damage to infrastructure in the already impoverished Gaza Strip, home to two million people. It said that 40 schools and four hospitals had been \"completely or partially destroyed\" in recent days. It also warned that fuel supplies there were running out, threatening basic services.\nThe World Health Organization's emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, said all attacks on healthcare needed to stop immediately.\nThe outbreak of violence began after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem that culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes.\nThe Israeli military conducted further air strikes on Tuesday and, shortly after dawn, two buildings in Gaza City were destroyed.\nA spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said another 15km (nine miles) of Hamas tunnels had been destroyed in the latest operation. \nThere were no immediate reports of casualties. \nSimilar strikes before dawn on Monday also damaged roads, power lines and houses. At least seven Palestinians were killed in the bombing.\nMohammad Abu Rayya, a paediatrician in Gaza, told the BBC of the devastation on the ground there. \"We don't have a morgue here big enough for the killed and the dead bodies,\" he said. \n\"We need at least 10 years more to build what has been damaged here in Gaza,\" he added.\nPalestinian militants fired rockets into Israel later on Tuesday morning. It set off warning sirens in cities in the south, sending people running for shelters.\nBut the rocket fire from Gaza appeared to be less frequent that in previous nights, according to a Reuters correspondent in the region.\nRockets were also fired at Israel from Lebanon, but the army said they did not reach its territory. The Israeli Air Force said it had shot down what it described as a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) that approached its border from Jordan.\nIsrael has vowed to continue its air strikes on Gaza. On Monday, it said more than 3,000 rockets had been fired into the country over the past week.\nThe country's Iron Dome defence system is said to have intercepted 90% of the rockets. Israeli emergency services have reported an overall total of 311 injuries, six of them severe.\nAn Israeli tech executive and father of three, Eitan Singer, told the BBC: \"It is not easy - seven days in a row when we go to sleep and almost every evening, every night, we get the kids out of bed, run to shelters. We have 30 seconds to 60 seconds to find a shelter.\""

      "tags": "Obesity,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There were more than a million hospital admissions for obesity-related treatment in England in the year leading into the global pandemic, figures reveal.\nThe record number provides the clearest indication yet of the scale of the obesity problem as coronavirus started to spread across the UK. \nBeing overweight is one of the most significant risk factors for severe Covid.\nExperts say the data should be a wake-up call for tackling obesity.\nThe figures, published by NHS Digital, show a 17% increase in hospital admissions where obesity was a factor, compared with the year before. \nThis amounts to almost 150,000 more instances of people being admitted to hospital over the course of a year.   \nThe number of admissions where obesity was recorded as the main cause actually fell to 10,780 last year, from 11,117 in 2018-19. \nBut this is mainly due to a fall in the number of bariatric surgeries (including gastric bands and bypasses) being performed. \nWomen accounted for two-thirds (64%) of admissions where obesity was a factor. \nNaveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine, at the University of Glasgow, says obesity is \"the strongest risk factor for [Type 2] diabetes\". \n\"It's a strong risk factor for heart disease, for heart failure, for lung disease, for kidney disease, for multiple other conditions,\" he says.\n\"If we now add to that obesity is a strong risk factor for this acute viral pandemic which is killing people worldwide, then... this is a wake-up call. \n\"Many health systems and government really do now need to pay attention to obesity.\n\"We do need to tackle obesity and we need to take it seriously.\"\n'They told me I could die'\nAt his heaviest, Phil Skeates weighed 25 stone (159kg). \nAnd when he developed coronavirus, last year, he ended up needing intensive care.\n\"It was horrible,\" Mr Skeates says. \n\"I was blue-lighted. \n\"As I was taken out of the house, I said goodbye to my wife.\n\"I was crying my eyes out in the ambulance.\n\"It was heartbreaking. \n\"My thoughts were I may not see her again.\n\"They'd actually told me if I caught Covid, there was every chance that I would die.\"\n\"On the ward, I saw two people pass away. \n\"It was a massive massive point. \n\"It really made me think I need to address this.\"\nPhil has now lost more than six stone. \n\"I paid the price,\" he says. \n\"I've come through it and I'm not going back.\"\nScientists are still trying to understand why the coronavirus poses such a risk to those significantly overweight.\nProf Sattar says there is some evidence heavier people have a higher viral load or more virus in their bodies than others and the virus triggers a dangerous response by the immune system.\n\"There may be a critical interaction between fat cells and the immune response which increases the likelihood of that immune response being exaggerated and harmful,\" he says.\n\"We also know that people who are heavier have thicker blood to begin with, and this hyper-response thickens the blood even more.\n\"So the likelihood is that this thickness will clot off blood vessels and block blood vessels.\n\"People who are overweight, effectively have less capacity to deal with the damage Covid causes.\"\nAnd for many people, the pandemic has led to weight gain, early evidence suggests.\nNHS England medical director Professor Stephen Powis said: \"Today's shocking figures are a growing sign of the nation's obesity crisis which is putting hundreds of thousands of people at greater risk of becoming severely ill with Covid, as well as heart attacks, stroke, cancer and other deadly diseases\".\nThis is a real concern, Susan Jebb, professor of diet and population, at Oxford University, says.\n\"People have gained 2-3kg but that is very unevenly spread - some people have gained much more,\" she says.\n\"And it seems to be a particular problem for women, for younger people and for those living in deprived areas.\"\nPressure is piling on the government to take radical action to address the obesity problem. \nLast month, doctors, academics, campaigners and public-sector experts wrote to the prime minister, urging him to stick to a landmark government proposal to ban junk-food advertising online and on social media - after fears it could be ditched.\nThe government says it has a clear plan to introduce a ban on junk-food adverts on television before 21:00.\nIt has now finished a consultation with industry and how far it is prepared to go with restrictions online will be revealed in the next few weeks.\nHave you needed hospital care for obesity?

      "text": "Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has said she hopes \"100%\" to go to a concert or outdoor performance this summer.\nThe minister has set up a Culture Recovery Taskforce to recommend measures for entertainment venues to reopen and performances to resume.\nSome plays, live music, performances and exhibitions resumed in England, Wales and Scotland on Monday.\nTheatres in NI have been given an indicative date of 21 June to reopen.\nBut it is not yet clear if live music can return on that date.\nLibraries, museums, galleries and cinemas are expected to open from Monday.\nArts, music, culture and heritage has been hit hard by the pandemic, with many venues closed to audiences since March 2020.\nIndoor entertainment venues in England, Wales and Scotland reopened on Monday.\nHowever, capacity is limited to 50%, or up to 1,000 people at most.\nSocial distancing and face masks are still needed but \"Covid passports\" or proof of a negative test are not required to enter a venue in England.\nMs Hargey told BBC News NI the 25-strong taskforce would consider how venues in Northern Ireland could open safely to audiences from 21 June.\n\"We wanted to give that date so that it's something to work towards,\" she said.\n\"What I would like to see the task force do is how then we can open on 21 June safely.\n\"There are a number of pilots that are taking place in England, we're obviously getting information on that via the SAGE committee which the health minister and the chief medical officer sit on.\n\"We'll be monitoring those closely, and I want all of that to go through this taskforce.\n\"But also to look at the local knowledge and expertise here, people who run events, people who organise safety around key events in planning for coming into the summer season.\n\"But doing that in a safe way that keeps the opening long-term and sustainable.\"\nThe taskforce includes those who run festivals, music, theatre and arts venues and organisations.\nMs Hargey said she also wanted to see live music resume \"as quickly and as safely as possible\".\n\"I want to get venues a bit of normality back,\" Ms Hargey said.\n\"We have obviously eased a good bit of restrictions around outdoor events and indoor events from next Monday.\n\"We want to build on that then to aim for 21 June to make sure that we can do that quickly and also as safely as possible.\"\nHowever, the minister also said that if some restrictions on performances or audiences remained there would need to be further financial support for venues and those working in the sector.\nMs Hargey was asked by BBC News NI if she expected to be able to go to a concert or performance this summer.\n\"I would hope to go to some type of concert or outdoor venue, 100%,\" she replied.\n\"I do hope through the taskforce and the work that we'll be doing with the executive that we can see that ray of sunshine over the summer season, and particularly during festival season.\"\nThe chairwoman of the taskforce, Rotha Johnston, said its purpose was both \"recovery and re-opening in the short-term\".\n\"I think what the taskforce will want to look at are the measures that have been put in place for live performances across the water in England,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\"What can we learn from those measures and can they be applied safely here?\n\"We will be guided by the views from the executive and the guidelines in place at that time, but the sorts of issues we'll want to look at are in terms of capacity, in terms of social distancing, in terms of track and trace.\n\"But also for these organisations the viability - what does it mean for them opening in terms of those additional requirements.\n\"We'll want to look at every possibility.\""

      "tags": "Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,Employment,Microsoft,Bill Gates",
      "text": "Microsoft was investigating its co-founder Bill Gates over a 20-year-old affair shortly before he stepped down from the company's board last year.\nThe tech giant confirmed that it had launched a probe after concerns were reported about his behaviour.\nThe firm said it held an investigation with a law firm and provided support to the employee who made the complaint.\nA spokesperson for Mr Gates denied that his decision to step back had anything to do with the investigation.\nNews of the investigation emerged after Bill and Melinda Gates announced their decision to divorce after 27 years of marriage.\nOn Monday, a spokesman for Microsoft said the software company had received a complaint in late 2019 that Mr Gates had \"sought to initiate an intimate relationship\" with a female employee in 2000.\n\"A committee of the board reviewed the concern, aided by an outside law firm, to conduct a thorough investigation,\" he said.\n\"Throughout the investigation, Microsoft provided extensive support to the employee who raised the concern,\" he said.\nThe investigation did not reach a conclusion, as Mr Gates stepped down from the board before it was completed.\nIn a LinkedIn post in March of last year, Mr Gates said that he took the decision so he could spend more time on his charity work with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It came three months after he was re-elected.\nAt the time, he wrote: \"With respect to Microsoft, stepping down from the board in no way means stepping away from the company. Microsoft will always be an important part of my life's work... I feel more optimistic than ever about the progress the company is making and how it can continue to benefit the world.\"\nHowever, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Microsoft's board had decided that Mr Gates's involvement with a female employee was inappropriate and he needed to step down.\nA spokeswoman for Mr Gates acknowledged the affair took place when asked by the newspaper, but denied it had anything to do his decision to step back.\n\"There was an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\"Bill's decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter. In fact, he had expressed an interest in spending more time on his philanthropy starting several years earlier.\"\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told the BBC that it stood by that statement.\nBill and Melinda Gates announced their decision to divorce earlier this month. The couple have spent billions on charitable causes around the world and have pledged to continue to work together at the foundation once their divorce is finalised.\nUS media reported that the two had agreed how to divide their property and assets before announcing their separation.\nMr Gates, 65, is the fourth wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes, and is worth $124bn (\u00a389bn).\nHe co-founded Microsoft - now the world's biggest software company - in the 1970s and remained full-time at the firm until 2008.\nThe couple's estate is believed to include multi-million dollar properties in the states of Washington, Florida and Wyoming. Their main residence is a lakeside mansion in Medina, Washington that is reported to be worth at least $127m."

      "tags": "Grenfell Tower fire,Grenfell Tower Inquiry",
      "text": "A local councillor who oversaw the Grenfell Tower refurbishment has admitted questioning the colour of the cladding - but not whether it was safe.\nRock Feilding-Mellen told a public inquiry that he believed safety was being handled by experts.\nHe said he only \"skimmed\" an email giving him safety advice, but he did send emails saying he didn't like the proposed \"champagne\" cladding colour.\nThe deadly fire in June 2017 has been partly blamed on dangerous cladding.\nSeventy-two people died in the disaster.\nThe second phase of the inquiry is looking into the cause of the disaster, including how Grenfell Tower came to be in a condition which allowed the fire to spread. \nMr Feilding-Mellen, a former Conservative councillor and deputy leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, oversaw housing policy and regeneration and became closely involved in design decisions during the refurbishment of the west London tower in 2014. \nHe told the Grenfell Tower public inquiry that he was attempting to resolve a hold-up in the refurbishment project, following concerns raised by planners about the colour of the cladding. \nA string of emails shown to the inquiry set out discussions between Mr Feilding-Mellen and the management organisation running the refurbishment project. \nIn one, he wrote: \"I am less convinced by the champagne colour. It's hard to tell in a drawing... but none of us chose that option as best when onsite.\"\n\"The lime green should be less neon and a bit more pastel shade of green/turquoise or a deeper/darker racing green... And I'd personally prefer the battleship grey.\"\nThe same day he stressed that \"the most important thing is to get cracking\".\nHowever, he admitted failing to follow the advice of the London Fire Brigade by asking detailed questions about fire safety when visiting Grenfell Tower. \nHe said he had \"only skimmed\" information from the fire service containing a \"councillor guide on fire safety for use during estate visits\".\nThis advice suggested councillors should ask about fire escape routes and the effect of modernisation work on safety. \n\"I failed to do that,\" Mr Feilding-Mellen told the inquiry. \n\"And based on what has happened I regret having failed to do that.  I, at the time, was conscious there were many layers of people with what I thought was the relevant expertise and indeed the role to check that health and safety generally and the fire safety of a refurbishment project like this.\"\nRichard Millett QC, the inquiry's chief lawyer, said the former councillor had made an assumption the fire brigade documents specifically warned councillors not to make. \n\"That appears to be the case,\" Mr Feilding-Mellen said.\nMr Millett asked him whether he became too closely involved with subjective opinions about the colour. \n\"I've said in my statement that I got involved and expressed my personal subjective view about the colours,\" Mr Feilding-Mellen responded.\n\"I've also tried to make clear that the reason that I was having this conversation was to try to help resolve the blockage in the planning system.\"\nCorrection 20th May 2021: This article originally reported that Rock Feilding-Mellen told the inquiry that he hadn't opened an e-mail giving safety advice and this has been amended to make clear that he said he had skimmed it."

      "tags": "Carbon capture and storage,COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change,Renewable energy",
      "text": "The International Energy Agency (IEA) says that no new fossil fuel boilers should be sold from 2025 if the world is to achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of this century.\nIt's one of 400 steps on the road to net-zero proposed by the agency in a special report.\nThe sale of new petrol and diesel cars around the world would end by 2035. \nThe IEA says that from now, there is no place for new coal, oil or gas exploration or supplies.\nThe report has been welcomed as an important contribution on the road to COP26 in Glasgow, when countries will attempt to agree the measures needed to put the Paris climate agreement into practice. \nIn that context, tackling the issue of how the world produces and consumes energy is the most critical endeavour.\nThe energy sector, according to the IEA, is the source of around 75% of the emissions of greenhouse gases that are driving up global temperatures. \nModels designed so they could switch to burn hydrogen could be an option - and will probably be around \u00a3100 more than the \u00a32,000 standard gas boiler.\nThis will help the climate because hydrogen from renewables burns with no emissions.\nBut climate advisors say it will probably only heat around 11% of homes, because hydrogen supply will be limited.\nSo most are expected to be warmed by heat pumps, which extract warmth from the air or the ground, or from water - a bit like a fridge operating in reverse which sell for between \u00a36,000 and \u00a318,000. \nThey're subsidised, but MPs say the government needs to offer more help to home owners. What's more, heat pumps need high levels of insulation which aren't always possible.\nThere are other technologies being considered. Geothermal heat may warm places such as Cornwall. Nuclear might figure, too.\nBut the great task of shifting heating from gas will be expensive and difficult. \nTo keep the world safe, scientists say that global heating has to be limited to 1.5C by the end of this century. \nTo keep close to that mark, emissions of warming gases need to drop by half by 2030, and essentially hit zero in 2050. \nThe IEA's new study sets out what it believes to be a realistic road map to achieve that aim, while at the same time creating millions of jobs and boosting economic growth. \nBy 2050 it envisions a global economy that is twice as big as today, with two billion extra people but with the demand for energy dropping by 8%.\nThe authors say their plan achieves this with no carbon offsets and a low reliance on technologies to remove carbon from the air. \nCrucially, it sees no place for new supplies of coal, oil or gas.\nHowever, the IEA's route to net-zero will require massive investments and international co-operation on an unprecedented scale. \nIt will also have direct impacts on consumers all over the world. \nHome heating with gas or oil is currently a major source of carbon emissions in many countries, responsible for around 20% of CO2 in the US and the UK.\nThe IEA path to net-zero says that in just four years' time, there should be no new fossil fuel boilers sold, except where they are compatible with hydrogen.\nThis will not be an easy shift for the building sector.\n\"It will be very difficult, because it means a massive turn in the consumption behaviour,\" said Maria Pastukhova, from the E3G environmental think tank. \n\"The building sector is maybe one of the toughest ones because aside from the emphasis that the IEA has put on efficient buildings, all the old existing infrastructure has to be retrofitted. And that's a particular challenge for governments.\"\nThe IEA says that as well as greening the energy system it will need to be expanded to provide electricity to the 785 million people in the world who have no access at present.\nTo meet this challenge the world will need to install four times the amount of wind and solar energy than it did in 2020. \nThis equates to adding a massive solar park every day over the next nine years.\nBy 2035 the report says there would be no more sales of new cars with petrol or diesel engines. All of the world's electricity would be emissions free by 2040. \nWhile the scale of the change is unprecedented, the IEA believes it will create around 14 million jobs by 2030, while investments in energy production soar to $5tn, boosting global GDP.\n\"The scale and speed of the efforts demanded by this critical and formidable goal - our best chance of tackling climate change and limiting global warming to 1.5C - make this perhaps the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced,\" said Fatih Birol, the IEA Executive Director. \n\"The IEA's pathway to this brighter future brings a historic surge in clean energy investment that creates millions of new jobs and lifts global economic growth. Moving the world on to that pathway requires strong and credible policy actions from governments, underpinned by much greater international co-operation.\" \nOne issue that has caused concern among environmentalists is the reliance in the report on unproven technologies, such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). \nThere are also worries about bioenergy which involves the use of trees, crops and plants to make liquid fuel or to generate electricity. \nThe IEA path to net-zero sees a significant increase of around 60% in this energy source, with an estimate that energy crops and forestry plantations will take up 25% more land than is used today for bioenergy production.\n\"Burning forests for energy is the latest in a parade of false climate solutions,\" said Hannah Mowat from Fern, a Brussels-based NGO campaigning to protect forests and people.\n\"Sadly, the IEA has bought into it by proposing wholly unrealistic levels of bioenergy, which will damage forests the world over and worsen climate change. Instead of burning trees for energy, we should focus on cutting fossil fuel use, maximising energy efficiency and increasing renewables such as solar, wind, heat pumps and geothermal.\"\nThe IEA Net Zero by 2050 report can be found here. \nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."

      "tags": "UK trade tariffs,Agriculture,NFU,UK economy",
      "text": "UK farmers have sounded the alarm over reports the government plans a trade deal with Australia that would make its food and farming imports cheaper.\nThe move is being considered as part of a free trade pact with Australia the UK government hopes will be a springboard for similar pacts with other countries.\nBut UK farming unions have warned of \"irreversible damage\" from a bad deal.\nThere is speculation the Cabinet is split over the move, and Labour has accused the government of a \"sell-out\".\nAs with many countries, farming imports from Australia face tariffs - or taxes - making lamb and beef, for example, more expensive.\nBut in a post-Brexit world, the UK government is keen to strike free trade deals and has now indicated that farmers may have to prepare for the lowering of tariffs on agricultural imports.\nThe Department for International Trade (DIT) would not be drawn directly on reports it is willing to concede to zero tariffs in return for an Australia deal. \nHowever, it said a deal would be \"an important stepping stone\" to joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a sprawling trade group that includes New Zealand, Chile, Japan, Vietnam, as well as Australia.\nA deal would \"allow UK farmers even greater access to growing consumer markets in Asia\", the DIT said, adding that it would not allow importers to undercut the farming industry or food standards. \nHowever, the National Farmers' Union warned that its members will struggle to compete if zero-tariff trade on lamb and beef goes ahead.\nNFU president Minette Batters said: \"We know that if we're to open up the opportunities of new markets overseas for UK farmers, we will have to offer greater access to our own markets in return.\n\"However, this trade-off needs to be balanced, and we need to make sure concessions to our hugely valuable home market are not given away lightly.\n\"There is a very real risk that, if we get it wrong, UK farming will suffer irreversible damage rather than flourish in the way we all desire, to the detriment of our environment, our food security and our rural communities.\"\nRift?\nFarmers' concerns are reportedly shared by some members of the Cabinet. \nThe Financial Times reported that Environment Secretary George Eustice and Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove are at loggerheads with International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and Brexit minister Lord Frost over granting tariff-free access to Australian, and possibly New Zealand, farmers.\nAsked about the rift by the Press Association, Mr Eustice said: \"I'm not going to get into discussions that are going on in government about individual trade agreements.\n\"In any discussion on any part of government policy, and trade agreements are no exception, there's a discussion and there's a consensus.\n\"At the moment there's a very clear consensus in government that we want to do a trade agreement with countries like Australia, but obviously on the right terms.\"\nHowever, sources did not deny to the BBC that there were Cabinet divisions over the issue.\nEmily Thornberry, Labour's shadow international trade secretary, accused Ms Truss of selling out British farmers.\n\"It's perfectly normal that the Australian government should try to get the best possible deal for its agricultural mega-corporations,\" she said. \n\"But British family farmers have a right to expect that Liz Truss will do the same for them, not sell out their livelihoods for the price of a quick trade deal, and a cheap headline at the G7 summit.\"\nMs Truss was hoping to secure an Australia deal ahead of the G7 summit in June. She is about to start official trade talks with Canada and Mexico, adding to those under way with India and New Zealand.\nTrade deals are about countries trying to secure the best for their businesses and people. When working down the menu of issues, the hardest to digest - typically, agriculture -  is normally left to the last.\nAustralia aims to get tariffs and quotas dropped for all goods, which on the UK government's own estimates could boost imports from that country by 83% - mainly due to beef and lamb.\nThat's worrying for some farmers - but the government says any liberalisation would take years, and Australia isn't taking full advantage of the tariff free quotas it's got now.\nBut the key is what it signals for other trade deals and policy. An agreement with Australia will likely be the first one struck by the UK with a nation with which it didn't have an agreement while part of the EU. And Trade Secretary Liz Truss is keen to strike it fast, as a springboard for membership of a wider trans-pacific trading bloc."

      "tags": "Royal College reports,Freedom of Information,NHS",
      "text": "Serious patient safety issues are being buried in confidential hospital reports, BBC Panorama has found.\nFreedom of Information requests revealed 111 reports, written by medical royal colleges, which NHS trusts have a duty to share.\nEighty reports were given to the BBC but only 26 had been shared in full with regulators, and 16 published.\nThe Department of Health would not comment on whether it might change the law to ensure publication. \nSince the 2015 Morecambe Bay maternity scandal in which 11 babies and a mother died, NHS Trusts are supposed to publish summaries of external reviews, and share them with the regulator. \nAn earlier review into the hospital had previously identified concerns but had not been made public. \nDr Bill Kirkup, who led a 2015 investigation into the Morecambe Bay scandal, said Panorama's findings were a \"great disappointment\". \n\"People should know that there is something that is important enough to be looked at and they should know what the results of that scrutiny are. \n\"I can't understand what the rationale would be for withholding the existence of a report or the findings of the report. These are important matters of accountability in the public service.\"  \nJames Titcombe, who became a patient safety campaigner after his baby son Joshua died due to failures of care at Morecambe Bay, said by not publishing reports \"there are possibly risks out there that the regulator is unaware of, and ultimately those risks can have tragic consequences\".\nFreedom of Information (FoI) requests were sent to all NHS Trusts in the UK requesting any Royal College reviews of services in the last five years.\nThe colleges set standards of care and can be commissioned to review how a health care provider is performing.\nOf the 80 reports released to the BBC, just 16 are in the public domain, and only 26 were shared in full with the regulators. \nIn another 22 cases the regulator was only aware of the review or had only seen part of it. Sixty-five of the 80 contained potential or actual patient safety concerns.\nThough the BBC had been told about 111 reports, the Royal Colleges told Panorama they had carried out about 260 reviews in the same period.  \nProf Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said she was \"dismayed\" summaries of reports were not being made public, and it had published guidance in 2016 saying reports dealing with safety or care concerns should be made public. \n\"If things are not being shared, and if that has implications for patient safety, that must be put right. The fact that a review is done should never be secret and indeed a summary of the findings should always be published\".\nThe vasculitis department at the Royal Liverpool Hospital treats people with a disease affecting the blood vessels. \nIn 2015, after concerns were raised by other clinicians, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) was called in.\nThe college recommended there should be an audit of patients treated during the previous two years \"without delay\" to ensure they were on the correct treatment. \nFoI requests reveal there were 400 patients under the care of the unit at that point.\nBut 18 months after the review, less than a quarter had been checked.\nOut of a group of 26 who were on powerful medications, two were found to have been given them \"inappropriately\", four were given \"possibly excessive\" doses and three had died while suffering side effects from the drugs. \nBBC Panorama has seen emails from the RCP threatening to tell the regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), if the audit wasn't completed, but it did not follow through.  \nIn addition, the CQC was never told by the hospital or the college about the concerns or given the full report. Instead it was only told a review had happened.\nThe CQC said if it had known an audit was required, it would have monitored the outcomes.\nAnd the RCP said it was \"satisfied that the trust made reasonable attempts to complete the audits\" but was \"very disappointed with the speed of response and progress\", adding that the trust \"had a clear obligation to share serious ongoing concerns with patients and the regulator\".\nThe Royal Liverpool Hospital said it was \"committed to providing safe and excellent care\" and that the recommendations identified within the RCP's 2015 report have since been \"successfully implemented, or are part of longer-term actions currently in progress\".\nThe CQC does not currently have the legal power to compel trusts to share the reports or make the trust implement recommendations.\nProf Ted Baker, the CQC's chief inspector of hospitals, said: \"Both hospital trusts and the professional bodies undertaking invited reviews have a responsibility to ensure that any serious patient safety issues raised in an invited review are shared with CQC.\n\"It is extremely disappointing that despite this very clear expectation, we continue to see examples of a lack of transparency.\"\nDr Kirkup said a legal duty may have to be placed on trusts compelling them to disclose royal college reviews.\nNHS England and NHS Improvement said there are \"robust and transparent systems to ensure hospitals and other care providers learn and improve services\". \nIt said \"all independent reviews should be made available\" to health commissioners and regulators and it \"expects trusts to take prompt action to address recommendations made\". \nOut of 111 reports the BBC was made aware of, 100 came from NHS trusts in England.\nThe NHS in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all emphasised the usefulness of the Royal College review system and stressed the importance of openness and transparency in healthcare.\nBBC News asked the Department of Health whether they would consider a change in the law to enforce publication and sharing with regulators but they declined to comment.\nYou can watch Panorama: Hospital Secrets Uncovered on BBC One at 19:30 BST or afterwards on BBC iPlayer."

      "text": "Wealthy people have so far spent more than \u00a31bn on superyachts in 2021 as they seek to escape Covid lockdowns and travel restrictions, according to a luxury lifestyle publisher.\nBoat International said the surge is set to make this year the biggest yet in terms of second-hand sales.\nBut Oxfam said it was \"obscene\" that such wealth was not spent on vaccines.\nFor the cost of those superyachts, the population of Nepal could be fully vaccinated, the charity said.\nThe trend towards buying superyachts, which started last summer, is the \"hottest sales streak on record\", Boat International said.\nIt defines a superyacht as being longer than 24 metres and typically they need a crew.\nThese smaller superyachts - the bigger ones can be up to 180 metres - usually cost between \u20ac1m and \u20ac5m (\u00a3860,000 to \u00a34.3m) second-hand, and have running costs of about \u20ac200,000 per year for crew, mooring fees and fuel, said Boat International editor-in-chief Stewart Campbell.\nThey can be kitted out with spa pools, sun decks, gyms, or anything else the owners want.\nThe sales surge was being driven by \"a cohort of very wealthy people\" who wanted to get away from travel restrictions and covid-related lockdowns by buying a yacht, Mr Campbell said.\nWhile the pandemic had made it more difficult for rich people to jet to the Mediterranean and cruise around, he said, \"it's a minor inconvenience in the scheme of things\".\nMore than 50% of superyacht sales are in the US, he said, so people there could cruise in US waters, avoiding travel restrictions.\nMany yacht owners \"did not want to go near land\" due to the pandemic, Mr Campbell added.\nHe said that it was a misconception that all superyachts were owned by oligarchs, and that the majority of people who owned them had earned their money ethically, and that many gave to charity.\nSuperyacht owners also contribute to the boat-building and tourism industries in places such as Germany and the Caribbean, he said.\nThe three biggest yachts sold second-hand this year were Solo, at just over \u00a354m, Elixir, with an asking price of \u00a333.5m, and Lady Sheridan, with an asking price of \u00a324.7m.\nBut as superyachts go, they were tiddlers. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's superyacht is estimated to have cost about $500m (\u00a3350m).\nOxfam said the \u00a31bn spent on second-hand superyachts in 2021 was enough to fully vaccinate entire countries.\nMax Lawson, head of inequality policy at Oxfam International, said: \"The \u00a31bn spent in the last year by billionaires on superyachts is more than the cost of fully vaccinating a country like Nepal, where Covid is inflicting a terrible toll. \n\"It is obscene - a sign of a world that has its priorities badly wrong - that with so much wealth around poor countries cannot get the vaccines they need to protect their people.\" "

The advice is not to go because it's not essential travel, but you can go if you quarantine. So it's make your own mind up.\"\nHe added: \"A lot of fans would have paid a lot of money upfront, which they can't now recoup because the insurance won't pay out because it's an amber country. \n\"You won't get a refund on your ticket and you won't get a refund on your hotel. I'm not 100% about flights but we're being told if it's amber, it should leave fans out of pocket by thousands of pounds. That's the problem.\"\nMr Alm said he believed \"the majority of fans\" who had tickets would still travel \"for the simple fact they won't want the hassle of trying to chase the insurance companies to get their tickets\".\n\"Many can also work from home so the quarantine when they come back doesn't affect them,\" he said.\nFfion Eluned Owen, 30, of Cardiff, has tickets with her friends for all three of Wales' group matches and said it was \"unfair\" it had been left for individuals to decide.\n\"We're more fortunate than a lot of other people, because we haven't booked any flights or accommodation,\" she said.\n\"I know it's advisory, but this amber light is very confusing because it says you can go but you can't go and there are things like insurance to consider.\n\"We've been looking forward to this for so long and English and Scottish fans don't have to make these decisions because their games are all in the UK, so it's very frustrating.\"\nHywel Williams has followed Wales around the world for more than 30 years, and plans to go next month despite the restrictions.\n\"With the uncertainty over the last year, I didn't realise how much I missed football... it's been odd that when they have a game I'm not there,\" he said.\nMr Williams, from Cardiff, said the advice not to travel to the games \"did not really make a difference\" and said he could work from home if he had to self-isolate on his return.\nHowever he said many of his friends had decided not to go due to the restrictions.\n\"I worry I am going to have to take a megaphone, because I am going to be the only person in the crowd shouting on Wales,\" he said.\nConsumer law expert Gary Rycroft said fans could now find it difficult to buy adequate travel insurance or claim a refund for any bookings made after the latest announcement. \nHowever those with prior bookings, he said, should be able to reclaim money for not travelling due to the travel restrictions under \"frustration of contract\".\nHe added: \"The advice - don't go but you can go - is very confusing. There needs to be a definitive statement from the Welsh government.\"\nThere is, however, some hope for optimistic Welsh fans later in the tournament.\nIf Wales comes top of their group, they will play their last 16 match at London's Wembley Stadium. Finishing as runner-up would mean a trip to Amsterdam."

      "tags": "Tourism,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Travel,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned people should not be holidaying in amber list countries, after a minister said people could go and visit friends.\nThe confusion arose after Environment Secretary George Eustice said people could go to those countries if they quarantined when they returned.\nIt comes after news that some holiday companies are refusing refunds to such destinations.\nThat is because it is now legal to travel to countries on the amber list.\nMr Johnson said: \"I think it's very important for people to grasp what an amber list country is: it is not somewhere where you should be going on holiday, let me be very clear about that.\n\"And if people do go to an amber list country, they absolutely have to for some pressing family or urgent business reason, then please bear in mind that you will have to self-isolate, you'll have to take tests and do your passenger locator form and all the rest of it.\"\nThe warning came amid reports that thousands of people had headed for destinations such as France, Greece, Spain and the US, with more than 150 flights reported to have departed on Monday.\nMeanwhile the European Union is expected to relax its travel rules for British holidaymakers. \nEU ambassadors are meeting on Wednesday to discuss whether to allow people who have been fully vaccinated to visit countries in the bloc without any restrictions. \nThey are also considering whether or not to lift the current ban on non-essential travel from the UK to Europe. \nAfter the legal ban on foreign holidays ended on Monday, Environment Secretary George Eustice said that people could go to those countries if they quarantined when they returned.\n\"We don't want to stop travel altogether and the reason, as [Health Secretary] Matt Hancock set out, that we have the amber list is there will be reasons why people feel they need to travel, either to visit family or indeed to visit friends,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.\n\"They can travel to those countries but they then have to observe quarantine when they return and have two tests after returning.\n\"So people can travel to those areas, yes, but they will then have to subject themselves to the quarantine requirements on return.\"\nBut the prime minister's spokesman insisted travel to amber list destinations was only allowed for a strictly limited number of reasons.\nHe said people should not be going to those countries for holidays or leisure.\n\"The position remains that people should not travel to amber list countries and that is to protect public health,\" the spokesman said.\n\"There are some limited reasons why it might be acceptable to travel - for work purposes, protecting essential services or compassionate reasons such as a funeral or care of a family member - but otherwise people should not be travelling to these countries.\"\nHe said holidays and leisure travel should be restricted to the short \"green list\" of destinations such as Portugal.\n\"We are working with the travel industry and others on this. All of us have a personal responsibility to protect one another as we cautiously reopen international travel,\" the spokesman said.\n\"We are moving to a situation where the public can take responsibility for their actions. I think it is important to stress that, by and large, that is what we are seeing.\n\"Obviously we will keep this under review, we are keeping a careful eye on this and we will take further action if necessary.\"\nA health minister, Lord Bethell, advised people not to take a foreign holiday this year. \nAsked about reports that passengers at Heathrow had been forced to stand next to people arriving from red list countries, the minister told the House of Lords that \"segregation is unbelievably difficult during travel\". \nAnd he said that was why travelling was dangerous.\nHe told peers: \"The ultimate sanction here is that, particularly as we go into the summer, we tell people: travelling is not for this year. Please stay in this country.\"\nChief executive of Airlines UK Tim Alderslade accused the government of causing confusion. \n\"People should not travel to red countries, we know that, but to generalise against perfectly legal travel even to green countries is deeply unhelpful,\" he said. \nThe government's traffic light system is guidance rather than a legal requirement, and some travel companies have opted to still offer holidays to amber destinations so long as the Foreign Office has not advised against all but essential travel there.\nThat means some travel companies are refusing refunds for holidays booked last year for summer 2021, or that were moved from 2020 by tour operators - or even to defer the bookings.\nThe UK's largest tour operator, Tui, is currently offering holidays to amber countries such as Cuba, Barbados and Antigua and to some Greek and Spanish islands.\nThe company is offering customers free changes to holiday bookings if they don't want to travel, but they will be required to pay any price difference for the new dates, which can be more expensive because demand is high.\nFlying to an amber list country for a holiday isn't illegal - but it remains deeply frowned upon.\nUntil Monday, travelling without good reason was illegal - and you could be fined a great deal of money for doing it.\nNow, although you're technically allowed to travel, the government doesn't want you to - unless you go to a green list country.\nIf you find all this confusing, you're not alone, and reports suggest there are plenty of people for whom \"not illegal\" is a big green light for a holiday in France, Greece or the US.\nWith some travel companies refusing to refund would-be holidaymakers who pre-booked trips to countries which are now on the amber list, it's clear that in many cases there's a powerful incentive to disregard official advice.\nBut passengers should be clear about what they're letting themselves in for: mandatory self-isolation on their return, with possible fines if they don't; and the risk that if anything goes wrong, their insurance might not pay out."

      "tags": "Gaza border clashes,Israel & the Palestinians,Israel,Palestinian territories,Gaza,Jerusalem",
      "text": "A ceasefire was agreed on 21 May between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. \nIt came after 11 days of fighting, which left at least 255 people dead. Most of those killed were Palestinians in the territory of Gaza.\nIsrael and Hamas both claimed victory in the latest conflict. \nThe violence in May followed a month of rising tensions in Jerusalem. But the fighting has gone on for decades.\nBritain took control of the area known as Palestine after the ruler of that part of the Middle East, the Ottoman Empire, was defeated in World War One. \nThe land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority. \nTensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave Britain the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. \nFor Jews it was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.\nBetween the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe and seeking a homeland after the Holocaust of World War Two.\nViolence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also grew.\nIn 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. \nThat plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.\nIn 1948, unable to solve the problem, British rulers left and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the state of Israel.\nMany Palestinians objected and a war followed. Troops from neighbouring Arab countries invaded.\nHundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\".\nBy the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. \nJordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. \nJerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.\nBecause there was never a peace agreement - with each side blaming the other - there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.\nIn another war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.\nMost Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.\nNeither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.\nIsrael still occupies the West Bank, and although it pulled out of Gaza the UN still regards that piece of land as occupied territory. \nIsrael claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.\nIn the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in these areas, where more than 600,000 Jews now live.\nPalestinians say these are illegal under international law and are obstacles to peace, but Israel denies this.\nTensions are often high between Israel and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank. \nGaza is ruled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which has fought Israel many times. Israel and Egypt tightly control Gaza's borders to stop weapons getting to Hamas. \nPalestinians in Gaza and the West Bank say they are suffering because of Israeli actions and restrictions. Israel says it is only acting to protect itself from Palestinian violence.\nThe threatened eviction of some Palestinian families in East Jerusalem has also caused rising anger.\nThere are a number of issues which Israel and the Palestinians cannot agree on. \nThese include: what should happen to Palestinian refugees; whether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removed; whether the two sides should share Jerusalem; and - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside Israel. \nPeace talks have been taking place on and off for more than 25 years, but so far have not solved the conflict.\nIn short, the situation isn't going to be sorted out any time soon.\nThe most recent peace plan, prepared by the United States when Donald Trump was president, was called \"the deal of the century\" by Israel's then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But it was been dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.\nAny future peace deal will need both sides to agree to resolve complex issues.\nThe BBC's Middle East editor, Jeremy Bowen, says the latest round of violence in May was the fourth big war between Hamas and Israel since 2008.\nHe's seen previous wars end like this before: \"Similar things have been said by both sides in claiming victory and then essentially the seeds of the next conflict are sown.\n\"I can tell you one thing for certain - that if the status quo does not change favourably, there will be another round of this.\"\nCorrection 21st June 2021: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the US as recognising Israel's claim to the whole of Jerusalem and this has been amended to instead explain that the US recognises the city as Israel's capital.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

      "tags": "UK trade tariffs,Agriculture,NFU,UK economy",
      "text": "UK farmers have sounded the alarm over reports the government plans a trade deal with Australia that would make its food and farming imports cheaper.\nThe move is being considered as part of a free trade pact with Australia the UK government hopes will be a springboard for similar pacts with other countries.\nBut UK farming unions have warned of \"irreversible damage\" from a bad deal.\nThere is speculation the Cabinet is split over the move, and Labour has accused the government of a \"sell-out\".\nAs with many countries, farming imports from Australia face tariffs - or taxes - making lamb and beef, for example, more expensive.\nBut in a post-Brexit world, the UK government is keen to strike free trade deals and has now indicated that farmers may have to prepare for the lowering of tariffs on agricultural imports.\nThe Department for International Trade (DIT) would not be drawn directly on reports it is willing to concede to zero tariffs in return for an Australia deal. \nHowever, it said a deal would be \"an important stepping stone\" to joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a sprawling trade group that includes New Zealand, Chile, Japan, Vietnam, as well as Australia.\nA deal would \"allow UK farmers even greater access to growing consumer markets in Asia\", the DIT said, adding that it would not allow importers to undercut the farming industry or food standards. \nHowever, the National Farmers' Union warned that its members will struggle to compete if zero-tariff trade on lamb and beef goes ahead.\nNFU president Minette Batters said: \"We know that if we're to open up the opportunities of new markets overseas for UK farmers, we will have to offer greater access to our own markets in return.\n\"However, this trade-off needs to be balanced, and we need to make sure concessions to our hugely valuable home market are not given away lightly.\n\"There is a very real risk that, if we get it wrong, UK farming will suffer irreversible damage rather than flourish in the way we all desire, to the detriment of our environment, our food security and our rural communities.\"\nRift?\nFarmers' concerns are reportedly shared by some members of the Cabinet. \nThe Financial Times reported that Environment Secretary George Eustice and Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove are at loggerheads with International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and Brexit minister Lord Frost over granting tariff-free access to Australian, and possibly New Zealand, farmers.\nAsked about the rift by the Press Association, Mr Eustice said: \"I'm not going to get into discussions that are going on in government about individual trade agreements.\n\"In any discussion on any part of government policy, and trade agreements are no exception, there's a discussion and there's a consensus.\n\"At the moment there's a very clear consensus in government that we want to do a trade agreement with countries like Australia, but obviously on the right terms.\"\nHowever, sources did not deny to the BBC that there were Cabinet divisions over the issue.\nEmily Thornberry, Labour's shadow international trade secretary, accused Ms Truss of selling out British farmers.\n\"It's perfectly normal that the Australian government should try to get the best possible deal for its agricultural mega-corporations,\" she said. \n\"But British family farmers have a right to expect that Liz Truss will do the same for them, not sell out their livelihoods for the price of a quick trade deal, and a cheap headline at the G7 summit.\"\nMs Truss was hoping to secure an Australia deal ahead of the G7 summit in June. She is about to start official trade talks with Canada and Mexico, adding to those under way with India and New Zealand.\nTrade deals are about countries trying to secure the best for their businesses and people. When working down the menu of issues, the hardest to digest - typically, agriculture -  is normally left to the last.\nAustralia aims to get tariffs and quotas dropped for all goods, which on the UK government's own estimates could boost imports from that country by 83% - mainly due to beef and lamb.\nThat's worrying for some farmers - but the government says any liberalisation would take years, and Australia isn't taking full advantage of the tariff free quotas it's got now.\nBut the key is what it signals for other trade deals and policy. An agreement with Australia will likely be the first one struck by the UK with a nation with which it didn't have an agreement while part of the EU. And Trade Secretary Liz Truss is keen to strike it fast, as a springboard for membership of a wider trans-pacific trading bloc."

      "text": "Thousands of British holidaymakers have begun taking advantage of the easing of lockdown rules on overseas travel.\nTravellers from England, Scotland and Wales are jetting off to some countries in what the crisis-hit tourism industry hopes is the start of a recovery.\nTravellers can now visit 12 countries on the government's green list, including Portugal and Israel, without isolating on their return.\nThe bosses of British Airways and Ryanair said confidence was returning.\nThe vast majority of tourist destinations remain on the amber and red lists, meaning travellers must quarantine when they get back.\nBookings also remain well down on pre-pandemic levels. \nHowever, BA chief executive Sean Doyle told the BBC that the airline's six flights due to depart from Heathrow on Monday to \"green\" destinations such as Lisbon, Faro and Madeira were \"very busy\".\nHe said the latest relaxation of restrictions was \"a small step in the right direction\".\nRyanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said there were definite signs of an early rebound in travel to European destinations.\nBookings are up from 500,000 a week in early April to 1.5 million a week now. \"The rate of bookings suggests there is a huge amount of confidence,\" he told BBC Breakfast. \"We are very optimistic for the next couple of months.\"\nNellie and Jill are off to Portugal on Monday - but it seemed touch and go right up to the moment they got to the airport.\nThey are \"super excited and really happy to be able to travel again\". But the past few weeks have been stressful, especially as it was only confirmed on Friday that they could definitely travel.\nNellie said it was then a real scramble to get PCR coronavirus tests over the weekend, which Jill added was quite complicated. \n\"Adding all the documentation wasn't easy but we persevered and we're glad we did,\" Jill said. Some holiday sun and a glass of wine on their balcony would make it all worth it, she added.\nGatwick Airport chief executive Stewart Wingate said welcoming holidaymakers for the first time in months was a \"big relief\".\nHe expected the number of travellers to increase significantly by the end of May - but this will still be less than 15% of the traffic seen in pre-pandemic times.\n\"It's an important day for us... we're looking forward to seeing more countries added to the green list in the weeks ahead,\" he added.\nBut there is still caution. Online travel agent Thomas Cook said the number of people booking to travel abroad was \"still small\".\nIt said 75% of its bookings were for Portugal, although Thomas Cook customers planning to jet off this week numbered only in their hundreds.\nOn Friday, Portugal announced that travellers from the UK would be allowed to enter its borders provided they could show a negative PCR test result from the previous 72 hours.\nThat led to an increase in demand for flights to the country. Tui, which has 19 flights scheduled from the UK to Portugal next week, said eight of those would now be on a Boeing Dreamliner, which can carry up to 345 people - almost twice as many people as the Boeing 737s that it had planned to use.\nMany of those who do intend to get away plan to do so in style. Thomas Cook reported that 85% of customers had booked four or five-star hotels. Before the crisis, only around half of people chose to splash out on that kind of luxury.\nHays Travel has noticed a similar trend. At present around half of its customers are booking for next year but it highlighted a \"cautious optimism\" among travellers following an almost four-fold increase in bookings for Portugal this summer.\nChief operating officer Jonathon Woodall said the average spend on a two-week holiday for a family of four had increased by \u00a3370 to \u00a34,000 as people look to \"fulfil their bucket list\". \n\"People are upgrading to better destinations and accommodation, spending more to treat themselves,\" he said. \nAfter months of keeping apart, travelling on a busy plane feels both familiar and strange. Face masks are mandatory except to allow for eating and drinking, but seats are not socially distanced. I was handed a complimentary antibacterial wipe on boarding. \nThe paperwork is far more complicated than normal. Alongside my passport and ticket, I'm carrying proof of my negative PCR test, a passenger locator form for Portugal and proof of my booked tests for my journey home. I'll have to complete another locator form to come back to the U.K. \nStill at 35,000 feet, we don't know how long the queues will be at the Portuguese border when we land or on the return journey. \nPassengers on board have said they feel a little like guinea pigs. The travel industry knows it's important to make this process smooth and safe if it's to have a good summer. \nWhile travel from England, Scotland and Wales is permitted to the 12 countries on the green list, most of the destinations are either remote islands or do not currently allow UK tourists to enter.\nAnd the government is advising people not to make non-essential trips to locations on its amber list, which covers popular destinations such as Spain, France, Italy and Greece. However, the guidance is expected to be ignored by some holidaymakers.\nEasyJet and Tui have both said that they will operate holidays to countries classified as amber, provided Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) does not advise against \"all but essential\" travel.\nThe majority of countries around the world are in the amber category, meaning that arrivals from these places to the UK are required to quarantine at home for 10 days as well as taking a Covid test before departure and two more on arrival.\nTravellers arriving back in England from an amber country have the option after five days of quarantine to pay for a private Covid test under the Test to Release scheme. If the result is negative, the quarantine can end.\nBA boss Sean Doyle said \"cautious optimism\" should be exercised when decisions are made about whether to expand the green list when it is reviewed on 7 June. \nHe said vaccination and infection rates in a number of the major aviation markets were \"trending positively\", noting that the US - an important market for both tourism and business \"now has 60% of its adult population vaccinated [and] infections are falling\". \nFrom Monday, people travelling abroad will be able to use the NHS app - which is different to the NHS Covid-19 app - to prove they have had the vaccine.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps previously said people who have had both doses will be able to use the app at border controls, although the government says people should still check countries' entry requirements as tests or quarantine might still be needed.\nAre you travelling abroad today?

      "text": "Offering children in some richer countries a coronavirus vaccine before some high-risk people in poorer ones is \"morally wrong\", a group of MPs has been told.\nProf Andrew Pollard, who helped develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, said the \"inequity\" of vaccine distribution must change \"urgently\".\nThe US and Canada have made a jab available to children as young as 12.\nBut in many low-income countries those most at risk are yet to be vaccinated.\n\"The overall aim of a global vaccination programme in a pandemic is to stop people dying,\" said Prof Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, who led the trials for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\"I have worked in Nepal and Bangladesh and colleagues there are facing the most appalling circumstances - they're not working in a situation where there's an NHS to support them,\" he told the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus.\n\"It feels completely wrong to be in a situation morally where we are allowing that to happen whilst in many countries vaccines are being rolled out to younger and younger populations at very, very low risk. \n\"Children have near to zero risk of severe disease or death.\"\nThe Pfizer vaccine, which has been approved in the US and Canada, has completed trials in adolescents. \nAnd a number of other Covid vaccines are being tested on this age group and younger.\nBut Prof Pollard said: \"The main issue at the moment is to try and make sure the doses go to those in greatest need. \n\"This is a global problem which impacts our economies and puts pressure on health systems.\"\nStudies show over-50s, people with certain health conditions and healthcare workers are most likely to become seriously ill or die from coronavirus - but many in parts of Africa and South Asia are still waiting for a vaccine.\nCampaigners warn supply shortages are a huge concern.\nCovax, the international scheme to ensure equal access to Covid vaccines, is currently short of 140 million doses, after a disruption in supply from India.\nUnicef and the World Health Organization have both called on wealthier countries to share their surplus supplies, as some have ordered enough to vaccinate their populations many times over. \nA Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said \u00a3548 million has been provided to deliver more than a billion vaccines to more than 70 countries.\nThey added the UK will share the \"majority of any future surplus coronavirus vaccines from our supply with the COVAX pool, when these are available\".\nProf Pollard said his key message to the government would be to act with \"absolute urgency\" or \"many millions could die between now and September\".\n\"We can't wait until later this year to make decisions, he said. \n\"It has to be now that we look at redistribution and how we get doses to countries that have poor access at the moment - and that is through Covax.\"\nAnother witness told the MPs' panel richer countries were \"hoarding doses\" and he feared they would do the same with potential booster shots in the future.\nBut the production of vaccine in low- and middle-income countries would prevent this.\n\"We hear from so many manufacturers in places like Pakistan and Bangladesh and Indonesia - they're ready, they've got some capacity,\" Prof Gavin Yamey, director of the Centre for Policy Impact in Global Health, at Duke University, in the US, said.\n\"It's fine to continue donating - but there has to be a long-term vision. \n\"This pandemic could be with us for years.\n\"Is it really just going to be charity - drip, drip, drip of a few doses from rich countries? \n\"That's not a long-term vision.\""

      "text": "Ministers will step up calls for people to book a Covid vaccination as soon as they are offered one, amid increasing concern about the Indian variant.\nThe health secretary said anyone who was unsure should look at Bolton, where most people in hospital with Covid were eligible for a jab but had not had one.\nMatt Hancock said 86 local councils had five or more cases of the variant that is thought to be more transmissible.\nIt comes as lockdowns eased in England, Wales and most of Scotland on Monday.\nYasmin Qureshi, the Labour MP for Bolton South East, challenged the suggestion that her constituents had refused the vaccine, blaming poor organisation instead.\nMore than 36.7m people have had their first vaccine dose in the UK and more than 20.2m have had their second.\nThe NHS website for booking a vaccination is now open to those aged 36 and over.\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that surge testing was taking place in Bolton, while the government was \"keeping a very close eye\" on the football match at Old Trafford in Manchester later - where 10,000 fans are expected to gather.\nHe said the more people who are vaccinated, \"the greater the collective immunity that we have as a population\".\nMr Hancock told the House of Commons on Monday that there had been 2,323 confirmed cases of the Indian variant across the UK, saying it was now the dominant strain in Bolton and neighbouring Blackburn and Darwen, in Lancashire, and was rising in all age groups.\nHe said most people in hospital in those areas had been eligible for a vaccine but had chosen not to have it - and urged anyone not sure whether to get jabbed to \"look at what's happening in Bolton\".\nBut Ms Qureshi argued that the area was initially slow to get the right vaccine rollout infrastructure, telling BBC Newsnight on Monday that the rollout \"was done in one place in the town centre with only about six vaccinators to cover a huge area and a huge population\". \n\"Some people had to use two or three buses to get into the town centre,\" she said. \"A lot of these people were on zero-hours contracts or living in multi-generational homes and they weren't able to be contacted.\"\nMr Hancock also identified Bedford as another hotspot for the variant.\nVicky Head, Bedford's director of public health, told BBC Breakfast the town was experiencing a \"massive rise\" in cases of the Indian variant in what was a \"worrying time\".\n\"It's really important that people understand just how quickly the situation can change,\" she said.\nShe said they had been doing targeted testing in schools, setting up walk-in clinics for those eligible to get the jab, and making sure the right information was available.\nThe wait for more data begins. \nData on the variant from India: how quickly it spreads, how many fall seriously ill, how effective vaccines are against it. \nAnd data on the impact of the latest easing of restrictions in much of Britain. \nIt's likely to be a few weeks before an assessment can be made about what is done next. \nThe removal of all remaining restrictions in England is meant to be a little over a month away, but there's a consistent caution from ministers. \nThe government is desperate not to overpromise and disappoint; many businesses and some Conservative MPs are desperate the final shackles on our liberties are thrown off, on time. \nOne former minister, Conor Burns, said the country had tolerated \"the most profound curtailment of our freedoms in peacetime\" and \"it wouldn't be right to do so again\" because some people had refused the offer of a vaccine.\nProf Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College London, told BBC Radio 4 Today's programme that, so far, the evidence was that the vaccine was still effective against the Covid variant first found in India.\nHe said \"the messaging we're hearing\" is about getting people vaccinated, including those at-risk \"who for whatever reason they may have decided not to, it may have been very difficult for them for logistical reasons\".\n\"Now really is the time to reach as many of those people as we can in case we do have a little bit of a wave of infection now, and that will give them the best chance of getting protection,\" he said.\nOn Monday millions of people were able to enjoy new freedoms - such as indoor pints, hugs with loved ones and foreign holidays - for the first time in months, under the latest relaxation of rules across England, Wales and most of Scotland.\nBut amid concern over the variant first found in India the government has warned its next review of social distancing rules - set to take place by the end of May - may be delayed.\nAs part of its road map out of lockdown, the government's plan was to end all remaining restrictions on social contact by 21 June - which would mean unlimited numbers of guests at weddings, and venues such as nightclubs being allowed to reopen.\nMinisters are said to be considering contingency plans for local lockdowns if the variant cannot be brought under control, according to the Times newspaper.\nNHS England national medical director Stephen Powis said yesterday that there had been 930,000 appointments made since the vaccination programme was opened up to 38 and 39-year-olds, and he encouraged people to accept a jab when they are offered one.\n\"Getting vaccinated is the most important step we can take to protect ourselves, our families and our communities against Covid-19, so when it is your turn to get your first or second dose please do so,\" he said.\nA further 1,976 new infections were reported in the UK on Monday, and another five deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test."

      "tags": "Israel,Gaza,Hamas",
      "text": "As international outrage mounts over the number of civilians being killed in Gaza, Israel is trying to explain its actions.\nIn a flurry of briefings, senior military officials have been describing the objectives and timeline of an operation one of them said \"might stay like this for a while\".\nFirst, some numbers: Israel says it has hit 820 different targets in the first week of action, some of them repeatedly.\nThat compares with 180 targets in Gaza during the whole of last year (a reminder that for all the ferocity of the past week, this is a long-running war).\nIn return, Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants have fired more than 3,150 rockets. In 2019, by comparison, a total of 2,045 rocket launches were recorded (another reminder). \nIsrael's operation \"Guardian of the Walls\" began with attacks on Hamas tunnels close to the border fence with Israel. Defence of Israel's nearby communities, some of which are within a few hundred metres of the fence, was a top priority.\nNext came everything associated with missiles - including launchers, manufacturing centres - closely followed by an all-out assault on Hamas's entire military infrastructure, including hundreds of miles of underground tunnels Israel's military calls \"the Metro\". \nWhen this phase began, with a ferocious bombardment on Thursday night, terrified civilians fled, fearing an imminent ground invasion. \nIt's been during this crucial phase, described by Israeli officials as the centrepiece of the operation, that the number of Palestinians killed started to rise dramatically.\nA word, here, about who those people are. It's the subject of sharply differing narratives.\nJonathan Conricus, spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), says at least 130 of the close to 200 Palestinians killed so far have been combatants. He says this is \"the most conservative estimate\".\nThis is obviously at variance with figures from the Palestinian health ministry, which in Gaza is controlled by Hamas. It says almost 100 of the dead are women and children, but never talks about fighters. \nIsrael admits that civilians are caught up in the violence, but lays the blame squarely at the feet of Hamas, which it says is guilty of cynically operating in and around the blameless citizens of Gaza.\nThe fate of the 11-storey al-Jalaa tower is a case in point. Home to the local offices of al-Jazeera and Associated Press news agency, it was also, Israel says, bristling with Hamas offices and equipment. \nThe journalists were warned that an attack was coming and given an hour to get out before the building was levelled. \nIsrael insisted it had no choice but to attack the building and said the fact that no-one was killed was an example of the lengths to which its military will go to avoid civilian casualties. \nA senior commander had words of advice for the media. \"In Gaza, don't rent your office next to Hamas. It's a very bad idea.\"\nThe assault on the \"Metro\" presents other problems. \nEarly on Sunday morning, a series of devastating air strikes on Gaza's al-Rimal neighbourhood brought three residential buildings crashing to the ground, killing 42 people. It was the deadliest single attack so far. \nAgain, Israel blames Hamas and what one officer called \"this crazy underground infrastructure\".\nThe buildings were not the target, he insisted. It was the Metro. But when part of the tunnel network collapsed, nearby foundations collapsed too. \n\"That was very unfortunate,\" the officer said. \"We're trying to learn what happened.\"\nOn Monday morning, Gazans woke up to find craters in some of the strip's busiest roads. Naturally, they assumed their civilian infrastructure was now being attacked. \nNot so, Israel said. Again, it was all about the tunnels.\nAnd there's the problem. How do you fight a war in one of the poorest, most densely populated places on earth, against an enemy who uses this to his advantage? How do you defend your own population from harm when almost everything you do affects innocent civilians?"

      "text": "UK job vacancies have hit their highest level since the start of the pandemic as the easing of lockdown measures has led employers to start recruiting.\nIn the February-to-April period there were 657,000 vacancies, up about 48,400 on the previous quarter. \nThe unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.8% in the three months to March, down from 4.9% in February, the Office for National Statistics said.\nThe ONS said there were \"early signs of recovery\" in the jobs market,\nHowever, despite the rise in job vacancies over the past 12 months, the level remains almost 128,000 below its pre-pandemic level in the January-to-March quarter of 2020.\nThe official figures confirm several reports in recent weeks by recruitment companies that they are seeing a rise in job advertisements, leading to concern among some employers that they could face staff shortages.\nThe ONS said the number of workers on payrolls had risen by 97,000 between March and April, but was still 772,000 lower than before the pandemic struck.\nDarren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics, said the number of employees on payroll \"rose strongly in April\" as the economy began to reopen, continuing an improvement from its November trough.\nBut he said: \"There remains, however, three-quarters of a million people fewer on the payroll compared with the pre-pandemic peak.\n\"With many businesses reopening, the recent recovery in job vacancies continued into April, especially in sectors such as hospitality and entertainment.\"\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures showed the impact of the government's focus on protecting jobs during the pandemic.\n\"While sadly not every job can be saved, nearly two million fewer people are now expected to be out of work than initially expected - showing our Plan for Jobs is working.\"\nBusiness leaders welcomed the vacancy levels as positive signs for the economy, but warned there was still a long way to go.\nAs many experts have pointed out, Tuesday's positive jobs news does not disguise that many people in the labour market are still struggling. \nInterior designer Sheila Smith lost her job working for hospitality venues in October - and despite some 500 applications is still unemployed.\nShe worries that businesses are looking for someone younger and cheaper than her. \"I've been for a few interviews, which I haven't been successful at,\" she told the BBC.\nShe said the most frustrating aspect of the job search was the lack of communication from potential employers.\n\"When you take time to go for a job interview, get yourself prepared, but then you hear nothing back - that's the most frustrating thing.\"\nAlthough the number of job vacancies is rising, they are still well down on pre-pandemic levels and Sheila reckons there's about 200 people applying for each post advertised.\n\"It destroys your confidence,\" she said. \"I've worked solidly for years in the industry, and you find yourself in this situation scrambling for jobs.\n\"You feel like you're stuck at square one.\"\nMatthew Percival, director of people and skills at the CBI business lobby group, said: \"Businesses are starting to report vacancies they're struggling to fill so government support for skills and retraining is essential.\"\nHe added that companies still needed clarity over the rules for the next stage of reopening the economy, which is currently planned for 21 June.\nResearch consultancy Capital Economics said the fall in the jobless rate showed that the jobs furlough scheme was \"insulating the labour market\".\nThe firm added that although it expects the unemployment rate to rise over the next few months, that would most likely be due to people returning to the labour market rather than people losing their jobs.\nThe most encouraging sign here is that vacancies over the three months to April averaged 657,000. The ONS said its experimental monthly vacancy statistics for April itself were \"at near pre-pandemic levels\". There are increasing numbers of employers expressing concern about recruitment difficulties.\nThe jobs data continue to show some signs of resilience and recovery, with unemployment down again to 4.8%, and employment up for the fifth consecutive month. It's so far a slow recovery based on gradual re-openings seen up until last month.\nThe pattern is, though, as uneven as the lifting of the restrictions. Hospitality and retail jobs are still well down on pre-pandemic levels, and this means all of the loss in payrolled jobs and more can currently be explained by what has happened to young workers. There are still over four million workers on the furlough scheme, who count as employed.\nAre you currently unemployed?

      "tags": "Plastic,Pollution,Environment",
      "text": "Just 20 companies are the source of more than half of all the single-use plastic items thrown away globally. \nThat's the conclusion of analysis of the corporate network behind plastic production. \nThe study looked at approximately 1,000 factories that make the raw materials needed for single-use products. \nPlastic bottles, food packages and bags are among billions of items that are used once and then thrown away, often ending up in the oceans.  \nThe research - carried out by a consortium including the London School of Economics - looked at which companies are at the base of the plastic supply chain and make polymers, the building blocks of all plastics.\nIt names 20 petrochemical companies which it says are the source of 55 per cent of the world's single-use plastic waste. The companies include ExxonMobil, Dow and Sinopec.\nThe study also assesses which countries generate most single-use plastic waste, based on per head of population. \nThe UK comes in fourth, with more than 40kg of plastic waste generated per person per year, the authors state, while Australia is top and the United States second.\nPart of the increase in demand for plastic stems from the need for masks and other protective and medical equipment to deal with the Covid crisis. \nPrevious research has focused on the impact of plastic waste on the natural world, or on the consumer companies making and selling consumer products packaged in plastic. \nBy contrast, this analysis tracks the flow of plastic through the supply chain, starting with the manufacturers of the basic ingredients that go into making single use items.\nThose ingredients, known as polymers, are mostly produced by processing fossil fuels including oil, gas and coal.\nThe research was led by Australia's Minderoo Foundation and a consortium including LSE, market researchers Wood Mackenzie and the Stockholm Environment Institute.\nUS-based ExxonMobil is the biggest producer of single-use plastic, the report says, followed by: Dow, Sinopec, Indorama Ventures, Saudi Aramco, PetroChina, LyondellBasell, Reliance Industries, Braskem, Alpek SA de CV, Borealis, Lotte Chemical, INEOS, Total, Jiangsu Hailun Petrochemical, Far Eastern New Century, Formosa Plastics Corporation, China Energy Investment Group, PTT and China Resources.\nAccording to the foundation's director of finance and transparency, Dominic Charles, the research highlights \"how the future of the plastic waste crisis is in the hands of just 20 companies\". \nHe says: \"It's an extraordinary point of leverage for regulators, for finance institutions, to influence them in order that rather than producing from fossil fuels, they produce plastic that's recycled.\"\nHe adds that until now the emphasis of efforts to curb plastic pollution has been on the individual choices that consumers can make. \n\"But we need to go after the tap, to turn off the tap of fossil fuel plastics and we need to create plastics from recycled material.\"\nThe report finds that plastic production is set to expand by 30% in the next five years, increasing carbon emissions as well as creating more plastic waste. \nOne of the contributors is Prof Sam Fankhauser, a specialist in climate change economics at the University of Oxford and the London School of Economics. \nHe observes: \"Our reliance on oil and gas is not only fuelling climate change, but as the primary material used in the production of throwaway plastics also devastating our oceans. \n\"It is critically important petrochemical companies move towards circular economy-based alternatives if we are going to successfully tackle these interlinked crises. \n\"The benefits on offer are transformative and hugely beneficial, not only for our environment and ecosystems but also the communities living with the realities of plastic pollution.\"\nThe world's largest producer of plastic polymers, ExxonMobil, says it shares society's concerns about plastic waste. \nIn a statement, it said: \"ExxonMobil is taking action to address plastic waste by increasing plastic recyclability, supporting improvements in plastic waste recovery - for example, through our founding membership in the Alliance to End Plastic Waste - and minimizing plastic pellet loss from our operations. \n\"We are also working on advanced recycling solutions that create and capture value from plastic waste with opportunities for lower overall greenhouse gas emissions over the full life cycle of the plastic.\"\nAnother large polymer producer, Ineos, was also asked for comment. \nAccording to its website, the company is working on ways to chemically recycle plastic, adding that \"the holy grail of plastic recycling is fast becoming a reality and will mean we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels to make our products\".\nIt comes as Greenpeace reported yesterday that plastic waste collected for recycling from British households had been found dumped in Turkey."

      "text": "Joe Biden has brought back a US presidential tradition by releasing his tax return, the White House said.\nThe filing shows he and his wife earned $607,336 (\u00a3430,000) last year and paid $157,414 in federal income tax.\nTheir income fell from 2019 when they earned $985,223 mostly from speeches, book sales and positions at higher education institutions. \nDonald Trump refused to release his tax returns, the first president not to do so since the Watergate era.\nMr Trump claimed he was not able to do so as he was being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, the US government's tax-collection agency.\nAhead of the tax filing's release on Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said: \"I would expect that we will continue to release the president's tax returns, as should be expected by every president of the United States.\"\nThrowing down the gauntlet to Mr Trump ahead of the 2020 election, Mr Biden released 22 years of tax filings.  \nThe document, released on Monday, shows that during the busy election campaign year the Bidens paid a federal income tax rate of 25.9%, the White House said.\nThey also donated $30,704 to 10 charities in 2020. The biggest sum of $10,000 went to the Beau Biden Foundation, which campaigns against child abuse and is named after the president's son, who died aged 46 in 2015 of brain cancer.\nJoe and Jill Biden's previous tax returns have shown they donated $70,000 to charity in total over the two decades leading up to 2017.\nThe Bidens also have assets of between $1.2m and $2.88m, according to their financial disclosure form released on Monday. \nDuring last year's presidential race, Mr Biden's campaign said he and his wife made $11m in 2017 and $4.6m the year after.\nThe couple's previous tax filings have shown how they were able to lower their tax bill by funnelling book and speech income through so-called S Corporations, thereby benefiting from a tax loophole that the Obama administration - in which Mr Biden served as vice-president - tried and failed to close.\nMr Biden's current salary as president is $400,000.\nThe Democratic president is proposing tax rises on Americans who earn more than $400,000 in order to help fund one of the biggest expansions of the welfare state in decades and a wide-ranging jobs plan.\nUS Vice-President Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff also released their joint tax return for 2020.\nIt showed they had reported a federal adjusted gross income of $1,695,225, said the White House. \nThe couple paid $621,893 in federal income tax, amounting to a 2020 effective federal income tax rate of 36.7%.\u00a0They gave $27,006 to charity.\nMs Harris received an advance of $359,000 for her book, The Truths We Hold.\nBefore the election, Mr Emhoff was a partner in entertainment and intellectual property at multinational law firm DLA Piper."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "After months of good news, including falling Covid cases and a hugely successful vaccination campaign, the tone has shifted.\nEngland's full relaxation of rules in June is in jeopardy and there is the looming spectre of greater pressure on the NHS. \nThe thorn in the plans is the variant of coronavirus that emerged in India - B.1.617.2 - and has started spreading around the world.\nConcerns have been mounting over the past week and, for the first time, the scientists advising the UK government are now confident it does spread more easily. \nThe expectation is the variant will edge out the one that emerged in Kent and eventually \"dominate\" cases in the UK. \nWe are in a race between the virus and the vaccine. Easing restrictions on Monday and a more transmissible variant means the virus will move even faster. \nBut there is still huge uncertainty about exactly how much better the B.1.617.2 variant is at spreading. \n\"That's a really critical question to which we do not yet have the answer,\" said Prof Chris Whitty.\nIf it is just a smidge faster than the Kent variant, which still makes up the overwhelming majority of cases in the UK, then there's not much to worry about.  \nHowever, the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) says there is a \"realistic possibility\" it could spread 50% faster, which is a lot. \nThere are some higher estimates of 60% coming out of India, but these are based on published genetic sequences from viral samples and its not clear how representative of the overall picture they are.\nSage estimates the problems would really start with a variant that was 40% more transmissible as it \"would lead to a substantial resurgence of hospitalisations\" and put pressure on the NHS. \nThe uncertainty is reminiscent of last year when the new variant in Kent was first detected and raised questions about the approach to controlling the virus. \nBut it is important to remember we are not in the same situation as last year. \nMore than 19 million people - a third of the adult population - have had both jabs of their vaccine. Another 17 million have had one. Vaccines are weakening, if not eliminating, the link between infection and severe disease. \nAnd overall cases are also far lower. The Office for National Statistics estimates fewer than 50,000 people currently have the virus. The figure was 1.25 million at the start of the year. Currently there are only around 1,000 people in hospital with Covid.\nThe concern is that while vaccines are great they are not perfect and not everyone who is vulnerable has had one. So if there was another wave of cases from the combination of relaxing and a new variant then a worrying number of people could still end up in hospital. \nNote these predictions are not crystal balls. Earlier mathematical models had predicted a summer wave, but suddenly became far more optimistic once it became clear vaccinated people were less likely to spread the virus. \nPlans to reopen are going ahead, but the vaccination campaign is being tweaked to give more vulnerable people more immunity more quickly. \nThe hope is if the variant is going to pose a problem then there will be time to spot any further warning signs - such as a rise in hospital admissions - and then act.\nThe prime minister, Boris Johnson, said that if the Indian variant proves to be \"significantly more transmissible\" than other strains then \"we're likely to face some hard choices\" in the UK.\nBut the problem posed by more transmissible variants is far greater in countries that haven't got successful vaccination programmes, where they could be hugely damaging.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "The government has no plan to meet the \"huge challenge\" of persuading motorists to switch to electric vehicles, MPs have warned.\nThe Public Accounts Committee said the official target of banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 could be missed without urgent action.  \nIt also argued that electric vehicles were still too expensive and there were not enough charging points.  \nThe government said it was on track to meet its targets.\nA spokesman said it was investing \u00a32.8bn to help the car industry and drivers make the switch to electric.\nSales of electric vehicles are by far the fastest growing segment of the car market, but they still only account for only 11% of new registrations. \nThe committee warned that this would not get to 100% unless prices fell and charging infrastructure was installed quickly. \nOnly 13 electric car models on sale in the UK at the moment cost less than \u00a330,000, its report said.\nIt pointed out that the majority of charging took place at home and claimed the government had not focused enough on helping people who do not have off-street parking.\nThe committee also said the government needed to develop the skilled workforce and electric power infrastructure needed to support the transition.  \nIts chairwoman, Labour MP Meg Hillier, said the UK had \"a mountain to climb\" to meet its targets.\nChallenges included making the car industry \"environmentally and socially compliant\", but getting the government \"wean itself off carbon revenues\" could be the biggest obstacle, she added.\n\"What we've got is a government throwing up a few signs around base camp, and no let-up in demand for oversized, petrol-guzzling vehicles,\" Ms Hillier said.\nBut the government said it had a \"highly ambitious and world-leading approach to increasing the uptake of zero-emission cars\".\nA spokesperson said the \"progress we're making in this area will help us to meet our targets\".\nThe government had allocated \u00a31.3bn over the next four years to support the roll-out of charging points on motorways and major A roads, in homes and businesses and on streets, they added.\nThe cost of electric vehicles would fall as production scaled up around the world, the spokesperson claimed.\nThe RAC motoring group said it expected sales to grow further as new models came out.\nIt called for the government to look at \"ways to incentivise take-up\", adding that the plug-in grant - under which motorists are given help in purchasing zero-emissions vehicles - was not guaranteed to continue beyond 2023.\nSales of new hybrid vehicles are to be banned from 2035, under government plans."

      "tags": "Film",
      "text": "Charles Grodin, an American actor whose comic roles in films such as Midnight Run and Beethoven brought smiles to faces for decades, has died at 86.\nGrodin died at his home in Wilton, Connecticut on Tuesday, the New York Times newspaper reported.\nThe actor's son, Nicholas, told the newspaper his cause of death was bone marrow cancer.\nKnown for his dry wit, Grodin was a familiar face in Hollywood comedies and prime-time talk shows in the US.\nTributes have been made on social media, including a tweet from fellow American actor Steve Martin, who described Grodin as \"one of the funniest people I ever met\".\nBorn in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Grodin dropped his studies at the University of Miami to launch a career in acting. \nIt was a decision that paid off in the 1960s, when he started to land parts in plays on Broadway, including his debut in a production of Tchin-Tchin, which starred Anthony Quinn. \nHe soon moved to TV and film, building his profile with a small role in Rosemary's Baby, a 1968 psychological horror film written and directed by Roman Polanski.\nBut the 1970s was the decade Grodin's career really took off. A series of roles in films including Catch-22 in 1970 and The Heartbreak Kid in 1972 cemented his status as one of Hollywood's go-to comedy actors.\nFor his role in The Heartbreak Kid - in which he plays an unlucky-in-love sporting goods salesman - he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for best actor.\nThe fact he didn't win the award may not have bothered him too much.\n\"I never complain about anything, because I'm aware of what's going on around me, and I'm also aware that there are a lot of very gifted people that never even get a job in show business,\" Grodin told the AV Club website in a 2009 interview. \"It's just because they can't handle the rejection, and I can handle it, and I'm used to it.\"\nGrodin had his share of success as well. He won best actor at the 1988 Valladolid International Film Festival for his role in Midnight Run. In that film, a 1988 action-comedy, he co-starred with Robert De Niro as an accountant who embezzled millions from a mob boss.\nGrodin also won an Emmy as a co-writer on a 1977 Paul Simon TV special, hosted his own 1990s chat show, and was a regular fixture on shows hosted by Johnny Carson, David Letterman and Jay Leno.\nOne of Grodin's most well-known roles was in the popular family film Beethoven in 1992. He plays a short-tempered dad who, to his fury, is bedevilled by a slobbering, accident-prone dog."

      "tags": "Israel & the Palestinians,Israel,Gaza,West Bank",
      "text": "Israel's nine-day bombardment of Gaza has \"set Hamas back by many years\", Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said.\nIsrael and Palestinian militant groups in Gaza again exchanged fire overnight into the early hours of Wednesday.\nDiplomatic efforts to end the violence have met with little success. \nFrance has filed a draft resolution with the UN Security Council, in co-ordination with Egypt and Jordan, calling for a ceasefire.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Israel briefly opened a border crossing into Gaza to allow a convoy of aid to enter. However, the crossing was closed again after it came under fire from Palestinian mortars and rockets. \nHamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza, had been dealt \"unexpected blows\" and operations would \"continue for as long as it takes to restore calm\" for all Israeli citizens, he said.  \nAt least 215 people, including almost 100 women and children, have been killed in Gaza so far, according to its health ministry.\nIn Israel 12 people, including two children, have been killed, its medical service says.\nOn Tuesday Israel said at least 150 militants were among those killed in Gaza. Hamas does not give casualty figures for fighters.\nIsrael estimated that at the start of the conflict, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the two main groups in Gaza, had an arsenal of about 12,000 rockets or mortars.\nAs of 15:00 GMT on Tuesday, militants had fired some 3,300 rockets at Israel, of which 450 to 500 fell short, causing casualties in Gaza, an Israeli military spokesman said. \nSirens sounded in southern and central Israel in response to the latest barrage of Palestinian rockets.  \nIsraeli aircraft carried out dozens of raids, many of them on the city of Khan Younis.\nTwo Palestinian militants were killed in an Israeli air raid targeting an apartment in a building in central Gaza City on Wednesday morning, the BBC's Rushdi Abualouf reports.\nMany Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem took part in a general strike to protest at the  bombing of Gaza. Areas inside Israel with an Israeli Arab majority, such as Haifa, also joined the strike. \nPublic services, schools and many businesses were closed. \nThere were clashes in several locations. In the West Bank town of Ramallah, Israeli police said they were fired on during a \"violent riot\" and returned fire. \nThree Palestinians in the area were killed, the health ministry said. Another Palestinian was killed after he attempted to attack soldiers in Hebron, the Israeli army said. \nEarlier on Tuesday, Israel opened the Kerem Shalom crossing to allow aid into Gaza, but closed it again after Palestinian militants fired mortars at the area. \nTwo Thai nationals working on a farm 14km (nine miles) from the border were killed. \nMeanwhile at the Rafah crossing with Egypt, the only entry point to Gaza not controlled by Israel, a convoy of 15 lorries carrying fuel and 18 loaded with food and medicine entered the territory. \nThe UN humanitarian agency Ocha said 52,000 people in Gaza had been displaced, of whom 47,000 had fled to UN schools. \nIn New York, the latest meeting of the UN Security Council again failed to reach agreement on a response.\nFrance said its draft resolution was compiled during a video-conference with Egypt's leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Jordan's King Abdullah II.\nThe US has blocked previous attempts to issue a joint Security Council statement calling for an immediate ceasefire.\nThe US, the EU and other powers have called for an end to the conflict. Egypt has been seeking to mediate between Israel and Hamas. \nHowever, Israel has said it will continue its offensive for now, in an effort to destroy the capabilities of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. \nThe Palestinian ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, called the Security Council's failure to express a unified position \"shameful\".\nMeanwhile, the US has accused Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of making \"anti-Semitic\" remarks about Israel. \nHe accused Israel of \"terrorism\" against the Palestinians and recently said: \"It is in their nature\". He then called Israel \"murderers\" and used terminology widely seen as promoting anti-Semitic stereotypes.  \n\"The United States strongly condemns President Erdogan's recent anti-Semitic comments regarding the Jewish people and finds them reprehensible,\" State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.\n\"We urge President Erdogan and other Turkish leaders to refrain from incendiary remarks, which could incite further violence,\" he said.\nThe fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. \nThe site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded.\nPalestinian anger had already been stoked by weeks of rising tension in East Jerusalem, inflamed by a series of confrontations with police since mid-April.\nIt was further fuelled by Israel's annual celebration of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day.\nThe fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of other countries. \nPalestinians claim the eastern half of Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own."

      "tags": "Tourism,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Thomas Cook Group,TUI Travel,Portugal,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Thousands of British holidaymakers have begun taking advantage of the easing of lockdown rules on overseas travel.\nTravellers from England, Scotland and Wales are jetting off to some countries in what the crisis-hit tourism industry hopes is the start of a recovery.\nTravellers can now visit 12 countries on the government's green list, including Portugal and Israel, without isolating on their return.\nThe bosses of British Airways and Ryanair said confidence was returning.\nThe vast majority of tourist destinations remain on the amber and red lists, meaning travellers must quarantine when they get back.\nBookings also remain well down on pre-pandemic levels. \nHowever, BA chief executive Sean Doyle told the BBC that the airline's six flights due to depart from Heathrow on Monday to \"green\" destinations such as Lisbon, Faro and Madeira were \"very busy\".\nHe said the latest relaxation of restrictions was \"a small step in the right direction\".\nRyanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said there were definite signs of an early rebound in travel to European destinations.\nBookings are up from 500,000 a week in early April to 1.5 million a week now. \"The rate of bookings suggests there is a huge amount of confidence,\" he told BBC Breakfast. \"We are very optimistic for the next couple of months.\"\nNellie and Jill are off to Portugal on Monday - but it seemed touch and go right up to the moment they got to the airport.\nThey are \"super excited and really happy to be able to travel again\". But the past few weeks have been stressful, especially as it was only confirmed on Friday that they could definitely travel.\nNellie said it was then a real scramble to get PCR coronavirus tests over the weekend, which Jill added was quite complicated. \n\"Adding all the documentation wasn't easy but we persevered and we're glad we did,\" Jill said. Some holiday sun and a glass of wine on their balcony would make it all worth it, she added.\nGatwick Airport chief executive Stewart Wingate said welcoming holidaymakers for the first time in months was a \"big relief\".\nHe expected the number of travellers to increase significantly by the end of May - but this will still be less than 15% of the traffic seen in pre-pandemic times.\n\"It's an important day for us... we're looking forward to seeing more countries added to the green list in the weeks ahead,\" he added.\nBut there is still caution. Online travel agent Thomas Cook said the number of people booking to travel abroad was \"still small\".\nIt said 75% of its bookings were for Portugal, although Thomas Cook customers planning to jet off this week numbered only in their hundreds.\nOn Friday, Portugal announced that travellers from the UK would be allowed to enter its borders provided they could show a negative PCR test result from the previous 72 hours.\nThat led to an increase in demand for flights to the country. Tui, which has 19 flights scheduled from the UK to Portugal next week, said eight of those would now be on a Boeing Dreamliner, which can carry up to 345 people - almost twice as many people as the Boeing 737s that it had planned to use.\nMany of those who do intend to get away plan to do so in style. Thomas Cook reported that 85% of customers had booked four or five-star hotels. Before the crisis, only around half of people chose to splash out on that kind of luxury.\nHays Travel has noticed a similar trend. At present around half of its customers are booking for next year but it highlighted a \"cautious optimism\" among travellers following an almost four-fold increase in bookings for Portugal this summer.\nChief operating officer Jonathon Woodall said the average spend on a two-week holiday for a family of four had increased by \u00a3370 to \u00a34,000 as people look to \"fulfil their bucket list\". \n\"People are upgrading to better destinations and accommodation, spending more to treat themselves,\" he said. \nAfter months of keeping apart, travelling on a busy plane feels both familiar and strange. Face masks are mandatory except to allow for eating and drinking, but seats are not socially distanced. I was handed a complimentary antibacterial wipe on boarding. \nThe paperwork is far more complicated than normal. Alongside my passport and ticket, I'm carrying proof of my negative PCR test, a passenger locator form for Portugal and proof of my booked tests for my journey home. I'll have to complete another locator form to come back to the U.K. \nStill at 35,000 feet, we don't know how long the queues will be at the Portuguese border when we land or on the return journey. \nPassengers on board have said they feel a little like guinea pigs. The travel industry knows it's important to make this process smooth and safe if it's to have a good summer. \nWhile travel from England, Scotland and Wales is permitted to the 12 countries on the green list, most of the destinations are either remote islands or do not currently allow UK tourists to enter.\nAnd the government is advising people not to make non-essential trips to locations on its amber list, which covers popular destinations such as Spain, France, Italy and Greece. However, the guidance is expected to be ignored by some holidaymakers.\nEasyJet and Tui have both said that they will operate holidays to countries classified as amber, provided Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) does not advise against \"all but essential\" travel.\nThe majority of countries around the world are in the amber category, meaning that arrivals from these places to the UK are required to quarantine at home for 10 days as well as taking a Covid test before departure and two more on arrival.\nTravellers arriving back in England from an amber country have the option after five days of quarantine to pay for a private Covid test under the Test to Release scheme. If the result is negative, the quarantine can end.\nBA boss Sean Doyle said \"cautious optimism\" should be exercised when decisions are made about whether to expand the green list when it is reviewed on 7 June. \nHe said vaccination and infection rates in a number of the major aviation markets were \"trending positively\", noting that the US - an important market for both tourism and business \"now has 60% of its adult population vaccinated [and] infections are falling\". \nFrom Monday, people travelling abroad will be able to use the NHS app - which is different to the NHS Covid-19 app - to prove they have had the vaccine.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps previously said people who have had both doses will be able to use the app at border controls, although the government says people should still check countries' entry requirements as tests or quarantine might still be needed.\nAre you travelling abroad today?

      "text": "There is \"nothing conclusive\" in the data that means England \"would have to deviate from the roadmap\" out of lockdown, Boris Johnson has said.\nThe government plans to end remaining legal limits on social contact from 21 June, but there is increasing concern about the Indian variant.\nThe situation, including data from hotspots such as Bolton, was \"under close review\", the prime minister said.\nMinisters will \"let people know in a few days' time\" after data is studied.\nSpeaking on a visit to a vaccination centre in London, Mr Johnson continued to urge people to be cautious.\nHe said the situation with the Indian variant was \"under very careful, close review\", saying: \"We're looking at all the data as it comes in from places like Bolton, Blackburn, Bedford, Sefton.\"\nMr Johnson said they were trying to understand if the Indian variant was more transmissible and \"to what extent our vaccine programme has sufficiently fortified us\".\n\"We've got a few more days of looking at that data,\" he said.\nIt comes as the UK recorded another seven deaths within 28 days of a positive test and 2,412 new cases. \nOn Monday the government said 86 local councils in England had five or more cases of the variant first discovered in India, which is thought to be more transmissible. \nIn Bolton, a new vaccine centre has opened up and ministers have been stepping up calls for people to book vaccinations as soon as they are offered appointments.\nElsewhere, regional public health directors are concerned about rising cases of the variant in London. Cases have spread across a number of boroughs, although currently most are linked to foreign travel. \nThe prime minister's official spokesman said that while the government was not ruling out measures such as local lockdowns at this stage, it was \"too early to speculate\" on what future measures it may need to take.\nAsked if a decision was expected sooner than 14 June on progressing to the final step of England's roadmap, the spokesman said that in relation to certification and social distancing, ministers \"do want to update pubs and businesses, if possible, before 14 June\".\nBut he added they needed to \"allow the experts to do their work\" and \"couldn't be more specific on timings\".\nDay by day the scientists are learning more about the Indian variant - and the implications for the UK.\nOn Friday it was reported the variant could be 50% more transmissible than the UK variant, which was responsible for the deadly winter wave.\nBut confidence in that figure was always a little shaky. In the past few days there are some tentative signs its advantage over the UK variant may not be so great.\nThat's important. There's estimated to be an eight-fold difference between the impact in terms of hospital admissions a variant with a 20% advantage will have compared to one with a 50% advantage.\nThat clearly has a major implication for what restrictions are needed while the vaccination programme continues to be rolled out.\nThe next significant update is expected on Thursday. It will be too soon for a definitive answer, but it should help us understand more about what the variant means for the UK.\nRead more from Nick\nThe government has already warned its next review of social distancing rules - set to take place by the end of May - may be delayed because of concern over the variant.\nOn Monday millions of people were able to enjoy new freedoms - such as drinking indoors in pubs, hugs with loved ones and foreign holidays - for the first time in months, under the latest relaxation of rules across England, Wales and most of Scotland.\nHowever, Labour has accused the government of \"giving out conflicting and confused advice\" about travel to countries on the amber travel list, where people must quarantine for up to 10 days on their return to the UK. \nGovernment guidance states people should not travel to amber list countries. \nBut earlier Environment Secretary George Eustice suggested in a BBC interview that people could travel to such destinations if they \"feel the need\" to visit family or friends. \nAsked about the issue, Mr Johnson said it was \"very important people grasp what the amber list is - not somewhere to go on holiday\".\nHe said travellers should only go to these countries for \"pressing family or business reasons\". Those who break their self-isolation period on returning to the UK from these destinations face \u00a310,000 fines, he added. \nYvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said the current traffic light system was \"very messy\" and \"clearly isn't working\", adding that it should be linked to legal restrictions. \n\"We all seem to be in a position where the government has opened up to summer holiday travel by accident, by making it possible, but at the same time, a day later, saying 'no, people should not be travelling to amber countries,'\" the Labour MP told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme.\nMeanwhile, Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, which developed the AstraZeneca vaccine, has said it feels \"morally wrong\" that children in some richer countries are being offered a Covid-19 jab before some high-risk people in poorer countries.\nHe told the All Party Parliamentary Group on coronavirus: \"There are many unvaccinated people in the world whilst people whose risk is extremely low are being vaccinated, including children who have near to zero the risk of severe disease or death.\n\"That inequity is absolutely plain to see at this moment in a very troubling way.\""

      "tags": "Glasgow,DNA,Partick",
      "text": "Graham McGill strangled Mary McLaughlin with her own dressing gown cord - and was back in his prison cell the morning after the murder.\nSex offender McGill was on the last night of temporary release from jail when he killed the mother-of-11 in her Glasgow flat.\nMary was found dead in her bedroom six days later, on 2 October 1984.\nAs a major investigation was launched, her killer was already locked up, less than 50 miles away in HMP Edinburgh.\nBy the end of the month McGill, who had just turned 23, was a free man with a dark secret. \nIt would be 35 years before a DNA breakthrough finally solved one of Scotland's most perplexing cold cases.\nNow McGill - who still maintains his innocence - has been sentenced to a minimum of 14 years in jail after being found guilty of Mary's murder.\nMary McLaughlin spent her last night out drinking and playing dominos in the Hyndland Pub, now the Duck Club, which looks onto Mansfield Park  in the west end of Glasgow.\nIt was 26 September 1984 and the 58-year-old was joined by one of her daughters.\nNow aged 73, Catherin Mullen gave evidence during McGill's trial at the High Court in Glasgow. Asked if Mary was drunk, she replied: \"She didn't act drunk - she was happy.\"\nCatherine left the pub to catch a bus home - and never saw her mother again.\nMary was last seen leaving the bar, on Hyndland Street, at about 22:45 to walk less than a mile home to her Partick flat.\nAlong the way she called into Armando's chip shop on Dumbarton Road, where she joked with staff as she bought fritters and cigarettes.\nDavid Seager, who knew her as Wee May, recalled that she walked in front of his taxi carrying her shoes in her hands.\nDuring the trial he was also asked if he thought a man he saw standing outside a shoe shop was following her.\nHe replied: \"Well yes. Every time Mary walked away he was always behind her.\"\nThe defence cast doubt on whether this was the accused, as Mr Seager did not mention the scar which runs from one of McGill's ears to his chin.\nBut what is certain is that a short time later McGill struck up a conversation with Mary and walked her back to the Crathie Court block on Laurel Street, where she lived alone.\nDetectives said McGill was a stranger to the area and to a woman who was more than double his age.\nProsecutor Alex Prentice QC told the jury: \"Mary McLaughlin was someone who was friendly and trusting and I would suggest that ultimately brought about her death.\"\nOnce inside the third-floor flat McGill launched what was described in court as a brutal, sexually motivated attack.\nIt ended with the grandmother being strangled and left lying on her back, covered with a green dress which had been put on back to front.\nAt the time McGill, who had been convicted of rape in 1981, was in the final weeks of a six-year sentence, which had been halved due to good behaviour.\nBBC Scotland can reveal he was granted temporary release from HMP Edinburgh, as part of a training for freedom programme, on 21 September 1984.\nMcGill returned to prison on 27 September - just hours after leaving Mary's flat and using her keys to lock the door behind him. \nIn an era before mobile phones, Mary was not in frequent contact with her large family who lived in Glasgow, Lanarkshire and Ayrshire.\nOnce a week one of her sons, Martin Cullen, would call in to see her.\nBut when the then 24-year-old turned up at the flat on 2 October 1984, there was no answer and a \"horrible smell\" coming from inside.\nMr Cullen got a key from a neighbour but was still unable to get into the flat, so had to kick the door in.\nHis ex-partner went inside and came out screaming. Mr Mullen, now 60, told the jury: \"My mum was dead.\"\nA post-mortem examination concluded that Mary had died after being strangled at least five days earlier.\nThe key pillars of a modern murder investigation - DNA, CCTV, digital forensics and social media - were not available to detectives in 1984 and they had very little to work with.\nThere were no witnesses and, despite taking hundreds of statements, officers from the then Strathclyde Police were met with a poor response from the local community.\nForensic science was always going to be the key to unlocking the case, but by 2008 four separate reviews had failed to yield a profile of the suspect.\nThe fifth review was launched in 2014 and the eventual breakthrough was made possible by a new DNA-profiling facility at the Scottish Crime Campus in Gartcosh, North Lanarkshire.\nPreviously experts could look at 11 individual DNA markers but the latest technology was capable of identifying 24. \nThis dramatically increased the odds of scientists obtaining a result from smaller or lower-quality samples.\nTom Nelson, director of forensics for the Scottish Police Authority, said in 2015 that the technology would make it possible to \"reach back in time, with the potential to rekindle justice for those who had all but given up hope\".\nAt the time of the murder experts only had very basic opportunities open to them, such as blood grouping and serum testing.\nForensic scientist Joanne Cochrane said: \"One of the benefits of a case from that era is that often very little was done with the productions.\n\"They have been kept almost untouched for a number of years, which leaves us with quite a lot of opportunities to explore.\"\nIn Mary's case experts decided in 2019 to untie a knot in the ligature that had been tightened by the killer 35 years earlier.\nThis time they were able to take advantage of technology she described as \"gold standard\".\nMs Cochrane told the trial: \"We felt that within the knot might be protected from contamination. We felt there was a possibility of retrieving DNA from within the knot. \n\"We did it very slowly... it was very difficult to unfasten.\"\nPeter Tobin was jailed in 2008 for the 1991 murder of Bathgate schoolgirl Vicky Hamilton. Her body was found in 2007, buried along with the remains of 18-year-old Dinah McNicol in the garden of Tobin's former home in Kent. \nAngus Sinclair raped and strangled 17-year-olds Helen Scott and Christine Eadie after a night out at the World's End pub on Edinburgh's Royal Mile in 1977. He was jailed for a minimum of 37 years in 2014 after becoming the first person in Scotland to be tried for the same crime twice after a change in double jeopardy laws.\nJohn Docherty murdered 16-year-old Elaine Doyle in Greenock as she made her way home from a nightclub in June 1986 - but he was not convicted until 2014. His case was the first to go to trial following an investigation by the Crown Office's cold case unit.\nPrevious examinations of the cord had only found Mary's DNA and a trace that was not possible to analyse.\nBut DNA24 analysis picked up a minor profile from the knot.\nAnd when it was run through the Scottish database, police finally had a prime suspect.\nThe jury heard the likelihood of the forensic sample on the cord belonging to someone other than McGill was 85,000 to one.\nProfiles were also found on a cigarette butt and on Mary's dress but this time the odds of it not being McGill soared to a billion to one.\nA fourth sample was found on a black bra he took from the flat but which was later found in a nearby garden.\nDet Supt Suzanne Chow said McGill was confused when officers finally turned up at his door on 4 December 2019. \nShe said: \"He was quite tight lipped. You could tell he was shell-shocked and he probably wasn't expecting his past to come back and haunt him 35 years later.\"\nAt the time of his arrest he was still being managed as a sex offender, but was working in the Glasgow area as a fabricator for a company based in Linwood, Renfrewshire.\nAfter McGill's conviction last month, the court heard he was also jailed for life in 1999 for a brutal assault with intent to ravish and released on licence in 2007.\nDet Supt Chow described McGill as \"a sexual predator and a real danger to the public\".\nDuring the investigation Police Scotland's homicide governance review team trawled through his life and tracked down his ex-wife, Suzanne Russell.\nShe recalled a conversation from 1988 in which he confessed to killing a woman he met in a pub after going back to her flat.\nBut Ms Russell later told the jury that McGill threatened to kill her if she ever told anyone.\nShe added: \"He said he strangled her and said he just wanted to know what it felt like to kill someone.\n\"He said he used her tights and said he was shocked how long it took to actually murder her.\"\nWHO KILLED EMMA? Sam Poling investigates the brutal murder of Emma Caldwell\nTHE DOORSTEP MURDER: The murder of Alistair Wilson is one of Scotland\u2019s most baffling unsolved cases\nAfter three days of evidence, the jury in McGill's trial took just over two hours to return a unanimous guilty verdict.\nOn Tuesday, the 59-year-old was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 14 years in prison.\nLord Burns said McGill had murdered Mary after a \"chance encounter\", and that he had shown no remorse.\nThe judge added that Mary's family had been forced to wait more than 35 years to discover who was responsible for her death - knowing that whoever was responsible was probably still at large.\n\"They have never given up hope,\" he said.\nAfter the sentence, Mary's son Martin Cullen said: \"Hopefully he dies in jail.\"\nPolice believe the prosecution will now give hope to other families waiting for justice.  \nDet Supt Chow said: \"These cases are not forgotten about. Just because they are not resolved at the time doesn't mean that we don't still think about these people who have been victims of crimes and that we don't think about their families.\"\nShe added that McGill's conviction also sends out a powerful message to other cold case killers.\n\"Your past doesn't go away. It will come back and haunt you one day.\""

      "tags": "Clowne,Chesterfield",
      "text": "A teenager with a rare illness that has caused her hair to fall out can now wear a cap to school after pupils protested when her request was denied.\nElla Goodwin's father said the 13-year-old was told a cap or hoodie was not part of the uniform policy at Heritage High School in Clowne, Derbyshire.\nThe row led to a protest outside the school involving dozens of Ella's fellow pupils on Monday morning.\nThe school confirmed it has been agreed Ella can wear a cap and hoodie.\nHowever Ella said she was frustrated that the school did not agree to her request earlier.\n\"Rules should be bent for someone going through something like this.\n\"But it was an amazing feeling just to know how many people supported me.\n\"I'm not ashamed... but wearing a cap and hoodie just gives me confidence and comfort. I would not have gone back to school without it,\" she said.\nElla was diagnosed two years ago with CRMO (chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis), a disease where the immune system attacks the bones and causes pain and swelling.\nRecently, her hair has started falling out. Her father Shaun Goodwin said doctors are unsure if the hair loss is a symptom or a side effect of medication she has to take.\nElla has had her head shaved and was given a wig by the Little Princess Trust, but Mr Goodwin said she did not feel comfortable in it.\nHe said he and partner Joanna Davies had a meeting with the school last week in which they were told a cap - including one with school branding - was not part of the uniform policy. \nThe row sparked a backlash among parents and pupils, and 25 to 30 children protested the decision on Monday morning, many of whom wore caps and hoodies in solidarity.\n\"We went up to the school to support Ella and the amount of children and parents stood there with hats on - it's amazing.\n\"The support of the community is outstanding.\"\nMs Davies added: \"She [Ella] doesn't want to have to wear the cap but her hair loss is beyond her control. \n\"Even though everyone knows she's lost her hair, she uses the hat and hoodie to control who sees it and says when she is shielding it she feels in control. \n\"Even in the house she wears the hat, it's like her comfort blanket.\"\nA spokesperson for the Two Counties Trust - which the school is part of - said: \"We are happy to confirm that we have now been able to speak to Ella's family and have agreed with them that Ella can wear a cap and a hoodie to ensure she feels as comfortable and supported as possible when at school.\n\"We will continue to do everything we can to ensure Ella and her family are appropriately supported through this challenging period. No student has been sanctioned around this matter.\" \nMr Goodwin said: \"It's amazing, but it shouldn't have got to this in the first place. \n\"They ought to have come to this decision quicker, but I'm well chuffed. \n\"Seeing the protest and the amount of support she had brought a lump to my throat.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

Mr Justice Fraser said a custodial sentence was inevitable.\nThe jury reached a majority decision after 12 hours of deliberation. \nThe jury was told Johnson had lied \"prolifically\" and \"significantly undermined\" the trial in 1987.\nJohnson claimed she had acted under duress and \"had no choice\" but to lie during the trial more than 30 years ago.\nJurors heard Ms Johnson first told police a sweatshirt found near the scene belonged to Bishop, but later denied it in a witness statement and at his first trial.\nMr Justice Fraser said Johnson was \"infatuated\" with Bishop but the relationship had been \"problematic\".\nKaren and Nicola's parents - Michelle and Lee Hadaway and Susan and Barrie Fellows - did not give up their fight for justice and in 1988 called on Sussex Police to reinvestigate the case.\nMr Fellows told the BBC at the time: \"There's a man out there (who) murdered two little girls.\"\nSome of the girls' family members wept as verdicts on Johnson were delivered.\nAfter his acquittal, Bishop went on to attack a seven-year-old girl on the South Downs in 1990. She was kidnapped, sexually assaulted and left for dead.\nBishop was sentenced to life in prison. \nHe was finally convicted of the murders of Karen and Nicola in 2018 following a DNA breakthrough that linked the sweatshirt to the girls and his home.\nFollowing Johnson's conviction, Libby Clark, senior crown prosecutor at the CPS, said: \"Jennifer Johnson's deception caused decades of distress to the families of Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway. \n\"Her actions were clearly those of someone who wanted their partner acquitted of murder, rather than a person living in fear.\"\nAfter the hearing, Sussex Police Ch Supt Nick May said Johnson's lies \"mattered\".\nHe said her lies had undermined a key part of the prosecution in 1987.\nDuring the trial, the prosecution claimed Johnson stood to benefit from Bishop selling his story as an innocent man to the News of the World for \u00a315,000.\nAfter the verdicts, Nicola's family criticised the now-closed Sunday newspaper and said it \"provided encouragement for for Johnson to lie\".\nLorna Clary, Nicola's cousin, said: \"As a key witness in Bishop's 1987 trial, she [Johnson] lied knowing that there would be a huge financial reward if Bishop received two acquittals for the double child murders.\n\"He did indeed receive the wrongful acquittals. The News of the World got their stories. The perpetrators got their payday.\n\"Our two families were devastated again after those verdicts, yet on the same evening, Johnson and the Bishops celebrated with a funded champagne dinner at the Hilton Hotel. They should all hang their heads in shame.\"\nShe urged other historical murder families to \"take hope\", adding: \"The truth does eventually catch up with those who hide in plain sight.\"\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "text": "A decision about whether key workers with long Covid should get compensation could take more than a year, government advisers have told the BBC.\nIt comes after 65 MPs and peers wrote to Boris Johnson asking for the illness to be made an \"occupational disease\". \nMore than a million people in the UK are thought to have long Covid, including over 120,000 healthcare workers.\nThe government says it is committed to supporting people through the pandemic.\nFrontline key workers who believe they caught long Covid through their jobs are becoming increasingly worried about what financial support is available to them if they cannot return to work.\nDr Asad Khan, a respiratory consultant in Manchester, was treating Covid patients every day using what he calls an \"abysmal\" level of personal protective equipment (PPE) because of \"inadequate\" government guidelines.\nHe caught Covid in November and has now been off work for nearly six months with a number of debilitating symptoms - including extreme fatigue, heart palpitations and an inability to control his bodily functions. \nHe is currently on full sick pay which he has been told will last a year but, given the severity of his condition, he is already worried what will happen after that.\n\"Theoretically I could lose my job. I could be retired sick, which is a scary prospect,\" he said.\nHe now wants the government to step in and provide financial support.\n\"There are tens of thousands of us who are living with the illness, unable to work, unable to function.\n\"We answered the call to action when we were needed, the decent thing to do now would be to ensure those of us who have acquired Covid as a result of increased exposure to the virus should be assured of some financial compensation.\"\nWhile NHS staff with long Covid receive full pay for a year in England and Wales - and longer in Scotland and Northern Ireland - many in the private sector only get 28 weeks Statutory Sick Pay.\nClaire* was working with Covid patients in a care home in the East of England during the first wave and caught the illness last May. She has been unable to work since. \nWhen her six months Statutory Sick Pay ran out, she lost her job on capability grounds.\nA year on since becoming sick, with no prospect of returning to work - and no financial support - she told File on 4 she faces losing her home, and feels \"discarded\" by the government.\n\"They've paid all this money for people to stay at home on furlough and I can't claim a penny, that is quite an insult. I'm not asking for a lot and I'm hoping it won't be forever, but to just constantly be turned down for any financial help takes its toll.\" \n\"We were 'heroes' for keeping the country going - all the key workers, shop workers and bus drivers - then I get ill, I can't work and they don't want to know, they don't care. I just need some help.\"\nLiberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said she wants long Covid to be classed as an 'occupational disease' which would allow sufferers to be awarded a benefit according to their degree of disability - called an Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (IIDB).\n\"These are the very people we should be supporting the most - they aren't just the people who went out and did the jobs that needed to be done, they are also the people that got sick from it.\n\"It is only right the government now looks after their lives if they've been affected by long Covid - that they are compensated and this would be according to their need at the time.\"\nBut the body which advises the government whether it should classify an illness as an 'occupational disease' has told File on 4 such a recommendation could take a year.\nDr Lesley Rushton, who chairs the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council (IIAC), says they are hampered by a lack of research and data and whilst they realise some occupations are more risky than others, a major issue is proving someone got Covid through their work. \n\"For some diseases it's very clear cut, you can only get the exposure at a particular workplace, doing a particular type of work\" she said.\n\"But with coronavirus, it has the same effect whether or not the exposure has arisen at work or outside work.\" \nOnce a recommendation has been made to the government, it would then have to go through parliament to be become legislation.\nLayla Moran believes the government now needs to step in whilst the IIAC gathers evidence.\nA government spokesperson said: \"This government is committed to supporting people throughout this pandemic and provides a strong financial safety net for those in need.\n\"Covid-19 is still a relatively new disease and to better understand the long-term effects we are providing over \u00a350m for research funding and working with world-leading scientists to better understand the virus so we can ensure we have the best treatments available.\"\nYou can listen to File on 4: The Cost of Long Covid on Radio 4 on Tuesday 18 May at 20:00 BST and afterwards on BBC Sounds."

      "text": "A number of UK universities are preparing to keep lectures online into the autumn term.\nIt raises the prospect of Covid disrupting another academic year - and will prompt more questions about fee refunds.\nStudents have called plans for another term of online lectures \"unacceptable\".\n\"Online teaching is in no way a substitute for in-person learning,\" says a petition launched by University of Leeds students.\nAbout half of students in England have only been able to return to face-to-face teaching this week, not long before the term ends - having been taught online since Christmas.\nBut a growing number of universities seem to be anticipating carrying on with a mix of online and in-person teaching into the autumn term.\nThe University of Liverpool says it wants as \"much face-to-face teaching as possible\", but is expecting a blend of online and in-person.\n\"In practice this may mean instead of coming on to campus for lectures you may be asked to watch some short pre-recorded videos created by your tutor which cover the same themes and topics as the original lecture,\" says Liverpool's plan for teaching next year.\nA University of Leeds spokesman said: \"We intend to give every student a substantial on-campus experience throughout next semester, including multiple face-to-face sessions each week.\"\nBut many lectures \"will be delivered online as part of an overall hybrid approach\".\nKeeping lectures online prompted an angry response from some students, who started a petition saying that it was \"ridiculous\" and a \"disgrace\" - and calling for a \"complete return to in-person teaching\".\nSupporters of the petition complained about the \u00a39,250 tuition fees being charged and that many students have had very few hours of in-person teaching this year.\n\"Now children are in school full time, people are back in the workplace and the general public can visit pubs, theatres and cinemas... there is absolutely no need for any lectures to remain online,\" wrote a petitioner.\n\"My daughter has had an awful year stuck in her room\u2026 Get a grip please,\" wrote a parent backing the petition.\nThe students' union at Leeds says it is planning a survey of students' experience of online learning this year and what they want for next year.\nThe previous two academic years have been disrupted - with many students having to spend months off campus - but it seems as though the pandemic could mean a third year of changes.\nEven if students are back on campus they could still be watching lectures online.\nThe London School of Economics expects the \"vast majority\" of seminars and classes to be taught in-person, but lectures will be \"largely delivered online\".\nSt Andrews and the University of Edinburgh expect large lectures to be online - and the University of Manchester is planning a \"blended approach, with a mix of both on-campus and online elements\".\nSt Andrews says this \"interim\" guidance reflects the \"significant uncertainty\" about physical distancing requirements in the autumn.\nUniversity College London says courses on campus would \"prioritise interactive face-to-face teaching, such as seminars and workshops\".\nBut some modules \"will be mostly online and others completely online if all learning outcomes can be met this way\", says the information for next year's students.\nAn academic at a London university, speaking anonymously, contacted the BBC to suggest there would be financial savings for universities from reducing staffing levels and making a longer-term shift to keeping lectures online.\nBut the National Union of Students also said there could be some positive advantages in teaching online.\n\"Online lectures, remote access to resources and other digital provision has significantly improved access to education and, offered alongside in-person teaching, gives students greater choice over how they learn,\" said union vice president, Hillary Gyebi-Ababio.\n\"No matter what teaching methods universities and colleges use, they must provide consistently good courses for all students,\" said Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students.\nUniversities had to provide \"timely and clear information for students on how their courses will be taught next year\", she said.\nA spokeswoman for Universities UK said universities were trying to plan without knowing what restrictions will be in place in the autumn - and that even if lectures were online, students would still have access to facilities such as libraries and laboratories.\n\"Universities have a strong track record in delivering excellent blended tuition, and we have been clear that quality and quantity should not drop,\" said a Department for Education spokeswoman."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nIt will be a few days before the government can draw any conclusions about whether to deviate from England's current roadmap out of lockdown, the prime minister has said. There is increasing concern about the spread of the Indian variant but Boris Johnson said there was nothing conclusive in the current data to suggest the plan to end the remaining legal limits on social contact in England from 21 June needed to change. Health correspondent Nick Triggle has taken a closer look at why the UK is taking a risk with the variant.\nThe prime minister's former adviser, Dominic Cummings, has claimed that government \"secrecy\" in its handling of the Covid crisis \"contributed greatly to the catastrophe\". In a series of tweets Mr Cummings posted, apparently while in the waiting room for his first Covid jab, he attacked his former colleagues in government and the Civil Service. He said the government's handling of the pandemic was \"part disaster, part non-existent\". No 10 said it was always guided by the \"best scientific data\".\nHospital admissions for obesity-related treatment in England reached a record of more than a million in the year leading into the global pandemic, according to new figures. Experts say the pandemic should be a wake-up call to people - as being overweight is one of the most significant risk factors for severe Covid. The record number provides the clearest indication yet of the scale of the obesity problem as coronavirus started to spread across the country.\nLast year, Sandra Norman and her family spent nearly \u00a35,000 booking a package deal for a villa in Rhodes for the end of May 2021. But Greece is still an amber-rated country under the government's traffic light system and the advice is to not travel to amber countries for leisure. Sandra asked the travel agent if they could move the booking to the same dates in 2022 but she says they refused to do that or issue a credit note. BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme has been contacted by other travellers in the same situation. Here is a reminder of the new rules for foreign travel.\nMeet Ralph Russell, who says he has visited every pub in the city of Birmingham in his 66 years as a pedlar - selling things like socks, toys and tea towels. Now that pubs have reopened, he has polished up his suitcase, stocked up with new wares and returned to his favourite stomping ground - Digbeth.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nCan two households now travel in one car?
