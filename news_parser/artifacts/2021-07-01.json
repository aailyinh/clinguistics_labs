      "title": "Covid-19 in the UK: How many coronavirus cases are there in my area?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Welsh government,Welsh Conservatives,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Welsh government is \"stuck in lockdown mode\" and should stop \"treating the Welsh people like children\", the Conservatives have said.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford has held off lifting restrictions amid concerns over the Delta variant.\nThe Tories called for ministers to set out a dated plan for when they will lift all restrictions.\nMr Drakeford's government said its approach to reopening was led by the data and not \"by artificial dates\".\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said a plan was needed given data showing the number of people in hospital with Covid has fallen to a record low. \nThe party did not propose its own date for scrapping lockdown restrictions, but said it would like to see them end \"as soon as it is safe to do so\".\nAccording to the latest data from Public Health Wales there were 86 Covid patients in hospital beds in Wales on 30 June - a record low for the second day running.\nHowever the case rate across Wales on Thursday was 66.5 per 100,000 people - the highest since 23 February.\nThere have only been minor changes to the rules in Wales since 7 June, after the first minister announced a pause in order to \"reduce the peak number of daily hospital admissions\" and allow time to vaccinate more people. \nMinisters had considered permitting more indoor mixing, allowing more people to attend indoor events and reopening ice skating rinks, before deciding to hold off.\nCurrently in Wales people are able to meet in private homes if they are in an extended household with a fixed set of other homes, unlike in England where six people from any household can meet.\nNightclubs remain closed, as they do across the UK, while limits on social distancing and how many people can meet outside remain.\nThe restrictions will be reviewed again in a fortnight, with any further lifting due to be announced by Mr Drakeford on 15 July - no dates have otherwise been set.\nHowever the UK government's new Health Secretary Sajid Javid has already said he sees \"no reason\" why restrictions in England will not end on 19 July. \nThe end of England's lockdown was originally scheduled for 21 June, but was pushed back by four weeks.\nThe Scottish government hopes to lift the final major restrictions in Scotland on 9 August. \nMr Davies said: \"Given the data, it's important the Welsh Labour government now provides families, schools, workers and businesses with their plan for restoring all freedoms and releasing restrictions in Wales, as has been seen in Scotland and England. \n\"Sadly, the Welsh government is stuck in lockdown mode and can't shift gears into recovery because it means actually having to tackle some of the issues that Labour have failed to tackle over the past two decades. \n\"Instead of treating the Welsh people like children, the Welsh government needs to talk to them like adults. \n\"People will understand that no date ministers choose comes with zero risk for Covid. \n\"Sadly, it can't be eliminated and moving forward we will have to learn to live with it like we do with other viruses,\" he said.\nAsked what the Welsh Conservatives would do, and whether they would support lifting restrictions on 19 July, a spokesman said: \"Ministers will have access to advice and data not currently afforded to opposition parties. \n\"However, we would like to see restrictions lifted in Wales as soon as it is safe to do so. The virus doesn't recognise Offa's Dyke and our preference has long been for a consistent UK-wide approach, but the data may suggest some nuances are required in Wales.\"\nAhead of May's Senedd election the Welsh Conservatives published a plan to end lockdown that broadly aligned with the UK government's plans at the time.\nIt included a proposal to possibly end social distancing in Wales by 21 June. \nA Welsh government spokesman said: \"Since the start of the pandemic we have taken a cautious, phased approach to reopening and have been led by the data that is presented to the cabinet by the chief medical officer and our scientific adviser, and not driven by artificial dates. \n\"We review the coronavirus regulations every three weeks and update members of the Senedd and the public about whether we are able to relax these, in line with our coronavirus control plan.\""

      "tags": "Job Retention Scheme,Employment,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than a million workers came off furlough in May as the economy reopened, leaving the scheme supporting the fewest people since the start of the pandemic.\nAt the end of May, 2.4 million people still relied on the scheme for their income, the latest HMRC figures show.\nThe furlough measures are being phased out by the end of September.\nBut with parts of the economy still limited by the virus, some firms are calling for an extension to the scheme.\nTerry George, who owns the Mission night club in Leeds as well as several other venues, said he expected some of his staff would be made redundant as a result of the phase-out of furlough.\n\"We can't afford to pay people out of a pot that has no money coming in,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"We're going to have to lose some staff.\"\nHe called for the scheme to be extended until businesses such as his were back up and running.\nOver the next three months, firms will have to shoulder more of the costs of the scheme as the government starts to wind down its support. Staff will continue to receive 80% of their wages, but employers will pay part of that for the first time.\n\"The furlough isn't simply being switched off,\" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC's Today programme. \"All we're saying is that the employer should contribute something to the payroll, and then over time, over the next three months, the furlough will be will be taken away.\n\"It's a difficult balanced decision to make, the furlough wasn't going to last forever,\" he added. \"I think, as we open up in two weeks' time, this is the right time to think about the balance of payroll, which the government pays and which employers pay.\"\nThe Treasury said its furlough funding was still substantial and had deliberately been retained over the summer to provide more certainty.\nLabour questioned whether it was fair to ask bosses to contribute towards the salaries of furloughed staff if they were not yet permitted to reopen.\n\"Nightclubs can't open today, they don't know what capacity and rules they will be working under when they do, they have no income, they are still racking up debts, and today they have to start paying towards furlough payments,\" said Jeff Smith MP.\nThe government has spent \u00a366bn on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, as furlough is officially known, and it has supported 11.6 million jobs since March 2020.\nBut as the economy has gradually reopened many workers have returned to their jobs.\nEstimates from the Office for National Statistics' weekly survey suggest that numbers continued to fall in June, and that there are now between 1.3 million and 1.9 million people on the scheme.\nGemma Walker from Bradford, loves her job as an account manager for Newmarket Holidays. But because she's on furlough she hasn't worked for 15 months, an experience she has found difficult.\n\"I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt about the colleagues at Newmarket who are still working,\" she says. \"They've really held the fort for the rest of our team.\"\nShe used to travel around the country, talking to clients and going to conferences.\n\"When something like that is completely taken away from you, you almost feel lost,\" she says. \"My purpose is gone now because this is what I've worked towards my whole career, starting way back when I was 17 years old.\nThe furlough scheme has helped to prevent a spike in unemployment; jobless rates have remained below 5%, despite the pandemic shock to the economy.\nEmployers have been able to retain qualified staff, and reopen businesses quickly when pandemic restrictions allowed.\n\"The furlough scheme has been critical. It's part of the difference between survival and not,\" said Mark Vincent, chief financial officer at travel company Newmarket Holidays. \nBut he said that his firm, like others in the travel sector, would inevitably need to consider redundancies.\n\"In those winter months, we're all going to be loss-making and therefore, we're going to have to relook at what we do with our staffing.\"\nSteve Haslam, who owns pub chain TLC Inns, said he was very grateful that the government had provided an income to his employees, but he is more sceptical of the benefits to business, particularly the idea it would help firms retain staff.\n\"A lot of people didn't come back to work... because they just didn't want to come back, either into the industry or they'd gone off and found second jobs. We had one site where 80% of staff left.\"\nHe believes the end of furlough will make it easier for hospitality businesses like his to recruit new staff.\nAt the start of the pandemic, most of those on furlough were in younger age brackets.\nBut as the economy has reopened, many younger workers have returned to their old jobs or to new ones. Now about half of the people left on furlough are over 45, according to the Resolution Foundation.\nThe think tank says that older workers on furlough are now more likely to be let go, if businesses decide to restructure in the face of uncertainty.\n\"Reopening the economy has led to a surge in people returning to work from furlough, particularly young people in sectors like hospitality and leisure,\" said Karl Handscomb, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation.\n\"But not everyone is back working. Over one in four older workers who were furloughed during the recent lockdown have remained parked on furlough during the reopening, and now face a higher risk of unemployment as the scheme starts to be unwound.\"\nThe hundreds of billions in support has been dizzying, historic, and effective at keeping unemployment much lower, but now the great rollback begins. \nThough the economy is bouncing back strongly, this is a moment of acute sensitivity, as businesses start to discover whether they will keep going as government support is slowly withdrawn.\nThe most significant change will be a reduction in the generosity of the furlough scheme. Employers must find the equivalent of a tenth of their workers' wages, with that proportion increasing next month.\nThe holiday for stamp duty will also begin to be tapered, the business rates holiday becomes less generous, and delayed payments for VAT will restart.\nAll this comes with restrictions still in place, and some sectors, such as travel, very unlikely to get back to normal soon.\nBusiness groups representing small businesses have warned of a serious economic flashpoint.\nIt is unclear whether the end of furlough will lead to a significant rise in the unemployment rate, according to Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies.\nGiven the strength of the economic recovery, the number of job vacancies being advertised, and the fall in the number of people on furlough since the beginning of the year, Mr Wilson said the number of people being made unemployed could be in the \"low hundreds of thousands rather than the millions\" as feared last year.\nHe said that by September, when the scheme ends, the number of people on full furlough \"will be pretty low indeed\"."

      "tags": "Companies,Retailing,Fashion",
      "text": "US fashion giant Gap has confirmed it plans to close all its 81 stores in the UK and Ireland and go online-only.\nThe firm said it would close all its stores \"in a phased manner\" between the end of August and the end of September.\nThis includes 19 stores that were already scheduled to close in July as their leases were expiring. \nThe company has not disclosed how many employees the closures will affect, but will shortly start a consultation process with the staff.\nThe firm said it was \"not exiting the UK market\" and would continue to offer a web-based store when all the shops had closed.\nA Gap spokesperson said the decision followed a strategic review of its European business.\nAs a result, Gap is also looking to offload its stores in France and Italy.\nGap was a big hit when it first opened in the UK back in 1987, famous for its hoodies and sweatshirts.  But in recent years, it has struggled to stay relevant, resorting to prolific discounting to pull shoppers in. That left Gap in a weak position to withstand the turmoil of a global pandemic. \nIt launched a strategic review of its entire European operations last autumn, warning that it was considering closing all its UK stores. Just a few weeks ago, 19 store closures were announced - now the rest of them will close as well. \nGap blamed what it described as market dynamics - in other words, the huge shift to internet shopping. It's going online-only, just like Debenhams and Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group. It's yet another famous name bidding a retreat from our High Streets, adding to the challenge of what to do with empty shops. \nKate Hardcastle, a consumer and retail expert says the closure is because Gap failed to keep up with the competition by not offering enough variety or being as cheap as competitors such as Primark.  \n\"The brands you want to shop with in physical retail have to have so much more than just products on offer, they have to have purpose,\" she says. \n\"It just didn't feel like a company that had embraced the new consumer,\" she adds.  \nThe company said it was in negotiations with another firm to take over all of its French stores.\nIn Italy, Gap said it was in discussions with a partner for the potential acquisition of the stores there.\n\"We believe in Gap's global brand power. We are executing against Gap's Power Plan and partnering to amplify our global reach,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"We are not exiting the UK market. We will continue to run and operate our Gap e-commerce business in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.\"\nA source close to the company said that it had seen rapid uptake of internet shopping for its clothes in the UK since the pandemic-enforced lockdowns. \nThe move comes as the latest blow to UK High Streets, already reeling from the collapse of the Debenhams and Arcadia retail empires during the pandemic.\nThe Debenhams brand continues online after being bought by retailer Boohoo for \u00a355m in January - and now Gap has added to the ranks of bricks-and-mortar clothing chains that have moved to cyberspace.\nDo you work for Gap?

      "tags": "Cwmbran,Diabetes",
      "text": "An 11-year-old boy who died after being found unresponsive in bed had undiagnosed type 1 diabetes, an inquest has heard. \nKayden Hall, from Cwmbran in Torfaen, died at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales on 5 June 2020 with diabetic ketoacidosis.\nThe dangerous condition occurs when diabetes is undiagnosed and the body starts to run out of insulin. \nNewport Coroner's Court heard signs \"can be subtle and go unnoticed\".\nSenior coroner for Gwent Caroline Saunders recorded a conclusion of death by natural causes.\nShe also raised concerns about access to medical services during the pandemic, saying what was available had been \"poorly communicated\". \nThe court heard evidence from a police statement from Kayden's mother Melanie Hall who said her son became unwell on 1 June.\nShe said he told her he was \"struggling to go to toilet and his chest was tight\". \nThe court heard over the next few days Kayden ate little apart from some Weetabix and was sick on a number of occasions which was \"black and watery\".\nMs Hall said she did not think she would be able to get an appointment for her son because of restrictions caused by Covid-19.\nBy 4 June, Kayden was still unwell and Ms Hall said when she \"went upstairs, he was laid on his bed, under the covers - I could see his eyes were open and I put my hand on his shoulders to wake him up\".\nWhen she could not wake him, the family called 999.  \nThe court heard Ms Hall told police officers who arrived at the scene that Kayden had not been to the GP as she believed she would not be able to get an appointment because of Covid restrictions. \"There was no way I could get an appointment, he didn't have a temperature,\" she had said.  \nKayden was taken to the University Hospital of Wales where doctors believed his admission was due to \"severe diabetic ketoacidosis, which had led to cardiac arrest\".\nA statement by the intensive care consultant who treated Kayden, Dr Anna Barrow, said his glucose levels on arrival were 50 - the court heard a normal level was about five.\nA CT scan showed what was described as an \"unsurvivable brain injury\". \nFollowing discussions with Ms Hall the ventilator was turned off. \n\"He died in her arms in the paediatric intensive care unit,\" Dr Barrow said in her statement.\nDr Andrew Bamber, a consultant paediatric pathologist at the North Bristol NHS Trust, who reviewed Kayden's death, said there were a number of contributory factors that led to his death.\nHe said that meant it was \"hard to give a turning point\" of when earlier intervention might have saved his life. \nA cause of death was given as hypoxic brain damage, caused by diabetic ketoacidosis with contributory factors of aspiration and inflammation in his pancreas.\nKayden had \"no significant medical history\" apart from using inhalers for asthma, the inquest was told.\nDr Bamber explained that signs of type 1 diabetes, such as weight loss and being more thirsty, were difficult to spot in children.\nBut he said it was likely Kayden \"had diabetes for much longer\" than when the more severe symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis appeared in the days before his death.\nThe court also heard from Sara Davies, a family engagement officer based at Coed Eva Primary in Cwmbran, where Kayden had attended for the whole of his primary education.\nShe said she visited the family every week during the pandemic, as well as every day when Kayden was in school.  \nShe said she \"saw nothing\" that worried her and that there had been \"no signs\".\nShe last saw Kayden on the Wednesday before he died and had taken food to the family.\nCoroner Caroline Saunders said Kayden was an \"undiagnosed diabetic and died from the effects of diabetic ketoacidosis\". \nShe recorded a conclusion of death by natural causes and sent her \"sincere condolences to the family\".\nIn her statement, his mother described Kayden as a \"bright boy\" who \"made people laugh\" and was \"really popular in school\".\nDai Williams, director of Diabetes UK Cymru, said: \"During lockdown, we were concerned that fewer cases were being diagnosed in children in Wales and have intensified our campaign to reach more people and ensure that the symptoms become common knowledge.\n\"Diabetes is serious, can be life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated. Most people seem to think that this only happens to others, but it happened to me and I almost lost my son - better safe than sorry so if you're worried, check it out.\""

      "title": "Bill Cosby freed after top court overturns sexual assault conviction",
      "text": "US comedian Bill Cosby has left prison hours after his sexual assault conviction was overturned by Pennsylvania's Supreme Court.\nThe judges said there had been a \"process violation\" by the prosecution, but admitted their ruling was unusual.\nMr Cosby, 83, served more than two years of a three to 10-year sentence at a state prison near Philadelphia. \nIn 2018 he was found guilty of drugging and molesting ex-basketball player Andrea Constand.\nMr Cosby is best known for starring in the 1980s TV series The Cosby Show and was once known as \"America's Dad\".\nDozens of women have publicly accused Mr Cosby of sexual assault, but he was only tried criminally for the incident against Ms Constand. His conviction in 2018 was widely seen as a landmark moment in the #MeToo movement.\nIn a verdict issued on Wednesday, Pennsylvania's highest court found there was a \"process violation\" because Mr Cosby's lawyers had made an agreement with a previous state prosecutor that he would not be charged in the case.\nThe former actor appeared frail as he slowly walked to waiting media outside his home, shortly after being released from prison.\nHe did not say anything, instead leaning on his team of lawyers and spokesman Andrew Wyatt to answer questions.\n\"On this hot day - this is a hot verdict for us,\" Mr Wyatt said.\n\"Mr Cosby has always used his celebrity and his name to uplift women... How could a man who is being watched by the FBI every day be raping and drugging women\u2026 especially a black man?\" he added.\nOff camera, fans of Mr Cosby could be heard yelling their support throughout the media conference.\nMr Cosby was found guilty on three counts of felony indecent assault against Ms Constand. \nDecades his junior, she met him in 2002 when working at Temple University in Philadelphia and described the comedian as a mentor figure. She later testified at trial how she became \"frozen\" after Cosby drugged and molested her at his home in 2004.\nMs Constand first came forward to police about the assault in 2005, but former state prosecutor Bruce Castor did not press criminal charges. She then sued the comedian for sexual battery and defamation, reaching a settlement with a confidentially agreement in 2006.\nIn 2014 and 2015, dozens of women came forward with similar allegations of drugging and assault by Mr Cosby. Local authorities knew that statute of limitation rules meant they could not pursue the majority of these accusations - but they reopened the case involving Ms Constand and eventually charged him just days before the 12-year limit on her allegations was set to expire. \nA judge declared a mistrial in his first trial in 2017 after the jury failed to reach a verdict.\nThe testimony of other accusers was then allowed during a second trial, which helped prosecutors paint a pattern of predatory behaviour by Mr Cosby.\nThe judges' reasoning is complex - their written finding is 79-pages long.\nThey cite a written agreement reached by Mr Castor, the former prosecutor, stating that he would not charge Mr Cosby if he testified in Ms Constand's civil lawsuit.\nIn Wednesday's ruling, the Supreme Court judges also found that testimony from accusers unrelated to the case had tainted the trial.\n\"There is only one remedy that can completely restore Cosby to the status quo ante. He must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be barred\", the finding released on Wednesday reads.\n\"We do not dispute that this remedy is both severe and rare. But it is warranted here.\"\nA spokesman for Mr Cosby, Andrew Wyatt, thanked the court in a statement. \n\"This is the justice Mr Cosby has been fighting for. They saw the light,\" Mr Wyatt said. \"He was given a deal and he had immunity. He should have never been charged.\"\nActor Phylicia Rashad, who played his wife on the Cosby Show, wrote on Twitter: \"A terrible wrong is being righted - a miscarriage of justice is corrected!\" in response to the news. \nProsecutor Kevin Steele said in a statement that Mr Cosby \"was found guilty by a jury and now goes free on a procedural issue that is irrelevant to the facts of the crime\".\n\"My hope is that this decision will not dampen the reporting of sexual assaults by victims\u2026 We still believe that no one is above the law - including those who are rich, famous and powerful.\"\nLawyer Gloria Allred, who represented more than 30 accusers of Mr Cosby, described the ruling as \"devastating\" but said the decision did not vindicate the comedian's conduct. \n\"My heart especially goes out to those who bravely testified in both of his criminal cases,\" her statement added."

      "text": "A mother stopped from seeing her dying son in his final weeks said she felt Boris Johnson \"dismissed\" a question about what happened to her family.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer highlighted the case of Ollie Bibby, 27, who was not able to see his family as he died in hospital.\nMr Johnson said he \"shared the grief of Ollie and his family and millions of people up and down the country\".\nPenny Bibby said all families who have made sacrifices \"must be listened to\".\nHer son, from South Benfleet, Essex, died of leukaemia in hospital on 5 May, a day before Matt Hancock was filmed kissing a colleague, prompting his resignation as health secretary.\nMr Bibby had begged to see his family in the weeks before his death.\nSir Keir raised the case in the first Prime Minister's Questions since Mr Hancock resigned and asked why he had not been sacked. \nHe said he had spoken to the Bibby family, who had followed the rules and made \"huge sacrifices\", in contrast to Mr Hancock, who had set the rules.\n\"Every time, it's the same old story,\" said Sir Keir. \"Where the British people are doing everything asked of them, it's one rule for them, another rule for everybody else.\"\nIn response, Mr Johnson said: \"We all share the grief and pain of Ollie and his family and millions of people up and down the country have endured the privations that this country has been through in order to get the pandemic under control, and that is why we had a change of health secretary a day after the story appeared.\n\"And that's why as a government, instead of focusing on stuff in the Westminster bubble, we are focusing on rolling out those vaccines at a rate that will make sure that people like Ollie and his family do not have to suffer in the future.\"\nHis spokeswoman later said he \"absolutely was not\" referring to the case of Ollie Bibby when he spoke about the Westminster bubble.\nMrs Bibby said the response made her family feel \"not important\".\n\"Boris Johnson just dismissed the question, he avoided answering it entirely, which made us feel like we're not important,\" she said.\n\"He keeps going on about vaccinations, but there are no guarantees that families can be together on their death bed, even if everyone is vaccinated. \n\"There are no signs that anything is going to change.\"\nShe previously said she was \"livid\" Mr Hancock broke social distancing rules, while her family were \"treated like criminals\" as they battled to see Ollie in the weeks before he died.\nShe said she had received hundreds of \"heartbreaking\" messages from families in similar situations since her story came to light. \n\"I have lost confidence in this government now,\" she said.\n\"There needs to be a plan, this can't go on. How many more families need to be kept apart while loved ones are dying?\"\nSir Keir told the BBC: \"What came across powerfully in my conversation with Penny was the huge dignity which she and her family have shown through this terrible ordeal.\n\"Ollie's case demonstrates the huge sacrifices that families have made during this pandemic to follow the rules. That's why it was important for me to raise with the prime minister today.\"\nMr Bibby spent seven weeks at University College London Hospital before he died. His parents said they did not blame the staff, who were following rules, but most of his family were \"denied the chance to say goodbye properly\".\nThe hospital said it was \"confident that Ollie received appropriate care and treatment and that regular visits were allowed in line with hospital guidance\" but it would look to \"learn from the family's experience\".\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "PM Boris Johnson is discussing Covid travel restrictions with Angela Merkel in her final official visit to the UK as German chancellor. \nMrs Merkel, who is due to step down later this year, has previously called for all UK travellers to Europe to face quarantine. \nTrade and post-Brexit relations are also on the agenda. \nThe chancellor arrived at Chequers, the prime minister's Buckinghamshire residence, earlier for the talks. \nShe will also meet the Queen at Windsor Castle and address a meeting of the UK cabinet - the first foreign leader to do so since President Clinton in 1997, although on this occasion the meeting will be a virtual one. \nLast week Mrs Merkel, who has been in power since 2005, said she wanted other countries to follow Germany's lead by introducing tougher restrictions for UK travellers because of concerns about the Delta variant. \nSince May, travellers from the UK have been banned from entering Germany, aside from a few limited exceptions. Those who are allowed to arrive from the UK must quarantine for 14 days. \nMr Johnson is expected to announce the latest steps towards ending lockdown in England in the next few days, with international travel high on the agenda.\nIn contrast to Mrs Merkel, he said on Thursday that double vaccinations could be a \"liberator\" as millions of people plan their summer breaks. \nThe pair will dine on an three-course meal featuring British produce including an English asparagus tart and Oxfordshire beef fillet during a working lunch. \nAhead of the chancellor's visit, Mr Johnson said: \"The UK and Germany have a steadfast friendship and a shared outlook on many issues.\"\nHe is expected to announce the creation of an annual \u00a310,000 award for a UK or Germany-based female scientist who has excelled in the field of astrophysics.\n\"Our scientists, innovators and industrialists work together every day to make the world a better place,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\"Over the 16 years of Chancellor Merkel's tenure the UK-Germany relationship has been re-energised and reinvigorated for a new era.\n\"And the new joint ventures we will agree will leave a legacy that will last for generations.\"\nThe visit will be Mrs Merkel's 22nd to the UK since taking office and is one of a series of farewell trips, with US President Joe Biden among those expected to host her later in the summer.\nShe and Mr Johnson last met at the G7 summit in Cornwall in June."

      "text": "Wales' coronavirus booster jab programme is likely to begin in September under Welsh government plans.\nIt comes after UK officials gave the green light to give the most vulnerable a third dose of a Covid vaccine. \nInterim advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says boosters will help maintain protection against Covid and variants.\nWales' health minister said the advice \"very much aligns with our thinking and our planning assumptions to date\".\nEluned Morgan added: \"NHS Wales has been planning on the assumption of a September/October booster for cohorts 1-9, with around a six month gap following a second dose and health boards have submitted their initial plans on this basis. \n\"We will be working with health boards to ensure they are ready to deliver a booster programme from the start of September in line with this advice.\"\nJCVI has recommended that people are prioritised in two stages.\nFront-line health and social care workers, those in older people's care homes, the clinically extremely vulnerable and those over 70 are in the first stage.\nAll adults aged over 50 are included in the second group.\nThese groups should receive a third vaccine as soon as possible from September:\nDr Richard Vautrey, British Medical Association GP committee chairman, said: \"JCVI have listened to organisations such as the BMA by giving early notice of the roll out being prioritised alongside the annual flu vaccination campaign.\n\"As all doctors well know, winter brings with it a surge in illnesses and infections, and we hope that by protecting our most vulnerable patients with both Covid-19 and flu vaccines, we will prevent more people becoming seriously ill and dying. \n\"In turn, we hope that this will alleviate pressures on the whole NHS and social care, at a time when we know it is always at its most strained.\"\nOn Wednesday, Public Health Wales figures showed about 72% people (2,257,737) in Wales have now had at least one Covid vaccine.\nOf these, 1,659,754 (53%) have had their second jab.\nMark Roscrow of the NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership said giving the population a third vaccination would be \"a big team effort\".\nHe said the \"people behind the scenes have done a huge amount\".\n\"We've done quite a lot of work and pre-planning and thinking through what needs to be done to make this happen,\" he told Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales.\nHe said it was likely the third vaccine offered would be an alternative to the one initially offered to each patient for the first and second doses.\nMr Roscrow said the booster jab coinciding with the winter flu jab was an \"added complication\"."

      "text": "Covid is common in pet cats and dogs whose owners have the disease, research suggests.\nSwabs were taken from 310 pets in 196 households where a human infection had been detected.\nSix cats and seven dogs returned a positive PCR result, while 54 animals tested positive for virus antibodies.\n\"If you have Covid, you should avoid contact with your cat or dog, just as you would do with other people,\" Dr Els Broens, from Utrecht University, said.\n\"The main concern is not the animals' health but the potential risk that pets could act as a reservoir of the virus and reintroduce it into the human population.\"\nThe authors of the study said no evidence of pet-to-owner transmission had been recorded to date but it would be difficult to detect while the virus was still spreading easily between humans.\nMost infected pets tend to be asymptomatic or display mild Covid symptoms. \nResearchers from Utrecht University sent a mobile veterinary clinic to households in the Netherlands that had tested positive for Covid at some point in the past 200 days.\nSwabs were taken from their pet cats and dogs to test for evidence of a current infection, while blood samples were also tested for antibodies suggesting a past exposure to Covid.\nThe results were presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases:\nFollow-up tests showed all the PCR-positive (polymerase chain reaction) animals cleared the infection and went on to develop antibodies.\nThe researchers say the most likely route of virus transmission is from human to animal, rather than the other way round.\n\"We can't say there is a 0% risk of owners catching Covid from their pets,\"  Veterinary Microbiological Diagnostic Centre Dr Broens said.\n\"At the moment, the pandemic is still being driven by human-to-human infections, so we just wouldn't detect it.\"\nVets in Russia have started vaccinating some animals against the disease.\nBut Dr Broens said: \"I don't see the scientific evidence for that now. \n\"It seems unlikely that pets play a role in the pandemic.\"\nA separate study run by the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, found cats that slept on their owner's bed seemed to be at particular risk of infection. \nA total of 48 cats and 54 dogs from 77 households were tested for Covid antibodies and their owners asked about their interaction with their pets. \nAbout 67% of the owned cats and 43% of the owned dogs tested positive, compared with 9% of dogs and cats from an animal shelter and 3% of stray cats in the area.\nA quarter of the pets displayed a symptom of the disease, from loss of appetite to difficulty breathing. \nAnd although most cases were mild, three were severe.  \nThe study's authors said cats' biology may make them more susceptible to Covid. \nCats are also more likely to sleep near their owner's face than dogs, increasing their exposure to any infection.\nCambridge University veterinary medicine department head Prof James Wood said the two studies added to other evidence suggesting a substantial proportion of cats and dogs may catch the virus from their owners.\n\"The Dutch study is robustly conducted and shows that around 20% of exposed pets may be infected and that they eventually clear the infection just as most humans do,\" he said. \n\"Most reports are that this infection appears to be asymptomatic. \n\"It also seems that the virus does not normally transmit from dogs and cats to either other animals or their owners.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Sunderland,Nissan,Electric cars,Car industry",
      "text": "Nissan has announced a major expansion of electric vehicle production at its car plant in Sunderland which will create 1,650 new jobs.\nThe Japanese carmaker will build its new-generation all-electric model at the site as part of a \u00a31bn investment that will also support thousands of jobs in the supply chain.\nAnd Nissan's partner, Envision AESC, will build an electric battery plant.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson called it a \"pivotal moment\".\nOf the \u00a31bn investment, Nissan said it would invest up to \u00a3423m to produce a new-generation all-electric vehicle in the UK, building on the success of its existing electric car, the Leaf.\nProduction of the new model will create 909 new jobs and more than 4,500 in its UK supply chain. \nOther production locations have not yet been confirmed. More details about the new vehicle will be released closer to the car's launch date.\nEnvision's new gigafactory will eventually provide batteries to power up to 100,000 Nissan electric vehicles a year. It will create 750 new jobs and secure 300 existing roles.\nIt is hoped the new plant will operational in time for 2024, when the level of UK-made components in cars manufactured in the UK is required to start increasing, in line with the terms of the UK's trade deal with the EU.\nThe majority of Nissan's Sunderland-assembled cars are sold in the EU.\nMeanwhile, the BBC has been told that an investment at Vauxhall's car plant at Ellesmere Port is \"weeks away\" - a move that could secure the future of the plant.\nIt is expected that a promise of government aid could see Vauxhall's parent company, Stellantis, commit to building a new model at the factory.\nFrom 2030, sales of new cars and vans powered solely by petrol or diesel will be banned in the UK. However, some hybrids will still be allowed.\nMr Johnson said: \"The great thing about this investment and the creation of this gigafactory is it is going to drive down the cost of electric vehicles (EVs), not just for people who are currently buying them but so ordinary families can buy EVs as a matter of course and that will start happening in just a few years' time.\"\nAhead of the Brexit deal, Nissan had warned over the future of the Sunderland plant if the government was unable to secure an agreement with the EU.\nAt the time, Nissan's chief operating officer, Ashwani Gupta, said: \"If it happens without any sustainable business case obviously it is not a question of Sunderland or not Sunderland, obviously our UK business will not be sustainable, that's it.\"\nHowever, on Thursday Mr Gupta told the BBC: \"The key success factor for Brexit has always been trade friendly business conditions to sustain our business not only in the UK but in the whole of Europe and thanks to Brexit, Nissan is moving forward to use Brexit as an opportunity.\"\nHe declined to say how much money the UK government would contribute to the expansion plan, stating that talks were continuing. \"But, for sure, without the government support it would have not been possible,\" he said.\nMr Johnson said Nissan's announcement was \"a major vote of confidence in the UK\" and \"a pivotal moment in our electric vehicle revolution\".\nAsked about how much government money was contributing to the new plant, he said: \"We will review our support as the project develops and due diligence takes place... and after this details of the award will be in the public domain.\"\nMike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said the announcement was \"great news for the sector, the region and all those employed locally\".\nHowever, he told the BBC that for the full transition to electric car manufacturing \"it's not enough. We need a lot more. We have a number of factories in the UK, producing up to 1.5 million vehicles. So we need to see this sort of investment multiplied\".\n\"Germany and other parts of Europe, Eastern Europe in particular, are way ahead of us in terms of those committed investments,\" Mr Hawes said.\nThe news that Nissan is pumping hundreds of millions of pounds into a massive expansion of UK-based electric car manufacturing is a huge boost to the North East and the UK car industry as a whole. These are long-term investments that will create thousands of jobs. The prime minister and Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng will welcome the chance to answer critics who say the UK is falling behind European rivals in securing all-important battery production capacity, seen as essential as a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars in 2030 approaches. \nBut amidst the euphoria, a few sobering facts. By industry estimates, the UK is currently on course to have less than a tenth of the battery production capacity of Germany by 2025. From 2024, under the terms of the UK-EU Brexit deal, the percentage of components required to be sourced within the UK or EU begins to rise if UK-assembled cars are to avoid tariffs when exported to the EU - where most Nissans are sold. If you don't have a battery industry, you won't have a car industry. \nAlthough the precise details have not been disclosed, the government is thought to have contributed tens of millions of pounds towards the cost of the project. The prime minister will argue that it kills two prized economic birds - decarbonisation and levelling up - with one stone. Workers, unions and local politicians in the North East will consider it money well spent. But industry experts are clear: this must be the first of many such investments if the UK is to keep up with the biggest revolution in car technology since they were invented. \nEarlier this week, a report commissioned by the SMMT said a series of factories producing electric car batteries needed to be built in the UK to secure the future of the country's automotive industry.\nIt said the government should announce a \"binding target\" of 60 gigawatt hours of battery capacity to be in place by 2030.\nThe report said that at the moment, the UK is on track to have 12 gigawatt hours worth of lithium battery capacity by 2025. This compares with 164 gigawatt hours in Germany.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, told the BBC's Today programme: \"I don't think we are falling behind. Germany has a huge tradition of automotive manufacturing, we know that, and we are establishing gigafactories here in the UK.\" \nLabour's shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, welcomed the new gigafactory but said: \"Ministers cannot be complacent.\" \n\"Only this week, the SMMT said that the government was falling behind our competitors and the Faraday Institution estimates we need seven gigafactories by 2040.\"\nThe SMMT-commissioned study, written by policy and research company Public First, also called for the installation of at least 2.3 million charging points nationwide before the end of the decade.\nThis is aimed at giving confidence to drivers - particularly those with no off-road parking at home - to invest in zero-emission vehicles.\nMr Kwarteng said that this could be achieved: \"I think the way in which economies can transform is remarkable and I think nine years to hit those targets is sufficient.\""

      "title": "Brexit: NI Protocol is lawful, High Court rules",
      "tags": "NI Brexit,Brexit",
      "text": "The Northern Ireland Protocol is lawful, a High Court judge in Belfast has ruled.\nA group of unionist politicians, including Arlene Foster and Lord Trimble, had challenged the protocol in judicial review proceedings.\nThey claimed it was unlawful because it conflicts with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and the Acts of Union.\nBut Mr Justice Colton rejected their challenge on all grounds on Wednesday afternoon.\nMr Colton found that the Withdrawal Agreement Act, which includes the protocol, does conflict with the 1800 Acts of Union in respect of free trade between Britain and Northern Ireland.\nHowever, he added that the relevant parts of the Acts of Union are \"impliedly repealed\" by the Withdrawal Agreement Act.\nThat means that the more recent legislation automatically overrides the older laws.\nHe said the Acts of Union could not be used to override the \"clear specific will of Parliament\".\nNormally, a constitutional law, like the Acts of Union, can only be expressly repealed, but they can be impliedly by another constitutional law.\nThe judge said the Withdrawal Agreement Act meets the definition of a constitutional law.\nHe also rejected the argument that the protocol had changed the constitutional status as defined in the Good Friday Agreement.\nFurthermore, he found that the secretary of state did have the power to change Stormont's usual cross-community voting mechanism.\nNormally, Stormont must approve controversial issues by a cross-community vote but the protocol will be subject to a straight-majority vote.\nThe judge said the secretary of state had the power to do this on two grounds: that it was necessary to reflect the will of Parliament in implementing the Withdrawal Agreement Act and that it concerns international relations which is not a devolved matter.\nFurther areas of challenge concerning EU law were also rejected.\nThe judge was also critical of an analogy used by the applicants' barrister when he compared the operation of the protocol to the Vichy regime.\nVichy was the collaborationist French administration during the Nazi occupation.\nThe judge said such a comparison was \"unhelpful\".\nAn adjoining case, taken by Belfast pastor Clifford Peeples, was also dismissed by the judge.\nOthers pursuing the lead judicial review case included former Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken, TUV leader Jim Allister, former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib and Baroness Hoey. \nWednesday's judgement is likely to be appealed and the case could ultimately be heard by the Supreme Court before the end of 2021.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the government would \"study in detail\" the High Court ruling, after being asked about it during Prime Minister's Questions. \nDUP MP Ian Paisley asked if the government would \"reverse the mistakes of the Northern Ireland Protocol, seize the moment, defend the union to unilaterally fix and put Northern Ireland out of its commercial, social and economic misery\".\nMr Johnson said: \"Nothing will affect the position of Northern Ireland as part of the UK - we will make sure we uphold that.\"\nAlliance MP Stephen Farry also urged the prime minister to accept the ruling as a \"watershed where we can stop talking about the protocol in constitutional and identity terms\".\nThe prime minister replied that the \"best thing\" the EU could do was remove all the problems associated with the protocol's application.\n\"I hope all that can be fixed indeed and then we can move on,\" he added. \nDUP leader designate Sir Jeffrey Donaldson described the ruling as \"politically significant\" and would have potential consequences for \"the future stability of political institutions\".\nIn a tweet, he said the judgement confirmed the \"protocol damages our constitutional position in the UK contrary to the principle of consent and various agreements\".\nUlster Unionist MLA Steve Aiken said his party acknowledged the decision, but said it is \"an issue of such magnitude that it needs to be appealed to a higher court\".\nSpeaking at a press conference in Belfast following the judgement, Mr Habib said: \"The only positive you might put on it is we do now officially know that the union of the United Kingdom has been trampled on by the protocol.\"\nMr Habib said the prime minister now \"has to face up to the reality that his own judicial system has said that the union of the United Kingdom has been broken\".\nFormer Labour MP Kate Hoey - now Baroness Hoey - said it must be \"absolutely clear that this is only the beginning of the legal challenge and also of peoples' protests against what has been done to us without consent\".\nTUV leader Jim Allister said the court ruling \"confirmed the protocol is dismantling the union\".\nMr Allister said the ruling \"underscores the necessity to step up the political battle against the protocol\".\nHe said the UK government must \"now reverse the mistake of repeal, if the PM's words mean anything\".\n\"No more propping up the Belfast Agreement institutions while the protocol manoeuvres us out of the union,\" he added.\nSinn F\u00e9in MLA Declan Kearney said \"there is no credible alternative to the protocol\". \n\"It's ironic that the Tory/DUP cheerleaders of Brexit are now so opposed to the protocol that was made necessary by their reckless pursuit of a hard Brexit,\" he said."

      "text": "There are three main symptoms of coronavirus. \nIf you have any of them, you should get a test.\nPublic Health England says about 85% of people with Covid will have at least one of these symptoms.\nPeople infected with new variants such as Delta may be more likely to have other symptoms, such as headache, sore throat or a runny nose, according to research from the Zoe Covid Study and an ONS survey.\nIf you have any symptoms you should get tested as soon as possible and not leave home for any other reason. \nIt takes five days on average from the moment you're infected for symptoms to show.\nNo - it can affect multiple organs and has several less common symptoms.\nScientists using data on the health of four million people say Covid has six sub-types:\nResearchers think that vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps could be a sign of coronavirus in children.\nSome people who catch Covid develop chilblain-like lesions on their toes or fingers.\nIt can happen to anyone, but is more common in children and teenagers. \nFor some it's painless, but the rash can be very sore and itchy.\nIt appears to be a side effect of the body switching into attack mode to fight off the virus.\nWriting in the British Journal of Dermatology, researchers say they've pinpointed which parts of the immune system are responsible, which should lead to better treatments. \nLots of other viruses have similar symptoms to Covid, including flu. \nPublic Health England says just under half of people who have one of the three main Covid symptoms will not have it.\nIf you have a positive test result you should self-isolate at home for at least 10 days from the time symptoms started.\nMost people will only have mild symptoms, which can be managed with pain relief (like paracetamol), bed rest and fluids.\nYou should not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.\nSince 16 August, people who are double jabbed (or aged under 18) don't have to self-isolate if they're identified as a close contact of a person who tests positive.\nGetting vaccinated is the best way to prevent serious illness, hospitalisation or death from Covid. \nIf you are seriously unwell and you have a medical emergency you should call 999 - this includes feeling so breathless that you can't speak more than a few words.\nIf you're worried your symptoms are getting worse, use the NHS 111 website England, NHS Inform in Scotland or the equivalents in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe main reason people need hospital care is for difficulty breathing where they may be given oxygen.\nThe most seriously ill patients may require ventilation - where patients are sedated and air is pushed into their lungs.\nOlder people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. Men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women."

      "tags": "Contact tracing,Nicola Sturgeon,Jason Leitch",
      "text": "The huge increase in Covid-19 cases is straining Scotland's contact tracing system but it is \"not collapsing\", the national clinical director has said.\nFigures from Public Health Scotland suggest it is now taking longer to contact infectious people and to track down their close contacts.\nProf Jason Leitch said \"times of course stretch when numbers get big\".\nBut he said the country's contact tracing staff were still hitting international targets.\nA total of 4,234 new Covid cases were reported on Thursday, the latest in a series of new record highs in recent days.\nFigures for last week showed that just 29% of people who tested positive had spoken to a contact tracer within 24 hours of being logged in the Test and Protect system - by far the lowest on record.\nOpposition parties have called for more resources to be given to the Test and Protect system, warning that it was \"reaching breaking point\" and \"buckling under the pressure\".\nAsked about this on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Prof Leitch said: \"It's not collapsing. Not by any means.\n\"In fact there are thousands of my colleagues around the country today doing contact tracing and talking to positive cases and doing a fantastic job.\n\"But you can't have 4,000 cases without it straining. That's a lot.\"\nProf Leitch accepted that taking longer to conduct interviews with people who have tested positive \"potentially does lead to a bigger spread of the virus\".\nHe added: \"If you know you have been in touch with a positive case then use your common sense and be careful.\n\"Contact tracing is still getting in touch with people inside the recommended World Health Organisation time, but those times of course stretch when the numbers get big.\"\nAfter someone has tested positive, their case is logged on the Test and Protect system and a contact tracer conducts a telephone interview to establish where they have been and who they have been in close contact with.\nThese contacts - people who the \"index case\" has been in close physical proximity to for long enough to potentially infect them - are then told to isolate and book a test of their own.\nThe idea is to reduce the risk of these close contacts passing on the virus to more and more people, breaking the chains of transmission.\nThis means it needs to happen quickly, to reduce the amount of time potentially infectious people are out and about without knowing they could be spreading the virus.\nThe latest set of figures from Public Health Scotland suggest that the system is coming under increasing strain due to the record high level of new infections.\nThey are now being presented with more cases to deal with per day than they were in an entire week at the end of May.\nThe data - for the period running from 21 to 25 June - shows that 29.2% of people who tested positive had spoken to a contact tracer within 24 hours of being logged in the Test and Protect system.\nThis was down from 49.5% the previous week, and is by some distance the lowest percentage ever recorded by PHS - even at the peak of the \"second wave\" in January, it did not fall below 75%.\nIn early April - when there were far fewer infections and therefore index cases to interview - the figure stood at 95.6%.\nTracing is also taking a bit longer to complete, with just 20% being \"closed\" in the case management system - meaning the final contact interview has taken place - within 24 hours.\nThis is again the lowest percentage ever recorded by PHS. In April, 80% of cases were concluded within a day of being opened in the system.\nFewer cases being concluded quickly means more are taking longer, with the percentage of contact tracing exercises taking more than 48 hours to complete rising to 43% - its highest level since October 2020.\nEfforts are being made to streamline the system, so contact tracers can focus on getting through the ever-mounting pile of interviews with new cases.\nWhen case numbers were lower, they also tried to actually speak to close contacts by telephone, but Public Health Scotland says it has now switched to contacting them via text message as a default to make sure information and advice can be circulated as quickly as possible.\nStaff have also switched to sending text messages to travellers arriving from \"red list\" countries, who are required to quarantine, rather than calling them, and have dropped all \"secondary\" tracing - where in some cases, the contacts of contacts were notified.\nDuring the interviews themselves, teams have \"looked to increase capacity by prioritising the information collected during each call\" - essentially meaning less questions are asked about events, settings and travel.\nWhile Covid patients are waiting longer to be interviewed and fewer cases are being dealt with swiftly, the system's overall performance is still within the targets set for it by the government.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the aim is for 80% of new cases to have their close contacts traced and in quarantine within 72 hours of a positive test result.\nThe latest PHS figures had 85.9% of cases being complete within three days of being registered with Test and Protect.\nThis is down from 88.2% the previous week and 99.1% back in April, but still comfortably within the target range.\nMs Sturgeon cited the World Health Organisation as backing the 80% target.\nHowever guidance published by the WHO online appears to suggest that its goal is for 80% of the close contacts of each index case to be in quarantine within three days of them developing symptoms.\nThis difference in definitions makes it difficult to tell if Scotland is living up to international standards or not - the most recent PHS figures suggested that 23.5% of Scots had a wait of more than 72 hours between taking a test and being interviewed by a contact tracer.\nOpposition parties have called for Test and Protect to be given greater resources.\nScottish Conservative health spokeswoman Annie Wells said the surge in cases meant that it was \"imperative people are contacted as quickly as possible to stop any further spread of the virus\".\nShe added: \"The system is clearly completely overwhelmed with the spike in cases in recent weeks and SNP ministers must get on top of this situation immediately.\n\"The public would understandably be angry if continued failures within the Test and Protect system meant any potential delays to the further easing of restrictions.\"\nThe Scottish Lib Dems say the system is \"buckling under pressure\", with MP Wendy Chamberlain saying: \"The system needs urgent reinforcements - we need more tracers to be able to go and hunt down the virus because every minute counts.\"\nAnd Scottish Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie said \"mismanagement\" of the system was \"helping the virus to spread\".\nShe said: \"Test and Protect is collapsing under the pressure as cases spiral, and things will only get worse if we don't fix this. \n\"Minsters are cutting corners all over the place to try and keep the system afloat, but that will only make things worse.\"\nHave you been messaged or called by Test and Protect and told someone with Covid has been in contact with you? Did you expect to be approached by Test and Protect (because a close contact of yours had the virus) but were not?\nYou can get in touch with BBC Scotland on the phone messaging service, WhatsApp. \nTo start using the app, simply download WhatsApp on to your smartphone free from the internet.\nThen add our WhatsApp number +44 7902 704679 to your phone's contact list.\nPlease make sure you read our terms of use and privacy policy."

      "tags": "Job Retention Scheme,Employment,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than a million workers came off furlough in May as the economy reopened, leaving the scheme supporting the fewest people since the start of the pandemic.\nAt the end of May, 2.4 million people still relied on the scheme for their income, the latest HMRC figures show.\nThe furlough measures are being phased out by the end of September.\nBut with parts of the economy still limited by the virus, some firms are calling for an extension to the scheme.\nTerry George, who owns the Mission night club in Leeds as well as several other venues, said he expected some of his staff would be made redundant as a result of the phase-out of furlough.\n\"We can't afford to pay people out of a pot that has no money coming in,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"We're going to have to lose some staff.\"\nHe called for the scheme to be extended until businesses such as his were back up and running.\nOver the next three months, firms will have to shoulder more of the costs of the scheme as the government starts to wind down its support. Staff will continue to receive 80% of their wages, but employers will pay part of that for the first time.\n\"The furlough isn't simply being switched off,\" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC's Today programme. \"All we're saying is that the employer should contribute something to the payroll, and then over time, over the next three months, the furlough will be will be taken away.\n\"It's a difficult balanced decision to make, the furlough wasn't going to last forever,\" he added. \"I think, as we open up in two weeks' time, this is the right time to think about the balance of payroll, which the government pays and which employers pay.\"\nThe Treasury said its furlough funding was still substantial and had deliberately been retained over the summer to provide more certainty.\nLabour questioned whether it was fair to ask bosses to contribute towards the salaries of furloughed staff if they were not yet permitted to reopen.\n\"Nightclubs can't open today, they don't know what capacity and rules they will be working under when they do, they have no income, they are still racking up debts, and today they have to start paying towards furlough payments,\" said Jeff Smith MP.\nThe government has spent \u00a366bn on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, as furlough is officially known, and it has supported 11.6 million jobs since March 2020.\nBut as the economy has gradually reopened many workers have returned to their jobs.\nEstimates from the Office for National Statistics' weekly survey suggest that numbers continued to fall in June, and that there are now between 1.3 million and 1.9 million people on the scheme.\nGemma Walker from Bradford, loves her job as an account manager for Newmarket Holidays. But because she's on furlough she hasn't worked for 15 months, an experience she has found difficult.\n\"I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt about the colleagues at Newmarket who are still working,\" she says. \"They've really held the fort for the rest of our team.\"\nShe used to travel around the country, talking to clients and going to conferences.\n\"When something like that is completely taken away from you, you almost feel lost,\" she says. \"My purpose is gone now because this is what I've worked towards my whole career, starting way back when I was 17 years old.\nThe furlough scheme has helped to prevent a spike in unemployment; jobless rates have remained below 5%, despite the pandemic shock to the economy.\nEmployers have been able to retain qualified staff, and reopen businesses quickly when pandemic restrictions allowed.\n\"The furlough scheme has been critical. It's part of the difference between survival and not,\" said Mark Vincent, chief financial officer at travel company Newmarket Holidays. \nBut he said that his firm, like others in the travel sector, would inevitably need to consider redundancies.\n\"In those winter months, we're all going to be loss-making and therefore, we're going to have to relook at what we do with our staffing.\"\nSteve Haslam, who owns pub chain TLC Inns, said he was very grateful that the government had provided an income to his employees, but he is more sceptical of the benefits to business, particularly the idea it would help firms retain staff.\n\"A lot of people didn't come back to work... because they just didn't want to come back, either into the industry or they'd gone off and found second jobs. We had one site where 80% of staff left.\"\nHe believes the end of furlough will make it easier for hospitality businesses like his to recruit new staff.\nAt the start of the pandemic, most of those on furlough were in younger age brackets.\nBut as the economy has reopened, many younger workers have returned to their old jobs or to new ones. Now about half of the people left on furlough are over 45, according to the Resolution Foundation.\nThe think tank says that older workers on furlough are now more likely to be let go, if businesses decide to restructure in the face of uncertainty.\n\"Reopening the economy has led to a surge in people returning to work from furlough, particularly young people in sectors like hospitality and leisure,\" said Karl Handscomb, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation.\n\"But not everyone is back working. Over one in four older workers who were furloughed during the recent lockdown have remained parked on furlough during the reopening, and now face a higher risk of unemployment as the scheme starts to be unwound.\"\nThe hundreds of billions in support has been dizzying, historic, and effective at keeping unemployment much lower, but now the great rollback begins. \nThough the economy is bouncing back strongly, this is a moment of acute sensitivity, as businesses start to discover whether they will keep going as government support is slowly withdrawn.\nThe most significant change will be a reduction in the generosity of the furlough scheme. Employers must find the equivalent of a tenth of their workers' wages, with that proportion increasing next month.\nThe holiday for stamp duty will also begin to be tapered, the business rates holiday becomes less generous, and delayed payments for VAT will restart.\nAll this comes with restrictions still in place, and some sectors, such as travel, very unlikely to get back to normal soon.\nBusiness groups representing small businesses have warned of a serious economic flashpoint.\nIt is unclear whether the end of furlough will lead to a significant rise in the unemployment rate, according to Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies.\nGiven the strength of the economic recovery, the number of job vacancies being advertised, and the fall in the number of people on furlough since the beginning of the year, Mr Wilson said the number of people being made unemployed could be in the \"low hundreds of thousands rather than the millions\" as feared last year.\nHe said that by September, when the scheme ends, the number of people on full furlough \"will be pretty low indeed\"."

      "text": "Counting is under way in the Batley and Spen by-election, with Labour desperate not to lose a seat it has held since 1997 to the Conservatives.\nSixteen candidates are running in the West Yorkshire constituency, the best known of them being former Labour and Respect MP George Galloway.\nThe campaign has been marred by acrimony, personal abuse and allegations of dirty tricks.\nThe by-election result is expected to come at around 05:00 BST on Friday.\nTurnout was 47.6%, with some 37,786 verified ballots cast out of a total electorate of 79,373, Kirklees Council said.\nIn another by-election in May the Conservatives took Hartlepool, a once rock-solid Labour seat, with a majority of almost 7,000 votes.\nThis came in addition to the loss by Labour of more than 300 councillors in England's local elections.\nThe Batley and Spen contest is seen as an important test for leader Sir Keir Starmer, who, it has been reported, could face a challenge from his deputy Angela Rayner if the party loses another northern English constituency to the Tories.\nSir Keir's team insists he will fight the next general election and friends of Ms Rayner say she is not planning to oppose her boss.\nThe Batley and Spen vote was called after the previous MP, former Coronation Street actress Tracy Brabin, became West Yorkshire's first elected mayor in May.\nShe first won the seat in a by-election following the murder of previous MP Jo Cox by a far-right extremist in Birstall, part of the constituency, in 2016.\nMs Cox's sister, Kim Leadbeater, is Labour's candidate this time, but she faces a strong challenge from Conservative Ryan Stephenson.\nIn a statement after the polls closed, she said there had been \"many highs\" to the election campaign but also \"some unacceptable lows\". \n\"The acts of intimidation and violence by some who have come here with the sole aim of sowing division have been deeply upsetting to witness,\" she said. \n\"Whatever the result... the first priorities of the new MP must be to bring our community together and start working for local people in every part of the constituency.\"\nLabour's majority at the 2019 general election was 3,525 - slightly smaller than in Hartlepool.\nBut the by-election result in Batley and Spen is expected to be close, although the involvement of Mr Galloway, running for the Workers Party, has added to the sense of uncertainty.\nThe contest has at times become very bitter, with Labour activists claiming earlier this week that they had been egged, kicked and verbally assaulted while out campaigning.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson described such behaviour as \"absolutely appalling\".\nAnd on Wednesday Mr Galloway threatened legal action against Kirklees Council, which is overseeing the by-election, after it took down his posters.\nThis happened after officials said the text identifying the details of his political party was too small.\nMr Galloway, who pulled off a by-election upset in 2012 when he took Bradford West from Labour for his Respect Party, said earlier this week: \"I'm standing against Keir Starmer. If Keir Starmer loses this by-election, it's curtains for Keir Starmer.\"\nThe Conservatives have fought a relatively low-key campaign but Mr Stephenson has said he is \"squarely focused on talking to voters about the issues that matter here\".\n\"George Galloway and Keir Starmer's candidate have been fighting like cats in a sack over internal Labour Party issues,\" he told Yorkshire Live, \"and that's a matter for them.\"\nThe candidates were (in alphabetical order):"

      "text": "Covid-19 infections have risen by 10% in a week in Europe after two months in decline and the risk of a new wave of cases is growing, says the World Health Organization.\nRegional director Hans Kluge said the risk had been heightened by sluggish vaccine rollouts, new variants and increased social mixing.\nThere was also a danger that Euro 2020 could act as a \"super-spreader\".\nHundreds of fans returning from London and St Petersburg have tested positive.\nWHO senior emergency officer Catherine Smallwood called on host cities to do more to monitor the movement of fans.\n\"What we need to look at is around the stadia,\" she said, highlighting travel before and after matches. \"What's happening after the games? Are they going into crowded bars and pubs?\"\nThe Delta variant, which originated in India, is seen as the biggest threat by many countries in Europe. The European Union's disease control agency ECDC estimates that it could account for 90% of cases by the end of August. \nRussia has seen record numbers of deaths for the past three days, with 672 fatalities and 23,543 new cases announced on Thursday alone. Most of the new cases in Moscow are of the Delta variant, and top health officials are also talking of a new Delta-plus variant.\nEuro 2020 host city St Petersburg recorded 115 deaths in the past 24 hours on Thursday, on the eve of its sixth and last tournament match between Spain and Switzerland.\nFinnish health authorities appealed to the public to avoid travelling to Russia after 400 infections were linked to fans returning from St Petersburg on 21 June. \nEuropean football's governing body, Uefa, was branded \"irresponsible\" by German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who said it was clear that hugging supporters would help spread the virus. He was particularly critical of the decision to allow 60,000 supporters into the stadium at Budapest and at Wembley in London for the semi-finals and final.\n\"I cannot explain why UEFA is not being sensible... I suspect it is due to commercialism,\" he told reporters. Uefa is adamant that decisions on the number of fans allowed inside a stadium \"fall under the responsibility of the competent local authorities\".\nPublic Health Scotland said on Wednesday that 1,294 Covid cases had been linked to people who had travelled to London for the Euro 2020 match against England on 18 June, including 397 fans who were at Wembley.\nAcross the UK, another 27,989 cases have been recorded, the highest number since January. However, 62.7% of UK adults have had two vaccine doses.\nIn other developments:\nThe EU's medicine agency says that two doses of the vaccines it has so far approved appear to provide protection against the Delta variant.\nWhile vaccine rollouts have accelerated across the EU in recent months and at least one in three people have had both doses, that is not the case in Russia.\nPresident Vladimir Putin appealed on Wednesday for Russians to get vaccinated, however only 16% have had a single shot so far. Moscow health clinics have begun offering booster jabs in an attempt to curb the spread, however local reports say supplies of at least one vaccine have run out in the city's clinics.\nHans Kluge said that across the WHO's Europe region, which includes Central Asia, only 24% of people were covered and half of elderly people and 40% of health care workers remained unprotected."

      "text": "The Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex will meet later to unveil a statue of their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, on what would have been her 60th birthday.\nThe event will be William and Harry's first appearance together since the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral in April.\nCommissioned by the brothers in 2017, the statue will stand in Kensington Palace's redesigned Sunken Garden.\nAt the time, they said they hoped it would help visitors to the palace \"reflect on her life and her legacy\".\nHarry, who lives in the US with his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, and their two children, arrived in the UK last week in order to complete his quarantine ahead of Thursday's event.\nOn Wednesday, he paid a surprise visit to children's charity WellChild's awards ceremony for seriously ill children in the UK.\nKensington Palace confirmed that, in addition to the royal brothers, members of Diana's close family will attend the unveiling, which is due to take place this afternoon.\nThe committee that oversaw the statue's creation and the redesign of the garden that will be its home will also attend. \nIan Rank-Broadley, who has a long track record of creating images of the Royal Family, was chosen to sculpt it, and he will also be among the guests.\nThe ceremony - scaled back due to Covid restrictions - will be a \"small event and a very personal moment for the family\", a source told the PA News agency.\nKensington Palace said the Sunken Garden had been \"one of the princess's favourite locations\" when she lived there.\nMore than 4,000 flowers have been planted for the garden's redesign, which has taken 1,000 hours to complete.\nThe garden, which sits within London's Hyde Park, will be open to the public to visit for free from tomorrow, in line with Kensington Palace's opening hours. \nThe birthday flowers and balloons outside the railings of Kensington Palace are a reminder that despite her death almost 24 years ago, Diana has not been forgotten.\nBack when they were on much friendlier terms, Princes William and Harry commissioned this statue to be a permanent reminder of her \"positive impact on the UK and the world\".\nMuch has changed since then. Physically, the Sunken Garden has been redesigned and replanted with her favourite flowers. \nBut it is the changed relationship between her two boys which will overshadow much of the unveiling.\nThis will be a family event but William and Harry will know that the small number of cameras allowed in to capture the moment will be trained on them and their interactions. \nIt will add to the pressure they will be feeling on a deeply personal and poignant day for them. \nSpeaking about his mother's death in a recent interview, Harry said he had been willing to drink and take drugs to cope with the pain of losing her.\nHe also spoke of his family's unwillingness to talk about the death, and how he was expected to \"suffer\" in silence.\nThe comments, along with a series of other revelations, followed the Sussexes' decision to step down as senior royals at the beginning of 2020.\nPrincess Diana was killed in a car crash in August 1997, when Prince William and Prince Harry were aged just 15 and 12. \nIan Rank-Broadley is no stranger to depicting royalty. His effigy of the Queen appeared on all UK and Commonwealth coins since 1998, while another of his likenesses of the monarch appears on a plaque at the Supreme Court in Parliament Square.\nEarlier this month a limited-edition \u00a35 coin commemorating the life of the Duke of Edinburgh featuring Rank-Broadley's likeness of Prince Philip was unveiled on Armed Forces Day.\nTwo of his sculptures - a group of stretcher bearers carrying a wounded soldier and another group tending to an injured comrade - can be seen at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.\nHis other work includes a sculpture of a machine gunner that stands on the Royal Anglian Regimental Memorial at the Imperial War Museum in Duxford, Cambridgeshire."

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has said it is still possible to find survivors in the rubble of a building that collapsed last week near Miami in Florida.\nSpeaking after meeting families of people who died or are still missing, he said they were going \"through hell\", and that federal funding for the rescue effort would continue for a month.\nHe also said it was essential to find out what caused the collapse. \nEighteen bodies have been recovered but 145 people are still unaccounted for. \nRescue efforts resumed on Thursday evening after a 15-hour halt amid concerns about the stability of the remaining structure of the Champlain Towers South. Nobody has been pulled alive from the rubble since the first hours after the disaster.\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said officials were planning for the possible demolition of the remaining structure, and a decision would need to be made \"extremely carefully and methodically,\" given how it would affect the search-and-rescue mission.\nEarlier this week, in an interview with news outlet WPLG, a rescue worker recalled hearing a woman's voice underneath the debris - and his team's desperate attempt to get her out.\n\"We were continuously talking to her... 'Honey we got you. We're going to get to you',\" the worker said.\nBut despite their continuous efforts, the woman died of her injuries.\nAddressing relatives in a private meeting, President Biden drew his own experience of grief as he offered his prayers and support. In a video posted on social media, he was seen speaking in sombre tones about the death of his wife and daughter in a car accident.\nLater in a news conference, he said the \"whole nation\" was mourning with the families, and that he was \"holding out hope\" that survivors could be found.\n\"They're praying and pleading that 'God, let there be a miracle',\" he said. \"There is still a possibility that someone could be alive, that someone is breathing.\"\nPresident Biden also met firefighters and other first responders who have been working at the site and paid respects at the memorial site for the victims alongside First Lady Jill Biden.\nEight days after the disaster, officials are still searching for answers about what might have caused the 40-year-old block's sudden collapse in the town of Surfside, north of Miami.\nExperts gathering information at the scene are considering a range of possible causes - from structural defects to environmental influences - and whether a combination of factors may have triggered the fall.\nAt the news conference, President Biden noted that many of the victims' families mentioned potential causes, such as rising sea levels and climate change. But he added: \"I don't think there is at this point any definitive judgement as to why it collapsed.\"\nOn Wednesday, it emerged that residents had received a letter in April warning them of worsening structural damage to the building.\nLawsuits are already being filed over the disaster, with the latest accusing the block's building association of \"reckless and negligent conduct\".\nMiami-Dade County State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said she would convene a special grand jury to examine building safety and \"what steps we can take to safeguard our residents\" from similar disasters in the future."

I have always maintained my innocence.\"\nMr Cosby is best known for starring in the 1980s TV series The Cosby Show and was once known as \"America's Dad\".\nDozens of women have publicly accused Mr Cosby of sexual assault, but he was only tried criminally for the incident against Ms Constand. His conviction in 2018 was widely seen as a landmark moment in the #MeToo movement.\nIn a verdict issued on Wednesday, Pennsylvania's highest court found there was a \"process violation\" because Mr Cosby's lawyers had made an agreement with a previous state prosecutor that he would not be charged in the case.\nThe former actor appeared frail as he slowly walked to waiting media outside his home, shortly after being released from prison.\nAmong Mr Cosby's accusers to speak out against the ruling was Patricia Leary Steuer.\nShe told CNN: \"There were more than 63 of us who came forward in the end. I'm wondering what the purpose was of the 43 years of this ordeal and the trauma that I had and the trauma that my family endured as a result.\"\nJanice Baker-Kinney, who accused Mr Cosby of giving her pills and raping her in the 1980s, told WPVI-TV: \"I am stunned, I am shocked and my stomach is in a knot ... One legal ease can overturn this when so many people came forward.\"\nMeanwhile, celebrities have been taking to social media to condemn the decision.\nActor and activist Amber Tamblyn wrote on Twitter: \"I am furious to hear this news. I personally know women who this man drugged and raped while unconscious. Shame on the court and this decision.\"\nColumnist E Jean Carroll, who is one of several women to have accused former US President Donald Trump of sexual assault, said: \"THIS is why women do not come forward.\"\nActor Debra Messing tweeted that the decision was \"horrifying\".\n\"This is sickening. My heart is with my sister survivors. We have work to do,\" tweeted Rosanna Arquette, who was one of the first women to come forward to accuse film producer Harvey Weinstein of assault.\nAnita Hill, chair of The Hollywood Commission, which works to stop abuse in the entertainment industry, said in a statement: \"The Cosby ruling demonstrates how failures in our criminal justice systems make accountability for sexual assault impossible.\"\n\"Sexual assault, harassment and extortion happens in workplaces every day. Systems that ensure accountability for powerful abusers, protect workers and prevent agreements that shield abusers are urgently needed in entertainment and other industries.\"\nSome have expressed anger at the prosecutor and Pennsylvania Supreme Court for overturning the conviction, including author Keith Boykin.\nHowever, some welcomed the decision.\nActor Phylicia Rashad, who played his wife on the Cosby Show, wrote on Twitter: \"A terrible wrong is being righted - a miscarriage of justice is corrected!\" in response to the news.\nMr Cosby was found guilty on three counts of felony indecent assault against Ms Constand. \nDecades his junior, she met him in 2002 when working at Temple University in Philadelphia and described the comedian as a mentor figure. She later testified at trial how she became \"frozen\" after Cosby drugged and molested her at his home in 2004.\nMs Constand first came forward to police about the assault in 2005, but former state prosecutor Bruce Castor did not press criminal charges. She then sued the comedian for sexual battery and defamation, reaching a settlement with a confidentially agreement in 2006.\nIn 2014 and 2015, dozens of women came forward with similar allegations of drugging and assault by Mr Cosby. Local authorities knew that statute-of-limitation rules meant they could not pursue the majority of these accusations - but they reopened the case involving Ms Constand and eventually charged him just days before the 12-year limit on her allegations was set to expire. \nA judge declared a mistrial in his first trial in 2017 after the jury failed to reach a verdict.\nThe testimony of other accusers was then allowed during a second trial, which helped prosecutors paint a pattern of predatory behaviour by Mr Cosby.\n\"There is only one remedy that can completely restore Cosby to the status quo ante. He must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be barred\", the finding released on Wednesday reads.\nPeter Goldberger, a lawyer with an expertise in criminal appeals, told the Associated Press that prosecutors could ask the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to reconsider but it would be very unlikely to succeed."

      "tags": "Britney Spears",
      "text": "A financial firm has asked to withdraw as co-conservator of pop star Britney Spears' financial affairs, citing her objections in court last week.\nThe Bessemer Trust are named as joint guardians of her estate, along with her father Jamie Spears. \nThe star previously asked through a lawyer to end her father's involvement but last week gave explosive testimony against the entire arrangement.\nShe described the conservatorship as \"abusive\" and asked for her life back.\nBessemer Trust filed a motion to withdraw from the arrangement on Thursday, just one day after the latest order in the long-running legal saga upheld their role as co-conservators. \nThe financial firm cited the singer's 23 June court testimony as the reason it wants to quit.\nIn a court filing, the company said it had \"relied on the representations\" that the ongoing conservatorship was voluntary and that all parties, including Spears, had consented to its involvement.  \nThe firm said it had heard Britney Spears's desire to terminate the conservatorship and was seeking to respect her wishes. \nThe BBC has contacted the Bessemer Trust for a statement. \nBritney Spears has been under a conservatorship arrangement, governing her personal and financial affairs, for more than a decade.\nHer father was initially put in charge of both parts in 2008 after she was twice hospitalised amid a series of public incidents that sparked widespread concern about her wellbeing.\nThe arrangement has been extended in the years since, with many of the details and hearings kept outside of the public eye. \nThe Bessemer Trust only officially entered the arrangement as co-conservators on Wednesday after a US judge denied a request to remove Jamie Spears from the agreement. That decision, which did not factor in last week's hearing, was in response to a request by the singer's court-appointed lawyer last year asking for the financial firm to be the only party involved. \nSamuel Ingham had argued the 39-year-old was afraid of her father and said she refused to return to the stage while he remained in control of her career. \nAt a specially-convened hearing last week, Britney Spears described the conservatorship as \"abusive\" and said she wanted it to end.\nThe testimony was the singer's first full public statement about her situation and has sparked an outpouring of public support for her bid for freedom. \nIt came after years of speculation and concern from fans campaigning under the banner of #FreeBritney. \nSpeaking for 23 minutes, the star alleged she had been drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from having children under the arrangement. \n\"I've been in denial. I've been in shock. I am traumatised,\" she told the court. \"I just want my life back.\"\nHowever, her lawyer is yet to file a formal request to terminate the conservatorship."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,Brexit",
      "text": "The Northern Ireland Protocol is lawful, a High Court judge in Belfast has ruled.\nA group of unionist politicians, including Arlene Foster and Lord Trimble, had challenged the protocol in judicial review proceedings.\nThey claimed it was unlawful because it conflicts with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and the Acts of Union.\nBut Mr Justice Colton rejected their challenge on all grounds on Wednesday afternoon.\nMr Colton found that the Withdrawal Agreement Act, which includes the protocol, does conflict with the 1800 Acts of Union in respect of free trade between Britain and Northern Ireland.\nHowever, he added that the relevant parts of the Acts of Union are \"impliedly repealed\" by the Withdrawal Agreement Act.\nThat means that the more recent legislation automatically overrides the older laws.\nHe said the Acts of Union could not be used to override the \"clear specific will of Parliament\".\nNormally, a constitutional law, like the Acts of Union, can only be expressly repealed, but they can be impliedly by another constitutional law.\nThe judge said the Withdrawal Agreement Act meets the definition of a constitutional law.\nHe also rejected the argument that the protocol had changed the constitutional status as defined in the Good Friday Agreement.\nFurthermore, he found that the secretary of state did have the power to change Stormont's usual cross-community voting mechanism.\nNormally, Stormont must approve controversial issues by a cross-community vote but the protocol will be subject to a straight-majority vote.\nThe judge said the secretary of state had the power to do this on two grounds: that it was necessary to reflect the will of Parliament in implementing the Withdrawal Agreement Act and that it concerns international relations which is not a devolved matter.\nFurther areas of challenge concerning EU law were also rejected.\nThe judge was also critical of an analogy used by the applicants' barrister when he compared the operation of the protocol to the Vichy regime.\nVichy was the collaborationist French administration during the Nazi occupation.\nThe judge said such a comparison was \"unhelpful\".\nAn adjoining case, taken by Belfast pastor Clifford Peeples, was also dismissed by the judge.\nOthers pursuing the lead judicial review case included former Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken, TUV leader Jim Allister, former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib and Baroness Hoey. \nWednesday's judgement is likely to be appealed and the case could ultimately be heard by the Supreme Court before the end of 2021.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the government would \"study in detail\" the High Court ruling, after being asked about it during Prime Minister's Questions. \nDUP MP Ian Paisley asked if the government would \"reverse the mistakes of the Northern Ireland Protocol, seize the moment, defend the union to unilaterally fix and put Northern Ireland out of its commercial, social and economic misery\".\nMr Johnson said: \"Nothing will affect the position of Northern Ireland as part of the UK - we will make sure we uphold that.\"\nAlliance MP Stephen Farry also urged the prime minister to accept the ruling as a \"watershed where we can stop talking about the protocol in constitutional and identity terms\".\nThe prime minister replied that the \"best thing\" the EU could do was remove all the problems associated with the protocol's application.\n\"I hope all that can be fixed indeed and then we can move on,\" he added. \nDUP leader designate Sir Jeffrey Donaldson described the ruling as \"politically significant\" and would have potential consequences for \"the future stability of political institutions\".\nIn a tweet, he said the judgement confirmed the \"protocol damages our constitutional position in the UK contrary to the principle of consent and various agreements\".\nUlster Unionist MLA Steve Aiken said his party acknowledged the decision, but said it is \"an issue of such magnitude that it needs to be appealed to a higher court\".\nSpeaking at a press conference in Belfast following the judgement, Mr Habib said: \"The only positive you might put on it is we do now officially know that the union of the United Kingdom has been trampled on by the protocol.\"\nMr Habib said the prime minister now \"has to face up to the reality that his own judicial system has said that the union of the United Kingdom has been broken\".\nFormer Labour MP Kate Hoey - now Baroness Hoey - said it must be \"absolutely clear that this is only the beginning of the legal challenge and also of peoples' protests against what has been done to us without consent\".\nTUV leader Jim Allister said the court ruling \"confirmed the protocol is dismantling the union\".\nMr Allister said the ruling \"underscores the necessity to step up the political battle against the protocol\".\nHe said the UK government must \"now reverse the mistake of repeal, if the PM's words mean anything\".\n\"No more propping up the Belfast Agreement institutions while the protocol manoeuvres us out of the union,\" he added.\nSinn F\u00e9in MLA Declan Kearney said \"there is no credible alternative to the protocol\". \n\"It's ironic that the Tory/DUP cheerleaders of Brexit are now so opposed to the protocol that was made necessary by their reckless pursuit of a hard Brexit,\" he said."

      "title": "Asylum queue nine times longer than 10 years ago",
      "text": "The number of migrants waiting in the UK for their asylum claims to be processed was nine times higher by the end of last year than it was in 2010. \nOne is Patricia, 19, who fled war and abuse in Liberia and says her mental health has suffered during the two years she has waited for a decision. \nThere are currently 65,000 people in the queue, official figures obtained by the Refugee Council suggest.\nThe Home Office said it had a plan to \"fix the broken asylum system\".\nThe Refugee Council obtained the figures from the Home Office under Freedom of Information legislation. \nThe organisation's analysis shows the pandemic has contributed to a backlog which rose by a quarter in 2020.\nThe figures show: \nAsylum seekers have told the BBC how being in limbo has affected their mental health. \nPatricia, who asked not to use her real name, told the BBC she was given up by her family as a baby in war-torn Liberia.\nIn her teens, abuse from her foster family forced her to run away. \nPeople traffickers brought her to Britain two years ago, aged 17, and she claimed asylum. \nInitially, officials said they would respond to her application \"as soon as possible\" and talked about looking at the case \"for 45 days\".\n\"The 45 days has taken more than two years now,\" she says. \nHaving her life put on hold for so long \"has had a big effect,\" she says. \n\"I can't sleep well. I can't do anything good that I have to do\". \nWithout an asylum decision, she cannot work, find a permanent home or take part in the vocational part of her college course. \nHaving lost touch with her family years ago, Patricia has no support and she describes the wait as a \"very tough time for me\". \nKemal was a maths teacher before he said he had to flee persecution by the Turkish government because of his links to the banned Gulenist movement.\nThe only contact he has had with his wife and children for two years is through the internet. \nHe lives in shared accommodation in Gateshead but the Home Office has yet to provide an initial ruling on whether his claim to have suffered political persecution in Turkey entitles him to refugee status. \nHe says the wait has made him anxious and depressed.\n\"I was down, gloomy every day... for example last year, around three months... I just cannot sleep, something happening in my throat... I don't know what's happening. \n\"If I didn't have faith, I could do myself bad things.\"\nRefugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon says the backlog should be top of the agenda when it comes to reform of the asylum system. \n\"If you look at what the government has published, its proposals to reform the asylum system, there's nothing in it that talks about backlogs and delay, there's nothing in it which sets out a plan to address this problem.\" \nThe Home Office told the BBC it had a plan to \"fix the broken asylum system, which has been abused by those who have come here illegally, leading to increased numbers in the system and preventing genuine cases being looked at quickly. \n \"This is the most significant overhaul of our asylum system in decades, which will increase the fairness and efficacy of our system so that we can better protect and support those in genuine need of asylum.\n \"We are working to streamline cases and have already made significant progress in prioritising those with acute vulnerability but we are determined to clear the backlog to help speed up decisions and prevent people remaining in the system for long periods of time.\"  "

      "tags": "Companies,New York City,Donald Trump,United States",
      "text": "Former US President Donald Trump's company and its finance chief have been charged with tax-related crimes.\nAllen Weisselberg, 73, turned himself in to New York authorities on Thursday. He was later charged with concealing $1.7m (\u00a31.2m) worth of income.\nProsecutors say the 15-year-long scheme helped executives evade taxes by giving benefits, such as rent and school fees, that were hidden from the authorities.\nLawyers for the firm and Mr Weisselberg have pleaded not guilty to tax fraud.\nNo charges were brought against Mr Trump personally, though prosecutors said the former president had signed some of the cheques at the centre of the case. \nThe Trump Organization is a family holding company that owns hotels, golf clubs and other properties - and the cornerstone of a global brand that encompassed book deals, TV shows and Trump-emblazoned skyscrapers.\nThe criminal charges are the first to arise from long-running investigations into alleged fraud by both the Manhattan district attorney and the state attorney general. \nThe inquiry by District Attorney Cyrus Vance focused on whether Mr Weisselberg and other company executives received benefits such as apartment rentals or leased cars without reporting them properly on their tax returns.\nThe charges announced on Thursday include tax fraud and falsifying business records.\nAt the hearing at Manhattan's criminal court, prosecutor Carey Dunne said this was a \"sweeping and audacious\" scheme involving \"off-the-books payments\".\n\"It was orchestrated by the most senior executives who were financially benefiting themselves and the company, by getting secret pay raises at the expense of state and federal taxpayers,\" he said.\nMr Weisselberg \"is prepared to fight these charges in court,\" his lawyers said.\nMr Trump and his allies have said the investigations are politically motivated. The indictment was served as Mr Trump has been discussing a potential comeback run for president in 2024. \nThe ex-president issued a statement slamming the announcement: \"The political witch hunt by the radical left Democrats, with New York now taking over the assignment, continues. \n\"It is dividing our country like never before,\" he said.\nEarlier on Thursday, the Trump Organization said Mr Vance was using Mr Weisselberg, who has worked for Trump's business for nearly 50 years, \"as a pawn in a scorched earth attempt to harm the former president\".\n\"This is not justice; this is politics,\" the company said.\nHowever, during the court proceedings, prosecutor Carey Dunne said: \"To address what this case is not about: It's not about politics.\n\"This investigation, which is ongoing, has been thorough, careful and proper, and has been limited to subject matters within our New York jurisdiction.\" \nIf the company is found guilty, however, certain business partners might draw a line under their relationship with the Trump Organization and the company could face fines.\nNew York City, for example, has already announced it will terminate contracts with the firm to run skating rinks, a carousel and a golf course, in the aftermath of the US Capitol riots.\nDaniel Goldman, who was lead lawyer in the US House of Representatives for the first impeachment of Mr Trump in 2019, tweeted that the indictment could spur lenders to call in their loans, driving the Trump Organization to bankruptcy.\nThe investigations will also take into account eight years of Mr Trump's personal and corporate tax returns, obtained by prosecutors after a long legal battle, which ended in the Supreme Court in February.\nMr Trump, who inherited money from his father and went on to become a property developer, is the first president since Gerald Ford in the 1970s not to have made his tax returns public.\nDespite facing a number of investigations, the former president has denied any wrongdoing personally or in his business.\nNew York City has already cut business ties with the twice-impeached former president."

The company said it was \"working with partners across the food and drink industry\" to address the problem.\nThe Road Haulage Association believes there is currently a shortfall of about 60,000 drivers.\nIt estimates that some 30,000 HGV driving tests did not take place last year because of the Covid pandemic.\nThe haulage industry is one of a number of sectors having trouble finding suitable staff as the economy reopens, leading some experts to talk of the UK's missing workers.\nKate Shoesmith, deputy chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, told the BBC last month that before the pandemic, many lorry drivers in the UK had been nationals of EU countries, particularly Romania and Bulgaria. \nThey stayed in the UK after the Brexit referendum, but started leaving when coronavirus struck, she said.\n\"They have either sourced work in their home countries or they feel it's not right to return to the UK, either because of Brexit or the pandemic,\" Ms Shoesmith added.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We're working with industry and have already taken action on HGV driver shortages, including ramping up vocational test capacity, and funding apprenticeships. \n\"However, most of the solutions are likely to be driven by industry, with progress already being made in testing and hiring, and a big push towards improving pay, working conditions and diversity.\""

      "tags": "Xi Jinping,Asia,China,Communist Party of China,Hong Kong",
      "text": "China's President Xi Jinping has warned that foreign powers will \"get their heads bashed\" if they attempt to bully or influence the country.\nHe delivered a defiant speech at an event marking the centenary of the ruling Communist Party on Thursday.\nMr Xi also said Beijing would not allow \"sanctimonious preaching\", in remarks widely seen as directed at the US.\nIt comes as China faces criticism over alleged human rights abuses and its crackdown in Hong Kong.\nRelations between the US and China have worsened in recent times over trade, espionage and the pandemic. \nThe issue of Taiwan is also a major source of tension. While democratic Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state, Beijing views the island as a breakaway province.\nThe US, under its own laws, is required to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself should Beijing use force to take the island back. \nOn Thursday Mr Xi said China maintains an \"unshakeable commitment\" to unification with Taiwan.\n\"No one should underestimate the resolve, the will and ability of the Chinese people to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" he said. \nIn response, Taiwan said it was determined to defend its sovereignty and democracy.\n\"Beijing should introduce democratic reforms, such as party competition, and respect for human rights while behaving as a responsible regional player,\" the island's Mainland Affairs Council was quoted as saying by the Taiwan News website.\nThe 100th anniversary celebrations on Thursday morning saw military jet fly-pasts, cannon salutes and patriotic songs played. \nA carefully vetted crowd were in attendance in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, many of whom were not wearing masks. \nThe country has seen a media blitz in recent weeks promoting a party-approved version of China's history.\nHong Kong is also marking its handover anniversary on the same day.\nMr Xi, who spoke for around an hour, reiterated the role of the party in modern China, saying that it has been central to the country's growth and that attempts to separate it from the people would fail. \n\"Only socialism can save China, and only socialism with Chinese characteristics can develop China,\" he said, referring to the system under which the party embraced markets to reform the economy.\nHe added that \"we will never allow anyone to bully, oppress or subjugate China\".\n\"Anyone who dares try to do that will have their heads bashed bloody against the Great Wall of Steel forged by over 1.4 billion Chinese people,\" he said. \nChina has repeatedly accused the US of trying to curb its growth - and these comments are also seen as a reference to Washington. \nOn Hong Kong and Macau - which he said both retain a \"high degree of autonomy\" - they should \"accurately implement the principles of 'one country, two systems'\", which underpinned the deal for Britain and Portugal to return the territories to China.\nXi Jinping, modern China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, wore a light grey suit which appeared to be identical to the one worn by the Communist Party founder in the famous portrait that adorns one side of Tiananmen Square. \nMr Xi praised his people for the \"new world\" he said they had created. \nWhat he was also saying was that this is a world that could not have come into being without the Party. \nAt one point military jets flew over the crowd in formation of the number 100; flown by pilots loyal to the Party and the people.\n It's easy to forget when you live here but a key part of the Communist Party strategy has been to try to morph the Party and the machinery of government and the perception of the nation of China into one. \nThey attribute any success, progress, advancement - and there has been phenomenal economic advancement - to the people and the government but most of all the Party. \nJust to make sure the message went out loud and clear, at the end of the ceremony, the crowd sung a song called \"Without the Communist Party There Would Be No New China\".\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which was founded in 1921, came to power 72 years ago after a long civil war. \nIn that time the country has undergone massive changes - but some of these milestones were conspicuously missing in the propaganda drive. \nOn Monday, an art performance titled The Great Journey was staged at the Bird's Nest stadium in Beijing, where performers put on extravagant set-pieces detailing the history of the party and country. \nBut significant events such the Cultural Revolution purges, the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong were missing, reported AFP news agency.\nSince April, Chinese cinemas were ordered to screen propaganda films, known as \"red films\", at least twice a week.\nA song, called 100%, that praised China's achievements and featured 100 rappers was also released.\n\"Red tourism\" has also become popular, with travel companies such as Ctrip launching 100 unique routes for \"red pilgrims\". \nBut not all were pleased with the propaganda. \n\"Now when I turn on the TV at night, dozens of stations are airing dramas about revolutionary wars,\" a Beijing resident told BBC Chinese. \nReporting by Waiyee Yip and BBC Chinese"

      "text": "Covid is common in pet cats and dogs whose owners have the disease, research suggests.\nSwabs were taken from 310 pets in 196 households where a human infection had been detected.\nSix cats and seven dogs returned a positive PCR result, while 54 animals tested positive for virus antibodies.\n\"If you have Covid, you should avoid contact with your cat or dog, just as you would do with other people,\" Dr Els Broens, from Utrecht University, said.\n\"The main concern is not the animals' health but the potential risk that pets could act as a reservoir of the virus and reintroduce it into the human population.\"\nThe authors of the study said no evidence of pet-to-owner transmission had been recorded to date but it would be difficult to detect while the virus was still spreading easily between humans.\nMost infected pets tend to be asymptomatic or display mild Covid symptoms. \nResearchers from Utrecht University sent a mobile veterinary clinic to households in the Netherlands that had tested positive for Covid at some point in the past 200 days.\nSwabs were taken from their pet cats and dogs to test for evidence of a current infection, while blood samples were also tested for antibodies suggesting a past exposure to Covid.\nThe results were presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases:\nFollow-up tests showed all the PCR-positive (polymerase chain reaction) animals cleared the infection and went on to develop antibodies.\nThe researchers say the most likely route of virus transmission is from human to animal, rather than the other way round.\n\"We can't say there is a 0% risk of owners catching Covid from their pets,\"  Veterinary Microbiological Diagnostic Centre Dr Broens said.\n\"At the moment, the pandemic is still being driven by human-to-human infections, so we just wouldn't detect it.\"\nVets in Russia have started vaccinating some animals against the disease.\nBut Dr Broens said: \"I don't see the scientific evidence for that now. \n\"It seems unlikely that pets play a role in the pandemic.\"\nA separate study run by the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, found cats that slept on their owner's bed seemed to be at particular risk of infection. \nA total of 48 cats and 54 dogs from 77 households were tested for Covid antibodies and their owners asked about their interaction with their pets. \nAbout 67% of the owned cats and 43% of the owned dogs tested positive, compared with 9% of dogs and cats from an animal shelter and 3% of stray cats in the area.\nA quarter of the pets displayed a symptom of the disease, from loss of appetite to difficulty breathing. \nAnd although most cases were mild, three were severe.  \nThe study's authors said cats' biology may make them more susceptible to Covid. \nCats are also more likely to sleep near their owner's face than dogs, increasing their exposure to any infection.\nCambridge University veterinary medicine department head Prof James Wood said the two studies added to other evidence suggesting a substantial proportion of cats and dogs may catch the virus from their owners.\n\"The Dutch study is robustly conducted and shows that around 20% of exposed pets may be infected and that they eventually clear the infection just as most humans do,\" he said. \n\"Most reports are that this infection appears to be asymptomatic. \n\"It also seems that the virus does not normally transmit from dogs and cats to either other animals or their owners.\""

      "tags": "Contact tracing,Nicola Sturgeon,Jason Leitch",
      "text": "The huge increase in Covid-19 cases is straining Scotland's contact tracing system but it is \"not collapsing\", the national clinical director has said.\nFigures from Public Health Scotland suggest it is now taking longer to contact infectious people and to track down their close contacts.\nProf Jason Leitch said \"times of course stretch when numbers get big\".\nBut he said the country's contact tracing staff were still hitting international targets.\nA total of 4,234 new Covid cases were reported on Thursday, the latest in a series of new record highs in recent days.\nFigures for last week showed that just 29% of people who tested positive had spoken to a contact tracer within 24 hours of being logged in the Test and Protect system - by far the lowest on record.\nOpposition parties have called for more resources to be given to the Test and Protect system, warning that it was \"reaching breaking point\" and \"buckling under the pressure\".\nAsked about this on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Prof Leitch said: \"It's not collapsing. Not by any means.\n\"In fact there are thousands of my colleagues around the country today doing contact tracing and talking to positive cases and doing a fantastic job.\n\"But you can't have 4,000 cases without it straining. That's a lot.\"\nProf Leitch accepted that taking longer to conduct interviews with people who have tested positive \"potentially does lead to a bigger spread of the virus\".\nHe added: \"If you know you have been in touch with a positive case then use your common sense and be careful.\n\"Contact tracing is still getting in touch with people inside the recommended World Health Organisation time, but those times of course stretch when the numbers get big.\"\nAfter someone has tested positive, their case is logged on the Test and Protect system and a contact tracer conducts a telephone interview to establish where they have been and who they have been in close contact with.\nThese contacts - people who the \"index case\" has been in close physical proximity to for long enough to potentially infect them - are then told to isolate and book a test of their own.\nThe idea is to reduce the risk of these close contacts passing on the virus to more and more people, breaking the chains of transmission.\nThis means it needs to happen quickly, to reduce the amount of time potentially infectious people are out and about without knowing they could be spreading the virus.\nThe latest set of figures from Public Health Scotland suggest that the system is coming under increasing strain due to the record high level of new infections.\nThey are now being presented with more cases to deal with per day than they were in an entire week at the end of May.\nThe data - for the period running from 21 to 25 June - shows that 29.2% of people who tested positive had spoken to a contact tracer within 24 hours of being logged in the Test and Protect system.\nThis was down from 49.5% the previous week, and is by some distance the lowest percentage ever recorded by PHS - even at the peak of the \"second wave\" in January, it did not fall below 75%.\nIn early April - when there were far fewer infections and therefore index cases to interview - the figure stood at 95.6%.\nTracing is also taking a bit longer to complete, with just 20% being \"closed\" in the case management system - meaning the final contact interview has taken place - within 24 hours.\nThis is again the lowest percentage ever recorded by PHS. In April, 80% of cases were concluded within a day of being opened in the system.\nFewer cases being concluded quickly means more are taking longer, with the percentage of contact tracing exercises taking more than 48 hours to complete rising to 43% - its highest level since October 2020.\nEfforts are being made to streamline the system, so contact tracers can focus on getting through the ever-mounting pile of interviews with new cases.\nWhen case numbers were lower, they also tried to actually speak to close contacts by telephone, but Public Health Scotland says it has now switched to contacting them via text message as a default to make sure information and advice can be circulated as quickly as possible.\nStaff have also switched to sending text messages to travellers arriving from \"red list\" countries, who are required to quarantine, rather than calling them, and have dropped all \"secondary\" tracing - where in some cases, the contacts of contacts were notified.\nDuring the interviews themselves, teams have \"looked to increase capacity by prioritising the information collected during each call\" - essentially meaning less questions are asked about events, settings and travel.\nWhile Covid patients are waiting longer to be interviewed and fewer cases are being dealt with swiftly, the system's overall performance is still within the targets set for it by the government.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the aim is for 80% of new cases to have their close contacts traced and in quarantine within 72 hours of a positive test result.\nThe latest PHS figures had 85.9% of cases being complete within three days of being registered with Test and Protect.\nThis is down from 88.2% the previous week and 99.1% back in April, but still comfortably within the target range.\nMs Sturgeon cited the World Health Organisation as backing the 80% target.\nHowever guidance published by the WHO online appears to suggest that its goal is for 80% of the close contacts of each index case to be in quarantine within three days of them developing symptoms.\nThis difference in definitions makes it difficult to tell if Scotland is living up to international standards or not - the most recent PHS figures suggested that 23.5% of Scots had a wait of more than 72 hours between taking a test and being interviewed by a contact tracer.\nOpposition parties have called for Test and Protect to be given greater resources.\nScottish Conservative health spokeswoman Annie Wells said the surge in cases meant that it was \"imperative people are contacted as quickly as possible to stop any further spread of the virus\".\nShe added: \"The system is clearly completely overwhelmed with the spike in cases in recent weeks and SNP ministers must get on top of this situation immediately.\n\"The public would understandably be angry if continued failures within the Test and Protect system meant any potential delays to the further easing of restrictions.\"\nThe Scottish Lib Dems say the system is \"buckling under pressure\", with MP Wendy Chamberlain saying: \"The system needs urgent reinforcements - we need more tracers to be able to go and hunt down the virus because every minute counts.\"\nAnd Scottish Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie said \"mismanagement\" of the system was \"helping the virus to spread\".\nShe said: \"Test and Protect is collapsing under the pressure as cases spiral, and things will only get worse if we don't fix this. \n\"Minsters are cutting corners all over the place to try and keep the system afloat, but that will only make things worse.\"\nHave you been messaged or called by Test and Protect and told someone with Covid has been in contact with you?

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nFurlough, or the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme as it is formally known, starts to wind down from today - with employers now having to contribute. The UK government introduced the scheme in March 2020 and has so far spent \u00a366bn covering 80% of people's wages for businesses unable to operate due to Covid restrictions. About 1.5 million workers remain on furlough as more have returned to work with the easing of restrictions. Staff on the scheme will continue to receive 80% of their wages, but employers will now pay 10% of that for the first time, as the government drops its contribution to 70%. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies this could prompt layoffs, with older workers at greater risk of redundancy.\nSome people, including those pushing an anti-vaccine agenda online, have been claiming a large proportion of those dying with the Delta variant of coronavirus had been vaccinated. One conspiracy site even claimed vaccinated people were dying at higher rates than those who had not received the jab, which is untrue - the vaccine is reducing cases. Find out more here.\n\"If you have Covid, you should avoid contact with your cat or dog, just as you would do with other people,\" says Dr Els Broens, from Utrecht University. This is because research suggests coronavirus is common in pet cats and dogs whose owners have the disease. The study found six cats and seven dogs returned positive PCR results and 54 animals tested positive for virus antibodies from 310 pets tested in households where a human infection had been detected. The worry is the potential risk \"pets could act as a reservoir of the virus and reintroduce it into the human population,\" Dr Broens says.\nWhen pupils have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus in school, they are asked to isolate at home as per government policy. But the BBC has been told the government doesn't monitor how many of those self-isolating children end up getting the virus, therefore it cannot say what number of Covid cases in England are being prevented. This means the effectiveness of the policy cannot be fully judged says BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle. The government says the policy played a vital role in helping break the links in transmission but it is looking to replace the current system.\nThere's one item in a charity shop that's not up for sale - a wooden-back armchair with forest green upholstery. \"It is a worry chair. And we try and take their worries away,\" says Emma Brock who runs Fairstead Community Shop in King's Lynn, Norfolk. During the pandemic the shop run entirely by volunteers, provided prescription and food runs for the vulnerable, and called those who were housebound to check on them.

      "text": "A group of leading scientists is calling for the UK's official list of Covid symptoms to be expanded to ensure cases are not missed. \nThey point out the World Health Organization and US guidance include many other symptoms - such as a sore throat and runny nose.\nOthers warn this needs to be balanced against the risk of needlessly testing those who have other common illnesses.\nGovernment officials say they keep the symptom list under constant review.\nCurrent NHS advice states people should self-isolate and get a test if they have a high fever, a new continuous cough or a loss or change to their sense of smell or taste. \nBut the group of experts - including Prof Calum Semple, of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - points out not everyone who catches Covid displays these classic symptoms. \nWriting in The BMJ, they say \"unofficial\" symptoms such as a runny nose, headaches and muscle aches are more commonly seen in younger people, who are now more likely than older people to be infected.\nRecent analysis by the Zoe Covid Symptom study, for example, suggests headache, sore throat and runny nose are now the most commonly reported symptoms linked to Covid infection in the UK.\nAnd researchers, including Dr Alex Crozier, from University College London, say the situation is now very different from when the list was first published, with greater testing capacity and more knowledge about the disease.\nThey acknowledge the approach could increase the demand on testing centres and the number of people isolating.\nBut they say with careful implementation, there would be important gains - including reducing transmission at a time when new variants are emerging. \nAnd the current \"narrow\" list could miss contagious people, particularly at the start of their illness, when they are more likely have non-classical symptoms and most likely to spread the disease.\nDr Alexander Edwards, at the University of Reading, said the group raised valid points about spotting infection. \nBut he said: \"The big difficulty is in accurately finding people who are infected, without needlessly testing other people with other symptoms.  \n\"Many are very common - and the best way to judge the likelihood of someone having Covid is a combination of symptoms, their risk of exposure, plus testing.\"\nDr Edwards added: \"Unless you can effectively support infected individuals to isolate from others and thereby break the chain of infection, testing alone doesn't reduce the burden of this disease.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care official said: \"Since the start of the pandemic, we have acknowledged Covid has a much longer list of symptoms than the ones initially used in the case definition and our experts keep the list of symptoms under review.\n\"With around one in three people not showing symptoms of Covid, we have made regular, rapid testing available twice a week for free for everyone in England.\""

      "tags": "Nottingham,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government is not monitoring how many Covid cases in England are being prevented by sending pupils home from school to self-isolate.\nThis is despite the huge disruption to education caused by the policy.\nCurrently 279,000 children are at home because they have had close contact with an infected person in school.\nThe government said the policy is helping to curb the spread of the virus, but scientists said it was impossible to tell without the data.\nResearch suggests children, particularly younger ones, are less likely to transmit the virus if infected.\nBut the approach used by schools means that for every positive case, 20 other pupils on average are being asked to self-isolate for 10 days.\nMinisters have indicated they want to see the system replaced in time for the start of the new school year in the autumn.\nTrials have been carried out to see if rapid testing of close contacts can be used instead of self-isolation.\nHead teachers' leader Paul Whiteman said schools needed to be told how alternative arrangements would work, and how safety would be maintained for all members of the school community.\nProf Robert Dingwall, of Nottingham Trent University, said the lack of data on who tested positive during self-isolation meant the benefit the policy was having in return for the cost to education was unclear.\nAnd given most adults had been vaccinated, and children remained at very low risk, he said there was no reason to even introduce testing in the autumn as a replacement for automatic self-isolation.\n\"I don't see why we can't get back to normal in September and children stay at home if they are sick,\" Prof Dingwall said.\n\"There are growing levels of natural immunity building up in children anyway, and we know schools are not big drivers of transmission.\"\nDr Julian Tang, an expert in virus, at the University of Leicester, said treating Covid like flu and other respiratory viruses was perhaps the logical step as society learned to live with the virus.\n\"We don't impose any further restrictions for other viruses - we could do the same for Covid,\" he said.\nHis only concern would be for potential risk of \"long Covid\", Dr Tang added.\nA government spokeswoman said: \"We are aware that a minority of children are experiencing disruption as a result of self-isolation at the moment, which is why the health secretary and education secretary are working to get education back to normal as quickly as possible.\""

      "title": "Right to repair rules will extend lifespan of products, government says",
      "tags": "Consumer electronics,Employment,Climate change",
      "text": "Products such as washing machines, TVs and fridges should become easier to repair and cheaper to run under new rules coming into force.\nManufacturers are now legally required to make spare parts available to people buying electrical appliances.\nThe aim of the new rules is to extend the lifespan of products by up to 10 years and benefit the environment.\nHowever, one company said that the new rules could make white goods more expensive.\nThe right to repair rules are designed to tackle \"built-in obsolescence\" where manufacturers deliberately build appliances to break down after a certain period to encourage consumers to buy new ones.\nThe new rules apply to products bought from Thursday, but manufacturers have a grace period of up to two years to make spare parts available.\nMany consumers have complained that goods don't last long enough, then can't be fixed in the home.\nAdam French from consumer group Which? said that electrical items end up in landfill too often \"because they are either too costly or difficult to fix\".\nThe rules \"should ensure products last longer and help reduce electrical waste\", he said.\nOnly parts for \"simple and safe\" repairs will be available directly to consumers, including \"door hinges on your washing machine or replacement baskets and trays for your fridge-freezers\", he said.\n\"Other parts that involve more difficult repairs will only be available to professional repairers, such as the motor or heating element in your washing machine,\" he said.\nThe government has also made changes to energy efficiency standards, which it has estimated will knock an average of \u00a375 per year off energy bills, and cut carbon emissions.\n\"The tougher standards will ensure more of our electrical goods can be fixed rather than have to be thrown away when they stop working, putting more money back in the pockets of consumers,\" said energy minister Anne Marie Trevelyan.\nThese new rules should bring an end to the frustration of having to throw away an item because a small part is no longer working and no longer in stock. \nOften the seal around a fridge, the detergent drawer on a washing machine, or the runners on a dishwasher break. Rather than having to buy a whole new product, replacement parts must now be sold directly by the manufacturer for 10 years, whether or not they are still selling the complete item in their range.\nThis isn't a law about who is responsible for the repair. If it's still within warranty, then the manufacturer or the retailer should repair it, but after that, you are at least now guaranteed access to a replacement part. You'll probably have to buy it, and you may have to pay someone to fit it if it's a complicated internal part, but at least you should be able to get hold of it. \nHaving the right to repair is a step removed from having the confidence to actually attempt one, though. It's a much bigger cultural shift to convince people to fix it and not to fling it.\nEnvironmental expert Libby Peake, head of resource policy at Green Alliance, said that the new regulations \"represent a small, first step towards giving people the long-lasting repairable products they want\".\nHowever, she said it was not accurate to say the new rules create a \"legal right to repair\".\n\"The government hasn't given consumers any such right, as the spare parts and repairability criteria are only directed at professional repairers, not at the people who own products,\" she said.\n\"There is also no guarantee that spare parts and repair services will be affordable, so considerable barriers remain to making this the easiest, default option,\" she added.\nOne company said the legislation could make appliances more expensive.  John Elliot, executive chairman of Ebac, said his business had always focused on the long-term reliability of a product.\n\"We don't look to make the cheapest washing machine. We look for one that's going to do the job and last a long time,\" he said.  \nThe firm has been manufacturing dehumidifiers, water coolers and washing machines for five decades, at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham. \n\"Our focus is reliability - not just a low initial cost,\" Mr Elliot said. \"The secret of a product that's easy to repair and long-lasting is in the design.\" \nOverall, Mr Elliot said, the legislation will not make much difference to his business. But it will to competitors, who have been in a race to the bottom on prices for many white goods. \n\"I can't think of one example where we could not repair a product,\" he added. \"I checked, and the oldest machine we repaired was 25 years old.\"\nRob Johnson, operations director at repair business Pacifica, said that his firm was now hoping to recruit engineers because of the new rules.\nThe company already has 400 qualified engineers going into homes to fix about 6,000 appliances per week.\nHe said the legislation \"gives customers real choice\" about whether to repair or replace their product. \nHowever, he said that business was still brisk for quick fixes to items such as dishwasher filters, washing machine seals and broken fridge or freezer doors.\nPeople have different comfort levels when it comes to the thought of tackling home repairs on appliances, according to YouGov research for BBC News.\nMen said they felt more comfortable than women in trying to fix appliances across the board.\nMost of the appliances featured in the new legislation can be found in the kitchen. However, data suggests few feel comfortable taking advantage of the increased availability of spare parts.\nOf the kitchen appliances covered under the new rules, Britons are most comfortable repairing their washing machines (22%) including some one-in-three men (32%) and half as many women (14%). But people are less comfortable with dishwashers (16%). "

      "title": "Bill Cosby: Why is there a time limit on bringing sexual assault cases to US courts?",
      "text": "More than 50 women allege they have been sexually assaulted by the comedian Bill Cosby, but only one woman will face him in criminal court. Campaigners say laws which set deadlines on when these crimes can be reported, deny survivors justice.  \nIt started when he was just eight. A man, well known to his family, began grooming him. \nFifty years later, Kevin Sweeney is finally able to talk about the sexual abuse to which he was subjected. \n\"It quickly escalated to inappropriate touching, and eventually rape,\" explains Mr Sweeney. \nIt continued until Mr Sweeney was 13 years old.  His abuser threatened to harm his siblings and parents if he told anyone, so he stayed silent.  \nNow a school teacher, married with children, Mr Sweeney lived with his secret for decades. \nIn his early forties, after learning his abuser had died, he worked up the courage to tell his wife.\n\"It took about 8 months of therapy before I could say the word rape,\" he explains.\nBy then, it was too late to seek justice - even if his attacker had been alive, he could not have pressed charges, thanks to the statute of limitations on such crimes in his home state.\nStatutes of limitation set deadlines on when someone can file a criminal complaint.\nIn murder cases there is no time frame, but for many other crimes, the clock starts ticking after an alleged offence occurs. When it comes to allegations of rape and sexual assault, states have different laws. The window of opportunity can vary from a few years, to a few decades. In sixteen states there is no limit. \nCampaigners say this law has impeded many of those who are accusing Bill Cosby from seeking justice. Proponents say it's necessary to keep the justice system fair. \nFifty-eight women have come forward claiming Mr Cosby sexually assaulted them - allegations spanning from the 1960s to the late 2000s.  \nBut only one of these women has brought charges against Mr Cosby.\n\"For most of these accusations, it was simply too late for a prosecutor to even consider them,\" Gloria Allred, the lawyer representing more than 30 of the women, recently wrote.  \nMr Cosby is due to go on trial in June next year, accused by Andrea Constand of drugging and abusing her in Pennsylvania in January 2004. He denies the allegations and all the others.  \nMs Constand first went to the police in 2005, but prosecutors initially said there wasn't enough evidence to press charges. \nLast year the case was reopened, after new evidence emerged. Ms Constand filed her case a few days before the statute of limitations - which is 14 years in Pennsylvania - was about to expire. \nBut other women who accuse Mr Cosby of sexual assault say they feel cheated. \nLise-Lotte Lubin says she passed out after Mr Cosby gave her two alcoholic drinks and petted her hair at a hotel in Nevada in 1989.  She believes she was drugged by the comedian.\nShe tried to file a police complaint at the start of 2015, after other women came forward with stories very similar to her own. Because the four year statute of limitations in Nevada had passed, it was too late.\nTestifying before a judiciary committee in March of that year, she said, \"I now understand that the law prevents the victim in my circumstances from seeking justice.\" \nIn May 2015, a new law was passed giving survivors up to 20 years to report an alleged sexual crime. Ms Lubin, who was one of the leaders of the campaign for change, said the new law would provide survivors of sexual assault \"much needed time\" to come forward. \nIn June this year, Beth Ferrier and Heidi Thomas, who both allege Mr Cosby assaulted them in the 1980s, celebrated as politicians in Colorado doubled the statute of limitations there from 10 to 20 years. \nMr Sweeney also successfully fought to change the statute of limitations in his current home state, Ohio. \nIn June 2015, the state increased the time sexual assault survivors have to file a complaint, from 20 to 25 years. He hopes the limitation will be removed completely one day. \n\"Imagine that your wife or your daughter or your sister or mother had had this experience, and that you did everything you could as their parent or spouse to get them to a point where they were strong enough to testify but then found out you couldn't because time was up. \n\"What would you say to them then?\"\nThe fight to change statute of limitation laws across the US has been met with resistance. The Catholic Church has lobbied against proposals to change child sexual assault laws in several states.\nMany legal experts argue these laws exist to protect defendants. \nJoe Patrice, a former lawyer who edits the legal news publication Above the Law, believes there needs to be a cut-off point so a defendant isn't at the mercy of prosecution indefinitely.\nKeeping a case within a set period avoids a scenario where memories fade and it becomes one person's word against another's, he argues. Mr Patrice is also concerned that in sexual assault cases where DNA is crucial, evidence could get corrupted over time.\nBut it can take decades for DNA evidence to come back in the first place. In a number of states, including Ohio, rape kits lie untested for decades. \nAmy Roberts had to wait nine years for her rape kit to come back. \nTwo decades ago, a man broke into her college apartment and raped her at knifepoint. \n\"I thought he was going to kill me,\" she said. \"After I left, I went to the hospital and got a rape kit done, and I reported it to the police and basically that's where it stayed for a while.\"\nMs Roberts' attacker still hasn't been caught. Like Mr Sweeney, she also testified before the state Senate in Ohio.  \nAs part of the new changes introduced, victims now have an additional five years to file a case after DNA is found.\n\"Rape is such a traumatic crime. It's almost 20 years and I still feel like it's affected my core.\n\"The idea that there's an arbitrary timeline that a person can no longer be held accountable makes no sense.\"\nThe publicity the Cosby case has thrown onto these issues could bring about even more change. \nIn California, a state where some of Mr Cosby's accusers live, a bill called SB 813 was recently passed to end the statute of limitations for rape, child sex abuse, and other sex crimes. \nGovernor Jerry Brown has until the end of September to sign the bill into law. \nThe author of the bill, State Senator Connie Leyva, says the high burden of proof still stands in these cases. \n\"SB 813 simply ensures that the door does not slam in the face of victims,\" she says.\nAnd for Mr Sweeney, it's important that door always stays open. \n \"One of the dangers of statutes of limitations is that it's assuming a victim's healing process is linear and logical. But it's not.\n \"It's more like a wave pattern. I feel strong today, but tomorrow I don't.\"\nFollow Rajini on Twitter - @BBCRajiniv"

      "tags": "Princess Diana, Princess of Wales,Prince William, Duke of Cambridge",
      "text": "The Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex have united to unveil a statue of Diana, Princess of Wales, saying \"every day we wish she were still with us\". \nWilliam and Harry came together for a ceremony in Kensington Palace's redesigned Sunken Garden, on what would have been their mother's 60th birthday.\nIt was their first appearance together since the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral in April.\n\"We remember her love, strength and character,\" they said.\n\"Qualities that made her a force for good around the world, changing countless lives for the better.\"\nThey said they hoped the statue would \"be seen forever as a symbol of her life and her legacy\" and thanked \"all those around the world who keep our mother's memory alive\".\nThe pair were seen laughing and talking animatedly with guests, who applauded as they pulled off a green cloth covering the statue.\nThey remarked on changes to the Sunken Garden, which Kensington Palace said had been \"one of the princess's favourite locations\" when she lived there.\nPrince Harry has hinted at difficulties between him and Prince William since stepping back from royal duties last year.\nHe told Oprah Winfrey in March that the two were on \"different paths\".\nThen, in May, he spoke of his family's unwillingness to talk about his mother's death, and how he was expected to \"suffer\" in silence.\nHe said he had been willing to drink and take drugs to cope with the pain of losing her.\nHarry, who lives in the US with his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, and their two children, arrived in the UK last week in order to complete his quarantine ahead of Thursday's event.\nIt was a low-key event - quiet and intimate. \nThere were just a handful of guests at the unveiling of the statue - Prince William, Prince Harry, Diana's two sisters, her brother and members of the statue committee.\nWilliam and Harry walked out together into the Sunken Garden. Harry, in particular, spent time with his two aunts and uncle in animated conversation.  \nNeither of them spoke publicly at the event. There were no speeches or fanfare.\nIt was professional and friendly and gave no obvious sense of the tensions behind the scenes. There was even laughter between the brothers as they prepared to unveil the bronze statue. \nThey don't want the day to be about their own broken relationship. They want it to be about their mother and her legacy.\nDiana's siblings were among those at the ceremony at Kensington Palace, Diana's former home in London.\nThe dukes were seen warmly greeting their aunts, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, and their uncle, Earl Spencer.\nThe statue's sculptor, Ian Rank-Broadley, was also at the ceremony, along with the Sunken Garden's designer Pip Morrison.\nRuth Millington, art historian and critic: Rank-Broadley was given a very difficult task - to honour a woman who still means so much to so many. \nShe was a public figure, a campaigner and an activist, as well as what she considered her most important role: a mother.\nWithin art history, there are far too many overly romanticised representations of mothers. But there is nothing overly sentimental about this statue. While opening her arms symbolically to the three children, Diana clasps the girl's hand with strength.\nWhile using the traditional medium of bronze, Rank-Broadley has broken the mould of royal monuments. He has focused on rendering the folds of fabric to indicate movement: Diana looks like she might step down from the plinth and keep walking. It's a monument which invites engagement and embodies her openness. \nWith this poignant memorial, the artist has created a characterful depiction of Diana, which does her justice.\nRank-Broadley has managed to capture the many sides of Diana with this complex statue: she's determined and graceful, brooding and warm, commanding and compassionate.\nFar from elevating her to a high pedestal, he has represented her - as she will always be remembered - as a princess of the people.\nElizabeth Fullerton, art critic: It's an uncontroversial, accessible representation of a female icon.\nIs it good art? Well that depends on your taste.\nIt's pretty conservative, made in a naturalistic style and doesn't move the conversation forward in terms of innovation in contemporary art - but then again, that clearly wasn't the aim. This isn't the Fourth Plinth after all.\nPrincess Diana was killed in a car crash in August 1997, when William and Harry were aged just 15 and 12. \nWhen they commissioned the statue of their mother in 2017, they said they hoped it would help visitors to the palace \"reflect on her life and her legacy\".\nMore than 4,000 flowers have been planted for the Sunken Garden's redesign, which has taken 1,000 hours to complete.\nThe garden - which sits within London's Kensington Gardens, next to Hyde Park - will be open to the public to visit for free from Friday, in line with Kensington Palace's opening hours.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The PM says he is hoping England will return to as close to the pre-pandemic status quo as possible on 19 July. \nBoris Johnson said he would set out in the next few days what step four of the roadmap out of lockdown - due in just over two weeks - will look like. \nBut he added some \"extra precautions\" may still be needed and urged patience over the possibility of scrapping isolation for whole bubbles in schools. \nThe PM also said double jabs would be \"a liberator\" for foreign travel. \nOn Thursday, the UK recorded 27,989 new Covid cases, the highest daily figure reported since 29 January, and a further 22 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nDuring a visit to a new Nissan plant in Sunderland, Mr Johnson was asked whether measures such as social distancing and masks would be removed on 19 July.\n\"I know how impatient people are to get back to total normality, as indeed am I,\" he said. \n\"But I think I've said it before, we'll be wanting to go back to a world that is as close to the status quo, ante-Covid, as possible. Try to get back to life as close to it was before Covid.\n\"But there may be some things we have to do, extra precautions that we have to take, but I'll be setting them out.\" \nAsked about reports that fully-vaccinated people may be able to travel from amber-list countries without quarantining by 26 July, the prime minister told reporters: \"Everybody who is frustrated about travel over the summer - double jabs will be a liberator.\n\"I want travel to be possible but I've got to stress that this year will not be like every other year, because of the difficulties with Covid. People shouldn't expect it will be completely hassle-free.\"\nThe government has previously said it wants to scrap quarantine for fully-vaccinated travellers returning from amber-list countries \"later in the summer\". \nMost popular holiday destinations are currently on the amber list, meaning people must isolate for up to 10 days on their return to the UK. \nThe prime minister was sounding very confident about lifting restrictions on 19 July, on his visit this morning to the Nissan vehicle factory in Sunderland.\nWhat everyone wants to know is how far he'll go when it comes to masks, social distancing, school bubbles, travel.\nThe feeling around Whitehall is that it's going to be very close to a return to normal life.\nI'm hearing that an announcement laying out these details could come as soon as next week, with final confirmation giving formal go-ahead a week later.\nThere are concerns after crowds of football fans celebrated England's win against Germany in the European Championships on Tuesday.\nProf Christina Pagel, of University College London, told the BBC there was \"potential for lots of superspreader events all across Europe\" as a result of the tournament.\n\"Not just from fans travelling to actual matches, but fans travelling to the cities and then going out to the bars and celebrating, on trains, on public transport, but also at each other's houses,\" she said.\nThe UK recorded 26,068 new cases on Wednesday - the highest daily figure since 29 January. \nHowever, deaths remain low, with 14 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded on Wednesday. \nAlthough the country has seen a \"big increase in cases\", Mr Johnson said this was \"not translating into a big increase in serious illness and deaths\". \nHe said it looked \"ever clearer\" that the vaccination programme had \"broken the link between infection and mortality\". \n\"That gives us the scope, we think, on the 19th, to go ahead cautiously and irreversibly,\" he added. \nOn the possibility of replacing isolation with daily testing to prevent whole groups of pupils needing to stay at home, Mr Johnson said Public Health England (PHE) were looking at the advantages of this. \n\"I understand people's frustration when whole classes, whole bubbles, are sent home and people are asked to isolate,\" he said. \nHowever, the prime minister said PHE had not yet concluded their research, adding: \"So what I want to do is just to be cautious as we go forward to that natural firebreak of the summer holidays when the risk in schools will greatly diminish, and just ask people to be a little bit patient,\" he said. \nIf a pupil tests positive, anyone who has been in close contact with them is told to self-isolate. \nThis can result in whole classes or year groups being sent home.\nMore than 375,000 pupils in England are currently out of school because of Covid - but only 15,000 are positive cases. \nIt comes after a letter from 48 Conservative MPs urged the prime minister to end what they described as the \"disproportionate\" and \"unsustainable\" bubble system. \nThe group, including former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith and the chair of the Commons Education Committee Robert Halfon, are calling for schools to go \"back to normal\" on 19 July, when other restrictions in England are due to be lifted. \nMeanwhile, sociologist Prof Robert Dingwall, one of the scientists advising the government, said \"we have to ask very hard questions\" about what restrictions and the test-and-trace programme are achieving now the most vulnerable have been offered a vaccine. \nProfessor Dingwall, who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), told BBC Radio 4's World at One: \"We have never thought it was important to do differential diagnosis of school children with respiratory infections.\n\"If they're not well enough to go to school, they don't go to school - that's the sort of equilibrium we need to be moving towards when the school year restarts in the autumn.\""

      "text": "A fourth woman has sued Marilyn Manson claiming sexual abuse.\nModel Ashley Morgan Smithline says was subjected to rape, sexual assault, bodily harm and unlawful imprisonment, amongst other allegations.\nThe star \"repeatedly threatened\" her life, saying he would \"find her\" and \"kill her if she left him\", she said in court documents filed in Los Angeles. \nA representative for Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, said \"We strongly deny Ms Smithline's claims\".\n\"There are so many falsehoods within her claims that we wouldn't know where to begin to answer them,\" they continued. \n\"This relationship, to the limited extent it was a relationship, lasted less than a week in 2010. Manson hasn't seen Ms Smithline since then.\"\nIf you are affected by the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found on the following pages.\nThe claims outlined in Smithline's court case echo the story she told People magazine earlier this year.\nThe model said Warner first contacted her in the summer of 2010, asking for photographs and saying he wanted to cast her in a film.\nAccording to the court documents, Warner soon became \"infatuated\" with her and said she \"was the perfect girl for him\".\nIn November 2010, he flew her to Los Angeles, saying he had cast her in a remake of the Patricia Arquette movie True Romance, Smithline claims. Soon after she arrived, he asked her to move into his apartment and they began a consensual sexual relationship.\n\"However, it quickly became apparent that consensual sex was not enough for Mr Warner,\" the legal case states.\nSmithline alleges that, on one occasion, she \"awoke from unconsciousness\" to find she was being sexually assaulted.\nOn other occasions, he physically assaulted her and forced her to watch movie scenes depicting abuse and murder, the documents claim.\nSmithline, who is Jewish, also alleges she was subjected to anti-Semitic abuse - and says Warner once threw a \"Nazi knife\" at her, \"only barely missing her face\".\nAlthough she wanted to leave the relationship, Warner cut her off from her family, and \"manipulated Ms Smithline into a state of near-total isolation\", allowing him to assume \"complete control\" over her life, the case says.\nThe abuse lasted two years, she claims, leaving her with \"complex post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, and panic attacks as a result\".\n\"The scars left from Mr. Warner's knife cuts are a daily reminder of the torment Ms Smithline endured and survived,\" the documents add.\nSmithline is the fourth woman to sue the rock singer, after Game of Thrones actress Esm\u00e9 Bianco, Warner's former personal assistant Ashley Walters, and a woman who has chosen to remain anonymous. Many of their allegations are of a similar nature, including claims of sexual and physical abuse.\nIn total, more than a dozen women have come forward with allegations against the musician, including his ex-fianc\u00e9e Evan Rachel Wood.\nSince then, his record label, booking agent, and manager have severed ties with him. Planned appearances on the TV shows American Gods and Creep show have also been scrapped.\nWarner posted a statement on his Instagram account in February, denying any wrongdoing.\n\"Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality,\" he wrote.\n\"My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how - and why - others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth\".\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Severe flooding in a village during Storm Dennis was mainly caused by \"woody debris\" blocking a culvert, a report has found.\nPentre was hit by flooding five times in 2020, affecting 159 homes and 10 businesses.\nA report by Rhondda Cynon Taf council said there was a \"significant blockage by woody materials\".\nNatural Resources Wales (NRW) said not all the debris was related to its tree felling above Pentre.\nIt said it disputed the report's \"inference that its harvesting operations were the primary cause of the flooding\", adding that the felling was done properly.\nThe council said \"unprecedented rainfall\" during Storm Dennis, which hit Wales on 15 and 16 February 2020, caused river levels to rise to record highs, as the area recorded its most significant flooding since the 1970s.\nIt said \"significant impacts\" were identified by the council's flood risk management team, including stories from affected residents, and information collected by the public health team, NRW and Welsh Water.\n\"The main source of flooding in the initial flood was due to a significant blockage by woody materials... at the Pentre Road culvert inlet,\" said the report. \n\"It resulted in water flowing down Pentre Road, onto Elizabeth Street and Queen Street, and towards the lower streets of the village.\"\nColin Hughes, who has lived in Pentre since 1986, said the floods were \"horrendous\", with water reaching up to the window sill before coming through the front door.\n\"It was like a beach down here. I'd never seen anything like it and I don't want to see anything like it again either.\n\"Last year my insurance went right up, from \u00a3198 to \u00a3800-odd. And this year they refused to give us any insurance at all,\" he said.\nAnn Evans said water had entered her home very quickly and there was nothing that could be done to stop it.\n\"Before you knew it, it was above your knees,\" she said.\n\"It was devastating. I wouldn't like to see that happen ever again.\"\nShe said she wanted to see those responsible for the blocked culvert to be held to account.\nThe council report said the culvert inlet, managed by NRW, had been blocked by woody debris washed off the mountainside, including an area where NRW had been felling trees.\nThis \"severely reduced the hydraulic capacity of the inlet,\" the report said.\nA review of the inlet itself found \"irrefutable\" evidence that it would have had sufficient capacity to deal with the storm event if there was no blockage. \nAs the woody debris washed down into the culvert network, it led to repeat flooding in the lower reaches of Pentre in subsequent storms, the report found. \nMud and silt entered the highway drainage infrastructure, which \"substantially reduced its capacity\". \nAndrew Morgan, leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council, said the investigation had been robust and included \"significant engagement with residents and businesses impacted\" to identify the underlying causes of the flooding.\n\"It is evident that blockage of the culvert inlet by woody material severely impacted upon the ability of the drainage infrastructure to manage this unprecedented level of rainfall,\" he said. \nNRW said its own report found felling operations were \"not likely to have been the primary cause of the flooding\". \n\"We accept that woody material washed off the mountains above Pentre may have contributed to blockages to the culvert system, which also included a significant amount of soil and rock,\" it continued.  \n\"However, a proportion of the woody debris was unrelated to NRW's felling operations and was washed down as a natural consequence of such an extreme event. \n\"NRW therefore disagrees with the report's inference that its harvesting operations were the primary cause of the flooding during Storm Dennis.\"\nAction to reduce the risk of future flooding includes significant upgrades to the Pentre Road inlet to reduce potential blockages, with multiple overflow systems in case of another blockage.\nA permanently monitored alarm system and CCTV will remotely alert the council of any problems.\nA \"super catchpit\" at Pleasant Street, capable of containing six tonnes of debris, aims to reduce the risk of debris being carried to the lower parts of the culvert system.\nNRW's water and forest management plans will be reviewed, including the treatment of tree clippings and refuse close to an ordinary watercourse.\nIn a statement, Welsh Water said: \"We sympathise with all those affected by the flooding events which occurred during the torrential rainfall events seen in 2020 and understand the devastating impact this can have.\"\nThe company said its network \"was operating as it should have done during the storms\".\u00a0 "

      "title": "'Coercion and rape': Investigating my yoga school",
      "tags": "Sexual violence,Yoga,India,Long Reads,Canada",
      "text": "Warning: This article contains descriptions of sexual assault\nBBC journalist Ishleen Kaur was a passionate yoga teacher with Sivananda, one of the biggest yoga movements in the world, until a disturbing social media post led her to uncover multiple allegations of sexual abuse spanning decades, right up to the present day. \nSince I discovered yoga in my mid-20s, it had become a huge part of my world. Like many devoted yogis, it was not just an exercise class for me, but a way of life. I didn't just teach classes at my local Sivananda centre, I volunteered to cook and clean there too. Sivananda teachings influenced every aspect of my existence.\nBut then in December 2019, I received a notification on my phone. It was a post in my Sivananda Facebook group about the movement's late revered founder, Swami Vishnudevananda.\nA woman called Julie Salter had written that Vishnudevananda had sexually abused her for three years at the Sivananda headquarters in Canada. \nShe wrote that when she finally found the strength - decades later - to report this to the Sivananda management board, \"the reactions ranged from silence, to the attempt to silence\". \nI have now interviewed 14 women who allege abuse at the hands of senior Sivananda teachers, many of whom have not spoken about this to family and friends, let alone made it public. I have also spoken to a former staff member who says her concerns were not addressed by the Sivananda board.\nMy investigation has exposed claims of an abuse of power and influence within the organisation I once held so dear. \nI vividly remember my first day at the Sivananda ashram in Kerala, southern India, where I trained as a yoga teacher in 2014. On the wall was a magnificent photo of Swami Vishnudevananda, Sivananda's late founder, and the man Julie would go on to expose. \nHis teachings were so powerful that many yogis renounced all worldly connections and dedicated their lives to the organisation. \nI could understand why. I was going through a very challenging time and Sivananda gave me a new-found peace. The asanas - or postures - gave me physical strength; Sivananda's principles of karma, positive thinking and meditation nourished my soul. \nIn 2015 I married a man who was living in London. I felt daunted by the idea of moving to be with him there, until I discovered there was a Sivananda centre in Putney, not far from our new home. My husband would joke that the centre was my first love, not him. \nTwo months after Julie Salter's Facebook post, two Sivananda board members flew in from Europe to talk to the Putney staff. I hoped they would answer at least some of the many questions I had swirling around my head. But their response was vague, and they seemed defensive during the Q and A that followed. \nI knew I would have to speak to Julie myself.\nOriginally from New Zealand, Julie was 20 and travelling in Israel when she first came across the teachings of Sivananda. She quickly became immersed in the life of the movement, and in 1978, moved to its headquarters in Canada. \nVishnudevananda was based there and Julie was asked to become his personal assistant, something she initially regarded as a privilege. \nBut she says her schedule was brutal. She worked from 05:00 until almost midnight, seven days a week - all without pay. She says Swami Vishnudevananda became unpredictable, often shouting at her. \n\"So of course, my own boundaries were getting more and more weakened,\" she tells me.\nAnd then events took a darker turn.\nOne day when Julie was working in Vishnudevananda's house, she found him lying down listening to devotional tapes. He asked her to lie down next to him. When Julie said she didn't understand what he wanted, he told her: \"Tantra yoga\" - a yoga practice which has become associated with spiritual sex, but simply means working towards spiritual enlightenment through deep relaxation. Nevertheless, Julie says Vishnudevananda had only ever referenced it in theoretical terms, during a lecture. \n\"I said: 'I don't understand,' and despite everything in my body and mind saying, 'No', I did lay down. And then there was the sexual contact. And then after that, I was downstairs again, working, and in total shame - and everything else - anguish, self blame, guilt.\" \nJulie says she was coerced into various sexual acts, including penetrative sex, for more than three years.\nGuru is a BBC investigation by Ishleen Kaur and produced by Louise Adamou. Listen to the podcast on the World Service/BBC Sounds, on The Documentary or in Hindi\nThe guru-disciple relationship, known in yoga as the guru shishya parampara, is an unspoken agreement that the follower will surrender to the guru's wishes.\nShe now considers Vishnudevananda's actions to have been rape, as her position made her ill-equipped to consent given the \"power dynamics\" at play.\n\"I was quite isolated, I was living on the other side of the world from family, anything I knew in the past. I was financially dependent on the organisation.\"\nI then spoke to two women who had responded within minutes to Julie's Facebook post, alleging Vishnudevananda had abused them too.\nPamela told me Vishnudevananda raped her during a retreat in 1978 at Windsor Castle in London, as she was lying in a deep state of relaxation, known in yoga as corpse pose. \nLucille says he raped her three times during the mid '70s in the Canadian ashram. She says the first two times she naively justified it as tantric yoga, but the third time he gave her money and she felt \"like a prostitute\".\nVishnudevananda died in 1993 but it took Julie another six years to find the strength to leave the organisation. \nHer only hope is that, by speaking out now, she can save others from suffering in the way that she did. Because as I was to discover, Vishnudevananda may have died, but the abuse of Sivananda devotees did not die with him. Julie's Facebook post had opened a floodgate.\nI've since spoken to 11 women who have made serious allegations against two other Sivananda teachers, one of whom the BBC believes is still active in the organisation.\nAmong the shocking allegations is an account by Marie (not her real name), who says she was groomed by one teacher - who we can't name for legal reasons - over a number of years. She says she was really confused when their relationship became sexual but felt she had no choice but to go along with it. After more than a year without any sexual contact from him, she remembers one occasion when he came into her room uninvited. Silently, he got on top of her, penetrated her, ejaculated, and left without saying a word.\nFive other women have told me that this same man sexually abused them. They don't know each other but their stories all follow a similar pattern of grooming and assault. \nCatherine (not her real name), was just 12 years old, and attending a Sivananda children's camp in Canada in the '80s when she said the teacher first took a sexual interest in her. She says the man would massage her and touch her bottom. When she was 15, he began touching her more explicitly, grabbing her between her legs and touching her breasts. She says the last time he assaulted her she was 17. She was taking a nap and woke up to find him on top of her. She left the organisation that day. \nAnother complainant says she was assaulted by the same man as recently as 2019. \nWe contacted this man and offered him the opportunity to respond, but he has failed to address the allegations we have put to him. The BBC understands he is still actively involved in Sivananda in India, although the organisation denies this.\nThe other teacher accused of abuse is Maurizio Finocchi, also known as Swami Mahadevananda. I have spoken to eight women about their allegations against him. One of them, Wendy, was working as Mahadevananda's personal assistant in the Canada headquarters in 2006. \nOne of her jobs was to print out his emails and take them to his cabin. On the day in question, he called her to bring the emails and his breakfast through to his bedroom where he was sitting up in bed. As she handed him a tray, she says he grabbed her arm and flipped the sheet back, under which she realised he was masturbating. She says he then ejaculated onto her arm. \n\"And I just remember feeling that I was almost not human to him. I was really a means to an end.\"\nWendy says if women approached senior staff to report worrying - and in some cases, criminal - behaviour, the staff would cast it in the framework of a spiritual teaching called \"guru's grace\". \n\"If something was problematic or confusing - and I'm talking about even administrative things\u2026 but certainly around sexual relations and questionable relationships - you'd be told: 'No, the fact that you're having a problem is actually 'guru's grace'. \n\"As in you're being taught some kind of a valuable lesson.\"\nWe contacted Mahadevananda to offer him the opportunity to respond to the allegations, but our request went unanswered. \nThe BBC has, however, seen a copy of an email he sent to a lawyer who has been crowdfunded by a Sivananda community Facebook group, called Project Satya, which I became a member of. In the email he apologises for what he calls his \"misdeeds\", and promises to \"endeavour not to do it again\". \nAnother thing I wanted to understand was, how much of this did Sivananda's management already know?\nJulie tells me she finally found the strength to report her abuse in 2003 when she attended a meeting with a member of the Executive Members' Board (EBM) - the board created by Vishnudevananda to act as Sivananda caretakers after his death. She says that board member was Swami Mahadevananda. \n\"We were there for a while, but basically he acknowledged that he had known about it for years.\" \nSwami Mahadevananda is one of the other teachers who faces sexual abuse allegations - but at the time Julie didn't know this.\nJulie says she told four more board members about her allegation over the next few weeks.\nThe trustees deny that Julie discussed her allegations with them in 2003. However the BBC has seen an email from Mahadevananda in which he confirms he did meet Julie at that time.  He describes it as informal, but says after this meeting the allegations became \"open knowledge\".\nIn 2006, Julie attended a mediated meeting with EBM, where discussions over some kind of financial support for her took place. The abuse allegations were also raised. \nThe trustees told the BBC that both sides were pleased with the results at the time, but Julie says nothing ever materialised. So the following year Julie's solicitor wrote to the board seeking compensation and threatening a claim for damages.\nIn response, she received a letter from the EBM's solicitor questioning why Julie was raising the matter so long after the alleged abuse.\nSivananda say that after the meeting with Julie they began implementing protocols for members and guests designed to give everyone a safe environment in which to speak out about such allegations.  \nWe asked them why they continue to revere the man who sexually abused her. The \"Sivananda Organisation honours its lineage and its teachings\", was their response.\nAs for Mahadevananda, our investigation has found evidence that the board knew about his alleged sexual impropriety as early as 1999. Because he himself admitted it to them.\nSwami Saradananda, an American woman on the EBM at the time, told us that in 1998/99 she received a phone call from the director of the Delhi ashram in tears. The director told her that Mahadevananda was walking around without his trousers - which Saradananda took to mean in his underwear. \nWhen she phoned to challenge Mahadevananda, he explained that wasn't right. He wasn't in his underwear - he was naked. And that wasn't his only revelation.\n\"He told me that he hadn't worn anything below the waist, and he had come into the office where [the Delhi director] was working and masturbated in front of her.\" \nSwami Saradananda, deeply disturbed, says she raised this at the next EBM meeting. \nShe says all recording devices were switched off and the secretary sent out of the room.\nMahadevananda was present and she says he confirmed her account was true.  \n\"And he said: 'But if she doesn't want me to do it, OK, big deal. I won't do it any more.'\"\nWhen she interrupted to ask how they were going to deal with Mahadevananda's admission, one of the board replied: \"Well, he already said he's not going to do it any more. What do you want? His blood?\" \nWithin a few months, Saradananda received a fax telling her that she had been voted off the board. We put this allegation to the EBM but they did not respond.\nSaradananda's revelations might account for the lack of surprise Wendy faced in 2006 when she told a senior member of staff in the Canadian headquarters that Mahadevananda had ejaculated on her.\nHis response, she says, was: \"Damn, not again.\"\nThe staff member told her not to worry - the organisation had arranged for Swami Mahadevananda to have counselling.\n\"I wasn't aware that in Canada this would be defined as sexual assault. And I wasn't aware at that time that this could have been taken to the police,\" Wendy told me.\nThirteen years later, the EBM did eventually investigate Mahadevananda, and then announced his retirement in their monthly magazine - a retirement which they have acknowledged they are funding. The notice said the executive board thanked him for his \"devoted and inspiring service\".\nCarol Merchasin, the lawyer crowdfunded by Project Satya, says she has spoken to 25-to-30 women who have alleged sexual assault against Sivananda staff. She says she has found every one of them to be credible. \nIn the case of Catherine, she questions why the incident was not reported to the police once the Trustees became aware of the allegations. When, many years later, her parents found out and confronted them, Carol says they told them that nothing could be done without evidence.\nThe EBM has told us the teacher who is alleged to have abused Catherine and others has been suspended from duties while they investigate. But we have been told by several sources that he is still involved in Sivananda's Indian ashrams, and when I called the Kerala ashram, I was told he did in fact teach a full course there earlier this year. \nThe EBM declined to be interviewed, but sent us a statement which we set out here in full:\n\"The Board of Trustees fully sympathises with those who came forward and offers any individual who feels that they might have been affected by the conduct referred to in the [BBC investigation] its assurance that it will not tolerate abuse or disregard inappropriate behaviour. It apologises unreservedly for any historic mistakes which it made in addressing the allegations detailed in the [investigation].\n\"As a result of those allegations, Sivananda has commissioned an independent investigation, and has appointed legal experts who have helped to review and implement safeguarding policies, and put in place appropriate training. The Sivananda Organisation has established a confidential reporting facility for anyone who is concerned about abuse. It is an absolute priority for the Sivananda Organisation that anyone coming into contact with it, in whatever capacity, is safeguarded from abuse or suffering. The Sivananda Organisation is a monastic order dedicated to physical, mental, and spiritual health and is committed to the safety of all of its members.\"\nI have seen four of the investigation reports into the teacher we cannot name, all of which conclude that on the balance of probability the survivors are credible and their testimonies are truthful, and that two of them did report their abuse to the EBM. \nIn April I returned to the Putney ashram where I had spent the last five years as a teacher and devotee. But this time I did not go inside. \nIt struck me that the all-consuming nature of Sivananda that had attracted me was also what could make it so dangerous. The women I have spoken to all told me it was easy to lose a sense of reality, which made it harder to question what was going on.\nAnd I am aware that during our investigation the women who came forward were all Westerners. But it seems there are also Indian survivors - I've seen emails from women detailing what happened to them but they were too scared to speak to me. \nAs for myself, it's over for me and Sivananda. \nInvestigation produced by Louise Adamou"

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Employment,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "For the past 18 months the government has been subsidising the wages of employees hit by the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe furlough scheme was the centrepiece of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's \"unprecedented\" intervention in the economy, designed to stave off a wave of job losses as the country closed down in the face of the virus.\nIt protected the incomes of millions of people across the UK working sectors that could no longer operate, such as live music, nightclubs, the travel industry, business events, hospitality and retail businesses. \nNow that scheme is ending, requiring firms to shoulder full responsibility for those employees again or let them go.\nDuring the lifetime of the scheme about 11.6 million jobs were supported, with a steep take-up in the first few months especially.\nThat doesn't mean the government was ever paying 11 million people's wages at the same time.\nAccording to data from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), the number of people on furlough peaked at 8.9 million on 8 May last year. It then fell steadily until late 2020, when it picked up again, without ever hitting the heights of the first lockdown.\nSince then, numbers have continued to fall, although around 1.6 million were still relying on the scheme at the end of July, the last date for which figures are available from HMRC.\n\"To all those at home right now, anxious about the days ahead, I say this: you will not face this alone,\" the chancellor said, announcing the furlough scheme in March 2020.\nAlthough he has since become one of the country's best-known politicians, Mr Sunak was fairly new in his post at the time, and he had just kicked off his chancellorship with a Budget that included a jawdropping a \u00a330bn package to boost the economy and get the country through the virus outbreak.\nBut it turned out to be nowhere near enough. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, to give furlough its official title, along with other support measures, would end up incurring a far bigger bill, requiring the government to borrow much more than it would in normal times, month after month.\nUnder the scheme, the government initially paid 80% of the wages of people who could not work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of \u00a32,500.\nBut by the end of the scheme the government was contributing only 60%, with employers shouldering a 20% share themselves\nOverall it cost the government nearly \u00a370bn, but has been praised by the Resolution Foundation think-tank as a \"great success\", protecting people's living standards and preventing what many feared would be a catastrophic rise in unemployment.\nWhile workers were furloughed in every age group it was younger workers who accounted for a large proportion of those on furlough.\nYounger people were more likely to be employed in the sectors of the economy worst hit by the coronavirus lockdown measures including hospitality and retail.\nSince March 2020, more women than men have been furloughed although according to the latest figures more men remained on furlough towards the end of the scheme.\nSome sectors of the economy made more use of the furlough scheme than others.\nWith pubs and restaurants particularly badly affected by coronavirus curbs, the hospitality industry saw a high number of workers furloughed.\nAnd non-essential shops were closed at the height of the lockdown, so retailers made big claims on the government's resources. However, some large employers in that sector, notably supermarkets - who remained open during lockdowns, have since repaid the cash.\nPeople working in the arts, entertainment and other leisure activities were also more likely to find themselves on furlough than those in other walks of life.\nThe scheme was designed to keep people connected to jobs that would return after the pandemic peak passed. \nHowever over the last 18 months some of those on furlough have been made redundant, especially during the period late last year when it looked as though the furlough scheme was coming to an end.\nIn recent months, as the economy reopened and continued to grow, the number of redundancies has fallen.\nThe Resolution Foundation has described the furlough scheme overall as \"a very successful and well-implemented policy intervention\".\nBut its recent research suggested there remained a \"real risk\" to the jobs of those still on the scheme as it ends, particularly for those in parts of the travel sector, which still hasn't returned to normal operation, and for older workers.\nAnd doubts have been voiced in other quarters over some aspects of the scheme.\nIt has drawn fire from the Commons Public Accounts Committee, which wants all firms benefiting from the scheme to be named publicly in the interests of transparency.\nThe committee has spoken dismissively of \"hastily drawn up economic support schemes\" that provided \"unacceptable room for fraud against taxpayers\".\nHMRC, which administered the furlough scheme, has suggested that up to 10% of the money delivered by the scheme to mid-August 2020 - \u00a33.5bn - may have been paid out in fraud or error.\nApart from that, there is the question of whether it has delayed the process of people making the shift from jobs that are no longer viable to take up new opportunities.\nThe number of vacancies fell sharply during the early stages of the pandemic, but job vacancies are now considerably up on last year with staff shortages affecting several sectors.\nSome have blamed furlough for keeping workers out of action during the last few months, waiting to see if their old jobs will still be there for them, when some firms have been desperately trying to recruit new workers. \nAre you coming to the end of your furlough?

      "text": "A man has apologised after footage emerged showing England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, being accosted in a park. \nLewis Hughes, from Romford, told the Sun he was sorry for \"any upset I caused\".\nThe video shows two men laughing and jeering as they grab hold of Prof Whitty, who struggles to free himself.\nThe Met Police are investigating the footage, which the force said happened in St James's Park in London on Sunday.\nMr Hughes, a 24-year-old estate agent, told the newspaper he had lost his job following the incident.\n\"If I made [Prof Whitty] feel uncomfortable, which it does look like I did, then I am sorry to him for that,\" he said.\nHis friend Jonathan Chew, 24, said: \"We just wanted a selfie.\"\nMr Chew told the Sun he had ADHD and autism, adding: \"Sometimes things seem a good idea and really they're not.\"\nMr Hughes said the pair had been on an anti-vax march in London when they spotted Prof Whitty. \nPolice said when officers spoke to Prof Whitty, he had not suffered any injuries and told them at the time that he did not wish to make any allegations. \nThey added that the incident had been recorded as a common assault and continued to be investigated.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson and several other MPs condemned the incident.\nIn its latest statement on Tuesday evening, the Met said: \"We are aware of a video being shared online showing an incident that took place in St James's Park at around 19:20 on the evening of Sunday, 27 June.\n\"Officers were in the vicinity policing a nearby demonstration and intervened when they saw what was happening.\n\"They spoke to the victim and checked his welfare. He had not suffered any injuries and informed officers that at that time he did not wish to make any allegations. He then went on his way.\n\"Officers continued to speak to the two men and recorded their details. They were robustly warned about their behaviour and ordered to leave the area.\"\nIt was not the first time Prof Whitty has been filmed being confronted by a member of the public.\nEarlier this month, a man in Oxford accused him of lying to the public about coronavirus, while in February a man accosted the chief medical officer outside Westminster.\nAnd a group of people gathered outside what was apparently Prof Whitty's London flat on Saturday, chanting and shouting.\nSince the start of the coronavirus crisis, he has been front and centre of the UK's decision-making and communication of messages to the public.\nHe took on the chief medical officer role in October 2019, and until the coronavirus threat emerged, had never done broadcast interviews or held press briefings or conferences.\nOne of the country's foremost experts in infectious diseases, he has worked as a doctor in Africa and Asia, as well as the UK.\nHe continues to practise medicine at University College London Hospitals, where he was spotted doing a shift over Christmas.\nHis mother was a teacher and his father was a diplomat who was murdered by terrorists in Greece after they flagged him down in his car in 1984."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The PM says he is hoping England will return to as close to the pre-pandemic status quo as possible on 19 July. \nBoris Johnson said he would set out in the next few days what step four of the roadmap out of lockdown - due in just over two weeks - will look like. \nBut he added some \"extra precautions\" may still be needed and urged patience over the possibility of scrapping isolation for whole bubbles in schools. \nThe PM also said double jabs would be \"a liberator\" for foreign travel. \nOn Thursday, the UK recorded 27,989 new Covid cases, the highest daily figure reported since 29 January, and a further 22 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nDuring a visit to a new Nissan plant in Sunderland, Mr Johnson was asked whether measures such as social distancing and masks would be removed on 19 July.\n\"I know how impatient people are to get back to total normality, as indeed am I,\" he said. \n\"But I think I've said it before, we'll be wanting to go back to a world that is as close to the status quo, ante-Covid, as possible. Try to get back to life as close to it was before Covid.\n\"But there may be some things we have to do, extra precautions that we have to take, but I'll be setting them out.\" \nAsked about reports that fully-vaccinated people may be able to travel from amber-list countries without quarantining by 26 July, the prime minister told reporters: \"Everybody who is frustrated about travel over the summer - double jabs will be a liberator.\n\"I want travel to be possible but I've got to stress that this year will not be like every other year, because of the difficulties with Covid. People shouldn't expect it will be completely hassle-free.\"\nThe government has previously said it wants to scrap quarantine for fully-vaccinated travellers returning from amber-list countries \"later in the summer\". \nMost popular holiday destinations are currently on the amber list, meaning people must isolate for up to 10 days on their return to the UK. \nThe prime minister was sounding very confident about lifting restrictions on 19 July, on his visit this morning to the Nissan vehicle factory in Sunderland.\nWhat everyone wants to know is how far he'll go when it comes to masks, social distancing, school bubbles, travel.\nThe feeling around Whitehall is that it's going to be very close to a return to normal life.\nI'm hearing that an announcement laying out these details could come as soon as next week, with final confirmation giving formal go-ahead a week later.\nThere are concerns after crowds of football fans celebrated England's win against Germany in the European Championships on Tuesday.\nProf Christina Pagel, of University College London, told the BBC there was \"potential for lots of superspreader events all across Europe\" as a result of the tournament.\n\"Not just from fans travelling to actual matches, but fans travelling to the cities and then going out to the bars and celebrating, on trains, on public transport, but also at each other's houses,\" she said.\nThe UK recorded 26,068 new cases on Wednesday - the highest daily figure since 29 January. \nHowever, deaths remain low, with 14 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded on Wednesday. \nAlthough the country has seen a \"big increase in cases\", Mr Johnson said this was \"not translating into a big increase in serious illness and deaths\". \nHe said it looked \"ever clearer\" that the vaccination programme had \"broken the link between infection and mortality\". \n\"That gives us the scope, we think, on the 19th, to go ahead cautiously and irreversibly,\" he added. \nOn the possibility of replacing isolation with daily testing to prevent whole groups of pupils needing to stay at home, Mr Johnson said Public Health England (PHE) were looking at the advantages of this. \n\"I understand people's frustration when whole classes, whole bubbles, are sent home and people are asked to isolate,\" he said. \nHowever, the prime minister said PHE had not yet concluded their research, adding: \"So what I want to do is just to be cautious as we go forward to that natural firebreak of the summer holidays when the risk in schools will greatly diminish, and just ask people to be a little bit patient,\" he said. \nIf a pupil tests positive, anyone who has been in close contact with them is told to self-isolate. \nThis can result in whole classes or year groups being sent home.\nMore than 375,000 pupils in England are currently out of school because of Covid - but only 15,000 are positive cases. \nIt comes after a letter from 48 Conservative MPs urged the prime minister to end what they described as the \"disproportionate\" and \"unsustainable\" bubble system. \nThe group, including former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith and the chair of the Commons Education Committee Robert Halfon, are calling for schools to go \"back to normal\" on 19 July, when other restrictions in England are due to be lifted. \nMeanwhile, sociologist Prof Robert Dingwall, one of the scientists advising the government, said \"we have to ask very hard questions\" about what restrictions and the test-and-trace programme are achieving now the most vulnerable have been offered a vaccine. \nProfessor Dingwall, who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), told BBC Radio 4's World at One: \"We have never thought it was important to do differential diagnosis of school children with respiratory infections.\n\"If they're not well enough to go to school, they don't go to school - that's the sort of equilibrium we need to be moving towards when the school year restarts in the autumn.\""

      "title": "Bill Cosby: The rise, fall and release of 'America's Dad'",
      "tags": "Bill Cosby sexual assault case",
      "text": "Bill Cosby was once known to millions as \"America's Dad\", but the comedian had his reputation shattered when he was sentenced to three to 10 years in jail after being convicted of sexual assault.\nThat judgement has now been overturned, and the 83-year-old has walked free from prison after serving two years of the sentence.\nHis role as the benevolent, jumper-wearing Dr Cliff Huxtable in 1980s hit sitcom The Cosby Show made him a national treasure in the US.\nBut more than a dozen women accused Mr Cosby of misconduct, and one case made it to court.\nAlthough a jury failed to reach a verdict in June 2017, a retrial originally led to a conviction less than a year later. But in June 2021, Pennsylvania's highest court ruled he had been denied a fair trial, quashing the guilty verdict.\nHow did this man, a household name for so long in America, rise and fall so far?\nBorn in 1937 in a social housing complex in Philadelphia, the young William Henry Cosby Jr shone shoes and worked at a local supermarket to help his family make ends meet. \nHis early life was touched by tragedy when one of his four brothers died and he, the oldest, became a father figure.\nAccounts of his school years portray a joker and a storyteller who loved to entertain classmates. After school he joined the US Navy, then went to university and worked part-time as a bartender.\nFilling in for a club comedian, he laid the path for his future fame. \nHis debut on NBC's Tonight Show in 1963 led to a recording contract with Warner Brothers, and the release of a series of award-winning comedy albums.\nOn one of those, 1968's To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With, he established the themes that would define his work - the father as a loving disciplinarian; siblings who could plot together one minute, then scream blue murder the next; and a confidence in the bonds of family.\nThe album sleeve noted: \"During his time on stage, Cosby never once told a joke. He didn't sing or dance or do tricks. All he did was talk\" - but the performer had the 10,000-strong audience in the palm of his hand throughout.\nBy the time the album was released, Mr Cosby was already a TV star.\nIn 1965, he had become the first black actor to star in a drama series, when he was cast in the espionage show I Spy.\nHe played Alexander Scott, an undercover agent posing as a tennis instructor, alongside Robert Culp, who played fellow agent Kelly Robinson. \nPremiering during a time of great upheaval for race relations in the US, it was banned by some stations in the southern states. But Cosby went on to earn three consecutive best actor Emmys for his role - a record that still stands.\nDespite his prominence on TV, Mr Cosby made a conscious decision not to directly address race relations in his act - preferring a more subtle challenge to the status quo. \n\"A white person listens to my act, and he laughs, and he thinks: 'Yeah, that's the way I see it, too,'\" he once said. \n\"OK. He's white. I'm Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that we are alike. Right? \"So I figure this way, I'm doing as much for good race relations as the next guy.\"\nThe Cosby Show, which was launched by NBC in 1984 and aired for eight seasons, was his biggest success and established him as a household name.\nBased on his stand-up routines, Mr Cosby's portrayal of an educated, affluent doctor - Heathcliff \"Cliff\" Huxtable - and the trials of raising five young children drew parallels with his own life.\nHis TV wife, Claire, was loosely based on his own wife Camille, whom he married in 1964.\nThe sitcom was watched by about 30 million viewers each week. By 1989, its star was earning $4m (\u00a32.5m) a month in syndication rights alone.\nWhen the show was cancelled in 1992, Mr Cosby embarked on a number of projects including film roles, but was never able to emulate the success of his star vehicle.\nIn 2013, he received rave reviews for his first TV stand-up show in 30 years, which led to a national tour.\nBut his comeback fell apart as several women came forward with allegations of sexual assault going back almost 30 years.\nThe accusations first surfaced in 2005, when Andrea Constand, a staff member at Cosby's former university, said she had been drugged and molested by the star at his home a year earlier.\nProsecutors declined to press charges, citing lack of evidence, but Ms Constand filed a civil case against the comedian. \nThirteen women, 12 of whom remained anonymous, agreed to be witnesses, each with a similar account of sexual assault.\nMr Cosby denied the accusations, which his lawyer called \"preposterous\", and the case was settled out of court in 2006 for an undisclosed sum.\nIn subsequent years, some of Ms Constand's fellow witnesses told their stories to the media. But the accusations were not comprehensively reported until Mr Cosby's planned TV comeback thrust him back into the limelight.\nMore than 50 women accused the star of sexual assault or rape, but due to time limits on cases, only one - Andrea Constand - took the case to criminal court. \nMr Cosby's lawyers consistently denied the charges, asking why the women had not made legal complaints at the time when they said they were assaulted. \nIn 2014 Mr Cosby said he had not addressed the allegations in public because \"a guy doesn't have to answer to innuendos\".\nBut shortly afterwards, previously unseen court papers from 2005 came to light and showed he had admitted obtaining sedatives to give to young women he wanted to have sex with. The sedatives, called Quaaludes, render people unable to move.\nThe accusations disrupted his hopes of a return to show business. Cable station TV Land pulled repeats of The Cosby Show, some of his stand-up shows were called off and protesters showed up to the ones that he still put on.\nHis statue was removed from the MGM Hollywood Studios park in Florida, and several colleges removed honorary degrees they had given him.\nHis portraits were taken down from the walls in his alma mater, Temple University in Philadelphia, and he resigned from the board of trustees.\nAt first, it appeared unlikely that any criminal action would be taken against Mr Cosby, partly because most US states have of statutes of limitation in cases of rape and sexual assault.\nHowever, one case came to criminal trial - that of Andrea Constand.\nThe case was seen as one of the biggest US celebrity court case since the murder trial of former American football player OJ Simpson in 1995.\nIn June 2017, Ms Constand told her story in court for the first time, having previously been barred from doing so due to the 2006 settlement.\nShe said Mr Cosby had given her pills that he claimed were herbal and said would \"take the edge off\", but which left her virtually paralysed.\n\"In my head, I was trying to get my hands to move or my legs to move, but I was frozen\", she said. About 20 minutes later, she said, he put his hand on her genitals.\n\"I wasn't able to fight it in any way,\" she told the court. \"I wanted it to stop.\"\nMr Cosby continued to deny the allegations. He did not give evidence in court but had one witness. In the end, with Mr Cosby possibly facing the rest of his life in prison if found guilty, the jury was deadlocked, and a mistrial was declared in June 2017.\nThe retrial, which began on 9 April 2018, took place in a changed atmosphere. \nA flood of sexual misconduct accusations against powerful men in the entertainment industry such as Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey had triggered the #MeToo movement.\nThe trial in Pennsylvania became one of the first celebrity cases of the #MeToo era. The decision by the judge to allow five more women to testify against him was seen as a key development.\nOn this occasion, the jury took two days to find the comedian guilty on all three counts of sexual assault. Months later, he was sentenced to a total of three to 10 years in prison.\nAfter serving two years of the jail sentence, in June Pennsylvania's highest court overturned his conviction for sexual assault. Hours later, Mr Cosby was driven away from the prison.\nThe court found that Mr Cosby had been denied due process and should not have been put on trial because he had reached an agreement with the previous prosecutor in 2005 that he would not be charged.\n\"He must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be barred\", it wrote in a 79-page ruling.\nBut despite the outcome, some legal analysts said Mr Cosby would not be able to go back to the life he knew before. His reputation would be \"forever tarnished\", said defence lawyer Rikki Klieman of CBS News.\n\"He does not go back to being America's Dad, everything that he lost in terms of the trappings of his life - his reputation, his TV jobs, his night club jobs, his being a spokesperson - all of that is gone.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

      "text": "Becky Salisbury and her husband David were in the car on Sunday when they got the news: one of the staff at their pub, the Alford Arms in Berkhamsted, had tested positive for Covid.\nSo, after a rollercoaster year, overhauling how they work and installing every hygiene measure they could think of, the pub is now closed again, for 10 days.\n\"It's frustrating,\" says Becky. \"Having made some profit recently with nice weather and a good garden, unfortunately it's all going to go down the pan.\"\nBecky and David are far from the only ones in this situation. Pubs and restaurants across the country are finding operating day-to-day a minefield. \nIt only takes one case on site, and the NHS Test and Trace alerts come thick and fast, instructing staff to isolate. Without them, venues can't open.\nIt isn't sustainable, the industry says, especially as cases continue to rise so rapidly.\nThe government says self-isolation remains an essential part of the effort to control the spread of the virus.\nIan Payne, chairman of the nationwide Stonegate group of pubs, wrote on social media that the chain has around 1,000 people off, because they had been alerted by NHS Test and Trace, and 15 sites closed, because the management team were self-isolating.\nThe Wetherspoon pub chain said six members of its staff had tested positive, leading to 69 further employees being required to self-isolate.\nNick Collins, chief executive of the chain Loungers, which operates 173 cafe-bars, has also had to temporarily close some sites, and reallocate staff between venues.\n\"It's really challenging,\" he said, but he now fears that it \"could get worse\" as rates of the virus continue to rise.\nAs a result, the body representing pubs and restaurants, UKHospitality, is calling on the government to reconsider the rules on isolation.\n\"For some weeks, we have been telling government about the severe staff shortages at venues,\" said UKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. \nShe said some team members were being told to isolate even if they hadn't shared shifts with colleagues who tested positive.\nUKHospitality would like to see a testing system that monitors whether staff are still negative for the virus, but allows them to continue working.\n\"If the system remains as it is, there's a threat of mass isolations, which would hugely damage trade, putting many companies at risk of failure,\" said Ms Nicholls.\n\"A strong focus on testing when cases are identified, rather than isolating fit and healthy people, would help to avoid mass isolations,\" she said.\nThe government is running a pilot scheme to see whether allowing people who have been exposed to the virus to take daily tests instead of isolating is effective at controlling its spread.\nThe government would continue to support the hospitality industry, but self-isolation was currently an essential part of the strategy for protecting the public, a government spokesperson said.\n\"By self-isolating, people are helping to break the chains of transmission while protecting friends and family from the virus and minimising the risk of further disruption in schools,\" the spokesperson said.\nWithout a change to the rules, pubs such as Becky and David's, which cannot switch staff between multiple sites, fear they could end up yo-yoing between being open and closed all summer.\n\"I think the risk to all hospitality of having more than one closure this summer is really high,\" says Becky. \n\"We've done everything we can and we are still utterly vulnerable.\"\n\"We have a machine that cleans the air. The staff wear hand cream that gives them four hours of protection. We clean religiously. But there's no way I can protect the staff from being pinged,\" she says.\nShe has gently asked her team to be as careful as they can outside work, but they are mostly young and she says she can't ask them not to see their friends. Yet she knows that is the age group where levels of the virus are highest.\n\"We're reopening on Tuesday and we're really excited. But there's every chance someone could be in contact on Wednesday and we'd have to close again. It could happen,\" she says."

      "tags": "Climate change,Severe weather,Canada",
      "text": "Hundreds of sudden deaths, many of them suspected of being heat-related, have been reported during Canada's record-breaking heatwave, officials say.\nSome 486 fatalities were recorded over the past five days in British Columbia alone, a 195% increase on the usual amount over that period.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau offered condolences to families of the victims, many of whom were elderly.\nAbnormally high temperatures have been recorded across North America.\nBritish Columbia Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe said on Wednesday: \"It is believed likely that the significant increase in deaths reported is attributable to the extreme weather BC has experienced and continues to impact many parts of our province.\"\nShe said many of those who died in the heatwave had lived alone in homes that were not ventilated. \nMs Lapointe added that the western province had only seen three heat-related deaths over the past three to five years. \nOn Wednesday evening, the town of Lytton, British Columbia, was evacuated because of a wildfire - a day after it recorded Canada's highest ever temperature of 49.6C (121.3F).\nMayor Jan Polderman told CBC News: \"The whole town is on fire. It took like a whole 15 minutes from the first sign of smoke to all of a sudden there being fire everywhere.\"\nThe heat over western parts of Canada and the US has been caused by a dome of static high-pressure hot air stretching from California to the Arctic territories. Temperatures have been easing in coastal areas but there is not much respite for inland regions.\nThe weather system is now moving eastwards over the Prairie provinces - Alberta and Saskatchewan and parts of Manitoba have been placed under Environment Canada heat warnings.\nJanice Houldsworth, who lives in the British Columbia community of Castlegar, told the BBC she had not ventured outdoors for four days. \"I've never experienced anything like this in all my 70 years,\" she said.\n\"We have blackened out all the windows, have fans running 24/7 constantly spraying with mist, cold foot baths, and showers and [are] drinking tons of liquid.\"\nIn Vancouver alone, heat is believed to have been a contributing factor in the deaths of 65 people since Friday. \nAt an affordable housing event in Kanata, Ontario, Mr Trudeau described heatwaves as a growing problem, and went on to talk about climate change.\nCanada's southern neighbour, the United States, has also seen extreme heat. \nIn the US Pacific Northwest on Monday, temperatures hit 46.6C (116F) in Portland, Oregon, and 42.2C (108F) in Seattle, Washington, the highest levels since record-keeping began in the 1940s, the National Weather Service said.\nIn Oregon, authorities say at least 63 people have died from health issues related to the hot weather over the past few days. Forty-five of those deaths were recorded in Multnomah County.\nAt least 16 people have died in Washington state's King and Snohomish counties.\nUS President Joe Biden has also linked the heatwave to climate change in a speech. \nI've heard from scientists who say that in just a few days they'll be able to determine just how much human driven warming has contributed to the searing temperatures seen in British Columbia.\nOne interesting piece of evidence is the lack of respite that night brings - recent temperatures at midnight in BC have been 2C warmer than the normal summer daytime figure.\nResearchers say this combination of day and night-time heat is very dangerous for humans - a study published last year indicated that these compound events are closely linked to emissions of greenhouse gases.\nNatural variability and local factors such as sea breezes can raise or limit the impacts of extreme heat.  But the bigger picture is the rising thermometer of global heating is impacting all events.\n\"Every heatwave occurring today is made more likely and more intense by human-induced climate change,\" Dr Friederike Otto from the University of Oxford told the BBC.\n\"Climate change is definitely one of the drivers of the intensity of this Canadian heatwave - but it is not the only one and determining how much it impacts it, is a work in progress.\" \nEven if they can't directly attribute this heatwave to climate change, experts say the fingerprints of global heating are all over it. \nBoth Mr Trudeau and Mr Biden have warned of an increased chances of wildfires in the heatwave. \nOn Wednesday Mr Biden met with governors of western US states and fire officials, as the annual North American wildfire season began.\nJodi Hughes, weather presenter at Global News Calgary, told the BBC that firefighters were extremely concerned at the possibility of wild fires, possibly sparked by thunderstorms that could occur as the weather pattern changes.\nMany homes in British Columbia do not have air conditioning as temperatures are usually far milder during the summer months.\nOne Vancouver resident told AFP news agency that hotels seemed to be sold out, as people flocked there for air conditioning, adding: \"I've never seen anything like this. I hope it never becomes like this ever again.\"\nOfficials in British Columbia have warned residents against leaving their doors open, after a spate of bears wandering into people's home.\nIn Vancouver, residents have reported car windows cracking and melting, even when they are not parked in the sun.\nHave you been affected by the high temperatures?

      "text": "The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September.\nThe government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of \u00a32,500.\nAt first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%.\nThe most recent figures show 1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July - the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier.\nNearly one million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation.\nThe numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough.\nSome employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends.\nInternational travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs.\nMany forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. \nIf you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. \nThe selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay.\nIf you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: \nYou might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. \nThe amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. \nYou may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs. \nThere is lots of free benefits guidance and advice available, including: \nThe government says 11.6 million jobs have been supported by the scheme.\nFrom March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about \u00a366bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. \nThat's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid.\nHowever, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs. \nAt the start of the pandemic it was feared that more than one in 10 workers would become unemployed.\nInstead the unemployment rate is currently less than one in 20.

However, linking any single event to global warming is complicated.\nLytton this week recorded the country's highest ever temperature of 49.6C (121.3F).\nAnd abnormally high temperatures have been recorded in swathes of North America.\nBritish Columbia, in western Canada, recorded 486 deaths over five days compared with an average of 165 in normal times. \nChief Coroner Lisa Lapointe blamed the extreme weather.

Hot, dry and windy conditions in the area could mean the fire was moving at 10 or even 20km/h.\nIn a social media post on Thursday, MP Brad Vis said he would not be attending Canada Day activities because he was devoting all his time to the emergency situation.\n\"There are reports of several injuries. The situation is ongoing,\" he wrote. \nResidents were being directed to nearby communities where reception centres were being set up, while the British Columbia Wildfire Service was diverting crews and equipment from other areas to respond to the fire.\nJean McKay, who left the First Nations community of Kanaka Bar, about 15km from Lytton, with her 22-year-old daughter Deirdre, told CBC how hard emotionally it had been to leave their home.\n\"I cried. My daughter cried. She said, 'I don't even know why I grabbed my key. We might not even have a home.' I said, 'Yeah I know. As long as we're together we'll survive.' I just pray that our houses are OK.\"\n\"You can't even comprehend it,\" Lytton evacuee Edith Loring-Kuhanga told CBC Radio. \"Our entire town is gone.\"\nBefore the fire, Lytton had recorded the highest temperature ever seen in Canada on three consecutive days.\nIn Vancouver, British Columbia's biggest city, heat is believed to have been a contributing factor in the deaths of 65 people since Friday. \nThe city has opened 25 air-conditioned cooling centres where people have been resting or working from their laptops.\n\"I have no air conditioning, only a fan at home - I came here just to work where it's cool,\" one woman, who gave her name only as Lou, told AFP news agency. \nIn the US state of Oregon, health officials tied more than 60 deaths to the extreme heat while in Washington state, 20 deaths were attributed to the weather, the Associated Press reports. \nSeattle, Portland and other cities broke all-time heat records, which climbed above 46C in places.\nBoth Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US President Joe Biden warned of the threat of wildfires, with Mr Biden telling governors of western US states it was as \"severe as it's ever been\".\nI've heard from scientists who say that in just a few days they'll be able to determine just how much human driven warming has contributed to the searing temperatures seen in British Columbia.\nOne interesting piece of evidence is the lack of respite that night brings - recent temperatures at midnight in BC have been 2C warmer than the normal summer daytime figure.\nResearchers say this combination of day and night-time heat is very dangerous for humans - a study published last year indicated that these compound events are closely linked to emissions of greenhouse gases.\nNatural variability and local factors such as sea breezes can raise or limit the impacts of extreme heat.  But the bigger picture is the rising thermometer of global heating is impacting all events.\n\"Every heatwave occurring today is made more likely and more intense by human-induced climate change,\" Dr Friederike Otto from the University of Oxford told the BBC.\n\"Climate change is definitely one of the drivers of the intensity of this Canadian heatwave - but it is not the only one and determining how much it impacts it, is a work in progress.\" \nEven if they can't directly attribute this heatwave to climate change, experts say the fingerprints of global heating are all over it. \nHave you been affected by the high temperatures?

      "text": "A hospital has apologised and pledged to review visiting restrictions after it prevented parents from seeing their dying son in his final weeks.\nOllie Bibby, of South Benfleet, Essex, died of leukaemia at University College London Hospital (UCLH) on 5 May.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer highlighted the case in the House of Commons on Wednesday.\nMr Bibby's mother Penny said: \"All we want from this is for policies to be reviewed. This has to stop.\"\nMrs Bibby said the letter from Tim Jaggard, acting chief executive of UCLH, was a \"pleasant surprise\" and she hoped it would help other people be with their loved ones in hospital.\n\"This is the outcome we wanted. We just don't want any other families to go through this. We feel like Ollie would be proud of us for taking a stand on this,\" she said.\nShe said Mr Jaggard wrote that the hospital was trying \"to get the balance right between keeping patients safe and compassion\" and was \"sorry\" if it failed at this.\nHe added: \"I would like to assure you we are reviewing how we implement the national guidance.\"\nMrs Bibby said it was not fair that visiting rules were \"like a lottery\", with each hospital interpreting national government guidance differently.\nHer 27-year-old son died the day before Matt Hancock was filmed kissing a colleague, prompting his resignation as health secretary.\nMrs Bibby subsequently said she was \"livid\" he broke social distancing rules, as she was prevented from being with her son. \nWhile he was dying in hospital, her son felt like he was \"in prison\", she said, and begged to see his family, but they were \"treated like criminals\" and \"barely allowed in\" due to Covid restrictions.\nSir Keir raised the case in the first Prime Minister's Questions since Mr Hancock resigned.\nHowever, Mrs Bibby said she felt Boris Johnson \"dismissed\" his question and avoided answering it.\nIn a statement, a UCLH spokesperson said the hospital had always followed national visiting guidelines to protect patients, many of whom were extremely vulnerable, from Covid-19. \n\"We know safety needs to be balanced with compassion for patients' individual circumstances so our staff do have some scope for discretion around visiting,\" they said.\nAdditional visiting arrangements had been put in place for Mr Bibby's family, they added.\n\"It has been a challenge to strike this balance during the pandemic but we believe our staff have always tried their best in very difficult circumstances and we are always looking at how we can improve further. \n\"We are reviewing how we implement national visiting guidance during the pandemic and listening to what our patients and their families tell us about the impact it has on their care.\n\"We are in contact with Oliver's family to learn from their experiences and our deepest sympathies go to his parents, brothers and wider family and friends at this very difficult time.\"\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Britney Spears,Music",
      "text": "A US judge has denied Britney Spears's request to remove her father from his role overseeing her conservatorship.\nThe pop star's lawyer asked an LA court to end Jamie Spears control of her estate, in November last year.\nThey said the star was \"afraid of her father\" and wanted him removed as her sole conservator -  a role he has carried out since 2008.\nAlthough the request has been denied, the ruling is not a response to Spears' explosive testimony in court last week. \nSpeaking for 23 minutes, the star said she had been drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from having children.\n\"I just want my life back,\" she said, via phone, as she asked the court to end her conservatorship.\nHowever, the judge cannot make a ruling based on her statement until she files a formal petition to terminate the arrangement.\nThe documents filed on Wednesday refer only to the November request, in which Spears asked for the private wealth management firm the Bessemer Trust to be appointed as her \"sole conservator\".\nAlthough Judge Brenda Penny refused to remove Jamie Spears from his position, she did agree to the Bessemer Trust's role as co-conservator of the star's multi-million dollar estate.\nIn a separate development, Jamie Spears' lawyers have asked the court to investigate the star's claims of abuse.\nThe LA court system has also ended a scheme allowing members of the press to listen to court proceedings remotely, after audio of Spears testimony was recorded and leaked online.\nThe move comes a week after the Baby One More Time singer delivered a blistering attack on the \"abusive\" conservatorship that has controlled her life for 13 years.\nShe told a judge she was traumatised and cried every day, adding: \"I deserve to have a life.\"\nThe star also said she had been denied the right to have more children and was put on the psychiatric drug lithium against her wishes.\nSpears, a mother of two, said she wanted to marry her boyfriend and have another baby, but the conservatorship would not allow her to. She claimed she was prevented from having a contraceptive intrauterine device (IUD) removed so she could get pregnant.\nDozens of fans gathered outside court, holding signs that read \"Free Britney now!\" and \"Get out of Britney's life!\"\nThe star later apologised to them for \"pretending like I've been OK\", but pride and embarrassment had prevented her from admitting the truth.\nMr Spears' lawyers have denied he was responsible for the restrictions apparently placed on his daughter's private life.\nWhile the 68-year-old has overseen her estate for 13 years, he has not actually been in charge of her personal affairs since September 2019, when he stepped down from that role due to ill health.\nHe was replaced on a temporary basis by Jodi Montgomery, the singer's care-giver.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Spears' lawyers requested an inquiry into his daughter's testimony.\n\"Either the allegations will be shown to be true, in which case corrective action must be taken, or they will be shown to be false, in which case the conservatorship can continue its course,\" they wrote in a court filing. \n\"It is not acceptable for Conservators or the Court to do nothing in response to Ms Spears' testimony.\"\nMr Spears's lawyers said he had no intention of returning as his daughter's personal conservator, but said he was \"concerned \" about her well-being.\nThey added: \"Mr Spears is unable to hear and address his daughter's concerns directly because he has been cut off from communicating with her\".\nDozens of stars have voiced concern for the singer, including her former boyfriend Justin Timberlake.\n\"Regardless of our past, good and bad, and no matter how long ago it was\u2026 what's happening to her is just not right,\" he wrote in a statement. \"No woman should ever be restricted from making decisions about her own body.\"\nSoul icon Dionne Warwick  also spoke out, comparing Spears' situation to \"13 years of bondage\".\n\"Give her back her rights. Give her back her life. Set her free,\" Warwick said in a two-and-a-half minute video message. \"Britney, I feel your pain baby. And I totally agree. Enough. It is enough.\"\nRapper Iggy Azalea, who collaborated with Spears on the single Pretty Girls, said on social media she had \"personally witnessed the same behaviour\" the star described in her court appearance.\nAzalea claimed that Spears was prevented from drinking soda while backstage at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards; and that Jamie Spears made her sign a non-disclosure agreement before taking to the stage with his daughter.\n\"Her father conveniently waited until literally moments before our BMAs performance when I was backstage in the dressing room and told me if I did not sign an NDA he would not allow me on stage... \n\"Britney Spears should not be forced to co-exist with that man when she's made it clear it is negatively impacting her mental health.\"\nA representative for Jamie Spears has been contacted for a response.\nLast week, Britney Spears' sister Jamie Lynn spoke publicly for the first time about the star's controversial conservatorship.\n\"I'm so proud of her for using her voice,\" Jamie Lynn Spears said in an Instagram story.\n\"If ending the conservatorship... or whatever the hell else she wants to do to be happy - I support that.\"\nShe added: \"I am so proud of her for requesting new counsel like I told her to do many years ago.\n\"I'm not my family, I'm my own person. I'm speaking for myself.\"\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "tags": "Shielding,Public health,China,Social distancing,Self-isolation,United States,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 350 million confirmed cases and more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. \nThe US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. \nVery few places have been left untouched. \nThe latest available data for the total number of cases in France since the start of the pandemic is from 16 January. \nIn the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands."

      "text": "The NHS has been given the green light to start planning a Covid vaccine booster programme in the UK ahead of this winter.\nA bigger flu season than normal is expected, meaning extra protection against Covid is likely to be needed.\nMore than 30 million of the most vulnerable should receive a third dose, vaccine experts are advising.\nThey will include all adults aged 50 and over, and anyone over 16 who qualifies for a flu jab.\nHealth service bosses had previously said they needed lots of warning of an autumn Covid-19 booster rollout in order to plan the logistics alongside vaccinating millions of people against flu.\nInterim advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is that boosters will help maintain protection against Covid-19 and new variants for those most at risk, before winter comes.\nThe vaccines are thought to protect most people against serious illness for at least six months, but a lack of data on exactly how long immunity lasts is prompting a safety-first approach.\nNo decisions have yet been made on which vaccines will be used.\nProf Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, said: \"We want to be on the front foot for Covid-19 booster vaccination to keep the probability of loss of vaccine protection, due to waning immunity or variants, as low as possible - especially over the coming autumn and winter.\"\nHe said other respiratory viruses, particularly flu, \"will make a comeback\" and be an additional problem this winter.\n\"We will need to ensure protection against flu, as well as maintaining protection against Covid-19,\" Prof Van-Tam said.\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said ministers were working with the NHS to rapidly deliver the programme from September.\n\"Our first Covid-19 vaccination programme is restoring freedom in this country, and our booster programme will protect this freedom,\" he said.\nScotland's health secretary Humza Yousaf said the government had been working closely with NHS boards to plan for the booster campaign, while the current vaccination programme \"continues at pace and remains on schedule\".\nWales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan said she was working with Welsh health boards to ensure they can deliver a booster programme \"from the start of September\".\n\"In line with the other nations of the UK, the Welsh government welcomes the JCVI advice,\" she said. \"It very much aligns with our thinking and our planning assumptions to date.\"\nThe JCVI's final advice will be published before September, when better data will be available on how long protection from the first two doses of the vaccines lasts. The latest figures on hospitalisations, emerging variants and trials will also be taken into account at that point, and could change their advice.\nIn the meantime, the JCVI's advice is to offer a third Covid jab (and a flu jab) to the following people from September 2021:\nAfter those groups, it will be:\nProf Wei Shen Lim, Covid-19 chair for JCVI, said all these groups would also be eligible for the annual flu vaccine and were strongly advised to have it.\nYounger adults will be not be given a third dose, because they will only have had their second dose in the summer, although this decision will be revisited at a later time, the JCVI said."

      "tags": "Savings,HM Treasury,Money,Personal finance",
      "text": "Details of a new savings product which will fund the government's environmental projects have been revealed - except for one key factor.\nAnyone aged 16 or over will be able to put between \u00a3100 and \u00a3100,000 into Green Savings Bonds from National Savings and Investments (NS&I).\nMoney will be locked in for three years but, significantly, the interest rate has yet to be announced.\nThat, and when the bonds go on sale, will be unveiled later in the year.\nAnna Bowes, of comparison site Savings Champion, said: \"It is frustrating that we were told this would be available in the summer but that date is being stretched.\"\nShe said the interest rate was unlikely to be very competitive because the bonds would be attractive to people who wanted to save safely in green projects. \nChancellor Rishi Sunak announced in the Budget that the new savings product would go on sale in the summer.\nIt is designed to raise billions of pounds for environmental projects such as wind and hydrogen power, as part of plans to hit the government's net-zero carbon emissions target by 2050.\nThe chancellor also hopes it will assist with green shoots of economic recovery after the pandemic by creating jobs in this sector.\nIn effect, the money will go to the government to spend on these products, rather than the public investing directly in a specific environmental scheme.\nThe new Bond will go on sale via NS&I - the government-backed provider of Premium Bonds. It has been heavily criticised by savers and MPs for its customer service performance during the pandemic. \nHowever, it is attractive to savers as their money is 100% guaranteed to be safe by the government. Up to \u00a385,000 per person, and per bank, building society or credit union is guaranteed for savers elsewhere under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.\nThe terms - published on the NS&I website - state that savers aged 16 and over can apply online and each put in between \u00a3100 and \u00a3100,000. Anyone unable to operate online can phone NS&I for help.\nTo receive interest, they must not withdraw their savings for three years.\nIn recent years, savers have been starved of any kind of decent returns owing to cheap rates of borrowing.\nSignificantly, the Green Savings Bond interest rate has not yet been declared.\nThe average rate for three-year bonds on the market is 0.76% a year. The most generous interest rate for a three-year bond at the moment is 1.26% a year.\nThe Treasury has described it as a world-first. Savings Bonds are certainly nothing new. The Investment Guaranteed Growth Bond (IGGB) was sold via NS&I for a year from April 2017. That was a three-year bond, with an interest rate of 2.2%.\nThere are a number of \"green\" savings products available to savers, some of which have market-leading interest rates.\nThey include the Gatehouse Bank Green Saver and Oxbury Bank Forest Saver, which fund tree planting projects. Triodos Bank and the Ecology Building Society also use money raised from savers to lend to environmental projects.\nOther specific green investment prospectuses are also marketed in the UK, although they often rely on the projects to be successful before paying any kind of return."

      "text": "The organiser of the Latitude Festival has said Covid testing meant those attending this month's event could \"jump, dance and hug\" in safety.\nAnyone attending the festival must show proof of a negative lateral flow test or double vaccination.\nThe event in Suffolk starts three days after the government expects to lift all limits on social contact.\nMelvin Benn said: \"I'm looking forward to opening the gates more than anything that you could possibly imagine.\"\nThe 40,000-capacity event at Henham Park is part of the government's events research programme (ERP).\n\"It will be quite an emotional moment for me and I think it will be emotional for the music industry at large as it really will be the first event that opens properly as a camping event anywhere in the world,\" said Mr Benn, managing director of the Festival Republic Group.\nHe said a number of ministers and MPs would be at the the four-day event, which begins on 22 July.\nMusical headliners will include Wolf Alice and the Chemical Brothers. \nMr Benn said the \"core preventative measure happens before you arrive\" at Latitude.\n\"That means that if you're jumping up and down, waving your arms around, having a hug with somebody, you know that that person that you're enjoying the music with, that you're enjoying the theatre with, that you're enjoying the dancing with, they're also tested clear of Covid at the same time, so it provides that security and safety that everybody's looking for,\" he said.\n\"I'm spending more time talking to government ministers and DCMS (Department for Culture, Media and Sport) officials than I'm talking to bands and managers and agents at the moment.\n\"The truth is there are a number of ministers and MPs coming to the event... as members of the general public, so they know exactly what it is.\"\nMr Benn worked with the ERP on May's pilot music festival in Liverpool, attended by 5,000, and on a reduced-capacity Download Festival attended by 10,000 last month, down from the usual 110,000.\nHe said results from Download were not yet available but there had been \"no alarm calls\" since.\nReading and Leeds festivals will take place in August, with about 190,000 due to attend in total.\n\"I think that's going to be a hell of a party period, a great weekend for us all, but of course we'll be watching the guidelines and following the procedures that the government want us to do,\" he said. \nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Commercial space travel,Richard Branson,Jeff Bezos,Virgin Galactic,Space exploration",
      "text": "Sir Richard Branson has named the date he'll fly to the edge of space. It will be 11 July, or very soon after.\nHe'll be a passenger in the back of the Unity rocket plane his Virgin Galactic company has been developing in the US for the better part of two decades.\nThe vehicle can climb to an altitude of 90km (295,000ft), giving those onboard a few minutes of weightlessness and a view of the curvature of the Earth.\nSir Richard's intention is to introduce a commercial spaceflight service.\nSome 600 individuals have already lodged deposits to take the ride.\nWitnessing the British entrepreneur do it means those customers are now getting extremely close to having to hand over the full ticket price, which in some cases will be $250,000 (\u00a3180,000).\nSir Richard Branson said: \"I truly believe that space belongs to all of us. After 17 years of research, engineering and innovation, the new commercial space industry is poised to open the Universe to humankind and change the world for good. \n\"It's one thing to have a dream of making space more accessible to all; it's another for an incredible team to collectively turn that dream into reality.\"\nAbsolutely key to Virgin Galactic moving forward with its business was the granting last week of a commercial spaceflight licence by the Federal Aviation Administration.\nSunday 11 July is the opening of what's termed a flight \"window\". The Galactic team will aim to make the ascent on that day, but it could of course be delayed because of unfavourable weather conditions or perhaps a technical issue.\nIf the mission does indeed go ahead on that Sunday, it would mean Sir Richard stealing a march on his rival in sub-orbital space tourism, fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos.\nThe founder of the online retail empire Amazon.com has sunk a fortune into his hobby of building rockets and has announced his own trip to the edge of space on 20 July.\nHe's invited three individuals to join him in his New Shepard booster and capsule system: his brother Mark; a mystery person who paid $28m (\u00a320m) at auction for a seat; and the famed female aviator Wally Funk.\nEighty-two-year old Funk trained to be an astronaut in the 1960s and will become the oldest ever spacefarer when she rockets to an altitude of 100km with Mr Bezos.\nThe Amazon man has yet to detail how he'll sell tickets more generally for New Shepard, but this is his plan.\nSir Richard has clearly moved his first flight up in response to Mr Bezos naming the date for his inaugural mission.\nThe original schedule for the next Unity flight called for four Virgin Galactic employees to ride as passengers to test the cabin experience for future tourists. Only after that outing was Sir Richard supposed to strap himself in.\nHe'll now be one of the four testers - alongside Beth Moses, Galactic's chief astronaut instructor; Colin Bennett, lead operations engineer; and Sirisha Bandla, vice president of government affairs.\nThe two pilots up front will be Dave Mackay and Michael \"Sooch\" Masucci. \nSpace tourism is a sector being rekindled after a decade's hiatus.\nThroughout the 2000s, seven wealthy individuals paid to visit the International Space Station (ISS). But this adventurism, organised under the patronage of the Russian space agency, ceased in 2009.\nNow, new initiatives abound, and some of these will be aiming much higher than the sub-orbital flights from Sir Richard and Jeff Bezos.\nCalifornia tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has already lined up several private missions in his Dragon capsules. These vehicles reach several hundred km above the Earth and will stay up for days.\nThe Russians, too, are reprising their commercial flights to the ISS, and there are even those who want to launch private space stations for people to visit. Among these is Axiom, a company started by a former Nasa ISS programme manager."

      "text": "The original source code for the world wide web has been sold as a non-fungible token, making $5.4m (\u00a33.9m).\nNFTs are certificates of ownership for digital assets, which often do not have a physical representation.\nThey do not necessarily include copyright control - and critics say they are get-rich-quick schemes that are bad for the environment.\nWorld-wide-web creator Sir Tim Berners-Lee sold the NFT to an unidentified buyer, through auction house Sotheby\u2019s.\nThe highest bid stood at $3.5m for most of the last day of the auction - but there were a flurry of bids in the closing 15 minutes.\nThe auction began on 23 June, with an opening bid of $1,000.\nThe profits would go towards causes chosen by Sir Tim and his wife, Sotheby\u2019s said.\nFour different items were sold as part of a single NFT:\nThe sale surpassed the $2.9m (\u00a32m) spent on Twitter founder Jack Dorsey\u2019s first tweet but fell short of the record amount an NFT has been sold for - $69m, for digital artwork by Beeple, at Christie\u2019s auction house, in March.\nSir Tim created the world wide web, in 1989, by connecting different pieces of information on the early internet through hyperlinks. \nHe built the first web browser and server, refusing to patent his invention.\nIn 1993, Cern, the research organisation Sir Tim worked for at the time, relinquished all its rights to the technology and put it in the open domain.\nAnd when the NFT auction was announced, Sir Tim told the Guardian: \u201cThe core codes and protocols on the web are royalty free, just as they always have been.\n\u201cI\u2019m not selling the web \u2013 you won\u2019t have to start paying money to follow links.\n\u201cI\u2019m not even selling the source code. \n\"I\u2019m selling a picture that I made, with a Python program that I wrote myself, of what the source code would look like if it was stuck on the wall and signed by me.\u201d\nSotheby's described the lot as \"the only signed copy of the code for the first web browser in existence\", comparing its sale to that of the handwritten documents of a historic figure.\nNFTs have been criticised for their impact on the environment, as the blockchain -  where the records of ownership are stored on a digital ledger - requires huge amounts of energy to run.\nSotheby\u2019s said it would pay for a carbon offset for the \u201cminting and transaction costs of the sale\u201d."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you on Friday morning. \nBoris Johnson has said he hopes England will return to as close to the pre-pandemic status quo as possible on 19 July. He said he would set out what step four of the roadmap out of lockdown - due in just over two weeks - would look like in the next few days. But he added some \"extra precautions\" might still be needed. The prime minister said double Covid jabs would be a \"liberator\" for travel, while he asked parents and teachers to be \"patient\" over school bubbles needing to isolate. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg has taken a look at how much life might change when the rules lift.\nLeading scientists are calling for the UK's official list of Covid symptoms to be expanded to ensure cases are not missed. They point out the World Health Organization and US guidance include many other symptoms - such as a sore throat and runny nose. Current NHS advice says people should self-isolate and get a test if they have a high fever, a new continuous cough or a loss or change to their sense of smell or taste. But the group of experts points out not everyone who catches Covid displays these classic symptoms, with a runny nose, headaches and muscle aches more commonly seen in younger people.\nA hospital has pledged to review visiting restrictions after apologising for preventing parents from seeing their dying son in his final weeks. Ollie Bibby died of leukaemia at University College London Hospital (UCLH) on 5 May and his case was highlighted by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer in the House of Commons on Wednesday. His mother Penny Bibby said a letter from Tim Jaggard, acting chief executive of UCLH, was a \"pleasant surprise\" and she hoped it would help other people be with their loved ones in hospital.\nThailand has welcomed its first quarantine-free tourists back to the island of Phuket as the country tries to reboot its tourism industry. About 250 people, mainly from the Middle East, were expected to arrive on four flights on Thursday. They do not need to quarantine, but they cannot travel to the mainland for 14 days. It is hoped the scheme will help support the Thai tourism industry, which accounts for about a fifth of the country's economy- with Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha saying \"we have to accept the risk so Thai people can make a living\".\nThe Edinburgh Fringe Festival Society has put tickets for 170 shows on sale for the world-famous festival, which runs from 6 to 30 August. Given the challenges of Covid, it's quite a feat, and no-one knows quite what to expect from a very different festival this year. While more shows are expected to be announced in the coming weeks there will be nowhere near the 3,800 shows in years before the pandemic. Although the latest Scottish government guidance is that social distancing should be unnecessary by 9 August, most venues are understandably nervous. It means a blended programme with outdoor performances as well as indoor ones, and digital shows will take place.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nAnd with the European Union rolling out its new Covid passport scheme you can find out what it means for travel here.\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Sexism,Online abuse,Women",
      "text": "More than 200 high-profile women have signed an open letter asking for concrete action to tackle abuse on social media platforms.\nThe letter - signed by women including former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard, ex-US tennis player Billie Jean King and British actresses Thandiwe Newton and Emma Watson - has been published at the UN Generation Equality Forum. \nMs Gillard told the BBC: \"As prime minister of Australia, like other women in the public domain, I regularly received highly gendered and ugly social media, including the circulation of pornographic cartoons.\" \nShe added that it made her \"angry and frustrated that women still face this kind of abuse\".\nThe letter was addressed to the chief executives of Facebook, Google, TikTok and Twitter, and asked them to \"urgently prioritise the safety of women on your platforms\". \nThe social media chiefs have said that they will commit to improving systems on reporting abuse, and filter what users see and who can interact with them online.\nHowever, some campaigners have expressed concerns that these commitments do not go far enough. \n\"These abstract statements offer tech companies a good PR opportunity, but these aren't real commitments,\" says Lucina Di Meco, co-founder of #ShePersisted Global, which tackles online attacks against women.\n\"They aren't specifically offering to look at content moderation or algorithmic preferences that will reward bad behaviour. So far, we are still putting the burden on women.\"\nThe letter reads: \"The internet is the town square of the 21st Century. It is where debate takes place, communities are built, products are sold and reputations are made.\n\"But the scale of online abuse means that, for too many women, these digital town squares are unsafe. This is a threat to progress on gender equality.\"\nThe letter also pointed to a 2020 study of more than 4,000 adult women by The Economist Intelligence Unit, which found that 38% of them in 51 countries have had direct experience of online intimidation.\nAnd it also emphasises online abuse is worse for marginalised groups and black, Asian, Latin American and mixed-race women. \n\"It is really important that we recognise that abuse and harassment against women on social media platforms is widespread, and that it is one of the biggest barriers to gender equality,\" said Azmina Dhrodia, senior policy manager at the World Wide Web Foundation, who organised the letter. \nAzerbaijani journalist Arzu Geybulla, who took part in the consultations, told the BBC that constant online harassment made her want to leave her career. \nShe added that she wondered if tech platforms would \"ever take trolling and harassment seriously\". \nTikTok already has a \"prompt\" that asks people to reconsider the impact of their words before posting a comment which may contain inappropriate or other key words, and Twitter has features to limit the posts people see.\nVijaya Gadde, Twitter's head of legal, public policy, and trust and safety, said: \"While we have made recent strides in giving people greater control to manage their safety, we know there is still much work to be done. \n\"We are committed to addressing this issue and working with industry partners and civil society to build a safer internet.\"\nOn Wednesday, Facebook also announced a Women's Safety Hub to centralise its existing resources to deal with online abuse, and a dedicated global Women's Safety Advisory board which they say will monitor and make recommendations on safety.\nThe commitments are part of a series of announcements made at the UN's Generation Equality Forum in Paris.\nThe World Wide Web Foundation says it will track the tech companies against the commitments they've made, and report annually on their progress.

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "tags": "Global economy,OECD,Rishi Sunak,Janet Yellen",
      "text": "Officials from 130 countries have agreed to overhaul the global tax system to ensure big companies \"pay a fair share\" wherever they operate.\nThe OECD said on Thursday that negotiators had backed a proposed minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15%.\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said: \"Today is an historic day for economic diplomacy.\"\nTax on big tech firms has been a source of friction between the US and others.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which led the talks, said that the plans could generate about $150bn (\u00a3109bn) in tax revenues a year.\nBut the Paris-based organisation confirmed that Ireland and Hungary - countries with low corporate taxes - had not joined the deal on the global minimum.\nAll G20 countries, such as the US, UK China and France, did back the agreement. \nParticipating governments are now expected to try to pass relevant laws to bring in the minimum, although details such as possible exemptions for certain industries are still up for negotiation.\n\"A detailed implementation plan together with remaining issues will be finalised by October 2021,\" said a statement signed by 130 out of 139 countries and jurisdictions involved in the talks.\nCountries have also signed up to new rules on where the biggest multinational companies are taxed. They would see taxing rights on more than $100bn of profits shift to countries where profits are generated, rather than where a business might have its headquarters.\nThe US Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, said the agreement sent a sign that a \"race to the bottom\" on tax rates was coming to an end.\n\"For decades, the US has participated in a self-defeating international tax competition, lowering our corporate tax rates only to watch other nations lower theirs in response. \n\"The result was a global race to the bottom: Who could lower their corporate rate further and faster?\"\nShe said that \"no nation\" had won the race. \nThe Biden administration has been pushing for a deal internationally while it seeks to raise taxes domestically. It has, for example, called for an increase in the US corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.\nThis agreement has been years in the making. The talks had lost momentum, reflecting to a large extent the United States' lack of enthusiasm for either of the main proposals. \nBut that all changed with the new administration, which took power in Washington in January. President Joe Biden and his Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, wanted a deal and made specific proposals. They want to raise more tax to repair the public finances after the pandemic and to cover their spending plans. \nA few countries have held out against the reforms, including three in the EU - Ireland, Hungary and Estonia, which have at least some corporate taxes below the proposed minimum. \nIf the deal works as planned, though, staying out won't help them. It includes a \"top-up\" provision, so that a parent company would get an additional bill if a subsidiary paid less than the minimum.  \nThe news was also welcomed by other finance ministers. \nChancellor Rishi Sunak cited last month's G7 talks in London, where rich nations agreed to battle tax avoidance: \"We achieved a historic agreement that will see the largest multinational tech giants pay the right tax in the right countries.\n\"I'm pleased to see this momentum has continued and welcome the OECD's progress today.\n\"I look forward to continuing discussions with our global partners in the coming months with a view of finalising the details by October,\" he said.\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire described it as the \"most important international tax deal reached since a century\" during a news conference. \nAnd German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Thursday that while details still needed to be worked out, the agreement marked \"colossal progress\" and would allow countries to increase spending on \"important priorities\" such as infrastructure and efforts to fight climate change.\nExplaining its decision not to join the agreement, Ireland said it had not signed up because of reservations over the proposed corporate tax \"floor\".\n\"Ireland expressed our broad support... but noting our reservation about the proposal for a global minimum effective tax rate of 'at least 15%',\" the government said in a statement.\n\"As a result of this reservation, Ireland is not in a position to join the consensus.\""

      "tags": "George W Bush,United States",
      "text": "Donald Rumsfeld, the two-time US defence secretary who was one of the main architects of the Iraq war, has died at the age of 88.\nServing under President George W Bush, he was a key proponent of the so-called \"war on terror\" after the 9/11 attacks.\nUS forces invaded Iraq in 2003 after claiming the country had weapons of mass destruction, but no such weapons were found.\nMr Rumsfeld resigned three years later amid the fallout from the conflict.\nHe staunchly defended his record, but many experts blamed him for decisions that led to difficulties in Iraq and the wider region. \nOn Wednesday, his family said he had died at home in the town of Taos, New Mexico. \"History may remember him for his extraordinary accomplishments over six decades of public service,\" they said in a statement.\n\"But for those who knew him best and whose lives were forever changed as a result, we will remember his unwavering love for his wife Joyce, his family and friends, and the integrity he brought to a life dedicated to country.\"\nReacting to the news, President Bush described him as \"a man of intelligence, integrity, and almost inexhaustible energy\" and an \"exemplary public servant\" who \"never flinched from responsibility\". \nUS defence secretary Lloyd Austin, meanwhile, said: \"Secretary Rumsfeld was propelled by his boundless energy, probing intellect, and abiding commitment to serve his country.\"\nBorn in Chicago in 1932, Mr Rumsfeld's political and private career spanned decades. He first came to Washington DC in the 1960s and served in multiple positions under presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.\nIn 1975, he became the youngest person to be named defence secretary and later became the oldest to serve in the role during his second stint under President Bush.   \nHe was at the Pentagon when the building was hit by a hijacked airplane during the 9/11 attacks. Mr Rumsfeld was among the first to reach the smouldering crash site, and he helped carry the wounded in stretchers.\nLess than a month later, US forces began an air campaign against al-Qaeda, the group responsible for the attacks, and the Taliban in Afghanistan, toppling the regime within weeks. \nThe administration's attention then turned to Iraq, which had played no role in the attacks. Mr Rumsfeld made the case for the March 2003 invasion, arguing that the country's weapons of mass destruction posed a danger to the world. No such weapons were ever found.\nMr Rumsfeld was known for his rollicking news conferences in which he sparred with reporters. One of the most memorable moments came in 2002, when he gave a much-mocked answer about \"known knowns\" and \"known unknowns\" after being asked whether there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\nHis tenure was also marked by photos that surfaced in 2004 of US personnel abusing prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad, and the treatment of foreign terrorism suspects at a prison set up at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\nMr Rumsfeld, however, largely remained defiant over his record after leaving office. In a 2011 memoir, which he titled Known and Unknown, he defended his decisions around the Iraq war but did express regret over some of his comments."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "\"It all has to go.\"\nOne member of the cabinet couldn't have been clearer on their hopes for the removal of legal restrictions on our lives in England on 19 July.\nBear in mind that nothing is final, no conclusive decisions have been made.\nThat cabinet minister may not get their wish entirely.\nBut every time one of their colleagues has opened their mouth in the last few days, the chances of the rules being removed more or less entirely in less than three weeks has seemed to increase.\nExpectation is building that the one-metre-plus rule that has made normal business for workplaces, pubs and public places so hard will go.\nIt seems likely the compulsory wearing of masks will be ditched too.\nAnd the rules that have controlled the size even of private gatherings are expected to disappear. \nYou might wonder about the logic of how long they can last in any case. How can it be sustainable for us to watch the crowds at Wembley in our living rooms, but not be allowed to have more than five friends over to watch the match if they happen to live in different places?\nIt doesn't seem that government will be able to change the rules to ease the frustrations of thousands of parents whose kids are stuck at home again before the end of the term in England. \nThe prime minister has asked parents to be patient. But there is a hope that clubs or play schemes in the school holidays won't have to be subject to the same limits and, as ministers have indicated, the rules will look very different when it's time to go back to school.\nThe government is still likely, though, to give advice, or urge some caution.\nBoris Johnson's instinct is to allow life after 19 July to get back to something as close to normality before the pandemic as possible.\nBut messages about the importance of hand washing, or ventilation, are likely to remain.\nIsolation and testing are still expected to be important, even though the government is searching for a way of reducing the burden on those who have been double jabbed.\nTravel for those who have had both vaccinations is likely to ease up, but don't expect booking a spot on the lounger or jumping on a plane to be straightforward this summer.\nAbove all, perhaps, Downing Street won't be in a position to say that restrictions have gone, never to return.\nWhen the announcement comes, perhaps in less than a week, ministers will have to balance a return to some norms with the reality that cases will continue to go up, perhaps by significant numbers.\nThe number of people being sent to hospital is therefore likely to rise as well.\nBut the vaccine should mean those increases simply won't translate into an awful spike in the number of people losing their lives to the disease.\nWe may not, though, see ministers pushing people to get back out into the world again. Exhortations to get out and spend, to \"eat out to help out\" or swarm back to the office are not likely to be a feature this year.\nRemember, no final decisions have been taken, but after many months the political sentiment is moving in one direction - towards scrapping most of the limits that have controlled so much of our lives for so long.

      "title": "Right to repair rules will extend lifespan of products, government says",
      "tags": "Consumer electronics,Employment,Climate change",
      "text": "Products such as washing machines, TVs and fridges should become easier to repair and cheaper to run under new rules coming into force.\nManufacturers are now legally required to make spare parts available to people buying electrical appliances.\nThe aim of the new rules is to extend the lifespan of products by up to 10 years and benefit the environment.\nHowever, one company said that the new rules could make white goods more expensive.\nThe right to repair rules are designed to tackle \"built-in obsolescence\" where manufacturers deliberately build appliances to break down after a certain period to encourage consumers to buy new ones.\nThe new rules apply to products bought from Thursday, but manufacturers have a grace period of up to two years to make spare parts available.\nMany consumers have complained that goods don't last long enough, then can't be fixed in the home.\nAdam French from consumer group Which? said that electrical items end up in landfill too often \"because they are either too costly or difficult to fix\".\nThe rules \"should ensure products last longer and help reduce electrical waste\", he said.\nOnly parts for \"simple and safe\" repairs will be available directly to consumers, including \"door hinges on your washing machine or replacement baskets and trays for your fridge-freezers\", he said.\n\"Other parts that involve more difficult repairs will only be available to professional repairers, such as the motor or heating element in your washing machine,\" he said.\nThe government has also made changes to energy efficiency standards, which it has estimated will knock an average of \u00a375 per year off energy bills, and cut carbon emissions.\n\"The tougher standards will ensure more of our electrical goods can be fixed rather than have to be thrown away when they stop working, putting more money back in the pockets of consumers,\" said energy minister Anne Marie Trevelyan.\nThese new rules should bring an end to the frustration of having to throw away an item because a small part is no longer working and no longer in stock. \nOften the seal around a fridge, the detergent drawer on a washing machine, or the runners on a dishwasher break. Rather than having to buy a whole new product, replacement parts must now be sold directly by the manufacturer for 10 years, whether or not they are still selling the complete item in their range.\nThis isn't a law about who is responsible for the repair. If it's still within warranty, then the manufacturer or the retailer should repair it, but after that, you are at least now guaranteed access to a replacement part. You'll probably have to buy it, and you may have to pay someone to fit it if it's a complicated internal part, but at least you should be able to get hold of it. \nHaving the right to repair is a step removed from having the confidence to actually attempt one, though. It's a much bigger cultural shift to convince people to fix it and not to fling it.\nEnvironmental expert Libby Peake, head of resource policy at Green Alliance, said that the new regulations \"represent a small, first step towards giving people the long-lasting repairable products they want\".\nHowever, she said it was not accurate to say the new rules create a \"legal right to repair\".\n\"The government hasn't given consumers any such right, as the spare parts and repairability criteria are only directed at professional repairers, not at the people who own products,\" she said.\n\"There is also no guarantee that spare parts and repair services will be affordable, so considerable barriers remain to making this the easiest, default option,\" she added.\nOne company said the legislation could make appliances more expensive.  John Elliot, executive chairman of Ebac, said his business had always focused on the long-term reliability of a product.\n\"We don't look to make the cheapest washing machine. We look for one that's going to do the job and last a long time,\" he said.  \nThe firm has been manufacturing dehumidifiers, water coolers and washing machines for five decades, at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham. \n\"Our focus is reliability - not just a low initial cost,\" Mr Elliot said. \"The secret of a product that's easy to repair and long-lasting is in the design.\" \nOverall, Mr Elliot said, the legislation will not make much difference to his business. But it will to competitors, who have been in a race to the bottom on prices for many white goods. \n\"I can't think of one example where we could not repair a product,\" he added. \"I checked, and the oldest machine we repaired was 25 years old.\"\nRob Johnson, operations director at repair business Pacifica, said that his firm was now hoping to recruit engineers because of the new rules.\nThe company already has 400 qualified engineers going into homes to fix about 6,000 appliances per week.\nHe said the legislation \"gives customers real choice\" about whether to repair or replace their product. \nHowever, he said that business was still brisk for quick fixes to items such as dishwasher filters, washing machine seals and broken fridge or freezer doors.\nPeople have different comfort levels when it comes to the thought of tackling home repairs on appliances, according to YouGov research for BBC News.\nMen said they felt more comfortable than women in trying to fix appliances across the board.\nMost of the appliances featured in the new legislation can be found in the kitchen. However, data suggests few feel comfortable taking advantage of the increased availability of spare parts.\nOf the kitchen appliances covered under the new rules, Britons are most comfortable repairing their washing machines (22%) including some one-in-three men (32%) and half as many women (14%). But people are less comfortable with dishwashers (16%). "

      "title": "Nissan announces major UK electric car expansion",
      "tags": "Companies,Sunderland,Nissan,Electric cars,Car industry",
      "text": "Nissan has announced a major expansion of electric vehicle production at its car plant in Sunderland which will create 1,650 new jobs.\nThe Japanese carmaker will build its new-generation all-electric model at the site as part of a \u00a31bn investment that will also support thousands of jobs in the supply chain.\nAnd Nissan's partner, Envision AESC, will build an electric battery plant.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson called it a \"pivotal moment\".\nOf the \u00a31bn investment, Nissan said it would invest up to \u00a3423m to produce a new-generation all-electric vehicle in the UK, building on the success of its existing electric car, the Leaf.\nProduction of the new model will create 909 new jobs and more than 4,500 in its UK supply chain. \nOther production locations have not yet been confirmed. More details about the new vehicle will be released closer to the car's launch date.\nEnvision's new gigafactory will eventually provide batteries to power up to 100,000 Nissan electric vehicles a year. It will create 750 new jobs and secure 300 existing roles.\nIt is hoped the new plant will operational in time for 2024, when the level of UK-made components in cars manufactured in the UK is required to start increasing, in line with the terms of the UK's trade deal with the EU.\nThe majority of Nissan's Sunderland-assembled cars are sold in the EU.\nMeanwhile, the BBC has been told that an investment at Vauxhall's car plant at Ellesmere Port is \"weeks away\" - a move that could secure the future of the plant.\nIt is expected that a promise of government aid could see Vauxhall's parent company, Stellantis, commit to building a new model at the factory.\nFrom 2030, sales of new cars and vans powered solely by petrol or diesel will be banned in the UK. However, some hybrids will still be allowed.\nMr Johnson said: \"The great thing about this investment and the creation of this gigafactory is it is going to drive down the cost of electric vehicles (EVs), not just for people who are currently buying them but so ordinary families can buy EVs as a matter of course and that will start happening in just a few years' time.\"\nAhead of the Brexit deal, Nissan had warned over the future of the Sunderland plant if the government was unable to secure an agreement with the EU.\nAt the time, Nissan's chief operating officer, Ashwani Gupta, said: \"If it happens without any sustainable business case obviously it is not a question of Sunderland or not Sunderland, obviously our UK business will not be sustainable, that's it.\"\nHowever, on Thursday Mr Gupta told the BBC: \"The key success factor for Brexit has always been trade friendly business conditions to sustain our business not only in the UK but in the whole of Europe and thanks to Brexit, Nissan is moving forward to use Brexit as an opportunity.\"\nHe declined to say how much money the UK government would contribute to the expansion plan, stating that talks were continuing. \"But, for sure, without the government support it would have not been possible,\" he said.\nMr Johnson said Nissan's announcement was \"a major vote of confidence in the UK\" and \"a pivotal moment in our electric vehicle revolution\".\nAsked about how much government money was contributing to the new plant, he said: \"We will review our support as the project develops and due diligence takes place... and after this details of the award will be in the public domain.\"\nMike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said the announcement was \"great news for the sector, the region and all those employed locally\".\nHowever, he told the BBC that for the full transition to electric car manufacturing \"it's not enough. We need a lot more. We have a number of factories in the UK, producing up to 1.5 million vehicles. So we need to see this sort of investment multiplied\".\n\"Germany and other parts of Europe, Eastern Europe in particular, are way ahead of us in terms of those committed investments,\" Mr Hawes said.\nThe news that Nissan is pumping hundreds of millions of pounds into a massive expansion of UK-based electric car manufacturing is a huge boost to the North East and the UK car industry as a whole. These are long-term investments that will create thousands of jobs. The prime minister and Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng will welcome the chance to answer critics who say the UK is falling behind European rivals in securing all-important battery production capacity, seen as essential as a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars in 2030 approaches. \nBut amidst the euphoria, a few sobering facts. By industry estimates, the UK is currently on course to have less than a tenth of the battery production capacity of Germany by 2025. From 2024, under the terms of the UK-EU Brexit deal, the percentage of components required to be sourced within the UK or EU begins to rise if UK-assembled cars are to avoid tariffs when exported to the EU - where most Nissans are sold. If you don't have a battery industry, you won't have a car industry. \nAlthough the precise details have not been disclosed, the government is thought to have contributed tens of millions of pounds towards the cost of the project. The prime minister will argue that it kills two prized economic birds - decarbonisation and levelling up - with one stone. Workers, unions and local politicians in the North East will consider it money well spent. But industry experts are clear: this must be the first of many such investments if the UK is to keep up with the biggest revolution in car technology since they were invented. \nEarlier this week, a report commissioned by the SMMT said a series of factories producing electric car batteries needed to be built in the UK to secure the future of the country's automotive industry.\nIt said the government should announce a \"binding target\" of 60 gigawatt hours of battery capacity to be in place by 2030.\nThe report said that at the moment, the UK is on track to have 12 gigawatt hours worth of lithium battery capacity by 2025. This compares with 164 gigawatt hours in Germany.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, told the BBC's Today programme: \"I don't think we are falling behind. Germany has a huge tradition of automotive manufacturing, we know that, and we are establishing gigafactories here in the UK.\" \nLabour's shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, welcomed the new gigafactory but said: \"Ministers cannot be complacent.\" \n\"Only this week, the SMMT said that the government was falling behind our competitors and the Faraday Institution estimates we need seven gigafactories by 2040.\"\nThe SMMT-commissioned study, written by policy and research company Public First, also called for the installation of at least 2.3 million charging points nationwide before the end of the decade.\nThis is aimed at giving confidence to drivers - particularly those with no off-road parking at home - to invest in zero-emission vehicles.\nMr Kwarteng said that this could be achieved: \"I think the way in which economies can transform is remarkable and I think nine years to hit those targets is sufficient.\""
