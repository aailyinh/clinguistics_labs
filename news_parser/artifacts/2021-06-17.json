      "text": "Lockdown restrictions in England will be extended by up to four weeks after MPs backed the government in a Commons vote by 461 to 60. \nIt means the regulations can stay in place until 19 July, despite a large Tory rebellion against the move. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs ahead of the vote there has been a \"significant change\" that has given the virus \"extra legs\".\nLabour supported the delay but said it did so \"with a heavy heart\". \nOn Monday, Boris Johnson said delaying the planned lifting of restrictions would give the NHS \"a few more crucial weeks\" to get people vaccinated.\nThe decision means pubs, clubs and theatres will still have to operate within capacity limits and nightclubs will remain closed.\nAnd limits remain on how many people can meet up, with groups of up to 30 allowed to gather outdoors and up to six people or two households allowed indoors, although weddings will be exempt. \nSeveral Conservative MPs expressed their unhappiness with the plans and 51 voted against the government. \nFormer Conservative minister, Mark Harper, who chairs the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, said: \"My worry, and the worry of others, is we're going to get to this point in four weeks' time and we're just going to be back here all over again extending the restrictions.\"\nSenior Tory Sir Desmond Swayne said ministers' response to the rising cases was disproportionate and a threat to civil liberties.\n\"I always thought it was wrong for them to take our freedoms, even though they believed that they were acting in our best interests in an emergency, but by any measure that emergency has now passed and yet freedoms are still withheld, and the government will not allow us to assess for ourselves the risks that we are prepared to encounter in our ordinary everyday lives,\" he said. \nFormer cabinet minister Dame Andrea Leadsom said while she would reluctantly back the government in the vote, she urged ministers to show some \"flexibility\" and if possible lift restrictions after two weeks rather than four. \nOn weddings, she said: \"For many couples being able to hug, but not dance, you can't have a band, you've got to socially distance, that's not the kind of big day that they wanted for themselves and their families, so can he reconsider this?\"\nSchool and university students, she added, \"are now faced for the second year in a row with no end-of-year celebrations\".\nOpening the debate, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said pausing step 4 of the roadmap out of restrictions was a \"difficult but essential decision\".\nHe said figures showed the Delta variant now accounts for 96% of new cases and the number of infections was rising - with hospitalisations up 48% over the past week.\nHe added: \"We don't yet know the extent to which the link between hospitalisation and deaths has been broken so we propose to give the NHS a few more crucial weeks to get those remaining jabs into the arms of those who need them.\" \nAnd he said the government's objective was \"not to eradicate\" the virus, he said, because \"that is not possible\" but rather to aim \"to live with it\" like we do with flu.\nAnd he said the delay to 19 July would enable \"a majority\" of the over-40s to have two doses of the vaccine.  \nThe government easily won the vote thanks to Labour's support.\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said lifting all restrictions now \"could be akin to throwing petrol on a fire\" and it was essential to listen to the warnings from health professionals and help relieve the pressure on hospitals. \nBut he added: \"We are only here because over the last eight weeks we have failed to contain the Delta variant and have allowed it to become dominant.\"\nMPs also voted to back a range of other measures, such as extending the wearing of face coverings on public transport to 19 July."

      "text": "A fatal accident inquiry will be held into the Cameron House fire which killed two men after the mother of one of them called for wider lessons to be learned.\nRichard Dyson and his partner Simon Midgley died in a fire at the luxury hotel by Loch Lomond in December 2017.\nThe Crown Office had said an FAI was not needed because the circumstances of their deaths had been established.\nA review of that decision has now overturned it.\nIt emerged during a prosecution case against Cameron House that the blaze started after a night porter placed a plastic bag of ashes in the concierge cupboard which contained kindling and newspapers.\nIn January, Cameron House was fined \u00a3500,000 after admitting breaches of fire safety rules, while the porter was given a community payback order for breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act.\nIn April, the Crown Office said the purpose of a fatal accident inquiry was to determine the cause of death and to establish what lessons could be learned.\nIt added that it was \"satisfied\" the reasons for the tragedy had been established.\nThe family of Mr Midgley exercised their right to ask for a review of the decision.\nJane Midgley told the BBC her life had been \"destroyed\" by the deaths of \"her boys\", who lived in North London but were visiting the hotel on a pre-Christmas break. \nMs Midgley said: \"No prison sentence, no fine would ever justify what's happened, so all I've got to do now is fight for this fatal accident inquiry and make it safer for everybody else.\"\nNow an independent Crown Office review has decided that a fatal accident inquiry should be held.\nIt is a type of court hearing which publicly inquires into the circumstances of a death, presided over by a Sheriff and normally be held in the Sheriff Court. \nThey are routinely held if the death has happened as a result of an accident at work or if the death happened while in legal custody - for example in prison or police custody. \nBut they can also be held in other circumstances, if prosecutors believe it would be in the public interest to hold an inquiry.\nThe review into the decision not to hold an inquiry was carried out by Crown Counsel with no previous involvement in the original decision-making process. \nA Crown Office spokesman said the fire had caused two deaths and put the lives of many other people at risk. \nHe said that although meaningful changes had been made and lessons had been learned over what had already been presented in court, there were further issues which could be addressed in an inquiry. \n\"There are wider public interest issues around the safety of guests and building fire safety which ought to feature in a fatal accident inquiry,\" he said.\nThe spokesman continued: \"The procurator fiscal has now started work to initiate this inquiry and there are a number of legal steps which must be taken before it can commence. \n\"The detailed work carried out in the preparation of the prosecutions will be invaluable in this process.\n\"The families will be kept informed of what will happen next.\""

      "text": "Talks at Stormont continue late into the night in a bid to break a stalemate over Irish language legislation.\nSinn F\u00e9in returned just before midnight on Wednesday to resume negotiations with NI Secretary Brandon Lewis.\nHe had earlier held meetings with Sinn F\u00e9in and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\nSinn F\u00e9in has said it will not support a new DUP first minister unless the UK government intervenes and introduces language laws from Westminster.\nLanguage legislation was part of the deal that restored power-sharing at Stormont last January.\nThe DUP has not agreed to pass the legislation before the next election.\nAfter first meeting Mr Lewis, the Sinn F\u00e9in delegation said it needed clarity and more information before commenting further.\nHowever, just before midnight, Sinn F\u00e9in President Mary Lou McDonald tweeted she was heading back to see the secretary of state.\nThe DUP left without speaking to the media.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the \"whole\" deal that restored power-sharing at Stormont last January should be implemented.\nMr Johnson said people in Northern Ireland wanted a \"stable, functioning and mature executive\".\nHe was responding in the House of Commons to a question from former NI Secretary Julian Smith, who said it was \"vital\" parties stuck to the New Decade, New Approach (NDNA) commitments.\nMr Smith said the government should act as a \"backstop\" if the Stormont parties cannot make progress. \nArlene Foster resigned as first minister on Monday, six weeks after she was overthrown as the leader of the DUP.\nSinn F\u00e9in's Michelle O'Neill lost her position as deputy first minister at the same time because the roles form a joint office.\nThat led to a seven-day period for the approval of a new first minister and deputy first minister by Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP.\nOn Monday, Sinn F\u00e9in revealed it had asked Mr Lewis to introduce the laws at Westminster, saying it was the \"only way forward to finally resolve\" the dispute over Irish language legislation.\nDUP MP Sammy Wilson said the government \"must not interfere in devolved issues at the behest of Sinn F\u00e9in\".\nParty leader Edwin Poots has said he intends to support Irish language legislation but not necessarily before the next assembly election.\nThe stand-off between the two largest parties at Stormont over language and culture law potentially threatens the future of power-sharing.\nIt centres on the implementation of the New Decade, New Approach agreement, which was made in January 2020.\nThe deal includes an Office of Identity and Cultural Expression, an Irish language commissioner and a commissioner to enhance and develop the language and culture of the Ulster-Scots/Ulster-British tradition.\nOne of the key areas the parties disagreed on during the talks was over demands for a standalone Irish language act.\nSinn F\u00e9in wants the legislation passed before the end of the current NI Assembly term in May 2022, but the DUP has not given that commitment.\nCould we be heading for a political first in Northern Ireland?\nSolving a Stormont crisis with days to run before a deadline.\nThat is the hope of Brandon Lewis as he flies back to Northern Ireland to re-engage with Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP.\nBut is he planning to put something on the table to break the deadlock?\nMight he suggest  - as per the demand from Sinn F\u00e9in - that Westminster will legislate for Irish language but only if the executive fails to act first?\nBut, crucially, without setting a deadline or timeline for that to happen?\nIf he does, will that be enough for Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP to lift the threat hanging over the institutions?\nLots of questions but don't expect the answers as quickly as the secretary of state would like.\nEarlier, the NI secretary said he wanted to get the Stormont executive \"on a stable footing\".\n\"We all want to see New Decade New Approach delivered and there is a cultural, cross-community package,\" Mr Lewis said.\n\"I want to make sure we do everything we can to ensure the first minister and deputy first minister can be nominated by the parties, which means they've got to find a way to agree a process.\"\nIn the House of Commons, Mr Lewis criticised the Republic of Ireland's T\u00e1naiste (deputy prime minister) Leo Varadkar after he said he believed a united Ireland would happen in his lifetime.\nMr Lewis said Mr Varadkar's comments, made during an opening address of Fine Gael's Ard Fheis (party conference) on Tuesday, were \"unhelpful and ill-advised\" and urged people to \"dial down the rhetoric\".\nMr Varadkar said while the views of unionists must be \"acknowledged and respected\", \"no one group can have a veto on Ireland's future\".\nConservative MP Simon Hoare, the chair of the NI Affairs Committee, said he would vote for an Irish language act if it came to the Commons.\nHowever, in a reply to his tweet, the DUP's Carla Lockhart said: \"Not for the first time, a lack of real knowledge of Northern Ireland and a respect for devolution. You can't cherry pick when it suits you.\"\nMeanwhile, assembly members have been told that the executive's post-pandemic recovery plan has been put on hold because of the absence of a first and deputy first minister.\nThe plan was due to be approved on Tuesday and set out by the interim head of the Civil Service, Jenny Pyper.\nMs Pyper said she hoped to give the plan from the Covid Taskforce on Thursday."

      "text": "Paul Givan and Michelle O'Neill have been confirmed as Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers amid an internal Democratic Unionist Party revolt.\nIt comes after a deal was done ending a stalemate over Irish language laws, with the UK government to legislate if Stormont does not.\nThe assembly nominations took place amid opposition from DUP MLAs and MPs.\nA meeting of party officers took place at the DUP headquarters. \nThose attending include deputy leader Paula Bradley, Lord Morrow, Diane Dodds, Gregory Campbell, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Sammy Wilson, Education Minister Michelle McIlveen, William Humphrey, Tom Buchanan and Peter Weir.\nLeader Edwin Poots left the meeting in east Belfast shortly after 20:00 BST, but declined to answer questions from the media. \nBBC News NI understands the vast majority of DUP assembly members (MLAs) - 24 to four - voted against Mr Poots nominating Mr Givan as first minister, during a meeting ahead of the special assembly sitting.  \nSammy Wilson later said the feeling of the party was \"very, very clear\". \n\"What has been done today... shouldn't have been done and the vast majority of people believe that is the case,\" said the East Antrim MP.\nAsked if he had confidence in Mr Poots, Mr Wilson said any leader should \"bring people along with them\" and that could not be achieved by \"ignoring the views of a huge number of people\".\n\"A leader who acts without the support of even a marginal majority of his party has to live with the consequences of that,\" he said. \nAsked on his way into the meeting if there will be a vote of no confidence in Mr Poots, Mr Wilson said: \"Wait and see.\"\n\"I think Edwin has got to ask does he have any confidence in the party now? If he decides to ignore the views of the party, maybe he doesn't have any confidence in us,\" he added. \nThe first and deputy first minister nominations followed a late-night deal after talks involving Sinn F\u00e9in, the DUP and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis ended a stalemate over Irish language laws, with Mr Lewis declaring legislation would be brought in by Westminster in October if not first introduced at Stormont. \nBut DUP MPs and peers wrote to Mr Poots expressing their concern at the deal, asking him to meet them \"to explain the basis of your agreement with the secretary of state and Sinn F\u00e9in before any further steps are taken in this process, including the nomination of a first minister\". \nSignatories included Sir Jeffrey and Mr Wilson, as well as MPs Gregory Campbell, Jim Shannon, Gavin Robinson, Paul Girvan, and Carla Lockhart, along with Lord Morrow, Lord Browne, Lord Hea, Lord McCrea and Lord Dodds. \nSome DUP MPs also joined the MLA meeting to vote on Mr Givan's nomination, but Mr Poots and Mr Givan left before the vote was taken, walking past Mr Wilson while he was speaking, BBC News NI understands.\nMr Wilson said the feeling of party members at the meeting about whether to nominate a first minister was \"very clear\".\n\"It wasn't a marginal vote. It was a clear vote,\" Mr Wilson told the BBC's Talkback programme.\nJust over a month since he was elected leader of the DUP, Edwin Poots has entered party headquarters tonight looking very sullen as those crisis talks got under way.\nThere is real anger across all levels of the party over what has unfolded in the last 24 hours. \nIt would be wrong to assume this anger isn't going to lead to a vote of no confidence in Mr Poots at the meeting of party officers, currently taking place. \nIf there is a vote of no confidence and Mr Poots loses it, that doesn't necessarily mean he is out as party leader. \nIt will be over to the 130-strong party executive to decide what happens, and that's scheduled to meet again next Thursday. \nThat has MLAs, MPs, peers and members of the constituency associations all coming together. \nWhile a special sitting of the assembly took place at 12:00 BST to nominate the first and deputy first ministers, former first minister Arlene Foster tweeted to say she hoped everyone was enjoying their day.\nOfficially nominating Mr Givan, Mr Poots said the assembly needed more people like him to win for unionism. \nSinn F\u00e9in's Conor Murphy said the new executive would face many challenges but that Ms O'Neill was a strong and dedicated leader. \nAccepting the nomination, Mr Givan said Mr Poots was a leader \"who had a big heart for the people around him\". \nMs O'Neill said the new executive's top priority was its response to the Covid crisis, the continued successful rollout of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme, and rebuilding the economy.\nWhen Arlene Foster stood down as first minister on Monday, Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle O'Neill also lost her position as deputy first minister because the roles are a joint office. \nThey then had seven days to nominate replacements. \nMr Poots had named Mr Givan as its pick to replace Mrs Foster, while Sinn F\u00e9in said Ms O'Neill would resume her post as deputy first minister.\nBut Sinn F\u00e9in had wanted commitments from the DUP over a timetable for implementing Irish language legislation, as set out in the New Decade, New Approach deal that restored power sharing in January 2020. \nThe party said this was not forthcoming, and it called on Mr Lewis to bring in Irish language legislation via Westminster. \nMr Poots has said he was committed to implementing all of the NDNA commitments, including those around Irish language, but not necessarily before the end of the current assembly mandate in May 2022. \nWhen a deal was reached in the early hours of Thursday, Mr Lewis said he was \"disappointed\" the Stormont executive had not brought Irish language legislation forward in the assembly.\n\"However, following my intensive negotiations with the parties over the last few days, I can confirm that if the executive has not progressed legislation by the end of September, the UK government will take the legislation through Parliament in Westminster,\" he said.\n\"If that becomes necessary, we will introduce legislation in October 2021.\"\nMr Lewis said later on Thursday that Mr Poots was aware that he was agreeing to the possibility that Westminster would step in and legislate on Irish language commitments. \n\"Edwin Poots was very clear that he would be nominating a first minister understanding that we will be legislating in October for a package, a balanced package, exactly as per NDNA, which both parties signed up to,\" he said. \n\"Mr Poots was very clear that should be delivered at Stormont. I agree with that. That's why I've given that space to allow the executive to look at delivering that here through the executive.\"\nMr Poots said his party had not been \"shirking away\" from NDNA, and said there was \"a lot in the cultural package for unionism\".\nHe said the pandemic was the reason Irish language legislation had not been implemented.\n\"If anybody thought that it should have been prioritised ahead of that - that would have been very foolish,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday. \n\"In terms of actually dealing with all of the issues contained within [New Decade New Approach], quite a number of those have not been implemented as a result of Covid-19.\"\nMs McDonald said Irish speakers had been waiting for 15 years for basic rights and recognition, which was important for wider society because power-sharing was \"based on inclusion, respect and equality\".\n\"On this basis of what has been agreed I am happy to confirm that Sinn F\u00e9in will nominate Michelle O'Neill as deputy first minister and will participate fully in the five-party executive,\" she said.\n\"We have a huge amount of work ahead of us as we come out of Covid and as we continue to rebuild the economy, get people back to work and tackle hospital waiting lists.\" \nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood welcomed the commitment to legislate for the cultural package, but said he was disappointed that reportedly intensive negotiations had resulted in no progress on funding hospital waiting lists, addressing the challenges of the Northern Ireland protocol or investing in the economy. \n\"If we're serious about transforming this place, we need to get real about addressing those challenges,\" he said.\nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie told the assembly that he did not want to see \"ransom politics\" holding politicians to account.\n\"What I want to see is collaborative politics, where we all see the problem in front of us, where we all work to try and find a solution,\" Mr Beattie said. \nAlliance Party leader and Justice Minister Naomi Long said she was \"disappointed\" as parties signed up to NDNA on the understanding it would be fulfilled. \n\"It seems like a very immature type of politics that we have to rely on him [Brandon Lewis] to do that [legislate for Irish language] because we can't stand over the decisions that we make,\" said Ms Long. \nTraditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said the day's events marked the \"first big humiliation and failure of Edwin Poots' leadership\".\n\"This is the portent of things to come as once more Sinn F\u00e9in rule prevails, with the DUP the onlooking bridesmaid,\" he said.\nTaoiseach (Irish prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin said the stability of Northern Ireland's executive was critical for peace and security in Northern Ireland.\nLast week, the NI Executive outlined a number of indicative dates, including relaxing the ban on live music.\nThe executive met on Thursday afternoon, but ministers delayed easing further restrictions to an indicative date of 5 July, with another review due to take place on 1 July.

      "tags": "Children,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination",
      "text": "A decision to vaccinate all 12 to 17-year-old children against Covid is unlikely to be recommended by UK vaccine experts imminently, the BBC has been told.\nCertain groups of children may still be offered a Covid jab - but not all.\nA statement from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is expected in the coming days.\nThe government will then make a final decision on whether teenagers will be included in the mass rollout.\nVaccinating all over-18s with a first dose and two-thirds of adults with a second dose by 19 July is the latest target set by the UK government.\nThere has been much speculation over whether children were going to be included in the UK's vaccination programme against Covid-19 after regulator the MHRA approved Pfizer's use in 12 to 15-year-olds recently.\nBut the JCVI - the committee of UK vaccine experts which advises the government on the best approach - has not yet made any formal recommendation on the matter.\nCurrent advice is that 16 to 18-year-olds can be offered a Pfizer jab if they are in a priority group, or live with someone who has a weakened immune system.\nThe committee may be waiting for more safety data on children who have been vaccinated in other countries, such as the US and Israel, before making its decision.\nThe MHRA's approval was based on trials of the Pfizer vaccine in 2,200 adolescents in the US which showed it was safe and effective, but this is a relatively small number.\nAt the same time, the UK's stock of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is being prioritised for adults aged 18 to 40 - who are not being offered AstraZeneca - meaning supplies available for children are currently low.\nHowever, for the experts there are a whole host of factors to consider, including the benefits and risks for children, as well as other wider ethical issues. \nChildren's risk of severe disease from Covid is tiny, deaths are extremely rare and have only occurred in UK children with profound underlying and life-limiting conditions. The direct benefits to them of vaccination would be low.\nSome people question whether it's morally right to vaccinate children in the UK, when so many millions of other people in the rest of the world are still unvaccinated.\nOn the other hand, vaccinating children could reduce infections across society, help protect adults and the vulnerable who are most at risk, and keep schools open.\n\"This is a very finely balanced issue and a difficult decision,\" says Prof Calum Semple, professor of outbreak medicine and child health from the University of Liverpool, who is also a member of the scientific advisory group, Sage.\nHe said he was \"veering towards not vaccinating children\" because of the need to get the vaccine into the arms of more hard-to-reach adults instead.\n\"The virus is spreading in schools because it's got nowhere else to hide at the moment,\" Prof Semple said, adding that improved ventilation in classrooms was much more of a priority than masks in schools.\nVaccinating children would be \"mainly to protect public health and reduce transmission\", he added.\nIt's possible the government is not rushing any decision because it wants to see the impact of vaccinating all adults in the UK on virus cases, which have been rising steadily since the end of May.\nA target of giving two doses to two-thirds of the UK's adult population was set by the prime minister on Monday - but that is principally the over-40s, who are due to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThere are concerns there are not enough Pfizer or Moderna vaccines to start vaccinating younger age groups any earlier.\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"No decisions have yet been made on whether people aged 12 to 17 should be routinely offered Covid-19 vaccines.\n\"We will be guided by our expert advisers, and the government has asked the JCVI for its formal recommendation. We will update in due course.\""

      "text": "Dominic Cummings has published expletive-laden messages, apparently from Boris Johnson, in which the PM calls the health secretary \"hopeless\".\nIt is the latest salvo in a bitter war of words between Mr Cummings, the PM's former top aide, and Matt Hancock over the handling of the pandemic.\nDowning Street did not deny the authenticity of the messages.\nBut the PM's official spokesman insisted Mr Johnson has full confidence in the health secretary.\nIn a 7,000-word blog, Mr Cummings accused Mr Hancock of trying to rewrite history during a select committee hearing last week which was examining how the government has managed various aspects of the crisis.\nHe also took aim at Mr Johnson, claiming he had \"lied about failures\" during the government's initial response to the pandemic.\n\"If No 10 is prepared to lie so deeply and widely about such vital issues of life and death last year, it cannot be trusted now either on Covid or any other crucial issue of war and peace,\" Mr Cummings wrote.\nMr Cummings told MPs three weeks ago that the health secretary had lied to the prime minister about testing hospital patients before they were released into care homes at the start of the pandemic - something firmly denied by Mr Hancock.\nA source close to Mr Hancock said: \"The health secretary answered many of Mr Cummings' claims at a lengthy session in front of MPs. \n\"Mr Cummings has still failed to provide evidence to substantiate his claims. \n\"The health secretary continues to work with the prime minister on the vaccine programme and getting us out of this pandemic as quickly as possible.\"\nMr Cummings, who was forced out of Downing Street last year, claims the version of events given to the committee by Mr Hancock was \"fiction\".\nThe former aide appears to have kept WhatsApp messages from his time in government and selected six to share with readers of his blog.\nOne of them appears to show an exchange between Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings on 27 March last year.\nMr Cummings highlights the ramping up of testing capacity in the US and criticises Mr Hancock for saying he was \"sceptical\" about meeting a target.\nMr Johnson purportedly responds: \"Totally [expletive] hopeless.\"\nMr Cummings also published another private message about the struggle to procure ventilators for Covid-19 patients.\n\"It's Hancock. He has been hopeless,\" a contact appearing to be Mr Johnson replies on 27 March last year.\nIn another message, on 27 April last year, the prime minister appears to call the situation around personal protective equipment (PPE) \"a disaster\" and alludes to diverting some responsibilities to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove.\n\"I can't think of anything except taking Hancock off and putting Gove on,\" Mr Johnson apparently adds.\nMr Johnson's official spokesman said he was \"not going to be drawn on these claims\", adding that the prime minister has \"worked very closely with the health secretary and continues to do so\". \nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told Mr Hancock in a Commons debate that he had been \"forever branded Hopeless Hancock by his own leader\".\nThe party's deputy leader Angela Rayner said a public inquiry into the pandemic promised for next spring was now needed \"as quickly as possible\".\nMr Cummings suggests in his blog that any inquiry would not \"start for years\" as it was \"designed to punt the tricky parts until after this PM has gone\".\n\"Unlike other PMs, this one has a clear plan to leave at the latest a couple of years after the next election, he wants to make money and have fun not 'go on and on',\" writes Mr Cummings. \nBut with the Conservatives riding high in the opinion polls, there is no incentive for the party's MPs to move against Mr Johnson, despite the \"systemic incompetence\" surrounding him, he adds. \nDowning Street rejected the claim that Mr Johnson planned to stand down after the next election, saying: \"The PM has actually been asked this before and said it's utter nonsense, so that still stands.\"\nLet's start with a quick political quiz.\nQ: Who has the safest job in cabinet?\nA: Matt Hancock\nQ: Why?\nA: Because Dominic Cummings wants him sacked.\nBoris Johnson's spokesman said the PM had full confidence in the health secretary.\nHe could say little else - as he won't be sacking him at the urging of a disgruntled former aide.\nIf he did, that would suggest that Dominic Cummings was right, about what he thinks were failures over PPE, ventilators and testing, early in the pandemic.\nAnd if Mr Hancock goes now, Labour would ask why he wasn't dismissed sooner.\nMr Cummings makes serious allegations about the handling of the Covid crisis.\nBut by continually suggesting that Matt Hancock is the very personification of government errors, he may be making it a little too easy for his detractors to portray his interventions as a grudge match.\nAnd by denouncing not just the Department of Health and Social Care but the Cabinet Office too, you get the impression that Mr Cummings felt that very few people could come up to his standards.\nMr Cummings's own credibility, of course, still remains dented due to last year's lockdown drive to Durham.\nBut his latest dossier does raise questions of ministers well ahead of the formal inquiry, and provides ammunition to an opposition which has questioned the pace at which the government moved.\nGiving evidence to MPs last week, Mr Hancock said he had seen no evidence to suggest any medical staff had died because of a lack of PPE.\nIn his blog, Mr Cummings accuses the health secretary of trying to blame NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and the Cabinet Office for last April's \"PPE disaster\".\n\"The lack of PPE killed NHS and care home staff in March-May,\" he writes.\nHe claims Number 10 and Mr Hancock had \"repeatedly lied about the failures last year\" and accuses them of now trying to \"rewrite history\", with the prime minister \"encouraging ministers to give false accounts to Parliament\".\nMr Cummings goes on to criticise Mr Johnson's management style. \nIn one section he contrasts Mr Johnson's approach with that of Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who stood in for the PM when he was in hospital with coronavirus.\nHe said meetings with Mr Raab at the helm were \"less pleasant for everybody but much more productive\". He said this was because Mr Raab \"can chair meetings properly instead of telling rambling stories and jokes\".\nHe went on to say that \"as soon as things get 'a bit embarrassing' [Boris Johnson] does the whole 'let's take it offline' shtick before shouting 'forward to victory', doing a thumbs-up and pegging it out of the room before anybody can disagree\".\nDowning Street said it was \"not going to engage\" with this claim.\nAnd on Thursday, Treasury minister Jesse Norman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I think this is some of the biggest nonsense I've heard.\n\"The prime minister obviously, as anybody would detect, is a massive supporter of the health secretary.\n\"He's coming firmly behind him. There can be no question of loss of confidence.\"\nMr Cummings published the alleged leaks on Substack, an online platform that allows people to charge for newsletters. \nHe has said he plans to charge subscribers for insider information on subjects other than the pandemic."

      "tags": "Nadhim Zahawi,Boris Johnson,Nick Thomas-Symonds,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Lockdown restrictions in England will be extended by up to four weeks after MPs backed the government in a Commons vote by 461 to 60. \nIt means the regulations can stay in place until 19 July, despite a large Tory rebellion against the move. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs ahead of the vote there has been a \"significant change\" that has given the virus \"extra legs\".\nLabour supported the delay but said it did so \"with a heavy heart\". \nOn Monday, Boris Johnson said delaying the planned lifting of restrictions would give the NHS \"a few more crucial weeks\" to get people vaccinated.\nThe decision means pubs, clubs and theatres will still have to operate within capacity limits and nightclubs will remain closed.\nAnd limits remain on how many people can meet up, with groups of up to 30 allowed to gather outdoors and up to six people or two households allowed indoors, although weddings will be exempt. \nSeveral Conservative MPs expressed their unhappiness with the plans and 51 voted against the government. \nFormer Conservative minister, Mark Harper, who chairs the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, said: \"My worry, and the worry of others, is we're going to get to this point in four weeks' time and we're just going to be back here all over again extending the restrictions.\"\nSenior Tory Sir Desmond Swayne said ministers' response to the rising cases was disproportionate and a threat to civil liberties.\n\"I always thought it was wrong for them to take our freedoms, even though they believed that they were acting in our best interests in an emergency, but by any measure that emergency has now passed and yet freedoms are still withheld, and the government will not allow us to assess for ourselves the risks that we are prepared to encounter in our ordinary everyday lives,\" he said. \nFormer cabinet minister Dame Andrea Leadsom said while she would reluctantly back the government in the vote, she urged ministers to show some \"flexibility\" and if possible lift restrictions after two weeks rather than four. \nOn weddings, she said: \"For many couples being able to hug, but not dance, you can't have a band, you've got to socially distance, that's not the kind of big day that they wanted for themselves and their families, so can he reconsider this?\"\nSchool and university students, she added, \"are now faced for the second year in a row with no end-of-year celebrations\".\nOpening the debate, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said pausing step 4 of the roadmap out of restrictions was a \"difficult but essential decision\".\nHe said figures showed the Delta variant now accounts for 96% of new cases and the number of infections was rising - with hospitalisations up 48% over the past week.\nHe added: \"We don't yet know the extent to which the link between hospitalisation and deaths has been broken so we propose to give the NHS a few more crucial weeks to get those remaining jabs into the arms of those who need them.\" \nAnd he said the government's objective was \"not to eradicate\" the virus, he said, because \"that is not possible\" but rather to aim \"to live with it\" like we do with flu.\nAnd he said the delay to 19 July would enable \"a majority\" of the over-40s to have two doses of the vaccine.  \nThe government easily won the vote thanks to Labour's support.\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said lifting all restrictions now \"could be akin to throwing petrol on a fire\" and it was essential to listen to the warnings from health professionals and help relieve the pressure on hospitals. \nBut he added: \"We are only here because over the last eight weeks we have failed to contain the Delta variant and have allowed it to become dominant.\"\nMPs also voted to back a range of other measures, such as extending the wearing of face coverings on public transport to 19 July."

      "tags": "Hospitality industry",
      "text": "A ban on landlords evicting firms for unpaid commercial rent is being extended for another nine months.\nThe ban, which stops landlords taking tenants to court for non-payment, was due to end on 30 June.\nTreasury Secretary Stephen Barclay said the delay in easing lockdown restrictions, announced on Monday, \"present additional challenges\" to business.\nIt is estimated that firms in retail and hospitality are \u00a35bn in rent debt.\nWhile retailers and hospitality firms welcomed the measures, landlords voiced dismay and again warned that some profitable tenants were abusing the ban to avoid paying rent they can afford.\nMr Barclay told the Commons: \"Existing measures will remain in place, including extending the current moratorium to protect commercial tenants from eviction to March 25, 2022,\" Mr Barclay told the Commons.\nHe also announced plans for a binding arbitration scheme to resolve disputes between landlords and commercial tenants. Mr Barclay said the scheme should be in place for when the eviction ban is lifted.\nHe said the measures \"strike the right balance\" between protecting landlords and supporting businesses most in need.\nBut Mr Barclay added: \"To be clear, all tenants should start to pay rent again in accordance with the terms of their lease or as otherwise agreed with their landlord as soon as restrictions are removed on their sector if they are not already doing so.\"\nThousands of companies, especially in the hospitality sector, are still unable to trade normally, among them nightclubs and leisure firms.\nIn April last year the government blocked legal attempts to evict shops, restaurants and other businesses that had stopped paying rent, as part of emergency measures to soften the economic impact of the pandemic.\nHospitality leaders had called for an extension of the moratorium and for more financial support from the government.\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said plans to remove remaining pandemic restrictions on 21 June have been pushed back to 19 July amid concerns over the spread of the Delta variant, which was first identified in India.\nLast week, the chief executives of trade groups UK Hospitality and British Retail Consortium (BRC) told MPs that both sectors have accrued a combined \u00a35bn in rent debt.\nData for the first quarter of 2021 shows that only 74% of rent was collected by landlords 60 days following the end of the period after tenants were battered by the pandemic.\nHospitality, leisure and retail operators have also benefited from a business rates holiday since the start of the crisis.\nHelen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, many of whose members have felt lockdown most acutely, said the extension comes \"in the nick of time\".\nShe said: \"Just as retailers feared a wave of legal action by landlords, the government has stepped in to offer both landlords and tenants more time to negotiate. Retailers need time to trade their way out of debt; this announcement does exactly that.\"\nThe Institute of Directors (IoD) also said firms across the country would welcome the extension, but the Treasury could have gone further. \nDr Roger Barker, the IoD's director of policy, said: \"This is only one element of the cliff edge that we have been calling on government to address. \n\"At the end of this month businesses will still face the tapering off of furlough and business rates relief, and the suspension of wrongful trading liability. The government must hold its nerve and push out its business support measures until the job is properly done.\"\nHowever, landlords were critical of the measures, with Melanie Leech, chief executive of the British Property Federation, saying: \"The government has failed to recognise that commercial property owners are essential to the health of our town centres - to creating economic growth, jobs and opportunity.\"\nShe said the majority of property owners had already reached agreement with their tenants on rent, and millions of pounds have been provided to the most vulnerable tenants in the sectors most impacted by Covid-19. \"That support will continue in light of the delay in the recovery roadmap for those businesses that need it,\" Ms Leach said.\n\"Another blanket extension to the moratoriums will provide further opportunity for those well-capitalised businesses who can afford to pay rent, but are refusing to do so, to continue their abuse of government and property owners' support and will cast a long shadow over future investment to build back better,\" she said.\nThe ban on tenant evictions was just one of the government support measures that is due to start wearing off on 1 July. A business rate holiday will end with firms asked to pay 33% of their normal bill - rising to 100% by next March, while government contributions to furloughed staff wages will drop by 10% with employers making up the difference. \nExtending these two measures would be very expensive for the government - extending an eviction ban costs it nothing - leaving the bomb in the lap of the landlord. \nThe government insisted the extension to March would allow new legislation to be drafted to create an arbitration system to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.\nLandlords big and small point out that they will have received no income from anyone who didn't want to pay (even if they could) for two years by next March. Support for them has largely come in the form of forbearance from their own banks whose patience may begin to run out. \nMany also point out that the process of investment and repurposing commercial business premises for a post pandemic age will fall to them.\nWhile many businesses will breathe a sigh of relief that landlord's knock at the door can be ignored for another nine months, someone will be left holding a rent arrears bomb - and the government is keen it's not them.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": " The rate at which coronavirus infection is falling in the UK - as measured by the R number - has continued to level off. \nThe latest R estimate from the government's scientific advisory group Sage, is between 0.7 and 0.9, up slightly from the week before.\nIt means that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between seven and nine other people.\nThe R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread. \nR is the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average.\nMeasles has an R number of 15 in populations without immunity. \nThat means, on average, one person will spread measles to 15 others. \nCoronavirus - known officially as Sars-CoV-2 - would have a reproduction number of about three if no action was taken to stop it spreading.\nYou can't capture the moment people are infected. Instead, scientists work backwards.  \nData - such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus over time - is used to estimate how easily the virus is spreading. \nIf the R value is higher than one, then the number of cases keeps increasing.\nBut if the R number is lower the disease will eventually stop spreading, because not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.\nGovernments everywhere want to force the R number down from about three (the R number if we took no action) to below one.\nThe R number is not fixed. Instead, it changes as our behaviour changes or as immunity develops. \nMathematical modellers at Imperial College London attempted to track how the number changed as isolation, social distancing and the full lockdown were introduced in spring of 2020. \nBefore any measures came in, the R number was well above one and the conditions were ripe for a large outbreak. Successive restrictions brought it down, but it was not until full lockdown that it was driven below one. \nAlthough the R number across the UK is now between 0.7 and 0.9, there are regional differences.\nScotland's estimated R number is between 0.8 and 1.0, up slightly on the previous week.\nIn Wales the number is between 0.6 and 0.9 - while in Northern Ireland it remains between 0.75 and 0.95.\nIn England, the number is risen slightly to between 0.8 and 1.0.\nThe R number is one of the big three.\nAnother is severity - some people have a very mild disease that does not cause many problems. But coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, can be severe and deadly. \nThe last is the number of cases, which is important for deciding when to act. If you have a high number, but ease restrictions so the reproduction number is about one, then you will continue to have a high number of cases.\nA vaccination programme, like the one currently under way in the UK, is another way to bring down the reproduction number.\nA coronavirus patient would naturally infect three others on average, but if a vaccine could protect two of them from infection, then the reproduction number would fall from three to one."

struck in January 2020 - was the \"only model for success\".\nAfter meeting Mr Lewis on Monday night, Ms McDonald said government intervention was the \"only way forward to finally resolve\" the dispute over Irish language legislation.\nShe said Sinn F\u00e9in had declined an earlier offer from the UK government to legislate at Westminster because its preference was for the matter to be dealt with at Stormont.\n\"We have engaged intensively with the DUP and with party leader Edwin Poots,\" said Ms McDonald.\n\"He has told us that they will not be delivering [an Irish language act] in this mandate.\n\"This legislation was negotiated a year-and-a-half ago and it is now incumbent on the British and Irish governments to act.\"\nThe 2020 deal as part of the New Decade, New Approach (NDNA) agreement, included an Office of Identity and Cultural Expression, an Irish language commissioner and a commissioner to enhance and develop the language and culture of the Ulster-Scots/Ulster-British tradition.\nAlliance Party leader Naomi Long accused the DUP of refusing to show \"any sort of compromise or ability to work with others\".\n\"It's apparent that some parties now see this change of leadership in the DUP as an opportunity to renegotiate, reposition themselves and create a crisis where none is necessary,\" Mrs Long told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"We all signed up to NDNA knowing that there were parts of that agreement that would be more difficult, would be more challenging, but we knew that it had to be done.\n\"All we need to do is move on, get the Irish language act underway, stop messing around and breaking promises and get on with the real business of government.\"\nHowever, Mr Wilson, DUP chief whip at Westminster, said: \"To force through the latest Sinn F\u00e9in wish list will cause further damage to the credibility of the Northern Ireland Assembly.\n\"Rather than running to Her Majesty's Government when they can't get their way, republicans should respect our mandate. \n\"Sinn F\u00e9in is playing the politics of ransom and are placing culture above health, education and economic recovery.\"\n In July 2019, when Stormont was suspended, MPs at Westminster backed amendments to liberalise abortion and extend same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland.\nMr Wilson said this \"only served to undermine devolution\".\nDUP Education Minister Michelle McIlveen said she would not be \"particularly happy\" about the secretary of state intervening to pass Irish language legislation at Westminster.\nSpeaking during a visit to a school in Belfast - her first engagement since taking over the role -  she accused Sinn F\u00e9in of prioritising Irish language commitments \"above all else\".\n\"This is a devolved matter - the secretary of state has gotten himself involved in previous issues but this is about the devolution package and how that's being respected,\" she added. \nExplaining the latest developments in Northern Irish politics to people who live here is sometimes hard enough - never mind to people who don't\nSinn F\u00e9in's appeal to the British government to bypass Stormont and legislate for the Irish language directly is such a moment. \nThis from the party who warned against the introduction of direct rule for the three years Stormont was suspended is quite a move.\nPragmatism or hypocrisy? You decide and many will.\nEven more astonishing is the claim that Westminster offered to do it weeks ago and Sinn F\u00e9in turned them down, believing it could be sorted at home.\nThe fact they've changed their minds shows that things between the party and the new DUP leadership could, shall we say, be better.\nIt's also a sure sign that Sinn F\u00e9in, no more than the DUP, want a collapse they would ship their fair share of blame for from an increasingly unforgiving public.\nAnother one for the pages of that still unwritten book \"Stormont, you couldn't make it up\".\nAlso speaking to Good Morning Ulster, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said all of the NDNA commitments needed to be delivered \"urgently\", adding: \"That includes the Irish language legislation, it includes other cultural legislation in the agreement.\"\nHowever, Mr Eastwood said it would be \"absolutely wrong\" to bring the executive down over the issue.\nInstead he said he and his fellow SDLP MP Claire Hanna would seek to legislate on the Irish language at Westminster.\nHe said if the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in could not reach a solution he would attempt to amend a bill related to Northern Ireland that is currently making its way through the House of Commons\nOn Monday Mr Poots said \"time will tell\" whether the implementation of the deal would happen in the existing Northern Ireland Assembly term, which is due to expire in April 2022.\nHe added that it was not appropriate for Sinn F\u00e9in to set preconditions on nominating a first and deputy first minister.\n\"It's not respecting someone's mandate... I'm not setting preconditions to the selection of Sinn Fein's deputy first minister,\" he said.\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly has the power to make laws in any area that isn't \"reserved\" to Westminster.\nReserved matters include things such as defence, income tax and making foreign treaties.\nAny matter that is not a reserved matter is devolved.\nThe Northern Ireland Act - which established the assembly - allows the NI secretary to make any devolved matter a reserved matter, or vice versa, using a legislative instrument known as an Order in Council.\nHowever in the case of the language and cultural package agreed as part of the New Decade, New Approach deal in January 2020, it was specifically stated that the legislation would be established as new dedicated parts of the Northern Ireland Act.\nThis meant it was always going to require passage at Westminster at some stage of the process.\nHowever it will still be up to Stormont to implement the legislation in practice."

      "tags": "Manchester,Cheshire,Manchester Arena attack inquiry",
      "text": "Paul Price does not know how close he was to death on the night of the Manchester Arena bombing.\nThough he remained awake in the horrific minutes that followed, he has barely any memory of it, and for that he is grateful.\nHis injuries were catastrophic, a seemingly endless catalogue of destruction from which his body will never fully recover.\nDozens of surgeries. Shrapnel still embedded in his body. Permanent loss of function in his hand and leg. Weekly painful rehab sessions. \nBut nothing compares to the loss of his partner Elaine McIver, who was among the 22 people killed when suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated his home-made device.\n\"She was the love of my life, I was the love of her life\", he said.\nFor a long time he could not bring himself to talk about her. \n\"It was just too upsetting,\" he said.\n\"And I'm ashamed to say it, but for such a long time I remember thinking my hurt was so much that I thought if someone could give me a tablet and I could forget about her, I'd be OK.\n\"Now her memory to me is a blessing and I love talking about her. And I'm glad of that.\"\nMs McIver was a detective constable who had worked for Cheshire Police and the North West regional crime unit Titan. \nShe was 43 when she died - off duty and with Mr Price to collect his daughter from the Ariana Grande concert.\nMr Price describes how much pride she took in her work and how proud she was to be a police officer, helping to keep people safe. \nIt has only made it harder to learn about failings in security in May 2017, which he believes made it \"easy\" for the bomber to slip through the net, unchallenged by anyone in authority. \nOn Thursday, the first findings from the inquiry will be made public. The report will focus on the security arrangements at the arena, and is likely to be critical.\nMr Price said: \"They all say we will learn from this... I don't know. \n\"The failings go back a long time, so many missed chances and it's hard to hear.\n\"There were failings on the night but the weeks, months before made it easy for him and it shouldn't have been so easy.\"\nOn the night Abedi murdered Ms McIver and 21 others, he hid for nearly an hour in a CCTV blind spot in the foyer of the Manchester Arena - a public area connected to the railway station next door.\nIt was a spot the bomber had planned carefully in repeated hostile reconnaissance trips over previous days. \nIt was here he waited as parents and families gathered to collect loved ones leaving the concert, and it was here that he walked into the crowd at 22:31 BST and blew himself up.\nHours of CCTV examined by the inquiry show Abedi earlier walking around the station, bent under the weight of his bulging rucksack, and at one point fiddling with wires sticking out of his clothes.  \nMr Price said he has felt particularly upset by revelations at the inquiry about the behaviour of British Transport Police (BTP), who were responsible for policing the station and foyer areas.\nHe has learned that against instructions, there was no police officer stationed in the foyer for the end of the concert. \n\"I didn't want to be let down by BTP, but I was,\" he said.\n\"And I think that hurt more than anything because Elaine was a police officer.\"\nThough they raced to help after the bomb went off, the officers on duty that night have been criticised for their behaviour in the hours leading up to the atrocity - including a two-hour dinner break and a 10-mile round trip to buy a kebab. \nAt one point, when Abedi took his final trip through the station to his hiding place in the foyer, there were no BTP officers on duty in the area at all.  \nMr Price said: \"After the explosion there was heroics and you know, they stepped up, but the failings before the explosion were unforgivable as far as I'm concerned. \n\"They were there to protect, and they weren't there.\" \nBTP has accepted the attack happened on its watch and it let the public down, but it says its officers did act with heroism following the explosion.  \nBut it was not only BTP who were responsible for keeping people safe in that area. Arena operators SMG and its contracted event security providers Showsec also shared responsibility. \nFor Mr Price, he feels there has been a sense of blame being shifted and an unwillingness by corporations to admit failings in their preparedness for an attack of this kind. \nHe said: \"I was disappointed in SMG and Showsec to begin with, because they just seemed to be passing the buck between one another.\n\"I thought - just admit the failings and try and learn from it. But it just seemed to be that they just didn't want the blame on them.\"\nSMG, Showsec and British Transport Police have all accepted shortcomings in their risk assessments. \nBut SMG said other accusations that it prioritised profit over safety were unfair, while Showsec said its own errors did not contribute to the bombing. \nToday will be yet another difficult day for Mr Price and all those impacted by the atrocity at Manchester Arena. \nMeanwhile, he is still working on his recovery and trying to look forwards.\nHe said: \"For such a long time I thought I could never be happy again, I felt life was a prison sentence I had to endure... the world seems a lonely place now, and frightening for me. \n\"But you know, I can see glimmers of light now... I am still alive, I've got to live my life for my kids, for everyone who's helped me.\n\"A lot of people have invested a lot of time in me to get me back on my feet. I can't let them down, and I can't let Elaine down.\"\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram? You can also send story ideas to northwest.newsonline@bbc.co.uk"

      "title": "Care services too focused on investigating families in crisis, says review",
      "tags": "Department of Health & Social Care,Social care,Child protection",
      "text": "Child protection services in England are too focused on investigating families in crisis and do not provide enough early support, a report says.\nAn independent review of council-run children's social care said services to protect vulnerable children were in urgent need of investment and reform. \nIt concluded that with an increasing demand for help, the current system was unsustainable and failing young people.\nThe government, which set up the review, said it was boosting funding.\nOver the last three months, the review team has heard from more than 1,000 young people, families and staff working in children's services. \nIt found a system under significant strain with an increasing number of families being investigated, more children in care and costs spiralling. \nJosh MacAlister, who chaired the independent review, said: \"If we carry on like this, children's social care will both become more expensive and continue to be inadequate in the support it gives to children and families, so we need to change.\" \nThe report said deprivation was a key factor among families needing help. Many of those who asked for support found assessments and investigations added to their stress. \nThe number of inquiries into whether a child is at risk of significant harm - known as section 47 inquiries - has more than doubled since 2010, rising to 201,000 investigations in a year. \nBut the report said 135,000 of those led to no child protection plan. It concluded that concerns about risk have dominated. \nOfficial figures also show that in 2019-20 there were more than 80,000 children in the care of local authorities in England, up 24% in a decade. \nThe review team looked at the availability and costs of foster care places and children's homes. It concluded this \"placement market\" was broken and that too often young people ended up being moved a long way from home.\n\"Too often children are moved far from where they have grown up, are separated from their brothers or sisters, are forced to move schools, and have a revolving door of social workers,\" the report said.\n\"We are failing to build lifelong loving relationships around these children.\" \nWith council budgets squeezed over the last 10 years, spending has increasingly focused on expensive crisis services that local authorities are legally required to provide. That has meant cuts to early help for families.  \nAt High Trees Family Centre in Hertfordshire, the county council provides the sort of wide-ranging support that the review team believes is vital. In one place, all local families can access health and care services along with playgroups.  \nChelsea, whose one-year-old daughter Darcie is happily playing with paints, said there should be more play sessions like this.\n\"It is very important for the mum and the baby,\" she said. \"It means the mum can meet new friends and get advice and tips.\"\nSammy Lewis works with pregnant mothers and under-ones at the centre. She said that because the centre was open to everyone, it was easy for parents to ask for help and made a real difference to those who were struggling.\n\"That can help to prevent the need for additional support later down the line and they can feel more happy and confident about family life,\" she said.\nThe independent review will publish its final report, making recommendations for change, next spring. \nNSPCC chief executive Sir Peter Wanless said the review should seize a \"once-in-a-generation opportunity\" to create \"a comprehensive, properly-funded care system that works for every child and family who needs it, regardless of their background or where they live\".\nMark Russell, chief executive at The Children's Society, said children's social care was \"hamstrung\" by under-investment and bureaucracy, too often intervened only at \"crisis point\", and had \"serious systemic flaws\" including a lack of understanding of threats outside the home.\n\"Covid has left more children at risk of abuse, exploitation, isolation, mental ill-health and poverty,\" he said, with vulnerable older children being failed as they enter adulthood.\nThe government said it was giving councils an extra \u00a316m to target more support earlier in the lives of children already in the care system. It is also planning a pilot scheme to increase educational help.\nChildren and families minister Vicky Ford said: \"For children in care, or those who are known to social care teams, it is absolutely vital we help them to overcome the barriers they can face in education so that they have the best chance to succeed in life.\"\nTulip Siddiq, Labour's shadow minister for children and early years, said: \"After failing to ban unregulated accommodation for all children in care, there is no evidence that ministers will deliver the reforms that are needed to stop vulnerable young people fall through the cracks.\"\nDirectors who run council care services said that while the child protection system in England was one of the safest in the world, the report represented a once-in-a-generation chance to make meaningful and lasting change for children and young people.

      "tags": "South Carolina,Capital punishment,United States",
      "text": "A high court in the US state of South Carolina has blocked two executions until the inmates are given the choice of death by electrocution or firing squad. \nA new law requires inmates on death row to decide between the two methods if lethal drugs are not available.\nBut as prison authorities have not yet formed a firing squad, the executions have been halted by the supreme court.\nInmates Brad Sigmon and Freddie Owens were due to be executed this month.\nThe convicted murderers were denied lethal injections - their favoured option - because prison authorities did not have the drugs needed.\nA shortage of these drugs has led to a 10-year pause in this method of execution in the state.\nThe new law, which came into effect last month, was designed to close a loophole that allowed inmates to indefinitely postpone their executions if the drugs were not available.\nGiven the lack of a firing squad, electrocution was the only method of execution available in the state.\nBut lawyers for Sigmon and Owens challenged the use of the method in court, arguing their clients have the right to die by lethal injection.\nThey petitioned the South Carolina Supreme Court to stop the planned executions of their clients until their appeals had been heard.\nOn Wednesday, the court ruled in their favour, saying the inmates had not been given the choice \"to elect the manner of their execution\".\nThe court said no further execution notices should be issued until \"protocols and policies to carry out executions by firing squad\" are in place.\nIn response to the court order, the state's prison authorities said it was \"moving ahead with creating policies and procedures for a firing squad\".\n\"We are looking to other states for guidance through this process. We will notify the court when a firing squad becomes an option for executions,\" the South Carolina Department of Corrections said.\nSouth Carolina is one of four states that allow executions by firing squad. Oklahoma, Mississippi and Utah are the others.\nSigmon, 63, was scheduled to be executed on Friday. He has spent nearly two decades on death row after he was convicted in 2002 of killing his ex-girlfriend's parents with a baseball bat. \nOwens's execution was planned for 25 June. The 43-year-old has been on and off death row since 1999, when he was convicted of murdering a shop worker during a robbery spree."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nConcern about the Delta variant means Covid restrictions in Wales are unlikely to be significantly relaxed until July, the BBC has been told. Ministers have been looking at permitting more people to meet indoors. But Welsh government sources are downplaying expectations ahead of a scheduled announcement by First Minister Mark Drakeford on Friday. With cases rising, sources say there will not be big changes in the rules for the next four weeks.\nEmployers can claim from the furlough scheme for staff who are self-isolating, it has emerged. The little-known entitlement was first reported by Politico's London Playbook after emails from civil servants complaining about government guidance were leaked. It exists despite government guidance stating it is not what the scheme is intended for. One email from a civil servant said the Treasury was \"reluctant\" to say the scheme could be used in such a way.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock has been described as a \"successful genius\" after he was allegedly branded \"hopeless\" in text messages from Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg rallied to Mr Hancock's defence after the PM's former chief aide, Dominic Cummings, released expletive-laden WhatsApp messages on Wednesday criticising the health secretary. Mr Rees-Mogg dismissed them as \"trivia\", adding that Mr Hancock's work during the pandemic had made the world safer. However, Labour accused the government of incompetence in handling Covid.\nHalfords has warned it faces \"acute\" challenges with bike supplies after Covid restrictions led to surging demand and local lockdowns affected manufacturers in Asia. Restrictions in local travel and overseas holidays contributed to a rise in bike sales of 54.1% in the year to 2 April. But global bike supplies have been hampered by shortages of components such as brakes, as well as raw materials. \nThousands of racegoers have combined their finest head-turning millinery with matching face masks for Ladies' Day at Royal Ascot. The five-day horse racing event is open to 12,000 spectators this year after it was held without racegoers last year because of the pandemic. And visitors have been making the most of the occasion.

      "title": "Covid in Scotland: What will the next few months be like?",
      "text": "Scotland has put the brakes on easing Covid restrictions this summer and it is all down to the new Delta variant that first emerged in India. \nWe may have seen it coming but that doesn't stop a familiar anxiety creeping across our shoulders. Despite confident assertions from the first minister that this is just \"a pause\", we have been here before. \nThe good news is that scientists do not seem to be overly worried. \nScotland may have the highest infection rate in Europe but it also has one of the highest vaccination rates and the jabs are doing their job.\nProf Aziz Sheikh is the director of Edinburgh University's Usher Institute for Population Health.  \nHis team has been working with Public Health Scotland to track the pandemic in real time.  \nTheir latest research, published in the Lancet this week, does raise some concerns about the Delta variant.  \nThey found that not only was it more infectious than the Alpha variant, first identified in Kent, but that the risk of hospital admission was double.  \nBut Prof Sheikh says vaccines are providing good levels of protection. \n\"The vaccines overall are still very effective which is fantastic news, and that's both the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine,\" he says. \n\"But there seems to be a bit of a delay with the vaccines exerting their maximum effectiveness, so the key message here is that the second dose is really important, and what we need to do after that is give people a couple of weeks to mount their immune response.\"\nThat's one reason to buy more time.  \nJust over 56% of the adult population in Scotland has had two doses but almost 900,000 people - one in every five adults - are still completely unvaccinated.\nSo keeping existing restrictions will allow many more people the chance to get at least one jab.  \nThe scientists also want time to monitor the data in detail.  \nThere has been an increase in the number of people in hospital over the past few weeks.  \nIt's nothing like the rise we saw in previous waves, and it appears that this time patients tend to be younger, less likely to need intensive care, and stay in for shorter periods - meaning the pressure on the NHS is less intense.  \nA few more weeks of data gathering will allow a clearer picture of what is going to emerge.\nYou could see this wave of infections as a test.  \nBy mid-July we will know how well we've coped and the rest of the summer could look a lot brighter. But that doesn't mean Covid is banished from our lives. \nProf Emma Thomson is an infectious diseases consultant working with Covid patients at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.  \nShe is also one of the leading scientists behind the UK's efforts to identify and monitor new variants and is running a trial in Scotland to investigate the role of booster jags.\nShe compares the role of vaccines to a dam, holding back the virus. \nAs restrictions ease, she says, we're asking the vaccines to work harder to do that and so far they're succeeding.  \nBut we are starting to seeing chinks where the virus is breaking through the dam - with new variants for example -  so it needs to be constantly reinforced.  \nFor now that means speeding up second doses, but as time goes on, scientists will need to continuously adapt the vaccines to plug more holes, and to make sure they maintain the advantage and stop the virus overwhelming us again.   \nProf Thomson says the virus is here to stay in the medium term.  \n\"Most of us think that we are going to be stuck with it, possibly for years to come.,\" she says.\n\"The key thing that we need to do is to get ahead of it.  And if we can get ahead of it with booster vaccines or with adapted vaccines then it becomes something for us to worry about as health professionals, and it becomes less of a major strain on the country.\"\nThat's why sequencing and monitoring new variants is so important.\nAt Glasgow University's Centre for Virus Research, they made an early call to put all other work on hold to do that, last March.  \nProf David Robertson, head of bioinformatics, explains that the Delta variant was introduced to the UK hundreds of times in hundreds of locations, since it was first detected in early April.  \nHe says the speed with which it became the dominant variant took experts by surprise. But the big question now is when and how the next powerful mutation will arise. \n\"What is predictable is that the virus will continue to evolve and the ability to escape the human immune response is inevitable,\" he says. \n\"We really just don't know the timeline that that will emerge on, so it seems wise to proceed on the assumption that worse mutations will emerge sooner rather than later. \n\"It won't be tomorrow, and it's not five years - but it's somewhere in between. \n\"So keeping our surveillance systems in place and making sure not too much virus is circulating seems wise. That's how this will become normal in the longer term.\"\nHopefully it will soon be an issue that only worries the scientists - allowing the rest of society to slowly reset. \nIn the meantime, politicians will have to wrestle with what might be acceptable levels of coronavirus - an equation that gets ever more difficult to answer."

      "tags": "Russia,Vladimir Putin,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "For the first time since Joe Biden took office as US president, he will meet in person with Russian leader Vladimir Putin on Wednesday.\nThe summit in Geneva, Switzerland, comes as both sides have acknowledged relations are at a new low.\nHere's what three young Americans and three young Russians told us about the other country.\nAn independent who strongly aligns with progressive values, Connor is a college student who has been \"very pleased\" with his vote for President Biden so far. \nDo you view Russia as an adversary or potential partner?\nI view the Russian government as an adversary and I believe certain conditions should be met in order for the United States to consider partnering with Putin's Russia.\nThese conditions should require that Russia cease the imprisonment of journalists and opposition leaders. Additionally, Russia must agree to cease aggression with their southern and western neighbours.\nWhat do you think the two countries could work together on?\nWith Russia and the United States having the first and second largest nuclear weapon stockpiles in the world, more joint denuclearisation treaties would be fantastic. I believe this joint mission is very important because it reduces the likelihood of accidents and creates an atmosphere of mutual trust.\nIn the realm of trade, as the North Pole continues to melt, this opens an extremely fast new sea route. It would be great to see the US and Russia jointly ensure the safe passage of trade vessels. \nIs there anything about Russia you admire that the US doesn't have?\nI greatly admire the spirit of the Russian people. They have withstood a dark and strenuous 150 years and have persevered throughout, despite all the while contending with despotic national leadership. \nAmericans and Russians are bonded by a history of revolution, social unrest, and vast technological progress. I hope our shared history can allow us to come to a greater understanding of one another and bring about an era of reconciliation rather than escalation.\nA final year student at Moscow State University, Viktor has aspirations of working as an interpreter in the future. He believes the two countries should be working together on a range of issues.\nDo you view the US as an adversary or potential partner?\nUnfortunately, right now Russia and the US are seen mostly as foes. But I am convinced that our countries can and should become friends. They are two large nuclear powers, who have huge influence over their respective continents. Their cooperation and peaceful coexistence is in the interest of the whole world. \nWhat do you think the two countries could work together on?\nRussia and the US should be cooperating in as many areas as possible. The most important ones, in my view, are military security, arms control and fighting terrorism. But also in education, academic exchange programmes, technology and innovations, and fighting infectious diseases.\nIs there anything about the US you admire that Russia doesn't have?\nI most admire about the US their attitude towards protecting their nature - their national parks, as well as support of internal tourism and creating infrastructure to strengthen it. I also admire how they develop international contacts in the academic sphere and how skilled they are at attracting talent and investment from other countries. \nGabrielle is a moderate Republican who voted for Joe Biden, but has been \"increasingly frustrated\" by his administration's policies and priorities.\nDo you view Russia as an adversary or potential partner?\nPoint blank, Russia and Vladimir Putin are intense adversaries of the United States. The global order is stronger if Russia is fiercely committed to liberal democracy, but it has proved time and time again that is not the case. Instead, it has consistently preyed upon Nato tensions and is looking to expand Russian occupation of Ukraine and the Balkans.\nContinuous cyberattacks, undermining confidence in elections and acts of aggression have proven that Russia has no interest in protecting or working with any country. \nWhat do you think the two countries could work together on?\nGiven the role of Russia as a leading natural gas producer, it is vital that the United States and Russia strive to work together on clean and alternative energy sources. Steps must be taken towards transition for the future wellbeing of both countries and their economies. \nOver reliance on oil is both a national and regional security threat, emphasising the need for global investment and partnership on alternative clean energy sources for continued global prosperity. \nIs there anything about Russia you admire that the US doesn't have?\nWhile its citizens remain fiercely committed to democracy and freedom, the government consistently undermines them. I admire the fire and want for freedom and prosperity of the Russian people, and fiercely condemn the actions and corruption of the Russian government. \nAlena organises media campaigns for charities. She believes Russia and the US should be partners but is sceptical of whether it is possible at present, given the tension between the two countries.\nDo you view the US as an adversary or potential partner?\nI am a pacifist and I'm against the escalation of geopolitical tensions, so I would say the US is a friend. If we, Russia, work at building friendly contacts with the US, and they do the same towards us, then our mutual cooperation will at the very least decrease international tension. \nWhat do you think the two countries could work together on?\nFirst of all, on nuclear disarmament, on the development of technology and on cooperation in space, but also in science and education.\nIs there anything about the US you admire that Russia doesn't have?\nI can't answer this very easily, as I follow European politics and the countries of the EU more closely.\nGordon is an aerospace engineer in Salt Lake City and a conservative voter who says he feels optimistic about the state of American politics.\nDo you view Russia as an adversary or potential partner?\nCurrently, I see Russia more as an adversary, largely because of President Putin. It's hard to completely decipher what has been specifically ordered by President Putin and what he chooses to allow adversarial third parties within Russia to do. In either case, he bears much of the responsibility.\nThe recent cyber attacks, thought to originate from Russian groups, have only increased tensions. \nWhat do you think the two countries could work together on?\nI think just about the only thing the two countries can work on together is a new nuclear arms treaty that will include other nuclear powers such as China. There seems to be some willingness on that front from both sides. The difficult thing is that both countries have very different goals and allies, which often puts them at odds with each other.\nIs there anything about Russia you admire that the US doesn't have?\nI love the Russian culture and people. They have a rich history and still are a major influence in Europe and around the world.\nA professional photographer and self-described pacifist, Katya says the two countries need to focus on fighting Covid-19 together even though they are enemies.\nDo you view the US as an adversary or potential partner?\nI think that Russia considers the US a foe, but the US isn't concerned about this as it has its own problems and concerns. And you can hardly have friends in politics.\nWhat do you think the two countries could work together on?\nRight now, I would say the most important thing is cooperation in fighting the coronavirus pandemic and in restoring the global economy.\nIs there anything about the US you admire that Russia doesn't have?\nI am attracted to the people's openness to each other and their tolerance. But I'm not saying that is completely universal in the US.\nInterviews by Sam Cabral of BBC North America and Alexey Ilin of BBC Russian"

      "text": "Children's charity the NSPCC says calls and messages to its helpline have risen to record levels during the pandemic. \nIn the year to March 2021 the helpline was contacted almost 85,000 times, up 23% on the previous year.\nThe figures amplify fears that children who could not go to school during the lockdowns were more vulnerable to abuse and neglect, says the NSPCC. \nChief executive Sir Peter Wanless says government recovery plans must address the harm children may have faced. \n\"We've been hearing first-hand about the immense pressures families have faced during the pandemic and the heavy toll that has taken on children and young people. \n\"For some children this has included experiencing abuse, bereavement and other harm,\" said Sir Peter. \nHe wants governments across the UK to put children at the heart of their recovery plans. \n\"These must go beyond education, and address the harm some have experienced, so the pandemic doesn't leave a legacy of trauma for children,\" he argues. \nOf the 85,000 contacts to the helpline, the NSPCC says almost half, 47%, led to a referral - for example to police or children's services. \nThe most frequently raised concern was about adult or parental behaviour, including: \nOther issues raised included neglect, physical abuse and emotional abuse. \nSisters \"Chloe\" and \"Debra\" - who asked not to use their real names - called the helpline after finding a young boy crying on the kerb outside their home. \nHe was scared of his mum, saying \"that she hits him and he'd been suicidal over it\", said Debra. \n\"He kept bursting into tears and explained he'd run away because he'd broken his TV and was worried about what his mum would do.\"\nDebra says they were aware the lockdown was affecting young people's mental health, and that being stuck at home in abusive circumstances was making things worse.\n\"Seeing how upset he was, I knew I was doing the right thing,\" Debra says. \nThe NSPCC says that with most children now back in schools, the harm and trauma faced by some children in the pandemic will become increasingly visible. \nThe charity wants governments across the UK to focus on prevention and better protection for children. \nThis includes more money for health visitors and children's social care, better mental health support in schools and imposing a duty of care on tech firms to protect children from harm online.\nThe Scottish government says policies could change depending on the result of next week's election but, together with local authorities, it has developed a \"vision and blueprint for holistic family support\" in the wake of the pandemic, particularly for those in the most challenging circumstances.  \nElections in Wales next week mean policies could likewise change, but a government spokesperson said: \"Our national action plan sets out clear actions to prevent child sexual abuse, to protect children at risk and to support abused children.\"\nIn Northern Ireland, the Department of Health says recovery plans \"will take account of the rising number of children about whom there are concerns, the impact of the pandemic on them and seek to ensure that their needs are met\".\nEngland's Department for Education says extra government funding for the NSPCC's helpline helped boost awareness during the lockdown. \n\"The pandemic has exacerbated some of the challenges vulnerable children and young people already face during their lives,\" an official said. \n\"That is why we kept nurseries, schools and colleges open for children with a social worker and have invested millions in the front-line charities supporting them.\"\nA \u00a31.7bn funding boost for schools \"can be used to support pupils' mental health and well-being, to help put them back on track\", the official added.

      "text": "Ryanair and the owner of Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports have launched a legal challenge against the government over the travel traffic light system. \nThey are calling for more transparency about how the government decides which countries qualify for the green list of safe places to visit amid the pandemic.\nEasyJet, Tui and IAG, the owner of British Airways, have backed the case.\nMinisters say the system \"cautiously manages the risk of new variants\".\nThe traffic light system rates countries green, amber or red based on their Covid risk. \nTravellers to countries rated green will not need to isolate on their return, but they will need to take a Covid test before and after their trip.\nArrivals from amber countries will need to quarantine, while red-list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents, allowed to return - and they must pay for a 10-day stay in a government quarantine hotel.\nThe challenge by Ryanair and Manchester Airports Group (MAG) has been put together after huge frustration within the travel industry at the inclusion of Portugal on the green list in mid-May and then its sudden removal a few weeks later. \nIAG, the owner of British Airways, has told the BBC it intends to join the case as an \"interested party\".\nOne airline in support said: \"We have been asking for more transparency for some time now and so we share the serious concerns being raised by MAG concerning the lack of transparency around government decision making.\"\nOn top of this, the travel industry believes the Balearic and Greek Islands should have been included on the green list of countries last month when health data was analysed.\nIn a separate development, the bosses of Jet2 and EasyJet Holidays have told the BBC they do not understand why low infection destinations like Mallorca were left off the green list in the last review and questioned how government decisions are made. \nThe boss of Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, wants Boris Johnson to explain the scientific basis behind the system which he says the government \"seems to make up\" as it goes along.\nFurther signatories to the challenge are set to be revealed on Thursday. They are demanding a fast response as the crucial summer season edges closer.\nThe government said at the time that moving Portugal from the green to amber list was necessary because of an increase in infection rates in the country, and the emergence of the \"Nepal variant\", a mutation of the Delta version of the virus first detected in India. There were concerns that vaccines would not work as well on this particular mutation.\nThe move meant that some British holidaymakers had to cut short their holidays and dash back from Portugal on extra flights put on by airlines before the country came off the green travel list in early June.\nTravellers the BBC spoke to said it cost them hundreds of pounds to book new flights to get home before the deadline. \nTravel bosses are concerned the damage of these sudden reversals will continue to erode the confidence of the British travelling public. \nThey maintain there is huge pent-up demand to travel abroad this summer, following three coronavirus lockdowns and huge numbers of cancelled or postponed holidays. \nBut epidemiologists worry that mass travel before more people are fully vaccinated, both in the UK and at holiday destinations, will allow the virus to spread more rapidly. \nAnd if Covid cases spiral suddenly on holiday islands, it is not clear if healthcare systems there are in a position to manage their care.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We recognise this is a challenging period for the sector, as we seek to balance the timely reopening of international travel while safeguarding public health and protecting the vaccine roll-out.\"\n\"We have provided \u00a37bn to help support for the industry during the pandemic.\"\nThe spokesperson added that the government could not comment on legal proceedings.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A second dose of the Pfizer vaccine will be offered to 16 and 17-year-olds across the UK, following updated advice from the UK's vaccine committee.\nAll over-18s across the UK can have two Covid vaccine doses, as can some vulnerable, high-risk children over 12.\nHealthy, low-risk children between 12 and 15 have only been offered a single dose - which should be delayed until 12 weeks after a coronavirus infection.\nThe Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says a second dose for those aged 16 and 17 is safe and effective 12 weeks after the first.\nThe JCVI has previously held back from recommending a second dose because of concerns over a very rare heart condition, called myocarditis, experienced by tiny numbers of young people - particularly boys - after the second dose.\nIt says it is now reassured by evidence from other countries that a 12-week gap between doses would lower that already very small risk.\nA decision on a second dose for 12-15s has not yet been made but could happen in the next few weeks.\nIn the meantime, all 12-17 year olds should wait 12 weeks after a Covid infection before having their first or second dose.\nNo vaccine is currently approved for under-12s in the UK.\nIf you're over 18, and want to book your first, second or booster dose, you can find out how here.\nNo. If you're under 40 or pregnant you'll be given Pfizer or Moderna.\nEvery woman who is pregnant (or planning to become pregnant) is encouraged to get two vaccine doses. Hospital figures show that 98% of pregnant women admitted to intensive care this year were not vaccinated.\nUnder-18s have so far been offered Pfizer. \nThe vaccines are very effective at protecting people against becoming seriously ill or dying from Covid-19. \nLatest data from the UK Health Security Agency suggests more than 90% protection against hospitalisation and death with all three vaccines.\nThe vaccines are less effective at stopping people becoming infected by the virus, developing mild symptoms or passing it on - but they do reduce the risk of that happening too.\nIf you've been double-jabbed, you are far less likely to become seriously ill or die from Covid.\nCovid vaccines aren't compulsory, but everyone is urged to get jabbed to protect themselves, their family, friends and wider society.\nChildren under 16 don't need parental consent to get jabbed, as long as they are believed to have \"enough intelligence, competence and understanding to fully appreciate what's involved in their treatment\". This is known as \"Gillick competence\". \nBeing fully vaccinated can make travelling to most other countries easier, and in many cases means you will not have to self-isolate either when you return to the UK. \nHowever, it's worth bearing in mind that under-16s are not eligible for their own digital NHS Covid Pass, which is now accepted widely as proof of vaccination. \nWhat's more, the single jab which most UK teenagers have so far received, is not recognised as full vaccination by some countries (including France), and more tests may be required.\nCheck your destination's rules on the Foreign Office website before you travel. \nMost are mild, completely normal and disappear after a few days. \nThey happen because the body's defences are reacting to the vaccine, and include:\nA very small number of people had a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, so you should discuss any allergies you have before vaccination.\nThere's no evidence to suggest you should avoid alcohol altogether, but drinking in large quantities can suppress your immune system.\nSome women have experienced unusually heavy, painful or prolonged periods after being jabbed.\nThis may be because the vaccine prompts an increase in activity in the immune system, which also plays a role in the menstrual cycle. \nHowever, there's no evidence  the vaccine has any impact on pregnancy or fertility.\nPregnant women are being urged to get the vaccine, to protect themselves and their babies.\nCoronavirus can cause serious illness in some women in later pregnancy, and possibly a slightly higher rate of stillbirth.\nIf you're planning a pregnancy or are breastfeeding, government guidance says you can still get vaccinated, \nA recent study suggests vaccination can help improve long Covid symptoms.\nResearchers think the vaccine could be pressing the body's reset button and helping it recover.

      "tags": "Wembley Stadium,Peterhead",
      "text": "Thousands of Scotland fans are heading south ahead of the team's game against England on Friday night. \nTrain operators said many services were sold out to fans travelling to London for the Euro 2020 match at Wembley.\nWith tickets limited due to Covid restrictions, fans have been urged not to travel unless they have organised a place to watch the game.\nHowever, some supporters groups have criticised the tournament organisers for not setting up a fan zone.\nPaul Goodwin, founder of the Scottish Football Supporters' Association told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"So many Scotland fans are just so excited about the prospect.\n\"All these other [Covid] considerations that we've got, I think they are mindful of it. Undoubtedly it's not going to be same as normal.\n\"But I'm really disappointed that there isn't going to be a fan zone there, in a city the size of London.\"\nLoyal Tartan Army footsoldier Paul has chosen not to travel down for the match on this occasion - but he said it was inevitable that thousands of others would.\nHe said: \"In some respects, this is the most important fixture in Scottish football because of the historical consequences and the fact that it doesn't come around all that often.\n\"I think it's just a unique part of the super-loyalty that football fans have. They feel they have to be part of it.\n\"We can't go out and kick a ball on the park, but we can be part of that unique aspect that the Tartan Army brings.\"\nBy BBC Scotland's Steven Godden, in London\nFor Scotland fans games don't come bigger than England at Wembley. Tickets or no tickets, the thousands who've travelled weren't about to miss it. \nThe journey has been a mixture of planes, trains and automobiles. The London Mayor was among those asking fans not to travel unless they have somewhere safe to watch the game. \nAnd so, behind their masks on the morning flight from Edinburgh, kilted supporters were working out their plans for bar bookings. \nAt Kings Cross station, meanwhile, the swollen crowds underneath the old clock signalled the arrival of another train from Scotland. \nEvery time it was the cue for a quick, enthusiastic rattle through the Tartan Army songbook - \"Super John McGinn\" a particular favourite - before fans started to spread out across the pubs and parks of London. \nWith the traditional gathering point Trafalgar Square off limits, Leicester Square seems like a popular alternative this evening.\nHundreds of fans have gathered there. They're loud, well oiled and it didn't take long for the first one to find his way into the fountain. \nScotland lost their first game 2-0 against the Czech Republic on Monday.\nWembley and Hampden are among 11 venues across Europe hosting the games in the tournament, which was delayed for a year because of the pandemic.\nScotland have never made it past the group stage before, but the top two - or possibly three - teams will go through to the knockout phase. \nAfter the match at Wembley, Croatia will visit Hampden on Tuesday for Scotland's second match on home soil.\nTicketless fans have been urged not to travel to London unless they have organised somewhere to watch the match because space to congregate will be limited. \nWembley will be open at 25% capacity for the match, with supporters having to show either proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test before entry.\nAnd Scotland fans will not be able to access their traditional Trafalgar Square meeting place as it will be reserved as a fan zone for key workers.\nPubs and bars in London are also expected to limit numbers allowed in.\nHamish Husband, from the Association of Tartan Army Clubs, said it was \"a bit late\" to tell fans not to travel without a place to watch the match because the minute people knew Scotland were playing England, they had booked to go.\nMr Husband told BBC Scotland's the Nine there should have been more Covid-safe outdoor events offered for fans wanting to go to London. \"It's a no win situation,\" he added. \nHe said his plea to football fans was that they must \"follow the guidelines.\"\n\"If you're going to go down - and they are on their way - just, behave yourselves,\" he said.\nMany supporters have chosen to travel down early for the match.\nLNER, which operates the services from Edinburgh to London's Kings Cross, said its services were sold out for both Thursday and Friday. \nIt said its services were reservation only, and urged customers to only travel to the station if they already had a booking. \nAvanti West Coast, which operates the Glasgow to London line, said capacity on services had been reduced to about 40% due to social distancing. \nA spokesman said: \"We're monitoring demand closely and also looking at extra trains before and after the match.\n\"We're also reminding customers to travel safely by wearing a face covering unless they're exempt as well as strongly urging fans to plan ahead and only travel if they have a reservation.\"\nOn Thursday, a piper will play for queuing fans heading to London from Glasgow's Central Station. \nBritish Transport Police said extra officers would be on duty.  \nBTP's Supt Ricky Twyford said: \"Throughout Euro 2020, we'll have more officers at key stations and routes supporting fans, frontline rail staff and everyone else travelling during this busy time.\n\"In the lead up to and day of the England v Scotland game, there'll be an even further increase in officers, and we'll be working closely with Police Scotland and the Metropolitan Police to ensure people's journeys are safe and secure, and disruption is kept to a minimum.\"\nLNER services are currently alcohol free, but customers will be able to drink onboard Avanti services. \nOn Wednesday night, one dedicated group of 25 or so football fans who managed to get tickets set off for Wembley from the north east. \nThey have hired a bus to - safely, and following social distancing rules - take them down to London. \nAmong them was Kev Lynch, 36, who told BBC Scotland he'd been away with the Tartan Army quite a few times - but this would be their first time since the pandemic began. \n\"Because of the restrictions, a lot of the boys didn't get tickets - we'd usually have had 50+ in normal times. \n\"It's the biggest game we've had in a long time.\" \nHe said the excitement on Friday night would be even more intense, after Scotland \"slipped up\" by being defeated by the Czech side on Monday. \n\"It will be the biggest game I have been to\" since the early 2000s, he said. \"The last time Scotland got to major finals I was still in secondary school.\n\"The fact it's England makes it a double bonus - the auld enemy,\" adding that it would make a victory \"even sweeter\". \nThe group will be joined later by more fans, who are flying down to join them. \nBecause the group of about 40 have been unable to book into the same pub, they have hired a boat on the Thames to watch earlier coverage, before heading to Wembley for the Scotland match.  \nKev said the bus journey home would be brilliant if Scotland win - but added: \"If there's a loss, it will be a long way home.\". \nAre you watching the Scotland-England game?

He had bitten the teenager's breasts and compressed her neck.\nThey had shared the vodka equally, which Fulton said left Mhari \"obviously drunk. It was like she had lost all motor skills, she was too drunk to do anything.\"\nFulton said she kept falling off the bench and could not walk.\nHe claimed he needed to get the last train home and told her he was leaving, but did not get a response as she was \"unable to speak.\"\nThe next day he sent her texts stating \"Are you alive?\" In a message to a friend he wrote \"I had no choice but to leave what was I supposed to do.\"\nFulton pleaded guilty last month to culpable homicide. He admitted taking part in sexual activity with the schoolgirl, culpably and recklessly endangering her health and life, and exposing her to risk of injury and death.\nThe culpable homicide charge said Fulton left her without the means to contact anyone, had failed to get help for her, and behaved with \"utter disregard\" for the consequences of his actions.\nThe court heard that Fulton later attempted suicide.\nHis defence counsel Shelagh McColl QC said he would have to live with what had happened for the rest of his life: \"He was a young man who would have been under the influence of alcohol himself and he's a young man who has made a bad decision with catastrophic consequences,\" she said."

      "text": "Rules covering wedding and civil partnerships receptions and wakes in Wales are to change from Monday.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said there would no longer be limits on numbers at weddings.\nFollowing a risk assessment by venues, numbers will be based on how many can be \"safely accommodated,\" he said.\nHowever, Mr Drakeford also announced a four-week pause to further lifting of lockdown rules amid concerns over the Delta variant.\n\"We are once again facing a serious public health situation,\" he said.\nAt a briefing on Friday, Mr Drakeford also warned a third wave of coronavirus has already started to spread widely across Wales.\nCurrently, as many people as a venue can accommodate safely can attend wedding ceremonies, but only 30 people can attend indoor wedding receptions. \nThere are other rules, such as the first dance must only involve the bride and groom.\nMr Drakeford said changes meant venues would move away from having a notional number, adding: \"If those can safely accommodate over 100 people, that's what they'll do.\"\nHe added it would mean \"at quite a number of venues across Wales, the number able to be at a wedding will be higher than it is now\".\nAmong the \"small technical amendments\" being made to the lockdown rules are:\nLockdown rules in Wales will be reviewed again on 15 July.\nLewys Williams and Ms Harris were supposed to get married in August of last year but have had to reschedule twice.\nOn one occasion this was because their venue was being turned into a mass vaccination centre.\nIn a letter, also signed by brides-to-be other than Ms Harris and some wedding suppliers, the couple ask Mr Drakeford for a roadmap for weddings. \nAnd they have asked if lateral flow tests could be given to guests before they arrive.\n\"We need clarity,\" Ms Harris said.\n\"We need a roadmap and we need to consider why on earth we are allowing sporting events of up to 10,000 people to go ahead, when we can't have our closest family and friends at our wedding.\n\"The level of worry, anxiety, mental health worries that this has caused.\n\"It sounds dramatic. But it really is every minute of every day, there some kind of worry going around my head at the moment.\n\"We don't know whether we go ahead and pay these suppliers, who within the next few weeks or so, are due the best part of six grand from us.\" \nCrug Gas Country House, near St David's in Pembrokeshire, usually it hosts about 60 weddings a year - but because of the Covid lockdown rules, there have been three this year so far.\n\"At weddings here it's table service-only and only the bride and groom are allowed to dance - it's really sad,\" Crug Glas' wedding coordinator Sandra Vaughan told BBC Radio Cymru.\n\"It's quite hard to see people out enjoying the football in the pubs, but nobody can come here to have a nice wedding. It's not the same product we sold to them.\"\nWelsh government officials are talking to councils about the possibility of fan zones for Wales' remaining Euro 2020 games, Mr Drakeford said. \nHundreds gathered at one indoor venue near Cardiff for Wales' 2-0 victory over Turkey, with hopes larger outdoor facilities will be opened.\nHowever, Mr Drakeford said conversations were taking place with experts and police about the viability of accommodating the \"large numbers of people\" fan zones would attract.\nThe announcement comes as Wales' overall case rate has continued to climb since late May. \nThere are close to 500 cases of the Delta variant, which originated in India, accounting for four out of every five new cases in Wales, latest figures show, with Mr Drakeford saying it is \"seeded in every part of Wales\".\nHe believes it could be a fortnight before the impact of this is seen in hospital admissions and people falling ill. \n\"Across the border in Scotland and England, they are about two weeks ahead of us on all of this,\" he added.\n\"We are already seeing hospital numbers rising, particularly amongst people in their forties and fifties. \n\"That's why we will use the next four weeks to accelerate or vaccination programme.\"\nMore than 500,000 doses of the Covid vaccine will be distributed across Wales in a bid to speed up the number of people receiving second jabs. So far 1,454,066 people have been fully vaccinated. \nMr Drakeford said restrictions could be eased following the four-week pause even if there is not conclusive evidence that vaccinations have broken the link between rising infections and hospital admissions.\nHe told the PA news agency: \"I agree that you cannot, in the end, delay everything in the search for perfection in terms of data.\n\"But what we are quite clearly told by our scientific advisers as well as others is that this four weeks will allow us to get a sufficiently good handle on the extent to which a relationship between falling ill and needing hospitalisation has been modified by the vaccine.\n\"Then we will make a calculation about how much headroom we have, as we always do, to take further steps.\"\nResponding to the announcement, Plaid Cymru deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"Many in hospitality are still feeling the pinch from the unexplained gap in funding in April of this year.\"\nHe said, while clarity on wedding venues would be welcome, he called on the Welsh government to \"provide leadership and support at a time when many have genuine fears for the future\".\nWelsh Conservatives Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies wants the move to be scrutinised in the Welsh Parliament. \nHe added: \"In light of the ongoing restrictions, Welsh businesses will require more financial support and I hope the first minister makes clear what additional funding his government will provide to protect Welsh jobs.\""

      "text": "The government must not \"under any circumstances\" order civil servants in England to return to the office until Covid rates are cut, a union has said.\nThe PCS warned it would not rule out industrial action if this happened.\nLast September ministers told civil servants to spend more time in the office, but dropped the policy as Covid cases increased.\nThe government is looking into guidance on flexible working as it reviews social distancing measures.\nIt said civil servants' safety was \"a key priority\" and it was \"learning lessons\" from its \"experience over the past year\".\nThe PCS's demand also comes as the Daily Mail is reporting that millions of office staff could be given a \"default\" right to work from home from later this year.\nA Downing Street spokesman said there are no plans to introduce a legal right to work from home but that the government is consulting on making flexible working a default option.\nThe spokesman defined flexible working as \"a range of working arrangements around time, place and hours of work including part-time working, flexi-time or compressed hours\" but not necessarily working from home.\nOn Wednesday, MPs backed a four-week delay to the ending of lockdown restrictions in England, with the more easily transmissible Delta variant driving an increase in Covid infections.\nIn September 2020, the government ordered Whitehall bosses to get 80% of staff to go into the office at least once a week, saying that they should set an example to the private sector.\nBut the senior civil servants' union, the FDA, called the move \"Luddite\", arguing that technology made working from home effective.\nThe government discarded its plans after two weeks, as coronavirus infections started soaring for a second time.\nPCS general secretary Mark Serwotka told the BBC he was \"very concerned\" the government might again push for more office-based working for civil servants when its safety review is completed in the next few weeks.\nHe warned against issuing \"highly disruptive diktats\", saying: \"September 2020 was a disaster. It was deeply resented by managers, as well as staff.\"\nA further 9,055 Covid cases were confirmed by the government on Wednesday, up from around 2,000 per day three weeks ago.\nHospitalisations are also up, although they are still at a far lower level than during the first and second wave of infections, while almost 80% of UK adults have had a first vaccination, and more than half have had their second. \nMr Serwotka said civil servants needed to \"have a series of options open to them to allow them to make the best decision for them and, most importantly, be made to feel safe and secure\".\nHe said officials in the Cabinet Office - which coordinates government policy - had shown \"some recognition\" that last September's call for a return to the office \"should not be repeated under any circumstances\".\n\"However, whether ministers recognise the reality is another question,\" Mr Serwotka added, saying offices must be Covid-secure.\nThe government insists this is the case, with all ministries following rules on social distancing and hygiene laid down by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.\n\"The safety of our staff remains a key priority and the civil service continues to follow the latest government guidance on working from home, as we have done throughout the pandemic,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"We have made good use of technology to enable civil servants to work effectively and productively when working remotely and we are learning lessons from our experience over the past year to inform how we work in the future.\"\nThe current advice to work at home where possible applies across the UK."

      "text": "People aged 18 and over in England are being invited to book their first Covid-19 jab in what the NHS has described as a \"watershed moment\".\nAbout 1.5 million texts are due to be sent to people aged 18 to 20 on Friday.\nPM Boris Johnson said the speed of the programme was \"one of our country's greatest collective achievements\".\nIt comes as a study suggests the epidemic is growing across the nation, with much of the rise being driven by young people.\nOn Thursday a further 11,007 cases of Covid-19 were reported, the highest daily rise since 19 February, while a further 19 deaths were also recorded.\nThe government has set a new target to have offered a first dose to all adults by 19 July and a second dose to two-thirds of the over-40s. \nThe prime minister said: \"Offering all adults a jab less than 200 days after the programme launched is one of our country's greatest collective achievements, saving over 14,000 lives so far.\"\nHe added reaching the next stage of the programme would see \"vaccines accelerate in their race with the virus\" and called on people to \"finish the job\" by coming forward for their jab.\nNHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the health service was \"delivering the final push to protect the country\".\n\"This is truly a watershed moment. Whoever you are, wherever you live, if you are aged 18 or older and you are yet to book your Covid jab, today should be the day you make that happen,\" he said.\n\"Only months after delivering the world-first first jab, hardworking NHS staff have given more than 60 million vaccinations in England alone, saving thousands of lives and giving the entire country hope for a brighter future.\"\nAs of Wednesday more than four in five adults have received a first dose of the vaccine, while 58.2% - or 30.68 million people - are now fully vaccinated.\nThe BBC has been told that a decision to vaccinate all 12 to 17-year-old children is unlikely to be recommended by UK vaccine experts imminently.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is expected to make a statement on the matter in the coming days.\nSpeaking at the NHS Confed Conference on Thursday, England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said there was currently a \"further surge\" of coronavirus, with the height of it \"still uncertain\".\nHe said he expected a \"further winter surge\" and said he thought new variants may well lead to booster jabs or revaccination being required over the next two to three years.\nCase rates have risen in all regions of England, according to Public Health England's latest survey report, with the North West seeing the highest rate with 196.9 cases per 100,000 people for the week to 13 June.\nThat compares with 152 per 100,000 people the week before.\nRates are highest among young people with 195.9 cases per 100,000 in those aged 20-29, up from 123.6.\nThe second highest rates are among 10 to 19-year-olds, at 143.3 per 100,000 up from 100.3.\nIn England people can book their vaccination appointment online or by calling 119.\nElsewhere in the UK, people aged 30 and over can get their vaccine in Scotland, although in some parts of Glasgow people aged 18 and over can get a first jab.\nIn Wales, people aged 18 and over can get the vaccine, with the Welsh government announcing that all adults had been offered a vaccine earlier this week.  \nIn Northern Ireland, people aged 18 and over can book online or call 0300 200 7813."

      "tags": "Sexual violence,Robert Buckland",
      "text": "Politicians don't like saying sorry, and it's rare to hear.\nSo the justice secretary's decision to make a major public apology to all victims of rape is an unusual and important moment, acknowledging that the system has let countless victims down, and that the government's efforts to help them seek justice have failed.\nThe quickest of glances at the slide in the numbers of prosecutions and convictions for rape in England and Wales shows what's happened in the last few years - numbers at a record low, fewer than half the number of cases progressing compared to five years ago. \nAnd on Friday, what Robert Buckland described as the \"sobering\" review of how bad things have got will be published in full. \nHis verdict? \nThat the \"sheer scale\" of what's gone wrong has left far too many victims, chiefly women, \"without any means of redress\". \nQuite the admission from the man in charge of the legal system. \nHe certainly can't hide from the numbers, nor the experiences of the victims who, suffering not just the terrible misfortune of being attacked, all too often feel that their experience with the police, CPS or judicial system makes things worse. \nThe justice secretary will publish plans to try to improve the situation on Friday, including a target to return the level of cases taken to 2016 levels, for victims' phones to be returned much more quickly if they are taken for evidence gathering and to shift the focus away from victims' histories to perpetrators' behaviour.  \nBut he admitted that cuts to the justice system have been part of the problem saying, it was \"self-evidently the case that decisions were made\" that took money out of the system.\nBut Mr Buckland, himself a QC who prosecuted many of these kinds of cases, is trying to shift something more fundamental than finding enough cash from the Treasury or introducing new policies.\nHe is trying to push more than 45 different organisations - police forces, the judiciary, the CPS - to give rape more priority. \nHe wants to change the culture: the \"focus should be on predators, not whether victims should be believed\", he says. \nQuestioning why the terrible clich\u00e9s about sexual offence victims still pertain, he says: \"If your house is burgled people don't start asking you why you did you go out\u2026 all those assumptions I'm afraid are far too often not applied when it comes to sexual offences. \n\"It's not that long ago we lived in a climate where frankly for a woman who seen to be dressed in a certain way, there were terrible assumptions of consent,\" and he calls for those \"damaging misconceptions\" to be stamped out. \nCulture can't be changed overnight. \nAnd the government is only seeking to return the rates of prosecution to 2016 levels. \nSo while a new focus on seeking justice for rape may be welcome, there's a real question over whether the scale of ambition really matches the scale of the problem. Labour says the government's record is abysmal.  \nThe apology does matter, a political signal of priority, but campaigners and victims will want to see actual progress - it won't be a matter of forgive and forget."

      "tags": "Criminal justice system",
      "text": "Rape victims in England and Wales should be able to pre-record evidence and cross-examinations so that they do not have to face perpetrators in court, the victims' commissioner has said.\nIn a new report, Dame Vera Baird has called for the practice to be rolled out \"as soon as practically possible\". \nIt would also reduce stressful waits in the run-up to trials, she told the BBC.\nThe BBC understands the government is considering the move, but it is not clear how it would be implemented.\nA plan will be laid out in a government review due to be published next month.\nIn a review of the provision for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses in courts, Dame Vera said pre-recording interviews would relieve unnecessary stress for those who had experienced sexual assault.\n\"We've found that almost everybody who was asked had heard victims say how frightened they were to come to court,\" she said.\nThey did not want to come face-to-face with the defendant or their \"supporters\", she said, nor did they want people in the public gallery.\nShe also said the practice would reduce the wait between the witness giving initial evidence to police and being cross-examined in court, which can sometimes be two years because of backlogs made worse by the pandemic.\nInstead, the evidence and cross-examination could both be filmed soon after the alleged offence, and played to a jury in court once the case reached trial, without any further involvement from the victim. \nDame Vera said this would mean the complainant could give their account \"whilst their memory is good\" then move on - and, if they choose, get therapy without fear that their notes could then be used by the defence.\nShe said asking people alleging rape to wait for years before being cross-examined \"preserves the traumatisation\" and can lead to them withdrawing from prosecution altogether.\nAround 43% of rape complainants dropped out of prosecutions in the nine months to December 2020, according to Home Office figures.\nThose who do proceed can give up if their case is listed for a certain date but cancelled last minute, Dame Vera said, adding: \"It's a torture you don't have to put anyone through.\"\nThe law in England and Wales says that under \"special measures\", witnesses who are classed as vulnerable or intimidated are eligible to pre-record their initial evidence and cross-examination.\nThis practice was rolled out for all vulnerable witnesses - which includes all children - last year. However, it is not currently used for intimidated witnesses, which includes those who allege sexual offences.\nA pilot was introduced in three courts September 2019 and an evaluation has not yet been published.\nThe victims' commissioner's report found that the guilty plea rate was \"notably higher\" when evidence was pre-recorded and the process was less traumatic for witnesses.\nIt also said, more broadly, that too often \"special measures\" - designed to help witnesses give evidence and relieve stress - were not being offered to those who were entitled to them. \nThese measures include the provision of screens to shield witnesses from the defendant in court, and the option to appear in court from a separate room via television link. \nAmong its recommendations is a call for the government to make sure that separate entrances and waiting rooms are available for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses, and to make greater use of remote centres where witnesses can give evidence without attending court.\nThe BBC understands that a government review to be published next month will also include plans to ask judges to bar the public from courts more often and to ensure mobile phones are returned to victims within 24 hours.\nKatie Russell, spokeswoman for Rape Crisis England and Wales,  told the BBC that these measures, as well as pre-recording evidence, would have the \"potential to improve the unacceptably low levels of criminal justice\" that rape and sexual violence complainants receive.\n\"All sexual violence and abuse victims and survivors have been subjected to trauma and deserve trauma-informed and sensitive treatment,\" she said.\nShe also said the \"significant length of time\" that mobile phones were kept for had been \"a cause for concern for some time\".\n\"Being disconnected from friends, family and support networks at such a difficult and stressful time can undoubtedly be distressing,\" she said.\nIn a statement, the Ministry of Justice said: \"We understand how traumatic the court process can be and despite the pandemic we are continuing to improve the support provided for victims.\"\n\"This includes protective screens and video links in every criminal court, more separate waiting rooms as well as piloting the pre-recording of cross-examination for rape victims to help further reduce the stress of attending court,\" it added.\n\"At the same time, a new Victims' Bill - set out in the Queen's Speech - will strengthen the rights of victims at every stage of the justice system.\"\nIf you've been affected by the issues in this video, you can find help and support from BBC Action Line."

      "text": "Paul Givan and Michelle O'Neill have been confirmed as Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers amid an internal Democratic Unionist Party revolt.\nIt comes after a deal was done ending a stalemate over Irish language laws, with the UK government to legislate if Stormont does not.\nThe assembly nominations took place amid opposition from DUP MLAs and MPs.\nA meeting of party officers took place at the DUP headquarters. \nThose attending include deputy leader Paula Bradley, Lord Morrow, Diane Dodds, Gregory Campbell, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Sammy Wilson, Education Minister Michelle McIlveen, William Humphrey, Tom Buchanan and Peter Weir.\nLeader Edwin Poots left the meeting in east Belfast shortly after 20:00 BST, but declined to answer questions from the media. \nBBC News NI understands the vast majority of DUP assembly members (MLAs) - 24 to four - voted against Mr Poots nominating Mr Givan as first minister, during a meeting ahead of the special assembly sitting.  \nSammy Wilson later said the feeling of the party was \"very, very clear\". \n\"What has been done today... shouldn't have been done and the vast majority of people believe that is the case,\" said the East Antrim MP.\nAsked if he had confidence in Mr Poots, Mr Wilson said any leader should \"bring people along with them\" and that could not be achieved by \"ignoring the views of a huge number of people\".\n\"A leader who acts without the support of even a marginal majority of his party has to live with the consequences of that,\" he said. \nAsked on his way into the meeting if there will be a vote of no confidence in Mr Poots, Mr Wilson said: \"Wait and see.\"\n\"I think Edwin has got to ask does he have any confidence in the party now? If he decides to ignore the views of the party, maybe he doesn't have any confidence in us,\" he added. \nThe first and deputy first minister nominations followed a late-night deal after talks involving Sinn F\u00e9in, the DUP and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis ended a stalemate over Irish language laws, with Mr Lewis declaring legislation would be brought in by Westminster in October if not first introduced at Stormont. \nBut DUP MPs and peers wrote to Mr Poots expressing their concern at the deal, asking him to meet them \"to explain the basis of your agreement with the secretary of state and Sinn F\u00e9in before any further steps are taken in this process, including the nomination of a first minister\". \nSignatories included Sir Jeffrey and Mr Wilson, as well as MPs Gregory Campbell, Jim Shannon, Gavin Robinson, Paul Girvan, and Carla Lockhart, along with Lord Morrow, Lord Browne, Lord Hea, Lord McCrea and Lord Dodds. \nSome DUP MPs also joined the MLA meeting to vote on Mr Givan's nomination, but Mr Poots and Mr Givan left before the vote was taken, walking past Mr Wilson while he was speaking, BBC News NI understands.\nMr Wilson said the feeling of party members at the meeting about whether to nominate a first minister was \"very clear\".\n\"It wasn't a marginal vote. It was a clear vote,\" Mr Wilson told the BBC's Talkback programme.\nJust over a month since he was elected leader of the DUP, Edwin Poots has entered party headquarters tonight looking very sullen as those crisis talks got under way.\nThere is real anger across all levels of the party over what has unfolded in the last 24 hours. \nIt would be wrong to assume this anger isn't going to lead to a vote of no confidence in Mr Poots at the meeting of party officers, currently taking place. \nIf there is a vote of no confidence and Mr Poots loses it, that doesn't necessarily mean he is out as party leader. \nIt will be over to the 130-strong party executive to decide what happens, and that's scheduled to meet again next Thursday. \nThat has MLAs, MPs, peers and members of the constituency associations all coming together. \nWhile a special sitting of the assembly took place at 12:00 BST to nominate the first and deputy first ministers, former first minister Arlene Foster tweeted to say she hoped everyone was enjoying their day.\nOfficially nominating Mr Givan, Mr Poots said the assembly needed more people like him to win for unionism. \nSinn F\u00e9in's Conor Murphy said the new executive would face many challenges but that Ms O'Neill was a strong and dedicated leader. \nAccepting the nomination, Mr Givan said Mr Poots was a leader \"who had a big heart for the people around him\". \nMs O'Neill said the new executive's top priority was its response to the Covid crisis, the continued successful rollout of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme, and rebuilding the economy.\nWhen Arlene Foster stood down as first minister on Monday, Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle O'Neill also lost her position as deputy first minister because the roles are a joint office. \nThey then had seven days to nominate replacements. \nMr Poots had named Mr Givan as its pick to replace Mrs Foster, while Sinn F\u00e9in said Ms O'Neill would resume her post as deputy first minister.\nBut Sinn F\u00e9in had wanted commitments from the DUP over a timetable for implementing Irish language legislation, as set out in the New Decade, New Approach deal that restored power sharing in January 2020. \nThe party said this was not forthcoming, and it called on Mr Lewis to bring in Irish language legislation via Westminster. \nMr Poots has said he was committed to implementing all of the NDNA commitments, including those around Irish language, but not necessarily before the end of the current assembly mandate in May 2022. \nWhen a deal was reached in the early hours of Thursday, Mr Lewis said he was \"disappointed\" the Stormont executive had not brought Irish language legislation forward in the assembly.\n\"However, following my intensive negotiations with the parties over the last few days, I can confirm that if the executive has not progressed legislation by the end of September, the UK government will take the legislation through Parliament in Westminster,\" he said.\n\"If that becomes necessary, we will introduce legislation in October 2021.\"\nMr Lewis said later on Thursday that Mr Poots was aware that he was agreeing to the possibility that Westminster would step in and legislate on Irish language commitments. \n\"Edwin Poots was very clear that he would be nominating a first minister understanding that we will be legislating in October for a package, a balanced package, exactly as per NDNA, which both parties signed up to,\" he said. \n\"Mr Poots was very clear that should be delivered at Stormont. I agree with that. That's why I've given that space to allow the executive to look at delivering that here through the executive.\"\nMr Poots said his party had not been \"shirking away\" from NDNA, and said there was \"a lot in the cultural package for unionism\".\nHe said the pandemic was the reason Irish language legislation had not been implemented.\n\"If anybody thought that it should have been prioritised ahead of that - that would have been very foolish,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday. \n\"In terms of actually dealing with all of the issues contained within [New Decade New Approach], quite a number of those have not been implemented as a result of Covid-19.\"\nMs McDonald said Irish speakers had been waiting for 15 years for basic rights and recognition, which was important for wider society because power-sharing was \"based on inclusion, respect and equality\".\n\"On this basis of what has been agreed I am happy to confirm that Sinn F\u00e9in will nominate Michelle O'Neill as deputy first minister and will participate fully in the five-party executive,\" she said.\n\"We have a huge amount of work ahead of us as we come out of Covid and as we continue to rebuild the economy, get people back to work and tackle hospital waiting lists.\" \nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood welcomed the commitment to legislate for the cultural package, but said he was disappointed that reportedly intensive negotiations had resulted in no progress on funding hospital waiting lists, addressing the challenges of the Northern Ireland protocol or investing in the economy. \n\"If we're serious about transforming this place, we need to get real about addressing those challenges,\" he said.\nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie told the assembly that he did not want to see \"ransom politics\" holding politicians to account.\n\"What I want to see is collaborative politics, where we all see the problem in front of us, where we all work to try and find a solution,\" Mr Beattie said. \nAlliance Party leader and Justice Minister Naomi Long said she was \"disappointed\" as parties signed up to NDNA on the understanding it would be fulfilled. \n\"It seems like a very immature type of politics that we have to rely on him [Brandon Lewis] to do that [legislate for Irish language] because we can't stand over the decisions that we make,\" said Ms Long. \nTraditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said the day's events marked the \"first big humiliation and failure of Edwin Poots' leadership\".\n\"This is the portent of things to come as once more Sinn F\u00e9in rule prevails, with the DUP the onlooking bridesmaid,\" he said.\nTaoiseach (Irish prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin said the stability of Northern Ireland's executive was critical for peace and security in Northern Ireland.\nLast week, the NI Executive outlined a number of indicative dates, including relaxing the ban on live music.\nThe executive met on Thursday afternoon, but ministers delayed easing further restrictions to an indicative date of 5 July, with another review due to take place on 1 July.

      "title": "Why are rape prosecutions falling?",
      "tags": "Sexual violence,Crown Prosecution Service,Reality Check",
      "text": " Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has apologised to rape victims for low conviction rates in England and Wales. \nOver the past five years, cases reported to police - and initially recorded as rape - have risen sharply.\nHowever, the proportion making it to court (prosecutions) in that time has more than halved.\nIn the year to the end of March 2020, 58,856 cases of rape were recorded by police forces in England and Wales. \nThese led to just 2,102 prosecutions, compared with 3,043 in the previous 12 months. \n\"This is devastating news for victims and survivors of rape, and all forms of sexual violence and abuse. There is no disputing how dismal these figures are,\" said Katie Russell from the charity Rape Crisis. \nFrom the point that a crime is reported to the police, to a decision being made in court, there are a number of hurdles that have to be overcome. \nAnd at each stage in the criminal justice system, cases are dropped. \nAs a result, rape prosecutions represent a small percentage of all reported rapes. And an even smaller proportion lead to a conviction - when someone is found guilty. \nSo, what is going on?\nThe police have to gather enough evidence in order to refer a case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) -  the body that conducts criminal prosecutions in England and Wales. \nBut there has been an increase in the amount of evidence to consider, often from phones and social media. This has made these cases more difficult for police, prosecutors and, potentially, victims.\nVictims' commissioner Dame Vera Baird said in her annual report that the level of prosecutions has got so low that \"what we are witnessing is the de-criminalisation of rape\". \nShe said that some victims withdrew their complaints because \"they cannot face the unwarranted and unacceptable intrusion into their privacy\". \n\"This is because many will be required to handover their mobile phones, so that the data can be downloaded to see if it has any bearing on a possible criminal prosecution.\" \nIn July 2020, the CPS and police scrapped the digital consent form that people alleging rape had been asked to sign. This form gave full access to their mobile phone data.\nIt followed a court case brought by the Centre for Women's Justice and an investigation by the Information Commissioner's Office.\nThe government review recommends that \"no victim is left without a phone for more than 24 hours, with an ambition that victims have their own phones returned within this period, with replacement phones being provided in a minority of cases\". \nOnce a case is referred to it by the police, the CPS decides whether there is enough evidence to charge a suspect with a crime. Only after this can it go to court.\nIn the year to March 2020, just 1.4% of rape cases recorded by police resulted in a suspect being charged (or receiving a summons).\nThe CPS has been bringing fewer rape prosecutions over the past few years, which is partly due to fewer referrals by police. This is thought to be in part a reaction to a fall in the number of successful convictions.\nThe victims' commissioner's report says: \"Anecdotally, some police officers say the reason they made fewer referrals was precisely because they knew that CPS were prosecuting fewer cases after 2017.\"\nIn November 2019, it was revealed the CPS had previously had a secret conviction rate target, introduced in 2016 - that 60% of rape cases should end in a conviction. It was suggested this may have led prosecutors to drop weaker or more challenging cases.  \nThe CPS called it an \"ambition\" or \"benchmark\" and said it had stopped using it in 2018. \nThe End Violence Against Women Coalition brought a legal challenge, arguing the approach had been unlawful, but it was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 15 March. \nThe CPS has launched a five-year blueprint to make sure offenders of sexual violence are brought to justice.\nMax Hill, director of public prosecutions said: \"It is clear that more needs to be done both to encourage victims to come forward with confidence, and to support them through the criminal justice process so the gap between reports of rape and cases that reach the courts can be closed.\"\nIn Scotland, there was a 43% increase in convictions for rape and attempted rape between 2017-18 and 2018-19.\nIn Northern Ireland the number of crown court cases for rape fell by about a quarter from 2017-18 to 2018-19, although the number of defendants convicted of at least one offence was almost the same.\nThe Justice Secretary was asked about whether government cuts were a factor. \nRobert Buckland said: \"Like all parts of public service, big choices were made in the last decade, because of the position that we all faced economically and that's, I think, self-evidently the case.\" \nThe Institute for Government estimated that the budget of the CPS was cut by 28% between 2009-10 and 2018-19 after adjusting for inflation. \nCPS staff numbers fell too:\nIn August 2019, the government announced an extra \u00a385m funding for the CPS to help it investigate violent crime and deal with the \"explosion in digital evidence\". \nAt the time, the FDA union - which represents CPS lawyers - welcomed the investment but warned that \"it is not enough to undo all the damage that has been done by years of cuts\".\nThis piece was originally published in April 2019, but has been updated to include the latest statistics. It was altered on 24 June 2021 to clarify that the CPS is not funded as part of the Ministry of Justice.    \nWhat claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Now we know they didn't act on any of those warnings.\"\nMs Sturgeon replied that Scotland had \"never once run out of PPE\", and that her government had \"shown leadership\" throughout the pandemic.\nShe said she would look to learn lessons \"every day\", adding: \"Let's engage properly on these things, not just chuck soundbites across a parliamentary chamber.\"\nIt is estimated the pandemic will cost the NHS \u00a31.67bn in 2020-21 alone. \nThe knock-on effects mean there is a \"substantial backlog of patients\" waiting to be seen in the NHS, according to Audit Scotland.\nStephen Boyle, auditor general for Scotland, praised the \"extraordinary commitment\" of NHS staff but said the pandemic had \"highlighted the need to deal with long-standing health inequalities\". \nHe told Good Morning Scotland that the financial sustainability of the NHS had been under threat for years. \nMr Boyle said auditors had emphasised in a number of reports the importance of longer term planning, and shifting the balance of care away from large hospitals to community-based care. \nThe government was expecting a pandemic.  \nIt had rehearsed scenarios, carried out table-top exercises and simulations, all of which identified the need to better prepare care homes and to improve stockpiles of PPE.  \nAnd despite assessing a flu pandemic as a high risk, the government did not identify it as a stand-alone factor when considering the biggest challenges to the health service.  \nScotland is not alone in being caught off guard, and the report points to some of the things that went well.  \nSpeedily increasing the capacity of intensive care and hospital beds for example, and rapidly rolling out the use of digital technology.\nBut this is the first time we've seen in black and white from an independent body that there were shortcomings in the preparations.  \nA public inquiry will later look at the decisions that were made.\nDr Lewis Morrison, chairman of the BMA Scotland, said there was \"some concern\" that the government could have been better prepared, especially when it came to PPE for doctors. \nHe said pre-existing challenges for the NHS had been \"exacerbated by Covid\", and that restarting services was going to be a \"substantial challenge\".\nCovid has caused or contributed to the deaths of about 9,000 people in Scotland so far, with those from the most deprived areas or ethnic minorities among the worst affected. \nThe forecasted \u00a31.67bn cost of Covid in 2020-21 includes \u00a3324.5m on PPE and a near 10% rise in staffing costs. \nResponding to the report, the Royal College of Nursing said lessons needed to be learned and the \"immense pressure\" staff had faced for sustained period should be recognised. \nIt said nurses were concerned about potential long-term\u202frisks to their physical and mental health,\u202fincluding PTSD and long Covid.\u202f "

      "text": "The government must not \"under any circumstances\" order civil servants in England to return to the office until Covid rates are cut, a union has said.\nThe PCS warned it would not rule out industrial action if this happened.\nLast September ministers told civil servants to spend more time in the office, but dropped the policy as Covid cases increased.\nThe government is looking into guidance on flexible working as it reviews social distancing measures.\nIt said civil servants' safety was \"a key priority\" and it was \"learning lessons\" from its \"experience over the past year\".\nThe PCS's demand also comes as the Daily Mail is reporting that millions of office staff could be given a \"default\" right to work from home from later this year.\nA Downing Street spokesman said there are no plans to introduce a legal right to work from home but that the government is consulting on making flexible working a default option.\nThe spokesman defined flexible working as \"a range of working arrangements around time, place and hours of work including part-time working, flexi-time or compressed hours\" but not necessarily working from home.\nOn Wednesday, MPs backed a four-week delay to the ending of lockdown restrictions in England, with the more easily transmissible Delta variant driving an increase in Covid infections.\nIn September 2020, the government ordered Whitehall bosses to get 80% of staff to go into the office at least once a week, saying that they should set an example to the private sector.\nBut the senior civil servants' union, the FDA, called the move \"Luddite\", arguing that technology made working from home effective.\nThe government discarded its plans after two weeks, as coronavirus infections started soaring for a second time.\nPCS general secretary Mark Serwotka told the BBC he was \"very concerned\" the government might again push for more office-based working for civil servants when its safety review is completed in the next few weeks.\nHe warned against issuing \"highly disruptive diktats\", saying: \"September 2020 was a disaster. It was deeply resented by managers, as well as staff.\"\nA further 9,055 Covid cases were confirmed by the government on Wednesday, up from around 2,000 per day three weeks ago.\nHospitalisations are also up, although they are still at a far lower level than during the first and second wave of infections, while almost 80% of UK adults have had a first vaccination, and more than half have had their second. \nMr Serwotka said civil servants needed to \"have a series of options open to them to allow them to make the best decision for them and, most importantly, be made to feel safe and secure\".\nHe said officials in the Cabinet Office - which coordinates government policy - had shown \"some recognition\" that last September's call for a return to the office \"should not be repeated under any circumstances\".\n\"However, whether ministers recognise the reality is another question,\" Mr Serwotka added, saying offices must be Covid-secure.\nThe government insists this is the case, with all ministries following rules on social distancing and hygiene laid down by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.\n\"The safety of our staff remains a key priority and the civil service continues to follow the latest government guidance on working from home, as we have done throughout the pandemic,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"We have made good use of technology to enable civil servants to work effectively and productively when working remotely and we are learning lessons from our experience over the past year to inform how we work in the future.\"\nThe current advice to work at home where possible applies across the UK."

      "text": "Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg has hailed Health Secretary Matt Hancock as a \"successful genius\" - after he was allegedly branded \"hopeless\" by the PM.\nIt comes after Boris Johnson's ex-aide Dominic Cummings released messages critical of the health secretary.\nMr Rees-Mogg dismissed them as \"trivia\", adding that Mr Hancock's work had made the world safer.\nBut Labour's leader said the prime minister's border policies showed he was \"as hopeless as Hancock\".\nSir Keir Starmer added that not imposing stronger controls on arrivals from India had forced the four-week extension of England's Covid restrictions.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Cummings - who was forced out of Downing Street after an internal power struggle - released a series of WhatsApp exchanges between himself and his former boss, dated to early last year.\nIn one of them, Mr Johnson purportedly called Mr Hancock \"Totally [expletive] hopeless\".\nIn another, he appeared to say his procurement of personal protective equipment had been a \"disaster,\" and that he wanted to hand some of Mr Hancock's duties to Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove.\nDowning Street did not deny the authenticity of the messages, but insisted the prime minister had full confidence in the health secretary.\nAsked on Thursday how he felt about the messages, Mr Hancock told reporters: \"I'm not getting into that.\"\nHe added: \"The prime minister and I have worked incredibly closely together in this last 18 months.\"\nIn the House of Commons on Thursday, Labour's Thangam Debbonaire asked: \"Why did the prime minister keep on as health secretary someone he thought was hopeless in a global health crisis?\n\"The British people recognise incompetence and waste when they see it. They know what's right and what's not and they know when a minister is hopeless.\"\nBut Mr Rees-Mogg replied: \"There's a great line from Dr [Samuel] Johnson, that in lapidary inscriptions [engravings in stone] a man is not on oath.\n\"And I think the same applies to text messages, which are essentially the trivia, the flotsam and jetsam, the ephemera of life, and they're fundamentally unimportant.\"\nHe praised the plan agreed at last weekend's G7 summit in Cornwall to distribute one billion Covid vaccines to poorer nations, lauding Mr Hancock's role in arranging the UK's contribution \"so successfully\".\nHe called his cabinet colleague \"the brilliant, the one and only successful genius who has been running health over the last 15 months\", adding that \"he has done so much to make not only the country but the world safer\".\nBut speaking later on Thursday, Sir Keir Starmer criticised the government's decision not to add India to the travel red until 23 April, arguing it had hastened the spread of the Delta variant of the virus first identified there to the UK.\nHe said the spread of that variant had made the four-week delay to the next stage of England's unlocking - supported by Labour at a vote on Wednesday - \"inevitable\".\nHe said the Delta variant \"wouldn't be here\" if tougher travel rules had instead been applied after 1 April, calling it \"the only reason we're not unlocking\".\n\"There's only one reason we've got the Delta variant, and that's because the prime minister failed to secure the border,\" he added.\n\"So the prime minister is as hopeless as Hancock.\""

      "text": "Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's first president and one of the last of the generation of African leaders who fought colonialism, has died aged 97.\nKaunda was admitted to a military hospital in the capital, Lusaka, on Monday suffering from pneumonia. His aides said he did not have Covid-19.\nIn the 1950s, Kaunda was a key figure in what was then Northern Rhodesia's independence movement from Britain.\nHe became president following independence in 1964.\nAs head of the left-leaning United National Independence Party (UNIP), Kaunda then led the country through decades of one-party rule. \nHe stepped down after losing multi-party elections in 1991. \n\"I am sad to inform we have lost Mzee,\" Kaunda's son, Kambarage, wrote on his late father's Facebook page, using a term of respect. \"Let's pray for him.\"\nZambian President Edgar Lungu said the country was mourning \"a true African icon\".\n\"I learnt of your passing this afternoon with great sadness,\" he wrote on Facebook. \"On behalf of the entire nation and on my own behalf I pray that the entire Kaunda family is comforted as we mourn our first president and true African icon.\"\nThe government declared three weeks of national mourning with all forms of entertainment suspended.\nThe Nelson Mandela Foundation said Kaunda's contribution to the struggle against colonialism and apartheid would not be forgotten.\nAnother tribute came from Kalusha Bwalya, former captain of the Zambian national football team, who said Kaunda had made \"an immense impact\".\nKaunda - popularly known as KK - was a strong supporter of efforts to end apartheid in South Africa. He was also a leading supporter of liberation movements in Mozambique and what is now Zimbabwe.\nIn later life Kaunda turned his attention to the fight against HIV after one of his sons, Masuzyo, died from an Aids-related disease.\n\"We fought colonialism.

      "tags": "Sexual violence,Crown Prosecution Service,Robert Buckland",
      "text": "Ministers have said they feel \"deeply ashamed\" of low conviction rates for rape cases in England and Wales.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland apologised to victims and promised to \"do a lot better\".\nHe also admitted budget cuts were partly to blame for convictions falling to a record low in recent years.\nThe government says it is now considering allowing victims to pre-record their evidence to spare them the trauma of a courtroom trial.\nIts review also outlined plans to focus more on the suspect's behaviour - not the accuser's, and make sure phones taken away for evidence-gathering were returned within a day.\nThe review was met with mixed responses, with one rape charity saying it was a missed opportunity and failed to identify any big commitments that would radically and swiftly improve rape victims' experience.\nLabour said the government had \"failed victims of rape on every front\" and its recommendations did not go far enough.\nSpeaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Buckland said the report revealed \"at all stages of the criminal justice process frankly a failure to deal with complaints made by many thousands of victims\".\n\"The first thing I think I need to say is, sorry - it's not good enough.\"\nIn a foreword to the review, Mr Buckland, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Attorney General Michael Ellis, said: \"The vast majority of victims do not see the crime against them charged and reach a court - one in two victims withdraw from rape investigations.\n\"These are trends of which we are deeply ashamed,\" they wrote. \"Victims of rape are being failed.\"\nThey went on to say that most rapes were carried out by people known to the victim, making investigations very personal and intrusive for the victim. \nThe trauma and their experience afterwards led many to disengage from the criminal justice process, they said.\n\"We are not prepared to accept that rape is just 'too difficult' a crime to prosecute. We can, and must, do better,\" they added.\nKatherine Araniello says she felt she wanted to take her own life after her rape case was dropped \"practically on the eve of the trial\" by the Crown Prosecution Service.  \nShe says she was given an explanation as to why her case was dropped but it was only \"very vague\". \"They didn't call me in to iron out any issues they might have at their end.\"\nShe says she felt like \"it was my character\" the Crown Prosecution Service were judging, not that of the alleged perpetrator, and her treatment by the CPS \"really stung, and it still stings to this day\". \n\"That lack of acknowledgment from the CPS on how to treat victims, highly traumatised victims as well, has left me really angry with the system,\" she says.\n\"They haven't learned their lessons.\"\nEach year there are about 128,000 victims of rape and attempted rape but fewer than 20% of them report the crime to the police, according to the report. And just 1.6% of rapes result in someone being charged.\nEmily Hunt, an independent adviser to the review and herself a rape victim, said the low prosecution rate was not because people made false allegations. \nShe cited Home Office research showing up to 3% of rape allegations could be false, which meant 97% of them were not.\n\"The reality is, in almost all cases, if someone says they've been raped, they have not made it up which makes the current situation all the more shocking and unacceptable,\" she said in the report.\nPlans set out in the report include:\nThe report - commissioned in March 2019 - also said the volume of cases going to court should return to \"at least 2016 levels\" and that regular \"scorecards\" would be published to monitor progress.\nThe Law Commission will also begin a review into \"rape myths\" and examine the use of a victims' sexual history as evidence.\nThere are many possible factors behind the fall in prosecutions. \nThe report argued it was due to \"a strained relationship\" between different parts of the system, lack of support for the victims and \"an increase in invasive requests for their personal data\".\nAsked in his BBC interview whether government cuts to the legal system were a factor, Robert Buckland replied: \"Like all parts of public service big choices were made in the last decade, because of the position that we all faced economically and that's, I think, self-evidently the case.\"\nHe said the government was now \"seeking to make the necessary investment\" but also insisted \"it's about more than just money, it's about culture.\"\nHe argued that \"for too long\" rape allegations have focused on the credibility of the victim rather than the evidence. \n\"If your house is burgled people don't start asking 'why did you go out?'\u2026 all those assumptions I'm afraid are far too often not applied when it comes to sexual offences,\" he said.\nIn rape investigations, there has also been an increase in the amount of evidence to consider, often from phones and social media, making them more difficult for police, prosecutors and, potentially, victims.\nVictims' Commissioner Dame Vera Baird has said some victims withdraw their complaints because \"they cannot face the unwarranted and unacceptable intrusion into their privacy\".\nThere have also been suggestions a secret conviction rate target, set by the CPS, led to prosecutors dropping weaker or more challenging cases. \nIn November 2019, it was revealed the CPS had introduced a target in 2016 that 60% of rape cases should end in a conviction. \nThe victims' commissioner welcomed the review's proposals but said the government \"has a mountain to climb if it is to restore victims' confidence\". Dame Vera said it was \"disheartening\" that the pre-recording of video evidence was not being introduced more widely. \nLabour's shadow solicitor general Ellie Reeves said the government's review had missed a \"real opportunity\" to improve the justice system, and accused the government of failing victims of rape \"on every front \u200bby pushing the justice system to the brink of collapse through a decade of cuts to police, courts and the CPS\".\nShe said \"piecemeal pilots\" and \"\u200btinkering\" would not be enough to fix the failures.\nAndrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said the current system was \"in disarray\".\nShe said it was welcome the government had admitted women have been failed, but women's groups felt \"frustration and disappointment\" over how long the measures in the review would take to be rolled out. \n\"Waiting a further two years to see some of these recommendations come to fruition is too long,\" she added. \nAmelia Handy, policy lead for Rape Crisis England and Wales, said the review was \"a missed opportunity\". \n\"While there are individual elements of the government's report that are encouraging, it's hard to identify any big commitments that will radically and swiftly improve the experience of the justice system for victims and survivors,\" she said.\nShe called for \"independent research into who does and doesn't report sexual offences to the police\" and an urgent review into governance of the Crown Prosecution Service.\nSumanta Roy from Imkaan - an organisation tackling violence against women from ethnic minorities - called for ring-fenced funding \"to address the historical under-funding of specialist independent support services for black, minoritised women\".\nIf you have been affected by sexual abuse or violence, help and support is available at BBC Action Line."

Equivalent to five million a week. \nBy the first week of April this haul of protective equipment had reached 24.4m - 200 times the usual amount. \nUnprecedented worldwide demand for PPE saw prices soar and, as of December 2020, the additional cost of the equipment was put at \u00a3320m by health boards and the social care sector. \nAs well as the PPE, waste collection costs have gone up as a result of the pandemic.\nThe NHS has awarded extra contracts worth more than \u00a37m to collect used PPE and waste generated by the vaccination and testing programme. \nThis is in addition to the Scotland-wide \u00a3100m NHS waste contract run by Spanish-owned Tradebe Healthcare. \nNHS figures show that in April this year the health service dealt with 1,633 tonnes of waste, up more than 200 tonnes on the same month in 2020. \nA spokeswoman for NHS National Services Scotland said: \"The NHS Scotland response to Covid-19 witnessed a sudden increase in both the overall volume of healthcare waste and the type of healthcare waste produced right across the UK. \n\"All NHS healthcare waste producers were impacted, as well as healthcare waste service providers. \n\"During 2020, Covid-19 planning anticipated further waves. Appropriate accelerated resilience measures were therefore put in place via these direct awards, in order to provide support to the existing healthcare waste infrastructure and mitigate any risks to critical front line services.\""

      "text": "The bosses of Jet2, Easyjet and Manchester Airport have criticised the government for not putting the Balearic Islands, including Majorca, on the green travel list. \nThe boss of Jet2 said he was \"bewildered\" over why they couldn't fly to those destinations.\nWhile UK travel is limited, Germans are flocking to popular holiday spots.\nThe government said it would continue to explore how to open international travel safely.\nCurrently very few countries are on the government's green list, which means they are approved for leisure travel, requiring less testing and no quarantine on return.\n\"When you take the UK government's own criteria for deciding where holidaymakers can travel to, and apply it to the Balearics, we are left bewildered as to why we cannot fly there,\" said Jet2 and Jet2 Holidays' chief executive Steve Heapy.\nCharlie Cornish, chief executive of Manchester Airport Group (MAG) said EU countries were taking a more positive approach to resuming international travel.\n\"Hundreds of thousands of people from places like Germany are travelling freely and safely to low-risk holiday destinations,\" he said.\nMAG has joined with low cost airline Ryanair to launch a legal action against the government over its traffic light system, particularly focusing on the lack of transparency over how countries are classified.\nThe Spanish island of Majorca, a favourite of British tourists for decades, is currently on the amber list; travel there is not advised and quarantine is required on return to the UK.\nBut rates of the virus are lower there than in the UK and in recent weeks, German tourists have started arriving in Majorca in large numbers. German travellers need just a digital pre-registration and either an antigen test or proof of vaccination.\nDutch and Belgian tourists are also flying to the Balearics but in fewer numbers than those travelling from Germany.\nPalma de Majorca Airport confirmed to the BBC that during May, 397,931 tourists arrived from Germany on 3,363 flights. In contrast 5,813 UK tourists arrived on 333 flights from UK airports.\nLocal businesses in the Balearics that usually rely on British tourists and their holiday spending, are feeling their absence for a second summer.\nMark Steenson owns Francey O'Connor's, an Irish pub in Ca'n Picafort, a Majorca resort that usually welcomes thousands of British holiday-makers.\nBut with Brits still advised not to travel there, he has begun to gear his trade to those who can. \n\"I went and got a Borussia Dortmund shirt and had the bar sign redone in German to get the German football fans in,\" said Mr Steenson.\n\"If it weren't for the Germans, we'd be broke. Ca'n Picafort is rammed with Germans,\" he said. \"It is a joy to see.\"\nBut rapid adjustments have had to be made, he says: \"I've gone out and bought German beers and I've started trying to learn some German words so I can chat to them.\"\nThe Germany and France game in the Euro 2020 tournament earlier this week was a big pull and for the first time this summer, the terrace at Francey O'Connor's filled up.\nBut while German visitors are a lifeline for Mark Steenson, the absence of their British counterparts has angered Manchester Airport Group boss, Charlie Cornish. \nThe UK's current traffic light system had not recognised the progress many countries have made in reducing rates of the virus, he said.\n\"The government's lack of transparency is unacceptable and makes operating a business in the travel sector almost impossible after what has already been the most challenging year in our history.\"\nEpidemiologists worry that mass travel before more people are fully vaccinated, both in the UK and at holiday destinations, will allow the virus to spread more rapidly. And if Covid cases spiral suddenly on holiday islands, it is not clear if healthcare systems there are in a position to manage their care.\nAdded to this, there are now concerns amongst EU nations about the Delta variant now dominant in the UK. The EU has not added the UK to its \"white list\" permitting travel. But this list is only guidance and EU nations can make their own decisions.\nThat's not a pressing issue for most EU governments yet, with the UK's largest tour operators almost completely grounded.\nBut when UK tourists are eventually allowed to travel again, the delays may put them at a price disadvantage, according to Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of the Advantage Travel Partnership.\n\"We are closed for businesses, we really are,\" she said. \"Our counterparts in Germany and Europe are flocking to the Med. \n\"What that will mean is a reduction in product for when we restart, and access to uncompetitive pricing, because everyone else will have picked best rates.\"\n\"As an industry it demonstrates that you can't plan an operation at the last minute. But there is no comprehension in government of the complexity of this story.\"\nEarlier this week, Easyjet announced it was increasing capacity from Germany to Majorca, to cope with swelling holiday demand.  \n\"We've just recently added 150,000 seats from Berlin into Palma to try meet the huge pent-up demand that has been released from those restrictions lifting,\" said Garry Wilson, chief executive of easyJet Holidays. \n\"It is a shame we can't do the same for UK customers, because we know demand is there.\"\nThe government says it is looking at how to reopen international travel, including the idea that travellers who have received both doses of the vaccine would not have to quarantine when they return from amber list destinations. \nJesse Norman, financial secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News: \"We don't want to get left behind by countries who are adopting a two-jabs approach if it can be done safely.\"\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"Our first priority is protecting the public and saving lives, and the traffic light system we have in place categorises countries and territories based on risk, using the latest data.\n\"As set out in the Global Travel Taskforce, we continue to engage with international partners to explore how we can open international travel safely.\"\nLabour said it had repeatedly called for ministers to publish the data and criteria around their traffic light system, but they had refused to do so. \nShadow transport secretary Jim McMahon added: \"When will they deliver on the sector-specific support promised for aviation 15 months ago? It's now clearer than ever that this government is actively choosing to turn its back on the industry at a time when thousands of jobs are on the line.\"\nSteve Heapy, boss of Jet2 said the continued exclusion of UK tourists risked inflicting long-term damage on the travel industry.\n\"Other nationalities are going, German customers are arriving on jumbo jets that are being put into Majorca and hotels are filling up.\n\"Hotels will give rooms in the future to these other nationalities and British tour operators and customers could be squeezed out.  \nHe said he hoped the government would review its decision after reexamining the data on 24 June.\n\"If that is the case, and Malta, Balearic and Canary Islands continue to have low infection rates, I expect them to be on the list. If they are not - I expect an explanation. \""

      "text": "The Welsh NHS is under \"substantial pressure\" as services return to pre-pandemic levels, its chief executive has warned.\nDr Andrew Goodall said the need to continue with Covid-19 precautions meant a \"difficult combination\" of factors was straining the system.\nMonthly waiting times show another rise, amid a growing backlog of patients waiting for treatment.\nOne doctors' group has called for a radical reorganisation of services.\nData from April showed there were 595,272 people on waiting lists in Wales - this has risen again on March and is up 29% on pre-pandemic levels. \nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan said it was a \"massive uphill task\" to clear the backlog and did not rule out establishing regional hubs.\n\"We've made it very clear it probably will take the whole length of this Senedd term [five years] to get us back to pre pandemic levels,\" she told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"We had to pause non-emergency care, that has created a massive challenge for us, but we've already put \u00a3100m on the table to get our health boards to shift some of that [backlog].\"\nWe can see in April, 223,365 people were waiting more than 36 weeks or nine months for hospital treatment.\nWhen we look at specialist areas, in trauma and orthopaedics there were 52,822 people waiting more than nine months. This is a 527% increase on the pre-pandemic total in February 2020.\nAltogether, there are 87,918 orthopaedic and trauma patients waiting for treatment.\nThose waiting the longest for general surgery have also hit a new high - 26,943, 12 times the numbers waiting before the pandemic.\nIn February 2020, 252 people had been waiting more than nine months for cardiology treatment, and by April this year there were 4,159 people with long waits. The number on that list has risen slightly after falling for four successive months.\nNumbers waiting the longest for cardiothoracic surgery are still falling although there are still 136 patients - three times the numbers before the pandemic hit.\nWhile two people were waiting more than nine months before the pandemic in February 2020 for restorative dental work, that has now increased to 625, although has fallen for the fifth successive month\nFor neurology treatments, numbers rose from 22 to 906 from pre-pandemic to April. \nCancer charity Tenovus said 13,480 people in Wales were referred to the Suspected Cancer Pathway April - the second consecutive time the monthly figure has exceeded the pre-pandemic average monthly figure of 13,208.\n\"This is a chink of light that gives us optimism that, as the Covid-19 pandemic begins to subside, we can avert a cancer pandemic through a combination of public awareness-raising and investment in our health service,\" said chief executive Judi Rhys. \nAttendances at emergency departments have also returned to pre-pandemic levels, and NHS Wales said that one health board experienced its busiest-ever day for A&E attendances on Monday.\nIn May, there were more than 81,000 A&E attendances, nearly 5,000 more than in February 2020.\nThe NHS Wales chief executive added that planned treatments were now at 70% of normal levels.\nDr Goodall said: \"It is a substantial pressure, I think it is substantial for different reasons. NHS staff want to make sure that we are able to support our patients across Wales and make sure that they can be seen within the appropriate and right level of services.\n\"But they are having to balance a growth in emergency pressures back to normal levels. \n\"They are still having to protect both staff and patients working around them. And they are the same staff who have been there through the pandemic, who are having to focus on the new services, to make sure people are supported as well.\"\nHealth boards have been asked to come up with innovative ways of dealing with the backlog, and an initial \u00a3100m of new funding has been made available by the Welsh government to try to bring waiting lists down.\nPilot schemes have begun in some areas to reduce waiting times or improve the quality of life for those who will continue to face the longest delays in their treatment.\nSurgical teams at the Princess of Wales hospital in Bridgend have already seen a significant reduction in waiting times for patients referred for urgent treatment after visiting A&E or their GP.\nThe Ambulatory Emergency Surgical Unit was launched at the hospital before the pandemic to allow patients to be assessed, diagnosed and treated - often on the same day. They do not need to be seen by separate medical teams or admitted as an inpatient.\nThe model was so efficient it has since been expanded to emergency medical admissions, and will be implemented for emergency gynaecology admissions from 1 July.\nConsultant surgeon Simon Weaver said the system had allowed about 80% of patients to be seen and treated within three hours, compared with about 30% before it was introduced.\n\"When it comes to resetting services it's really important that we're a getting a bang for our buck,\" he said.\n\"We've got to take this as an opportunity to restart the NHS.\" \nWhile local innovations will help reduce some pressures, the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) has called for the creation of non-Covid hubs to tackle waiting lists.\nRichard Johnson, the director of RCS in Wales, said: \"There is now an urgency to develop these sites and have a radical rethink of how the NHS is working in Wales.\n\"We are looking at these sites for planned treatments. We are not talking about new sites, we are talking about a reorganisation of the sites we have in Wales already.\"\nMr Johnson said an RCS survey found patients were prepared to travel in order to be treated at new hubs across Wales.\nAnd he said there needed to be \"an open and honest discussion\" about the implications of not changing the way hospitals are currently organised. \nDr Goodall said many changes had been implanted already, including greater use of technology in connecting patients to clinicians.\nHe added it was \"inevitable that we're going to have to have more regional solutions, with health boards working alongside each other to achieve that\". \n\"And I know there's a lot of clinical support for that to happen in Wales.\"\nThe health minister said the Welsh government was currently looking at ways to fund such hubs.\nDarren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said there was a \"long road ahead\" for the NHS in Wales to recover from the pandemic. \nHe urged the public to continue using services responsibly, adding: \"It's the same exhausted staff who have worked tirelessly over the last 15 months that will be required to deliver services and ultimately help tackle waiting lists. \n\"We can't thank them enough for all they've done for the people of Wales, and we must remember that as we begin the next chapter of recovery, they too need to recover.\"\nCases of the Delta variant of the virus, first identified in India, remain comparatively low in Wales compared with England. \nDr Goodall said the next two to four weeks would be crucial in determining whether a further increase in cases in Wales would result in a spike in hospital admissions.\nHe said: \"Numbers associated with a Delta variant remain very low in Wales from a hospital perspective, although they're increasing in terms of community cases. So we're tracking it very carefully. \n\"But inevitably there will be some impact in Wales and it's why, in part, I know that the first minister and the cabinet made decisions to defer some arrangements earlier on during this month, because it was to try and allow for more vaccination coverage for the population, which will provide a higher level of protection.\""

      "tags": "Poverty,Department for Education,State schools,Child poverty,Free school meals,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A \"worrying\" number of poorer school pupils will miss out on extra funding because of a change in the way support is allocated, unions say.\nNew figures show more than one in five children in England are now eligible for free school meals - an increase of 420,000 children since March 2020. \nBut extra funding for schools will be based on data from last October rather than the latest figures for January. \nThe government says the date change will help with budget planning. \nThe issue of child poverty during the pandemic has been highlighted by Manchester United and England footballer Marcus Rashford, who successfully campaigned for the government to allow about 1.3 million children in England to claim free school meal vouchers in the summer holidays. \nThe January figures show 20.8% of pupils in England now qualify for free school meals, up from 17.3% in January 2020. \nIt means a total of 1.74 million children are eligible for the support. \nChildren are entitled to free school meals if a parent or carer receives one of a number of benefits. \nPupil premium funding for schools is based partly on the number of children who are currently, or have been in the last six years, eligible for free school meals. \nIt is targeted to help disadvantaged children and provides schools with an extra \u00a31,345 per pupil in primary and \u00a3955 per pupil in secondary settings.\nIn every previous year this has been based on a snapshot of data taken in January each year, but for the first time the figures from the autumn census of schools carried out in October are being used. \nSchools argue this means their funding for the most disadvantaged children is not keeping up with the number of families falling into financial difficulty during the pandemic. \nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"As we expected, there has been a big rise in the number of children eligible for pupil premium this year - and a worrying number of them will not be receiving any additional funding due to a change in reporting date implemented by the government.\"\nHe accused the government of \"abandoning those children most in need\" in the middle of a pandemic. \nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it had \"short-changed schools\". \nHe said the number of pupils eligible for free school meals increased by 100,000 between October 2020 and January this year, suggesting \"a very large funding hole\". \n\"Whatever the motivation for this change in the rules the result is nothing short of shameful,\" he added. \nA Department for Education spokesperson said pupil premium funding was expected to increase to more than \u00a32.5bn this year and a typical school would see its allocations increase compared with last year. \n\"Any pupil who becomes eligible after the October census will attract funding in the following year,\" the spokesperson added. \nThe department says using data from October will allow schools to know their budget earlier in the year, helping them to plan ahead.\nWayne Norrie is chief executive officer of Greenwood Academies Trust, which runs a large family of 37 schools in the East Midlands and East of England. The majority of its children come from economically disadvantaged families, with almost 50% eligible for free school meals.\nHe says that over the past three years he has noticed \"the children getting poorer in front of our eyes\", with families more dependent on the school for help with food.\nMr Norrie says he is increasingly worried about the impact the pandemic has had on his pupils' language and basic skills. \n\"We have some older children who are seven years old in our multi-academy trust who staff are working with to re-toilet train because they have lost the ability through lockdown to use a toilet properly,\" he says.\nHe adds that pupils' stamina and concentration levels have also been impacted by not being in school. \nBased on its calculations, Mr Norrie says he is \u00a3400,000 down in his budget this year due to the time lag in receiving the pupil premium money for poorer children. \nPupil premium funding is not just there for pupil attainment but is used for \"the well-being of our children, the mental health of our children, the stability,\" he says. \"Looking at their basic needs, that make them happy, fed and warm.\"\nTracy Mayes, who has a child who receives free school meals at Studfall Junior Academy in Corby, Northamptonshire, also gets extra support from the school through food parcels delivered to her home. \nShe said the parcels made \"a big difference\". \n\"Once you've paid all your bills there's really not a lot left to last the whole month for food shopping,\" she said. \n\"A couple of weeks in and you're struggling and wondering where the next meal is going to come from and making what you've got stretch.\"\nThe highest rates of children eligible for free school meals are in north-east England, where 27.5% qualify, and the West Midlands, where the figure is 24.5%. \nThese areas also saw the largest increase from 2020. \nBy contrast, 16% of pupils are eligible in south-east England, although all regions saw some increase from 2020.

      "text": "Some 500 policemen raided the offices of pro-democracy paper Apple Daily in Hong Kong, alleging its reports breached a national security law. \nPolice also arrested the editor-in-chief and four other executives at their homes. It also froze HK$18m ($2.3m; \u00a31.64m) of assets owned by three companies linked to Apple Daily. \nThe paper is owned by Jimmy Lai, who is in jail on a string of charges.\nApple Daily is known to be critical of the mainland Chinese leadership. \nIn a press briefing, police said that since 2019, Apple Daily had published more than 30 articles calling on countries to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and mainland China. \nIt added that the assets of Apple Daily Limited, Apple Daily Printing Limited and AD internet Limited had been frozen. \nDozens of prominent activists have been arrested since the national security law was introduced last year. \nPolice entered the Apple Daily office premises at around 07:30 local time on Thursday (23:30 GMT Wednesday) and blocked off all entrances and exits. \nThe paper broadcasted live footage of the raid on its Facebook account.\nPolice said in a statement that they conducted a search operation at a media company, adding that their warrant \"covered the power of searching and seizure of journalistic materials\". \nPhotos published online by Apple Daily showed police going through reporters' computers. \nThe police separately visited the homes of editor-in-chief Ryan Law, parent company Next Digital's CEO Cheung Kim-hung, COO Chow Tat-kuen, Apple Daily publisher Chan Pui-man and Director Cheung Chi-wai, and arrested them. \nPolice did not name those arrested but confirmed that the five people, aged between 47 and 63, were arrested for \"collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\". \nThis is the second raid to take place in Apple Daily in under a year - a raid last August saw 10 people arrested including Lai and his sons. \nAccording to the BBC's Danny Vincent, this incident marks the first time Hong Kong journalists have been arrested under suspicion of violating the national security law. \nIn a press conference on Thursday, Hong Kong security chief John Lee said Apple Daily's actions \"targeted the use of journalistic work as a tool to endanger national security\". \nMr Lee also added that they were not \"normal journalists\", calling on others to \"keep a distance from them\". \nSome reporters from the paper told the BBC they planned to continue printing, but they now fear that today's events - both the arrests and the freezing of assets - may mark the beginning of the end for Apple Daily. \nLai is one of the most prominent supporters of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. \nEstimated to be worth more than $1bn (\u00a3766m), he made his initial fortune in the clothing industry and later ventured into media and founded Next Digital.\nIn his last interview with the BBC before he was sentenced to jail, he said he would not give in to intimidation.\n\"If they can induce fear in you, that's the cheapest way to control you and the most effective way and they know it. The only way to defeat the way of intimidation is to face up to fear and don't let it frighten you,\" he said.\nHe is currently facing time in jail for a series of charges, including participating in an unauthorised assembly in 2019.\nThe law was introduced in 2020 in response to massive pro-democracy protests that swept the city state the previous year. \nIt essentially reduced Hong Kong's judicial autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators. It criminalises secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces with the maximum sentence life in prison.\nBeijing said the law would target \"sedition\" and bring stability, but critics have said it violates the agreement under which Britain handed back Hong Kong to China in 1997.  \nThe handover agreement saw the creation of the Basic Law under the \"one country, two systems\" principle.\nThis is supposed to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - freedoms that no other part of mainland China has.\nFears that this model was being eroded were what led to the huge pro-democracy protests in 2019. \nSince the law was enacted in June, more than 100 people have been arrested under its provisions, including Lai.

More women were also choosing to buy comfortable, \"althleisure\" inspired underwear.\nVictoria's Secret held its last show in 2018 before confirming its cancellation the following year as viewing figures fell to 3.3 million.\nA spokesperson for Victoria's Secret said: \"As an entertainment brand, with a huge cultural footprint we are reimagining what a fashion show could look like for us in the future.\" \nThe company announced The VS Collective - which it described as \"a dramatic shift for our brand\" - as it prepares to cut ties with its parent company L Brands in a spin-off later this year.\nMartin Waters, Victoria's Secret chief executive - the fourth appointed in five years - told The New York Times that \"right now\" he did not see the Angels as being \"culturally relevant\".\nMs Rapinoe, an LGBTQIA+ activist, was more blunt in her assessment of the company's past image, describing it as \"patriarchal, sexist, viewing not just what it meant to be sexy but what the clothes were trying to accomplish through a male lens and through what men desired\".\nShe added that it was \"very much marketed toward younger women\", a message which she said was \"really harmful.\"\nThe Victoria's Secret show was the brainchild of L Brands' former chief marketing officer Ed Razek who resigned from the firm in 2019. The previous year he had come under fire for making a transphobic remark. He also said audiences had no interest in seeing plus-size models.\nValentina Sampaio, an LGBTQIA+ activist who became Victoria's Secret's first openly transgender model two years ago just before Mr Razek resigned, has also joined the firm's \"collective\" alongside plus-sized model and \"body advocate\" Paloma Elsesser.\nVictoria's Secret was bought by billionaire Les Wexner in 1982. Mr Wexner, the former chief executive of L Brands, recently announced that he would not stand for re-election as chairman emeritus.\nIn 2019, Mr Wexner came under fire for his long friendship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He employed Mr Epstein to manage his finances but cut ties with him in 2007. Mr Wexner said he was \"embarrassed\" by his friendship with Mr Epstein.\nCommenting on why Victoria's Secret was launching the new partnership now, Mr Waters told The New York Times: \"I've known that we needed to change this brand for a long time, we just haven't had the control of the company to be able to do it.\"\nMr Waters joined L Brands in 2008, overseeing its international division, before taking over as Victoria's Secret's new boss in November last year."

      "text": "The bosses of Jet2, Easyjet and Manchester Airport have criticised the government for not putting the Balearic Islands, including Majorca, on the green travel list. \nThe boss of Jet2 said he was \"bewildered\" over why they couldn't fly to those destinations.\nWhile UK travel is limited, Germans are flocking to popular holiday spots.\nThe government said it would continue to explore how to open international travel safely.\nCurrently very few countries are on the government's green list, which means they are approved for leisure travel, requiring less testing and no quarantine on return.\n\"When you take the UK government's own criteria for deciding where holidaymakers can travel to, and apply it to the Balearics, we are left bewildered as to why we cannot fly there,\" said Jet2 and Jet2 Holidays' chief executive Steve Heapy.\nCharlie Cornish, chief executive of Manchester Airport Group (MAG) said EU countries were taking a more positive approach to resuming international travel.\n\"Hundreds of thousands of people from places like Germany are travelling freely and safely to low-risk holiday destinations,\" he said.\nMAG has joined with low cost airline Ryanair to launch a legal action against the government over its traffic light system, particularly focusing on the lack of transparency over how countries are classified.\nThe Spanish island of Majorca, a favourite of British tourists for decades, is currently on the amber list; travel there is not advised and quarantine is required on return to the UK.\nBut rates of the virus are lower there than in the UK and in recent weeks, German tourists have started arriving in Majorca in large numbers. German travellers need just a digital pre-registration and either an antigen test or proof of vaccination.\nDutch and Belgian tourists are also flying to the Balearics but in fewer numbers than those travelling from Germany.\nPalma de Majorca Airport confirmed to the BBC that during May, 397,931 tourists arrived from Germany on 3,363 flights. In contrast 5,813 UK tourists arrived on 333 flights from UK airports.\nLocal businesses in the Balearics that usually rely on British tourists and their holiday spending, are feeling their absence for a second summer.\nMark Steenson owns Francey O'Connor's, an Irish pub in Ca'n Picafort, a Majorca resort that usually welcomes thousands of British holiday-makers.\nBut with Brits still advised not to travel there, he has begun to gear his trade to those who can. \n\"I went and got a Borussia Dortmund shirt and had the bar sign redone in German to get the German football fans in,\" said Mr Steenson.\n\"If it weren't for the Germans, we'd be broke. Ca'n Picafort is rammed with Germans,\" he said. \"It is a joy to see.\"\nBut rapid adjustments have had to be made, he says: \"I've gone out and bought German beers and I've started trying to learn some German words so I can chat to them.\"\nThe Germany and France game in the Euro 2020 tournament earlier this week was a big pull and for the first time this summer, the terrace at Francey O'Connor's filled up.\nBut while German visitors are a lifeline for Mark Steenson, the absence of their British counterparts has angered Manchester Airport Group boss, Charlie Cornish. \nThe UK's current traffic light system had not recognised the progress many countries have made in reducing rates of the virus, he said.\n\"The government's lack of transparency is unacceptable and makes operating a business in the travel sector almost impossible after what has already been the most challenging year in our history.\"\nEpidemiologists worry that mass travel before more people are fully vaccinated, both in the UK and at holiday destinations, will allow the virus to spread more rapidly. And if Covid cases spiral suddenly on holiday islands, it is not clear if healthcare systems there are in a position to manage their care.\nAdded to this, there are now concerns amongst EU nations about the Delta variant now dominant in the UK. The EU has not added the UK to its \"white list\" permitting travel. But this list is only guidance and EU nations can make their own decisions.\nThat's not a pressing issue for most EU governments yet, with the UK's largest tour operators almost completely grounded.\nBut when UK tourists are eventually allowed to travel again, the delays may put them at a price disadvantage, according to Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of the Advantage Travel Partnership.\n\"We are closed for businesses, we really are,\" she said. \"Our counterparts in Germany and Europe are flocking to the Med. \n\"What that will mean is a reduction in product for when we restart, and access to uncompetitive pricing, because everyone else will have picked best rates.\"\n\"As an industry it demonstrates that you can't plan an operation at the last minute. But there is no comprehension in government of the complexity of this story.\"\nEarlier this week, Easyjet announced it was increasing capacity from Germany to Majorca, to cope with swelling holiday demand.  \n\"We've just recently added 150,000 seats from Berlin into Palma to try meet the huge pent-up demand that has been released from those restrictions lifting,\" said Garry Wilson, chief executive of easyJet Holidays. \n\"It is a shame we can't do the same for UK customers, because we know demand is there.\"\nThe government says it is looking at how to reopen international travel, including the idea that travellers who have received both doses of the vaccine would not have to quarantine when they return from amber list destinations. \nJesse Norman, financial secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News: \"We don't want to get left behind by countries who are adopting a two-jabs approach if it can be done safely.\"\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"Our first priority is protecting the public and saving lives, and the traffic light system we have in place categorises countries and territories based on risk, using the latest data.\n\"As set out in the Global Travel Taskforce, we continue to engage with international partners to explore how we can open international travel safely.\"\nLabour said it had repeatedly called for ministers to publish the data and criteria around their traffic light system, but they had refused to do so. \nShadow transport secretary Jim McMahon added: \"When will they deliver on the sector-specific support promised for aviation 15 months ago?

      "text": "The Duchess of Cambridge has launched her own Centre for Early Childhood, to raise awareness of the importance of early years and help \"transform lives\".\nA royal aide said Catherine felt early childhood was the \"social equivalent to climate change\" but it was not discussed \"with the same seriousness\". \nKensington Palace described the centre as \"a landmark step\" in her work.\nThe duchess said she wanted to \"create a happier, more mentally healthy, more nurturing society\". \nAn aide said the development would shape her future focus as a senior royal. \n\"The duchess has made the observation that the more you learn about the science of early childhood, whether it's brain development, social science, what it means for our adult mental health, the more you realise that this is the social equivalent to climate change,\" they said. \n\"But it is not discussed with the same seriousness or strategic intent that that issue is.\"\nIn a video to mark the launch of the Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood, Catherine, wearing a necklace engraved with her children's initials, said: \"Working closely with others, the centre hopes to raise awareness of why the first five years of life are just so important for our future life outcomes, and what we can do as a society to embrace this golden opportunity to create a happier, more mentally healthy, more nurturing society.\n\"By working together, my hope is that we can change the way we think about early childhood, and transform lives for generations to come.\"\nThe centre will focus on research, working with people across the private, public and voluntary sectors on new solutions and campaigning to raise awareness. \nEarly childhood has been a focus of the duchess's decade as a member of the Royal Family, as she has looked at issues including family breakdown, mental health and the school environment. \nLast week, she joined US First Lady Jill Biden at a school in Cornwall to discuss early years development. \nLord Hague, chairman of the Royal Foundation set up by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, said the centre's launch was a \"pivotal moment\" in Catherine's work on the issue. \nThe centre's inaugural report, Big Change Starts Small, which has been written in collaboration with the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University and the London School of Economics, revealed that the cost of a lack of action in early childhood - from children in care to mental health issues - is \u00a316.1 bn each year in England alone.\nResearch by YouGov, commissioned by the Foundation and published on Friday - the final day of loneliness week - shows parents of young children have continued to feel lonelier as the pandemic has progressed. \nSome 9% always or often felt lonely in October 2020, compared with 16% in May 2021.\nIn November, the duchess published research on the role of early years in shaping adulthood, which found that only one in four people recognised the importance of the first five years of a child's life. \nMore than half a million people took part in the \"five big questions on the under-fives\" Ipsos Mori poll - the biggest public response to a survey of its kind."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nYounger people who have not yet had their vaccines are\u00a0driving much of the growth of the Covid epidemic in England, a study suggests.\u00a0Most cases were found in five\u00a0to 12-year-olds and 18\u00a0to 24-year-olds, researchers from Imperial College London discovered. They say the rollout of jabs to younger people is key to reducing further spread. The analysis, from the React-1 study, looked at the period 20 May to 7 June. But tentative signs in the latest daily data suggest growth may be beginning to slow.\nA legal challenge over the government's traffic light system for trips abroad is due to launched by members of the travel industry. Ryanair and the owner of Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports are calling for more transparency about how the government decides which countries qualify for the green list of safe places to visit amid the pandemic. The system currently rates countries green, amber or red based on their Covid risk, which ministers say \"cautiously manages the risk of new variants\".\nCuts to the UK's aid budget will leave millions of people at risk of dying from \"neglected tropical diseases\", the World Health Organization has said. It comes after the annual foreign aid budget was reduced from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income - a cut of almost \u00a34bn - due to the pandemic. The Foreign Office said it had been forced to take tough decisions to leave programmes that treated these diseases. This will mean almost 280 million lifesaving tablets are likely to expire and have to be incinerated due to the withdrawal of UK money, according to the United Nations agency. However, ministers say \u00a310bn will be still spent in 2021, with \u00a31.3bn on global health.\nIndia's holiest river, the Ganges, is one of the most polluted in the world but a new environmental crisis is looming due to the country's second wave of Covid. Watch the report to find out more.\nYou're struggling to make anything for lunch or dinner - or tea as it's known in some places in the UK - and you reach for your phone to get something in. Who's done it? According to consumer watchdog Which? food-delivery apps have experienced a huge boost during the pandemic. But a snapshot from its investigation suggests they may not be the cheapest option. It compared the costs of meals from five providers, bought directly and ordered on apps - and on average, a takeaway cost 23% more on an app. Read more here.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nRising coronavirus infections rates have led to a four-week delay in all restrictions being lifted in England.

      "title": "Biden and Putin praise Geneva summit talks but discord remains",
      "tags": "Geneva,Cyber-attacks",
      "text": "The presidents of the US and Russia have praised their talks in Geneva but have made little concrete progress at the first such meeting since 2018. \nDisagreements were stated, said US President Joe Biden, but not in a hyperbolic way, and he said Russia did not want a new Cold War.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said Mr Biden was an experienced statesman and the two \"spoke the same language\".\nThe talks lasted around three hours, less time than was scheduled.\nMr Biden said they did not need to spend more time talking and there was now a genuine prospect to improve relations with Russia. \nAs a gift to the Russian leader, Mr Biden brought Mr Putin a custom-made pair of aviator sunglasses, a style favoured by the US president, and a crystal sculpture of a bison. It is unclear whether Mr Putin gave Mr Biden a gift. In 2018, the Russian leader gave former President Donald Trump a soccer ball after a meeting in Helsinki, Finland.  \nThe two sides agreed to begin a dialogue on nuclear arms control. They also said they would return ambassadors to each other's capitals - the envoys were mutually withdrawn for consultations in March, after the US accused Russia of meddling in the 2020 presidential election. \nHowever, there was little sign of agreement on other issues, including cyber-security, Ukraine and the fate of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is currently serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence in a penal colony. \nMr Biden said there would be \"devastating consequences\" for Russia if Navalny died in prison.\nBefore the summit, both sides said relations were at rock bottom. \nMr Putin hinted at a possible deal on exchanging prisoners, saying he believed compromises could be found. \nOn cyber-attacks, Mr Putin brushed away accusations of Russian responsibility, saying that most cyber-attacks in Russia originated from the US. \nMr Biden said he told Mr Putin that critical infrastructure, such as water or energy, must be \"off-limits\" to hacking or other attacks.\n\"I looked at him and said how would you feel if ransomware took on the pipelines from your oil fields? He said it would matter,\" Mr Biden said, adding that if Russia violated these \"basic norms\" the US would retaliate. \nThe two sides differed sharply on human rights, including the right to protest. \nMr Putin dismissed US concerns about Navalny, who recently undertook a 24-day hunger strike. \nHe said Navalny had ignored the law and knew he would face imprisonment when he returned to Russia after having sought medical treatment in Germany. Navalny says he was poisoned with a nerve agent on Mr Putin's orders - an accusation Mr Putin denies. \nHe said Russia did not want disturbances on its territory comparable to the Capitol riots or the Black Lives Matter movement. \nMr Biden dismissed Mr Putin's comments about Black Lives Matter as \"ridiculous\", and said human rights would \"always be on the table\". \nAsked why Russia would want to co-operate with the US, Mr Biden said it was \"in a very, very difficult spot right now\".\n\"They are being squeezed by China. They want desperately to remain a major power,\" he told reporters, shortly before leaving Geneva.\nAt one point during his press conference, the US president appeared to nod in response to a reporter who asked if he trusted Mr Putin. But the White House sent a tweet out soon after saying Mr Biden was \"very clearly not responding to any one question, but nodding in acknowledgment to the press generally\". \nWhen a CNN journalist asked why Mr Biden was confident Mr Putin would change his behaviour, the US president became visibly irritated, retorting: \"If you don't understand that, you're in the wrong business.\" He later apologised for being a \"wise guy\". \nBBC Moscow correspondent Sarah Rainsford says Mr Putin was keen to underline several times that Russia was a nuclear power - an important country, with an economy smaller than that of the US, but one that still mattered and that was why Mr Biden had come to talk to him.\nWhat is the metric for success following this summit? I think that Joe Biden will see a success as the fact that they engaged in detailed conversations about the knottiest issues around. \nI think Mr Biden - for a domestic audience - also wanted to prove that the 'America is back' tour also means 'I'm not Donald Trump'. And I think he was very keen to underline this in his news conference that I attended a little while ago. \nBut as Mr Biden goes back to the US now on Air Force One, he said: \"We will respond if Russia doesn't do what we want, on cyber, on human rights and the rest of it.\" But respond how? That's the bit of it that is unclear. \nAnd I'm sure Mr Putin returning to Moscow will be thinking: \"Well, he said all these things, but what's he going to do about it?\" Mr Putin has seen down Western leaders before. Maybe he will think that Mr Biden is a different sort of American president. \nBut I think that Mr Putin is going to test his boundaries, and Mr Biden will eventually have to decide how he is going to respond."

      "tags": "Kim Jong-un,North Korea",
      "text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has formally acknowledged that his country is facing food shortages. \nAddressing a meeting of senior leaders, Mr Kim said: \"The people's food situation is now getting tense\". \nHe said the agricultural sector had failed to meet its grain targets due to typhoons last year, which caused flooding.\nThere are reports that food prices have spiked, with NK News reporting that a kilogram of bananas costs $45 (\u00a332).\nNorth Korea has closed its borders to contain the spread of Covid-19. \nTrade with China has plummeted as a result. North Korea relies on China for food, fertiliser and fuel. \nNorth Korea is also struggling under international sanctions, imposed because of its nuclear programmes. \nThe authoritarian leader of the single-party state talked about the food situation at the ruling Workers' Party central committee which started this week in the capital Pyongyang.\nDuring the meeting, Mr Kim said that national industrial output had grown by a quarter compared to the same period last year.\nOfficials were expected to discuss relations with the US and South Korea during the event but no details have been released yet.\nIn April, Mr Kim made a a rare admission of looming hardship, calling on officials to \"wage another, more difficult 'Arduous March' in order to relieve our people of the difficulty, even a little\".\nThe Arduous March is a term used by North Korea officials to refer to the country's struggle during the 1990s famine, when the fall of the Soviet Union left North Korea without crucial aid. \nThe total number of North Koreans who starved to death at the time is not known, but estimates range up to three million.\nIt is highly unusual for Kim Jong-un to publicly acknowledge a food shortage. But this is a North Korean leader who has already admitted that his economic plan has failed. \nThe problem for Mr Kim is that when he took over from his father, he promised his people a more prosperous future. He said they would have meat on their tables and access to electricity. This has not happened. Now he's having to prime the population for more hard work. \nHe is trying to tie this into the global pandemic, and state media reported that he pointed out to party officials that the situation across the world is getting \"worse and worse\". With so little access to outside information, he can paint a picture of things being bad everywhere - not just in sealed off North Korea. He also described efforts to beat Covid-19 as a \"protracted war\". That signals that border closures are not easing any time soon. \nThat is the concern of many aid organisations. The sealed border has prevented some food and medicine getting through. Most NGOs have had to leave the country, unable to get staff and supplies in or out.\nPyongyang has always called for \"self-reliance\". It has closed itself off, just as it may need assistance and it is unlikely to ask for help. If it continues to push away all offers of international assistance, as ever, it may be the people who pay the price. "

      "tags": "Russia,Geneva,Vladimir Putin,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The Geneva summit between Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden on 16 June will not be a friendly encounter. \nFor a start, Russia recently included the US on its official list of \"unfriendly states\".\nBoth sides describe relations as at rock bottom and neither currently has an ambassador in-country; senior Russian officials are under American sanctions for everything from annexing Ukraine's Crimea to alleged election meddling, and two former US marines are now in Russian prisons - one serving 16 years accused of espionage. \nOn top of all that, there's the moment in March when Joe Biden agreed with an interviewer that Vladimir Putin was \"a killer\".\nAnd yet, the two men are set to meet as presidents for the first time, and some in Russia see that as an achievement in itself.\n\"The summit is important in terms of symbolism; it puts Russia in the same league as the US, and for Putin symbolism is not unimportant,\" says Andrei Kortunov, director of the RIAC think-tank in Moscow.\nThe meeting comes early in Mr Biden's time in the White House, on his first foreign trip and at his request - all bonus points for the Kremlin. It's also a full summit - not a brief encounter appended to some other event. \nAnd despite a packed agenda, including meetings at Nato headquarters in Brussels on Monday, there's particular interest in Joe Biden's final stop on his European trip, his one-on-one on Wednesday with Vladimir Putin.\n\"Putin definitely wants to be equal to the US president. He wants to be respected on his terms,\" political analyst Lilia Shevtsova agrees. \"Putin wants to demonstrate macho muscle and to be a member of the club.\"\nThe choice of Geneva as a setting harks back to a Cold War encounter in 1985: the first summit between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. But there's little prospect that this week's event will match that either for personal rapport or political thaw.\nToday's White House says its aim is a \"stable\" and \"predictable\" relationship with Russia. But keeping people guessing - and wary - has been Vladimir Putin's way ever since his \"little green men\" entered Crimea in 2014 and the peninsula was annexed from Ukraine.\nIt was the start of this slide in Russia-US relations.\n\"A more feasible goal would be to test where each other's 'red lines' lie,\" Ms Shevtsova suggests, as well as \"an understanding that dialogue is the way back from the abyss\".\n'If they're not talking, then Russia will become more unpredictable,\" she argues.\nThis weekend, Vladimir Putin told state TV there were \"issues where we can work together\" with the US, starting with new nuclear arms control talks, discussing regional conflicts including Syria and Libya, and climate change. \n\"If we can create mechanisms for working on those issues, then I think we can say the summit was not in vain,\" Mr Putin argued. \nSome in Russia suggest a truce in the \"diplomatic wars\" may also be possible: the US has expelled dozens of Russian diplomats and shut down two compounds in recent years; now US missions in Russia are to be barred from employing locals, meaning dramatic cuts in services including visas.\nMoscow might allow its ambassador back to Washington as a minimum move.\nThe US will also raise the fate of its prisoners in Russia, including Paul Whelan who was arrested in 2018 and convicted of espionage, which he has always denied. \nRussia recently renewed its push for a prisoner-swap - but its terms have so far been impossible for the US to meet, and a unilateral gesture of generosity by Mr Putin seems unlikely. \nRussia's president has gone out of his way lately to underline his view of the West as hostile.\nAt this month's Economic Forum in St Petersburg, he claimed again that the US wants to \"contain\" Russia's development. \nA few days earlier, he had threatened to \"knock out the teeth\" of any foreign aggressor who wants to \"bite\" Russia, insisting that the world needs to wake-up to the country's restored status and strength.\n\"Clearly he believes the US is an adversary that doesn't wish Russia well, and I don't think this vision will change,\" Mr Kortunov says.\nEven so, he argues that Russia may be looking to lower the temperature a notch or two.\n\"As a rational politician, Putin would like to reduce the costs and risks associated with this adversarial relationship,\" Mr Kortunov believes. \nThat includes economic sanctions: the latest round restricted the government's capacity to raise funds and new steps could be further reaching, adding more strain to the economy in a key election year. \n\"The Russian public has no appetite for foreign policy 'victories' now as a substitute for addressing burning social and economic problems at home,\" Mr Kortunov says. \"Whatever Putin might want, I don't think he can gain anything [domestically] by escalating.\"\nWhat Vladimir Putin doesn't want, but is braced for, is a lecture on human rights - including the case of Alexei Navalny, Russia's opposition politician first poisoned and now in prison.\nNavalny's political offices and anti-corruption organisation have just been banned as \"extremist\" by a Moscow court, a ruling that could easily have been delayed until after the summit. \nInstead, the timing seems meant to send a message: that Vladimir Putin will continue to crush dissent and that is none of America's business.  \n\"Biden will do his song - his prelude about Navalny and human rights; then Putin will do his song - that the US is the same,\" Ms Shevtsova predicts, dryly. \n\"But the fact this meeting is taking place means that after the human rights 'hors d'oeuvre', they'll move on to the main dish. And that is: let's do something to lower the tension.\""

      "text": "All adults in Wales have been offered a Covid jab, which the Welsh government says is six weeks ahead of schedule.\nData published by Public Health Wales on Monday showed 2,216,031 people have been given a first vaccine dose - 70.3% of the population.\nWales' vaccine rollout is ahead of every world nation with a population of more than one million people.\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan said reaching the milestone before the original July target was \"remarkable\".\nWales remains ahead of the other UK nations in the total proportion of the population given a first jab.\nClinics are now accelerating second doses amid growing concerns about the spread of the delta variant.\n\"Wales is leading the world when it comes to the percentage of our population who have been vaccinated,\" said Baroness Morgan.\n\"However, we are not being complacent. I want to encourage younger adults to take up this offer of the vaccine and we don't want to see anyone left behind. \n\"We are keen to see 18 to 39-year-olds vaccinated and hope to reach our milestone of 75% take-up in this age group by the end of this month. \n\"Please take up your vaccine appointment; it offers protection to you, your loved ones and your communities and it is our best route out of the pandemic.\"\nIn the meantime Wales' case rate has risen again, climbing to 18.4 per 100,000 people, the highest since 16 April.\nThis is not unexpected, give the easing of restrictions and is still well below the other UK nations and all English regions.\nHowever there are growing concerns over the spread of the Delta variant which is now the dominant strain in Wales.\nOfficials plan to offer second doses to adults by September, while jabs for schoolchildren and boosters for older groups may be offered in the autumn.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford promised the second jab programme would be as quick as the first, if supplies allow.\nWales is slightly behind England and Scotland when it comes to fully vaccinating people. In all, 1,384,673 people (43.9%) here have now had a second jab.\nWhile take-up in some groups is exceptionally high, such as 90% among over-50s, there is concern that some people have still not accepted a vaccine.\nThe head of the Welsh government's vaccine programme said planning was already underway to begin offering a third booster jab from September - or possibly sooner if supplies allow.\nVolunteers in Wrexham have already been given a third Covid vaccine as part of a UK-wide trial.\n\"We are planning for various scenarios. That will involve supply, whether people have the same vaccine as they had the last time and who will get done,\" said Dr Richardson.\n\"We know the most vulnerable, those over-80, those in care homes, the groups that were one to four, they would be the first in line because they were the first to have the vaccine.\"\nDr Richardson, however, she was worried about low vaccination rates among some ethnic minority communities and deprived communities.\n\"We are doing a lot of engagement trying to understand why some people are not taking up the offer,\" Dr Gill Richardson told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"We know there are pockets, particularly in some of ethnic minority and our most deprived communities.\n\"We are worried about the black-Caribbean and black-African up-take, in the middle years. We are appealing that vaccination matters for black lives because you are more at risk.\""

      "text": "The UK faces shortages of British-produced meat as problems with recruitment continue, the industry has warned.\nBrexit and coronavirus have meant many EU workers have returned to their own countries, putting a squeeze on production.\nThe poultry industry is reporting a 10% fall in the number of birds being slaughtered for meat in recent weeks.\nBut vegans said the labour shortage could \"spark much-needed change\".\nAbout a billion birds are slaughtered, prepared and packed in the UK per year, with the industry heavily reliant on EU nationals, especially for lower-skilled jobs.\nBut migrants have been returning to their home countries due to Brexit effects including a weaker pound, a trend exacerbated by the coronavirus crisis, the British Poultry Council (BPC) said. \nOnce they get home, many decide not to return.\nMeat producers have been trying to counter these effects by increasing automation and raising wages for workers.\nNevertheless, skill shortages persist, especially in rural areas with high employment rates, the BPC said.\nThe industry group called on the government to ease post-Brexit immigration rules to make it easier to attract EU workers. \nChief executive Richard Griffiths said: \"We generally operate in areas of high local employment so there is a limit to availability of UK workers and there is negligible appetite from UK workers to move from other parts of the country.\n\"When it comes to non-UK labour - either from the EU or further afield - we have seen reducing numbers willing to come to the UK, the immigration barriers of salary and skill have been raised way beyond what we can manage, and the cost of bringing people is prohibitive.\"\nMr Griffiths warned that lack of supply could push up the cost of British meat.\nThis risks creating a \"two-tier\" system where the UK imports food produced to lower standards, such as chlorinated chicken from the US, and only the affluent can afford higher quality British meat, the BPC said.\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it was working hard to ensure that producers across the UK have the support and workforce that they need.\"\n\"We would like to see the sector highlight the domestic opportunities available. Food and farming businesses will also be able to employ EU nationals with settled or pre-settled status to help meet their labour demand,\" it added.\nThe beef, pork and lamb meat sector is also suffering a labour shortfall, an industry body said.\nThe meat industry is \"two or three weeks away from a real problem\", British Meat Processors Association chief executive Nick Allen said.\nSome of the biggest meat producers are on the verge of telling farmers they do not have the capacity to process their livestock, he said.\nWhile it's good news that the hospitality industry is opening up as coronavirus restrictions relax, this is putting an added strain on meat production, he said.\nHowever, the Vegan Society said that the situation could have ecological and animal welfare benefits.\nIt said low or no-meat lifestyles including veganism were becoming more popular as people realised the environmental benefits of eating plant-based proteins.\nPeople have been eating less meat over the past decade, most likely for environmental and health reasons, although consumption is still relatively high in the UK.\n\"This labour shortage could potentially spark much needed change, and be a positive outcome for animals and the environment,\" a Vegan Society spokeswoman said.\n\"We hope to see farmers gradually moving away from farming animals to growing crops for human consumption by providing food for the growing vegan population.\"\nThe Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, a non-departmental public body funded by a levy on farmers and growers, said that the number of households buying red meat increased by about 1% during the pandemic, while the number of households buying meat-free remained flat.\nThere were rises in both meat and meat-free sales, it said.\nIn addition, it said that more than 60% of agricultural land in the UK was only suitable for growing grass, and not suitable for crops."

Local lockdowns have also disrupted businesses in Asia which make cycles.\nThe Bicycle Association said: \"Most bicycles in the world are manufactured in East Asia, and even those which are assembled in the EU often require components shipped from that region. This extended supply chain does mean that, even in normal circumstances, delivery times are long.\n\"Sudden increases in global demand put additional pressure on production and, particularly recently, there have been constraints on shipping.

Pre-tax profits rose to \u00a364.5m from \u00a319.4m for the previous year.\nLooking ahead, the bike and motoring retailer said: \"A return to normal trading patterns remains highly uncertain, particularly in the second half, as the hospitality industry and international travel potentially reopen to a greater extent.\"\nNevertheless, Halfords said it has seen \"positive momentum\" continue into the first weeks of its current financial year \"with demand for our motoring services strong, cycling demand remaining elevated, and staycation products\" proving popular.\nOver the last year, it said sales of products related to people holidaying in the UK and motor maintenance had grown, including services such as car cleaning and body repair.\nAs well as bike shops, garages were also allowed to stay open during periods of Covid lockdown and Halfords said like-for-like revenue from its \"autocentres\" grew by 9.7%.\nHowever, due to fewer cars being on the road as people worked from home, like-for-like sales within its retail motoring business fell by 12.1%.\nIt said this was \"against the backdrop of 25% fewer car journeys and low consumer confidence\"."

      "title": "Nuclear energy: Fusion plant backed by Jeff Bezos to be built in UK",
      "text": "A company backed by Amazon's Jeff Bezos is set to build a large-scale nuclear fusion demonstration plant in Oxfordshire. \nCanada's General Fusion is one of the leading private firms aiming to turn the promise of fusion into a commercially viable energy source.\nThe new facility will be built at Culham, home to the UK's national fusion research programme. \nIt won't generate power, but will be 70% the size of a commercial reactor.\nGeneral Fusion will enter into a long-term commercial lease with the UK Atomic Energy Authority following the construction of the facility at the Culham campus. \nWhile commercial details have not been disclosed, the development is said to cost around $400m.\nIt aims to be operational by 2025.\nFusion is the process by which the Sun generates energy. Harnessing it here on Earth is seen as a critical step towards greener nuclear power.\nIt differs from the traditional nuclear approach by attempting to fuse atoms together rather than splitting them.\nIn theory, fusion promises a safer, carbon-free energy source that produces very little radioactive waste. \nBut getting atoms to fuse together at temperatures several times hotter than the surface of the Sun has proven a huge technological and financial challenge. \nA major international effort to build a fusion reactor is underway in the south of France with the Iter project. \nBut this $20bn dollar venture has been hampered by delays and isn't likely to be working effectively until after 2035.\nFrustrated by the slow progress, private companies across the world have been following their own approaches, and General Fusion's effort is seen as one of the most advanced.\nBacked by Jeff Bezos for over a decade, the company raised $100m in its last round of funding and is preparing to go back to investors for more cash to show that the firm's technology can be successfully scaled up.\nThe company uses an approach called magnetised target fusion. \nIn this process, a super-heated gas called a plasma, consisting of a particular form of hydrogen, is injected into a cylinder which is surrounded by a wall of liquid metal. \nHundreds of pneumatic pistons are then used to compress the plasma until the atoms fuse, generating massive amounts of heat. \nThis heat is transferred by the liquid metal, and used to boil water and make steam to drive a turbine. \nThe company says that a key advantage of their approach is that much of the technology exists in industry already.\nThis is a very different approach to that being taken by other fusion programmes, at Culham for example.\nThe campus is owned and managed by the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) and is also the location of major fusion research efforts: the Joint European Torus (Jet) and Mast Upgrade. \n\"Coming to Culham gives us the opportunity to benefit from UKAEA's expertise,\" said Christofer Mowry, the chief executive of General Fusion. \n\"By locating at this campus, General Fusion expands our market presence beyond North America into Europe, broadening our global network of government, institutional, and industrial partners.\n\"This is incredibly exciting news for not only General Fusion, but also the global effort to develop practical fusion energy.\"\nThe decision to locate the demonstration plant in Oxfordshire was made possible by funding from the UK government, with the monetary amount described by Christofer Mowry in wire agency reports as \"very meaningful\".\nWhile UK ministers were positive about the development, they wouldn't be drawn on the amount of taxpayer's money involved.  \nThe government says the agreement with General Fusion will support hundreds of jobs both in Oxfordshire and beyond, during the 3-year construction phase, as well as many others during the operational phase. \nThey say it will complement the government's commitment of \u00a3222m for the UKAEA's Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (Step) programme, which aims to design and build the world's first prototype fusion power plant by 2040.\n\"This new plant by General Fusion is a huge boost for our plans to develop a fusion industry in the UK, and I'm thrilled that Culham will be home to such a cutting-edge and potentially transformative project,\" said UK Science Minister Amanda Solloway.\n\"Fusion energy has great potential as a source of limitless, low-carbon energy, and today's announcement is a clear vote of confidence in the region and the UK's status as a global science superpower.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "title": "Covid: Epidemic growing across England, says study",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Covid-19 epidemic in England is growing, scientists tracking it say - with much of it being driven by younger people who are not yet vaccinated.\nThe analysis, from the React-1 study, looked at the period 20 May to 7 June. \nHowever, tentative signs in the latest daily data suggest growth may be beginning to slow.\nThe rollout of vaccinations to younger people is key to reducing further spread, researchers from Imperial College London say.\nSince last year, the team has been inviting a representative sample of the population to take Covid swab tests. The researchers found:\nThe analysis also suggests a strengthening link between cases and hospital admissions, which is also reflected in the government's daily coronavirus data.\nThe number of new infections is rising, with a seven-day average of 8,404 cases. The UK recorded 11,007 cases on Thursday - the highest number since 12,027 were reported on 19 February. \nThe number of hospitalisations has also increased, with 1,177 patients in hospital as of Monday. However, daily deaths remain low, with a weekly average of nine deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nA further 19 deaths were reported on Thursday.\nProf Paul Elliot, who directs the study, said: \"We can take quite a lot of comfort from the fact that when we look in the details, it does appear that there is very, very good protection in the older ages, where there is virtually everyone double vaccinated.\n\"The government has clearly announced that they want to vaccinate all adults in the period between now and 19 July. That will make a very big difference and increase the total amount of population immunity.\"\nHe told BBC News that the study had found the Delta variant first seen in India had overtaken the Alpha (Kent) variant as the UK's dominant strain, and was responsible for an estimated 90% of infections.\nEngland's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said Covid-19 had \"not thrown its last surprise at us\", warning that he is anticipating case rates will continue to rise over the next few weeks due to the Delta variant being \"significantly more transmissible\" than the Alpha variant.\nHe told the NHS Confed Conference he expected a \"further winter surge\" and said he thought new variants may well lead to booster jabs or revaccination being required over the next two to three years.\nThe picture presented by React is one from 10 days ago. But if we look at the daily figures published by the government, there are some encouraging signs, albeit very tentative.\nLast week, cases appeared to be doubling every 10 days, but this week that has slowed to something closer to 14 days. \nIt still means the epidemic is growing - but it is the first sign of a flattening of cases. \nThis, of course, could be a false dawn. The rise in infections has largely been driven by north-west England- the top 20 local-authority areas with the highest rates are all in that region. \nInfections could easily take off in other areas, speeding up the growth of this wave. \nBut if this slowing of growth holds, it is very positive. \nGovernment scientists had feared rapid growth right up to 19 July. \nThis would drive up hospital admissions, albeit, because of the vaccines, at a lower rate than in previous waves. \nIt is still early days, but data is now a little more encouraging than it was. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson cited the Delta variant's rapid spread when he announced a four-week delay to the lifting of remaining Covid restrictions in England\nThe government has accelerated its vaccination drive, setting a new target to vaccinate all over-18s with a first dose and two-thirds of adults with a second dose by the same date.\nEveryone aged 18 and over in England will be able to book their Covid-19 vaccine from Friday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced at the NHS conference.\nHe said a first dose had now been given to four out of five adults (80.1%). \nAs of Wednesday more than 30 million people - 58.2% of adults - have had both doses.\nNew figures published by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday suggest people who test positive for Covid after being vaccinated are less likely to show symptoms and have less of the virus in their body.\nThe ONS analysis swabbed people at random and picked up asymptomatic infections as well as cases that show up in the daily case numbers.\nIt showed that the risk of getting infected was highest in the first three weeks after vaccination and fell after a second vaccination. Just under 40% of people who did get infected after vaccination showed symptoms. \nThere have been about 16,000 suspected cases of coronavirus reinfection detected in England, out of nearly four million cases, according to Public Health England data, although only 53 have been confirmed.\nIn other coronavirus developments:"

      "tags": "China,International Space Station,Space exploration",
      "text": "China has launched three astronauts into orbit to begin occupation of the country's new space station.\nThe three men - Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo - are to spend three months aboard the Tianhe module some 380km (236 miles) above the Earth.\nIt will be China's longest crewed space mission to date and the first in nearly five years.\nThe crew successfully docked with the space station just over seven hours after the launch. \nThe moment of contact was met with applause from mission control in China. \nTheir Shenzhou-12 capsule took off atop its Long March 2F rocket on Thursday. \nLift-off from the Jiuquan satellite launch centre in the Gobi desert was at 09:22 Beijing time (01:22 GMT).\nThe launch and subsequent mission are another demonstration of China's growing confidence and capability in the space domain.\nIn the past six months, the country has returned rock and soil samples to Earth from the surface of the Moon, and landed a six-wheeled robot on Mars - both highly complex and challenging endeavours.\nThe primary objective for Commander Nie Haisheng and his team on the Shenzhou-12 mission is to bring the 22.5-tonne Tianhe module into service. \n\"I have a lot of expectations,\" Mr Nie said ahead of the launch. \n\"We need to set up our new home in space and test a series of new technologies. So, the mission is tough and challenging. I believe with the three of us working closely together, doing thorough and accurate operations, we can overcome our challenges. We have the confidence to complete the mission.\"\nThis 16.6m-long, 4.2m-wide Tianhe cylinder was launched in April.\nIt is the first and core component in what will eventually be a near 70-tonne orbiting outpost, comprising living quarters, science labs and even a Hubble-class telescope to view the cosmos.\nThe various elements will be launched in turn over the course of the next couple of years. The construction will be accompanied by regular cargo deliveries, as well as crew expeditions. \nThe Chinese authorities kept the identities of the Shenzhou-12 astronauts under wraps until a press conference on Wednesday.\nA fighter pilot, Nie Haisheng, 56, is said to be China's oldest astronaut in space. \nHe is a veteran of two previous flights, which included a 15-day visit in 2013 to the prototype space station, Tiangong-1. This has since been de-orbited. \nHis crewmates, Liu Boming (54) and Tang Hongbo (45), are also from an air force background. Liu's earlier spaceflight experience was on the Shenzhou-7 mission in 2008 that saw him participate in China's first ever spacewalk.\nMr Tang is the rookie on this occasion, having never before gone into orbit.\nThe food, fuel and equipment the trio will need during their stay aboard Tianhe was delivered by a robotic freighter last month.  \nThis freighter is still attached, and the men will make unpacking its supplies their first task as soon as they've settled in. Included in the delivery are two spacesuits they'll need to conduct spacewalks on the exterior of Tianhe.\nChina has in recent years made no secret of its space ambitions.\nIt has poured significant funding into its space efforts, and in 2019 became the first country to send an un-crewed rover to the far side of the Moon.\nBut it's had to go at it alone in developing a space station, in part because it has been excluded from the International Space Station project. \nThe US, which leads that partnership with Russia, Europe, Canada and Japan, will not co-operate with the Asian nation in orbit.\nFor its part, China says it is open to foreign involvement on its station. In the first instance, this means hosted scientific experiments. For example, the Shenzhou-12 crew will conduct cancer investigations that are led from Norway. And on the outside of the station, there is an Indian-developed telescopic spectrograph to study ultraviolet emissions coming from deep space, from the likes of exploded stars.\nBut, long term, there probably also will be visits to the station by non-Chinese nationals.\nRussia, which has shared technology in the past with China, has mentioned the possibility of sending its cosmonauts.\nAt Wednesday's press conference to introduce the Shenzhou-12 crew, Ji Qiming, an assistant director with China's human spaceflight agency, said: \"We welcome co-operation in this regard in general.\n\"It is believed that, in the near future, after the completion of the Chinese space station, we will see Chinese and foreign astronauts fly and work together,\" he added.\nPresident Xi Jinping has also thrown his support behind the country's space endeavours and the Chinese state media regularly cast the \"space dream\" as one step in the path to \"national rejuvenation\"."

      "text": "David Guetta, the producer behind hits like Titanium, I Got A Feeling and Hey Mama, has sold his back catalogue to Warner Music for a nine-figure sum.\nThe French star made about $100m (\u00a372m) in the deal, which also covers his future recordings, people familiar with the negotiations told the BBC.\nIt comes amid a spending spree on hit songs, with Bob Dylan and Paul Simon's catalogues also selling for millions.\nGuetta is one of the biggest figures in pop and dance in the 21st Century.\nThe 52-year-old has sold 50 million records and racked up more than 14 billion streams, and has worked with Rihanna, Bruno Mars, Justin Bieber, The Black Eyed Peas, Nicki Minaj and Sia.\nHe started off as a DJ in Paris and Ibiza, making his name with an unauthorised remix of David Bowie's Heroes.\nHis first UK number one was 2009's When Love Takes Over, recorded with Destiny's Child singer Kelly Rowland. He is currently back in the top 10 with the Little Mix collaboration Heartbreak Anthem.\nA two-time Grammy winner, Guetta has helped shaped the sound of modern pop - helping introduce America to European dance music through his production work the Black Eyed Peas' I Got A Feeling.\n\"It's rare for an artist to not only define a genre, but transform it,\" said Warner Music boss Max Lousada in a statement. \"David has been doing that for over two decades.\n\"He continues to have an extraordinary impact on the evolution of dance music, while innovating and collaborating with new voices in dynamic ways.\"\nThe acquisition of hit songs has become a major business over the last three years, as streaming opens up new revenue sources for classic hits.\nThe London-based Hipgnosis Songs Fund has led the way, taking a 50% share in Neil Young's back catalogue, as well as obtaining the rights to music by Shakira, the Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Fleetwood Mac guitarist Lindsey Buckingham.\nUniversal Music Group also spent a reported $300m (\u00a3288m) to acquire Bob Dylan's song catalogue; while Sony Music Group has spent $1.4 bn (\u00a31bn) on music-related acquisitions in the six months to the end of May this year - including splashing out a nine-figure sum for Paul Simon's hits.\nThe purpose of these deals is to allow investors to earn royalties every time one of those is played. \nInvestors usually seek out hits that have endured over decades, making Guetta's deal unusual, as his most popular songs were almost exclusively released in the last 10 years.\nThe deal is unique in one other respect - in that Guetta has sold his master recordings, rather than his songwriting rights. \nIt is still unusual for musicians to own their recordings, which are more typically in the control of record labels.\nHowever, Warner Music could be exposing itself to a certain amount of risk with its latest investment, according to industry website Music Business Worldwide.\n\"Some industry observers believe music like Guetta's best-known hits will ultimately be stung by a 'decay' in popularity,\" wrote Tim Ingham.\n\"Others point to the fact that a tune like Guetta's Titanium was released 10 years ago, and continues to maintain a handsome level of streaming popularity.\"\nGuetta is currently the world's eighth most-popular artist on Spotify. His manager, Jean-Charles Carr\u00e9, said several companies had expressed an interest in buying the rights to his songs.\nIn a statement, Guetta added: \"I'm super excited about the new music I'm working on. And even more excited that I have started to play all this new music live to my fans again and they are loving it.\n\"This deal is about having the best people around me to ensure I can keep innovating with exciting new projects, while also working my extensive catalogue and continuing to build my career.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

His wife, 61, pleaded guilty to misdemeanour harassment and was fined $2,000. \nBecause the charges are misdemeanours, the personal injury lawyers can keep their law licences and continue to own firearms. \nJudge David Mason accepted their guilty pleas, but rejected their request to donate Mr McCloskey's rifle in a fundraiser, US media said. \nA grand jury had indicted the couple on felony charges, which would have sent them to jail if convicted. But special prosecutor Richard Callahan said in a statement he opted for misdemeanour charges for a series of factors including \"the age and lack of a criminal record for the McCloskeys, the fact they initially called the police, and the fact that no-one was hurt and no shots were fired\". \nMr Callahan described the demonstrators as a \"racially mixed and peaceful group, including women and children\", who had made a wrong turn on the way to their protest. There was no evidence the group was armed, he said. \nParticipants had marched past the couple's $1.15m mansion on their way to the home of then-St Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson. \nThe protest came weeks after George Floyd's death while in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His murder incited a wave of demonstrations worldwide, with participants demanding racial equality and an end to police brutality. \nThe McCloskeys have since branded themselves as conservative defenders against left-wing rioters. \nIn May, Mr McCloskey announced he would run as a Republican in a bid for a US Senate seat in Missouri.

      "text": "\"I felt like the scum of the earth,\" said Jade, after her third child was taken into care. \"Everybody's looking down on you, you've just had a baby and they're taking it away from you.\"\nJade - not her real name - had her first two children taken into care. \nShe knew she might lose the third - but didn't expect to be summoned to a family court hearing just a couple of days after the baby was born.\nShe is one of many mums who feel they did not have time to prepare for court.\nHer comments come as a new report obtained exclusively by the BBC has recommended a \"wholesale review\" of how care proceedings in England and Wales are conducted at birth, and warns that current practice might compromise parents' human rights. \nIt also found that a mother's chances of having a care application made for her baby very shortly after it is born were far greater in the north-east of England and Yorkshire, than in London.\nCare order applications are usually made when social workers decide a mother is unable to look after her child on her own. The baby will probably go into foster care and it may be adopted.\nThe former head of the Family Court, Sir James Munby, told BBC Radio 4's World at One that the report's findings revealed a \"deeply troubling postcode lottery\" . \nSir James is now chair of the Nuffield Family Justice Observatory, which released the report.\nThe research is based on eight years of court data involving more than 21,000 babies in England and Wales.\nIt found there were more of these applications to take newborn babies into care than eight years ago. \nAnd it found these applications were increasingly issued at very short notice. \nThe report says most care applications for newborns - babies under two weeks - offer seven days' notice or less, with the majority of these with one or two days' notice. This means that the mother has very little time to prepare for a hearing. \nThe researchers also found significant variation between local authorities. \nIn the north-east of England, the data indicated many more newborn babies were being taken in to care - rising from 34 per 10,000 live births in 2012/13 to 83.1 per 10,000 in 2019/20. \nAnd more of these applications were being made at the shortest possible notice - 41% were \"same day\" applications.\nIn London, by contrast, there were far fewer applications to take newborns into care: 24.9 newborn babies per 10,000 live births in 2019/20. And less than 10% of these were same day applications.\nSir James added that more research was needed, saying: \"We now know what is happening but we know far too little about why.\"\nHe said he believed the current approach was leading to miscarriages of justice over the removal of newborns, based on \"what I have seen, what I have heard from others what I have read about and a substantial amount of anecdotal material\".\nIn the case of Jade, who is from the north-west of England but wished to remain anonymous, she said she was still bleeding and dressed in jogging bottoms and a T-shirt when she went to court.\nShe said she could not bring herself to go into the courtroom, but sat outside, feeling \"like the scum of the earth\".\nJade said she had only spoken briefly to her allocated solicitor, and did not know how to argue against the local authority's care application. \nShe returned, dazed, to the hospital, only to discover her daughter had already been taken away.\n\"I went into the ward, into the room and she was gone. And I was told to stay there, until someone came to get me. I looked out of the window and in the car park I could see the social worker taking her in her babyseat to the car. \"\nFor Jade, as for so many mothers in a similar position, it was as though her daughter had died. \"I think about her every day,\" she said. \"I grieve.\"\nAnother mother, Tasia - not her real name, from London, was devastated when, six months pregnant, she learned the local authority were going to take her baby into care. \"It was the last thing I was expecting,\" she said.\nShe was called to court eight days after her son's birth - but the hospital reported she'd taken excellent care of her son. \nThe judge decided they should go to a specialist mother and baby centre. \n\"It was frankly a miracle that the judge decided on very little evidence to give me a chance. I am incredibly incredibly grateful for the opportunity to have gone there. \"\nShe stayed for six months, kept her son, her life is now back on track: she hopes for a career in social care.\nProf Karen Broadhurst, one of the lead authors of the report, said: \"The statistics require us to look much more deeply into this issue.\"\nProf Broadhurst said this wasn't an argument against safeguarding or protecting babies - but about enabling parents to fairly participate in the process. \n\"It's a request for greater humanity. It's harsh enough to remove a baby at birth. So all the more reason why we need to strive for the fairest possible process.\"\nFamily Court judges have been worried about increasing numbers of these short notice cases. \nA working group set up by the most senior family court judge recently expressed concern that some were being issued because of insufficient planning and preparation on the part of local authorities. \nIn a statement, a spokesman for the judiciary welcomed the report, saying it would \"be the basis of further in-depth analysis, qualitative research and review\".\n\"We look forward to working with others across family justice in order to investigate more fully the overall context, experiences and issues which are raised by the data in the report,\" they added.\nCharlotte Ramsden, current president of the Association of Directors of Children's Services said: \"I think its rightly very challenging for us all, in terms of the current experience of families.\n\"The challenge is for us to do everything we can to avoid, reduce the need to remove babies at birth at all, but absolutely where we do that we do it in the best way, and we do it with parents properly represented.\"\nYou can hear Sanchia Berg's full report on BBC Radio 4's World At One."

      "tags": "Abertillery,Swansea,Morriston",
      "text": "Wedding businesses say there is \"no light at the end of the tunnel\" and are relying on personal savings to survive.\nCouples who have planned, cancelled, then re-planned their special day say they are hoping to say \"I do\" instead of \"what can I do?\" as lockdown eases.\nBut with no date set for wedding receptions, there remains confusion over whether plans for 2021 will fall foul of future guidelines.\nThe Welsh government said the law had changed to expand the range of venues.\nA week ago First Minister Mark Drakeford set out how various sectors in society would be reopened - like non-essential shops, hairdressers and outdoor sports - but weddings were not mentioned in his plans. \nOn Friday the Welsh government said as long as case rates remained low and vaccination numbers continued, weddings would be \"considered\" from 22 April.\nAt present receptions are banned and the number of ceremony guests depends on how many people from different households a venue can safely keep 2m apart.\nKris Agland, managing director of venue St Peter's Hall in Cardiff, said the guidance around weddings was \"being handled appallingly\" and called for more dialogue between the hospitality industry and those in power.\n\"There's no clear guidance. It's been a kind of one-size-fits-all approach,\" he said.\n\"Come and see what we're doing - do you feel safe? Why can't someone from the trade be part of their conversations?\"\nHe said he spent about \u00a310,000 making Covid-compliant additions to the venue, which usually hosts 50 to 60 wedding receptions each year.\n\"No-one will book anything until they know what the guidance is,\" he said.\n\"Everything is based on what-ifs. Financially as a business it's crippled it. Personally, it's just got me further and further into debt just like everybody else who owns hospitality businesses. \n\"When things do come back they're going to come back with such a boom that you've got to see yourselves through to that position. But at what stage do people say, 'well I can't see it through'?\"\nWedding photographer Mary Watler-Thomas, from Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, said some ceremonies had been \"surreal\", including couples being told to wear masks during the ceremony.\n\"Last year I was set to cover 20 [weddings] but I had quite a few postponed so ended up doing 10. But this year I'm set to do 27, fingers crossed,\" she said.\n\"When people want to postpone they're worried they won't be able to have all their guests there, they want to postpone but I'm not available for their new date.\n\"Because they haven't given a date for hospitality [couples are] reducing the day to just the ceremony. I've had to reduce the time to two hours where I used to cover 12 hours so it's had a massive impact on income because you're reducing the day by 10 hours.\n\"There's been so much confusion... a lot of questions in the minds of those planning what it'll look like in Wales, so it would be very helpful to have a roadmap in Wales.\"\nClaire Vessey, 46, from Treboeth, Swansea, and her fianc\u00e9e David McQueen, 54, from Morriston, have been together for nine years and put off getting married while caring for Claire's elderly mum, Maureen.\nWhen Maureen, 86, died at the start of the first lockdown, the couple - who had previously had a blessing at the Sacred Heart church in Swansea - decided to make her dream come true.\n\"The wedding would be one thing she would want us to do,\" said Ms Vessey, an administration manager for fire protection services.\n\"Us being happy together, that's what she would have loved. \n\"We incorporated what she would want too, so we can feel like she's there. She loved butterflies so that's part of our theme. She's a massive part of the day.\"\nBut Covid restrictions meant the couple had to plan for various outcomes. They still have not confirmed their guest list.\n\"We booked it for 15 May. It has been so hard with all the restrictions and so many obstacles put in our way,\" said Ms Vessey.\n\"It's like we have been planning two weddings. One for original plans - church wedding with a late reception - and also back-up plans if restrictions do not lift, which is looking like what we will have to go with.\n\"But these plans are all still not confirmed. Everything is up in the air and the weeks are flying by - we never thought it would be so stressful.\"\nDespite the stress, the couple said there were benefits to keeping the wedding simple.\nMs Vessey said: \"When people planned weddings in the past, they planned this big wedding with all these people, but when you break it down it's about two people that really love each other. He's my first real boyfriend and my first love. \n\"It's about David and I now. We've concentrated on what's important for us two, which is what it's really about.\"\nIn Scotland, wedding receptions - but without alcohol - can take place with up to 50 people from 26 April.\nWedding ceremonies in Northern Ireland are currently limited to 25 people and receptions are banned. But dates for lockdown easing reviews are set for 15 April, 13 May and 10 June.\nFrom 29 March in England, weddings can be attended by a maximum of six people. This will rise to 15 after 12 April if Covid rates remain low, increasing to a limit of 30 after 17 May. Receptions are included in the plans, but only in certain venues.\nHelen Pembridge, who runs a bridal boutique in Abertillery, Blaenau Gwent, said many brides who had already had to cancel appointments three or four times were \"desperate\" to get dresses in case there was another lockdown.\n\"Brides I'm getting calls from are not even getting married until October 2022, but they want to get their dresses now because they're afraid they won't be able to if we have to shut again for a couple of months,\" she said.\nThe Welsh government has already set out different rules for weddings at different alert levels. \nAt alert level four, for instance, receptions are banned but at alert level two a maximum of 30 people can attend an indoors reception and 50 outdoors, and venues are still subject to any additional rules set at that time on hospitality.\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \"We know many couples have made the difficult decision to postpone their wedding because of the ongoing pandemic.\n\"The current restrictions allow for the legal marriage ceremony to take place and we have changed the law to expand the range of venues where ceremonies can be performed.\n\"These are challenging times for everyone, especially those working in the events and hospitality sector, but with everyone's help, better times are ahead of us.\""

      "title": "Rape convictions fall to record low in England and Wales",
      "tags": "Sexual violence,Crown Prosecution Service,Crime",
      "text": "The number of rape convictions in England and Wales has fallen to a record low, according to new Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) data.\nIn 2019-20, 1,439 suspects in cases where a rape had been alleged were convicted of rape or another crime - half the number three years ago.\nThe number of completed prosecutions in \"rape-flagged\" cases was the lowest since tracking began in 2009.\nThe CPS said it was \"working hard to reverse the trend\".\nIt has announced a \"five-year blueprint\" to reduce the \"gap\" between reported cases of sexual violence and those which come to court.\nThe initiative involves improved working between CPS lawyers and police, \"fully resourcing\" specialist units for the prosecution of rape and sexual offences and \"clear, proportionate\" legal advice to investigators so they can focus on \"reasonable lines of enquiry\".\nMax Hill QC, the director of public prosecutions, said: \"It is clear that more needs to be done both to encourage victims to come forward with confidence, and to support them through the criminal justice process so the gap between reports of rape and cases that reach the courts can be closed.\"\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that while he does \"accept the scale of the problem\" in falling prosecutions and convictions, \"serious mistakes\" were being made \"three or four years\" ago. These included cases going to court \"which shouldn't have\", said Mr Hill. \nHe denied that the CPS has a \"target\" number of convictions that it applies for rape or any other areas of crime.\nHe added that that the five-year strategy being launched by the CPS is \"saying these are the actions which we will take together with our partners in the police to address what we recognise is a real problem\".\nThe CPS began closely tracking details of rape cases in 2009-10 as part of its \"violence against women and girls\" strategy.\nThat year, 2,270 suspects in \"rape-flagged\" cases admitted an offence or were found guilty after a trial.\nThe number fluctuated between 2,300 and 2,600, before reaching a high of 2,991 in 2016-17 - but it has fallen sharply since then.\nOverall prosecutions - which include those that end in an acquittal - also peaked in 2016-17, with 5,190 completed cases - but dropped to 2,102 last year.\nHarriet Wistrich, founder of the Centre for Women's Justice, said: \"Potentially it is sending out a message that rape is de-criminalised, virtually. It is very unlikely that it will ever be prosecuted, particularly in cases where there is intoxication. What does that tell men who are determined to rape? It gives a very worrying message.\"\nOther figures, seen by the BBC, suggest the decline in rape prosecutions may have deterred some police from submitting cases for charging decisions.\nInformed sources claimed some investigators were frustrated that growing numbers of rape cases they had worked on were not resulting in a prosecution and were more selective about which ones they sent forward for a charging decision. \nIn 2019-20, the police referred 2,747 cases to the CPS, a reduction of 40% in three years and the lowest number since the figures were first published in 2014-15.\nMs Wistrich said: \"We have heard anecdotally, police won't refer a case where there isn't a huge amount of corroborating evidence where there is a dispute as to consent.\"\nIt is also taking longer for suspects to be charged, with the average time from a case initially being referred to the CPS to a decision to charge up from 53 days in 2015-16 to 145 days in 2019-20, which is almost five months. \nThe period does not include the time spent investigating the case prior to referral nor the time between someone being charged and tried.\nPreviously, the delays have been partly blamed on the volume of digital evidence, particularly from smart-phones, that detectives have to trawl through.\nThe Victims' Commissioner Dame Vera Baird described the rape statistics as \"utterly shameful\" and called on the CPS to change its handling of rape cases \"now, not in half a decade\".\nIn a statement, she urged Mr Hill to \"immediately\" reverse a CPS policy she said is leaving \"thousands of rape complainants without the chance of justice\" even when \"they appear to have a strong evidential case\".\nShe said: \"There is no complexity in why rape prosecutions and convictions have crashed.\n\"It is a policy by CPS only to take only rock-solid prosecutions as set down in a CPS document in 2016/17 by the director of legal services and personally driven by him nationwide.\"\nShe said the CPS had cut the volume of cases they charge \"for the sake of getting a higher rate of convictions\" and called for an end to that \"today\". \nMeanwhile, Nazir Afzal, the former chief Crown prosecutor for the north-west of England, said rape is \"possibly the hardest of crimes to prosecute but this looks like they've given up\", adding that victims deserved \"better\".\nThe CPS said the drop in rape prosecutions was \"a major focus\" of its work and it had been \"working hard to reverse the trend we've seen in recent years\".\n\"It is early days, but there are encouraging signs with a steady increase in both the proportion and number of cases charged,\" a spokesperson said. \"If our legal test is met, we always seek to prosecute.\"\nThe CPS added that due to the time it takes to investigate and prosecute a case any changes may take some time to be seen in the data.\nA joint statement from the National Police Chiefs' Council's leads for rape, domestic abuse and charging said the fall in the number of convictions was \"very concerning for us\".\nIt said there were a number of reasons behind the drop in referrals, many due to changes in the way forces operate.\n\"Over recent years we have worked hard with the CPS to streamline the process and have introduced local 'gatekeepers' who can test evidence and give investigators advice, helping to improve cases, without the necessity for a referral,\" the statement said.\n\"However, we are hearing from our officers that it is becoming harder to achieve the standard of evidence required to charge a suspect and get a case into court. Victims tell us clearly how important it is to them to have the evidence tested in this way. \n\"Investigators are working incredibly hard to try and reach that standard, but in some occasions when they are unable to do so they are taking local decisions through gatekeepers and supervisors.\""

      "text": "The Scottish government has said it is not planning to make the vaccination of care home workers compulsory.\nThe measure could be brought in for staff in care homes for older people in England, the BBC has been told.\nCare staff there are expected to be given 16 weeks to have the jab - or face being redeployed away from frontline care or losing their jobs.\nBut Scottish Business Minister Ivan McKee said there were \"no plans\" to implement a similar policy in Scotland.\nScottish Care said UK government plans to mandate vaccinations had \"little relevance\" in Scotland as all staff had received both doses.\nPublic Health Scotland figures show 100% coverage for care home workers on first and second doses of the Covid vaccine, based on an estimate of 50,000 care home workers.\nThe latest figures show that 53,952 workers had received at least their first dose of a vaccine.\nThe estimate has been exceeded because of the high level of turnover among care home staff, meaning new workers are constantly being recruited, according to Scottish Care, which represents the independent care sector.\nA report by the organisation in 2019 estimated that, on average, almost a quarter of staff left their employer within a year.\nAsked on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme if Scotland would follow England in making care home worker vaccines compulsory, Mr McKee said: \"Our clinicians will look at [the] measures taken down south and consider that, but at the moment we don't have any plans to do that.\"\nA spokeswoman for the Scottish government added: \"The response from care home staff in Scotland to the call to take up their vaccinations has been fantastic.\n\"We currently have no plans to make vaccinations mandatory for health and social care staff as it's clear that these caring staff in Scotland are overwhelmingly making the choice to be vaccinated to protect themselves and their residents.\"\nCare organisations in England have warned that compulsory vaccinations could cause significant difficulties in a sector that already struggles to recruit enough people.\nScottish Care said the Scottish approach had been one of \"close partnership\" between the sector, the NHS and the Scottish government.\nA spokeswoman added in a statement: \"We have sought to develop a policy and practice of information and encouragement, rather than mandating and instructing.\n\"In large part, this has been a successful approach to date. As of 15 June, the vaccination dashboard from PHS details that 100% of care home staff have received both doses.\n\"Obviously, statistically, this does not mean all staff have now been vaccinated because there is a continual flow of new staff and there may be some homes with less than 100% compliance.\n\"But even then, we have clear measures now in place to ensure new starts are offered the vaccine and where there are gaps that there are targeted efforts to increase uptake.\"\nDo you work in a care home and have a view on whether staff should be required to have the Covid vaccine?

      "text": "A miner has described how he \"dragged\" his colleague to safety after he became trapped under a rock when roof supports gave way in a mine. \nHuw Thomas, 63, rescued Gwyn Woodland from Danygraig drift mine in south Wales in 2017 after \"cheap\" wooden pallet boards gave way underground. \nOn Monday, Three Ds Mining Ltd was found guilty of three counts of breaching health and safety laws. \nDavid Jones, its director, told BBC Wales he would not respond to \"lies\".\nDuring the trial, Swansea Crown Court heard the roof should have been supported by horizontal bars no less than 2.4in (63.5mm) thick.\nBut mine owner Three Ds had started using pre-cut pallet boards, which were as thin as 0.78in (20mm) in some places, in the summer of 2017.\nMr Thomas, 63, said he had been the mine manager at Danygraig, in the Dulais Valley area of Neath Port Talbot, but at the time was working as a freelance collier. \nMr Thomas said he and his colleague were working at the mine one morning, and Mr Woodland was \"punching (drilling) to put up extra supports, because these pallets that were being used weren't strong enough\".\nIt was at this time that the wood gave way, trapping Mr Woodland and his puncher under a half-tonne rock.\n\"I was crawling down the face and I heard a fall of rock. I went down, Gwyn was trapped under a big stone. Now that stone had to come off him because he was struggling to breathe,\" he said. \n\"It was a shock. He didn't moan much but I could tell he was in pain. \n\"Gwyn being a strong bloke, he's like an ox. If he wasn't that strong, he would have died.\"\nWhile trapped under the rock, Mr Thomas said Mr Woodland was in danger from a \"secondary fall\" which would have \"flattened\" the coal face.\nHe added: \"I had to break the stone off Gwyn with a sledge [hammer]. \n\"He broke three bones in his back, his legs were crushed, he couldn't walk, he was in a hell of a state.\n\"I had to chip around the stone and hope it would break in the middle. Because I couldn't directly hit it on to Gwyn, because he was already in agony. I had to work as quickly as I can, to get him out as quickly as I can.\n\"If I hadn't have done that, he would have died. I couldn't go and get help, I couldn't leave him, because the top was picking, there was going to be another fall, and he was struggling to breathe.\"\nMr Thomas said it took about three or four minutes to get the stone off Mr Woodland, before he \"dragged\" him out of the mine. \nMr Thomas said the mine owner, David Jones, tried to \"cover up\" what had happened by not reporting it to the Health and Safety Executive. \nHe said: \"The next day I went into work, the owner asked me to ask Gwyn to come into work so it wouldn't be a reportable incident. \n\"I phoned Gwyn up and said 'could you come into work?' He said 'you're having a laugh.' He couldn't move out of the chair, let alone come to work.\"\nMr Thomas said Mr Jones was \"obviously\" trying to cut corners and \"without a shadow of a doubt\", Three Ds Mining Ltd \"put lives at risk\". \nHe added Mr Woodland had never heard from the mine owner again. \n\"He hasn't had any wages for three years and I think it was disgusting the way he was treated,\" he said. \nMr Jones told BBC Wales: \"I don't have a response to lies. If the jury believed those lies, then what else can I say?\"\nThree Ds Mining Ltd is due to be sentenced on 10 September. "

      "tags": "Italy",
      "text": "Italy's public broadcaster Rai has faced strong criticism for airing leaked CCTV footage of a fatal cable car crash that killed 14 people.\nThe cabin is seen nearing its final stop before suddenly rearing up, then speeding back down the mountain and crashing to the ground. \nThe prosecutor in the case spoke of \"the absolute inappropriateness\" of publishing the footage.\nThe head of Rai TV said he was \"deeply shocked\" by the decision to show it.\nFive families were on board the car when it crashed, including two children who were among the dead. \nFive-year-old Eitan Biran was the sole survivor when the main cable holding the car snapped on 23 May. He lost his parents and two-year-old brother, originally from Israel, and his great grandparents.\nProsecutors say the emergency brake, which could have prevented the accident, had been intentionally disabled. The car reversed at over 100km/h (62mph) on a support cable, passing a support pylon and then plummeting to the ground and rolling down the mountain.\nThe CCTV footage was first obtained and shown on a news programme on Italian channel Rai 3, with the cabin blurred. It has since been republished in full or in part by several other Italian media, with some only obscuring the victims' faces.\nA second clip shows a worker running for help as the accident unfolds.\nProsecutor Olimpia Bossi said in a press release that although the suspects in the case were aware of the videos' existence, relatives had not been informed and the broadcast of the footage was prohibited. \nThe suffering of the victims' families, she said, \"cannot and must not be further exacerbated by actions like this\".\nThe Italian Data Protection Authority has urged media organisations and social media users not to share the clips out of respect to the victims and their relatives, \"so that pain does not become a tool for an extra like\".\nLocal Mayor Marcella Severino said she too was appalled by the decision to show the video: \"I don't think it was appropriate towards the victims and their families.\"\nThe head of the public broadcaster, Marcello Foa, said he had \"always respected the editorial choices of the directors and I have always refrained from commenting on them publicly, but as president of Rai in this case I cannot remain silent\".\n\"It is a duty for the public service, in circumstances like this, to carefully evaluate all the implications, starting with the ethical ones and respect for the victims and their families,\" he added.\nPoliticians joined the condemnation.\nFormer education minister Valeria Fedeli said in a joint statement with fellow Democratic Party politician Andrea Romano that the channel needed to explain its actions.\nThe decision showed \"total disrespect for the victims and their family members\", they argued, adding that the violation of the publication ban was \"all the more serious because it was carried out by public service providers\".\nSenator Laura Garvini said in a Facebook post that the broadcast of the video \"means trampling on the memory of the victims and the pain of their families. Sensationalising death has nothing to do with the right of the press.\"\nHowever, La Stampa newspaper defended its decision to republish the footage, arguing that it was \"stronger than 1,000 words and clarifies how the intervention of the brakes could have prevented the disaster\".\nThree suspects from the company that operated the cable car are currently under investigation over the incident.  A technician has admitted installing a fork-shaped bracket to deactivate the emergency brake, which had reportedly been malfunctioning, earlier this year. \nHowever, a cable car expert has alleged that earlier videos he took suggest the emergency brake was already disabled in 2014."

      "tags": "Shielding,Job Retention Scheme,Employment,Sick leave,Self-isolation,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Employers can claim from the furlough scheme for staff who are self-isolating.\nThe entitlement exists despite government guidance stating it is not what the scheme is intended for. \nThe little-known entitlement was first reported by Politico magazine after emails from civil servants complaining about government guidance were leaked. \nOne email from a civil servant said the Treasury was \"reluctant\" to say the scheme could be used in such a way.\n\"Furlough can be used to cover self-isolation, but HMT [the Treasury] are reluctant to say this explicitly in guidance because it could lead to employees being furloughed who do not need to be,\" Politico quoted one of the emails as saying. \n\"Incentive payments are too low to incentivise employees to take tests due to risk of loss of income.\"\nThe emails quoted by the magazine said a senior official was concerned people might avoid taking tests because if they had to self-isolate, their incomes would drop to statutory sick pay level. \nThe Treasury said that far from hiding anything, it was there \"in plain English\" that employers could choose to furlough self-isolating staff. \nStatutory sick pay requires employers to pay at least \u00a396.35 per week when staff are off sick for more than four days, whereas the furlough scheme, also known as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, pays 80% of an employee's normal wages up to \u00a32,500 per month.\nA section in the government guidance on business support titled \"If your employee is self-isolating or on sick leave\", says employees self-isolating or on sick leave as a result of Covid \"may be able to get statutory sick pay\".\nIt adds that the Job Retention Scheme \"is not intended for short-term absences from work due to sickness\" and \"short term illness or self-isolation should not be a consideration when deciding if you should furlough an employee\".\nHowever, the guidance states if employers \"want to furlough employees for business reasons and they are currently off sick, they are eligible to do so, as with other employees\".\nThe guidance also states employers \"can furlough employees who are clinically extremely vulnerable or at the highest risk of severe illness from coronavirus\".\n\"It's up to employers to decide if they will furlough these employees. An employer does not need to be facing a wider reduction in demand or be closed to be eligible to claim for these employees,\" it says.\nTreasury officials argue the guidance makes it clear that employers can choose to put staff on sick pay or use the furlough scheme. \nA Treasury spokesperson said: \"It has always been clear that the purpose of the furlough scheme is to support jobs - we've been upfront about that from the start. \n\"The guidance sets out that the scheme is not intended for short-term absences from work due to sickness or self-isolation. We have a specific support package in place for those self-isolating due to coronavirus, including one-off payments for those on low incomes. \n\"If an employer wants to furlough an employee for business reasons and they are currently off sick then they are eligible to do so as with other employees. This has been set out in guidance since April last year.\" \nBridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, called the news \"shocking\".\n\"The government were advised time and time again how crucial a proper self-isolation system is for curbing the spread of infection, and protecting people's lives and livelihoods,\" she said.\n\"It is shameful and reckless that the chancellor ignored professional advice and put countless people and workplaces at unnecessary risk when he had the opportunity to help.\"\nRachel Harrison, national officer at the GMB union, said:  \"Suppressing advice on furlough eligibility during self-isolation is scandalous and incompetent.  \n\"Lives will likely have been lost and higher infection rates will cost the NHS and employers far more in the long run. \n\"We need to know whether ministers approved the decision to withhold this advice. An urgent investigation should be established with accountability to Parliament.\""

      "text": "The amount of alcohol sold per person in Scotland last year fell to its the lowest level for 26 years.\nPublic Health Scotland figures show 9.4 litres of pure alcohol were sold per adult in 2020, the equivalent of each adult in the country drinking 18 units a week.\nIt is the third year in a row that the level has fallen and the largest drop on record.\nHowever, the figure was still higher than in England and Wales.\nThe amount of pure alcohol sold per person north of the border was 6% higher, although this was the smallest difference between the nations recorded since 1994.\nThe report, which monitored the impact of alcohol policy, found almost a quarter (24%) of all adults reported exceeding the safe weekly drinking guideline of 14 units a week in 2019.\nBut this was down from just over a third (34%) in 2003.\nThe report also revealed that 1,020 deaths were described as being \"wholly attributable to alcohol\" in 2019 - an average of 20 people per week.\nOver the course of 2019-20, a total of 23,685 people were admitted to hospital with an alcohol-related diagnosis, with some requiring more than one stay in hospital. \nDeprivation was linked to drinking-related illness, with the rates for both alcohol-related hospital stays and deaths eight times higher in the most deprived parts of Scotland compared to the least deprived areas.\nA total of 42.5 million litres of pure alcohol were sold in Scotland in 2020, the report revealed - with sprits and wine accounting for 31% of sales each, beer accounting for 27% and cider 6%.\nWith the coronavirus pandemic forcing bars and restaurants to either close or operate under restrictions for much of last year, 90% of alcohol was bought in supermarkets and other stores, up from 73% in 2019.\nDr Elizabeth Richardson, public health intelligence adviser at Public Health Scotland, said the pandemic was probably a factor in the figures. \n\"We have previously shown that per-adult sales were lower overall between March and July last year, during the first national lockdown, and it's likely that the pandemic and associated restrictions have contributed to the lower alcohol consumption we see across the Scottish population in 2020,\" she said.\n\"Despite these trends, the most recent survey data show that nearly a quarter of people still drink more than the recommended low-risk weekly guideline. Among people exceeding the guideline, it is those in the lowest income group who are likely to consume the most.\"\nShe added: \"An average of 20 people per week die as a result of their alcohol consumption, and whilst this latest figure represents the lowest rate since 2012, again it is those in the most deprived areas that are more likely to be hospitalised or die because of an alcohol-related harm. Like all harm caused by alcohol, this is preventable.\"\nAlison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said \"We're really pleased to see that as a nation we are drinking less for the third year running and that alcohol consumption is at a 25-year low - this is a good indication that minimum unit pricing is having the intended effect. \n\"Although the restrictions on pubs and restaurants for much of 2020 will have affected consumption across the UK, it is notable that the reduction in alcohol purchases in Scotland is greater than in England and Wales.\n\"But given nearly a quarter of Scots are still regularly drinking over the chief medical officers' low-risk drinking guidelines, we can't afford to take our eye off the ball where preventing alcohol harm is concerned.\"\nShe called on the Scottish government to raise the minimum price for alcohol from the current level of 50p a unit to 65p, saying this will \"increase the positive benefits of the policy by reducing consumption, saving more lives and preventing a new generation from developing an unhealthy relationship with alcohol\".\nScotland's Minister for Public Health, Maree Todd said she was more convinced than ever that minimum unit pricing was one of the main drivers in reducing the harm caused by over consumption of alcohol.\nShe said: \"Clearly Covid-19 and the associated restrictions have had a dramatic impact on the hospitality trade, but these figures demonstrate that the restrictions in place did not simply translate into an increase in the total amount of alcohol being consumed. In fact, the opposite is the case.\n\"We have already seen that alcohol sales were falling since the introduction of our world-leading Minimum Unit Pricing policy in 2018. \n\"We know that it will take longer for the full impact of reduced consumption to feed through into health-related statistics, but I am more convinced than ever that MUP is one of the main drivers in reducing alcohol harms.\""

      "tags": "Children,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination",
      "text": "A decision to vaccinate all 12 to 17-year-old children against Covid is unlikely to be recommended by UK vaccine experts imminently, the BBC has been told.\nCertain groups of children may still be offered a Covid jab - but not all.\nA statement from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is expected in the coming days.\nThe government will then make a final decision on whether teenagers will be included in the mass rollout.\nVaccinating all over-18s with a first dose and two-thirds of adults with a second dose by 19 July is the latest target set by the UK government.\nThere has been much speculation over whether children were going to be included in the UK's vaccination programme against Covid-19 after regulator the MHRA approved Pfizer's use in 12 to 15-year-olds recently.\nBut the JCVI - the committee of UK vaccine experts which advises the government on the best approach - has not yet made any formal recommendation on the matter.\nCurrent advice is that 16 to 18-year-olds can be offered a Pfizer jab if they are in a priority group, or live with someone who has a weakened immune system.\nThe committee may be waiting for more safety data on children who have been vaccinated in other countries, such as the US and Israel, before making its decision.\nThe MHRA's approval was based on trials of the Pfizer vaccine in 2,200 adolescents in the US which showed it was safe and effective, but this is a relatively small number.\nAt the same time, the UK's stock of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is being prioritised for adults aged 18 to 40 - who are not being offered AstraZeneca - meaning supplies available for children are currently low.\nHowever, for the experts there are a whole host of factors to consider, including the benefits and risks for children, as well as other wider ethical issues. \nChildren's risk of severe disease from Covid is tiny, deaths are extremely rare and have only occurred in UK children with profound underlying and life-limiting conditions. The direct benefits to them of vaccination would be low.\nSome people question whether it's morally right to vaccinate children in the UK, when so many millions of other people in the rest of the world are still unvaccinated.\nOn the other hand, vaccinating children could reduce infections across society, help protect adults and the vulnerable who are most at risk, and keep schools open.\n\"This is a very finely balanced issue and a difficult decision,\" says Prof Calum Semple, professor of outbreak medicine and child health from the University of Liverpool, who is also a member of the scientific advisory group, Sage.\nHe said he was \"veering towards not vaccinating children\" because of the need to get the vaccine into the arms of more hard-to-reach adults instead.\n\"The virus is spreading in schools because it's got nowhere else to hide at the moment,\" Prof Semple said, adding that improved ventilation in classrooms was much more of a priority than masks in schools.\nVaccinating children would be \"mainly to protect public health and reduce transmission\", he added.\nIt's possible the government is not rushing any decision because it wants to see the impact of vaccinating all adults in the UK on virus cases, which have been rising steadily since the end of May.\nA target of giving two doses to two-thirds of the UK's adult population was set by the prime minister on Monday - but that is principally the over-40s, who are due to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThere are concerns there are not enough Pfizer or Moderna vaccines to start vaccinating younger age groups any earlier.\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"No decisions have yet been made on whether people aged 12 to 17 should be routinely offered Covid-19 vaccines.\n\"We will be guided by our expert advisers, and the government has asked the JCVI for its formal recommendation. We will update in due course.\""

      "text": "Central stocks of some items of personal protective equipment (PPE) came within eight hours of running out in April 2020, a report has found.\nAudit Scotland said a stockpile of key items such as long-sleeved gowns had run \"very low\" early in the pandemic.\nIts report examines how the Scottish government and NHS Scotland managed PPE arrangements.\nThe Scottish government welcomed the report and said Scotland had never run out of PPE.\nBut the BMA's Scottish Consultants Committee said it added to the \"clear evidence\" that Scotland was \"not effectively prepared\" to deal with the Covid-19 outbreak last year.\nThe committee's chairman, Dr Graeme Eunson, said: \"It is very concerning to see how short supplies actually were in April last year, and that reflects the real issues and worries we were raising at the time on behalf of our members - and indeed all health and care staff across Scotland who were working throughout the pandemic.\n\"Nevertheless, it is also important to acknowledge the considerable, and rapid work that went into improving the situation and getting PPE to those frontline workers.\"\nAudit Scotland also found the surge in prices for PPE cost NHS National Services Scotland (NHS NSS) \u00a337.4m over what it would have normally paid for the safety equipment.\nA similar study carried out at a UK level by the National Audit Office estimated the UK spent \u00a310bn extra in inflated prices for PPE due to an \"inadequate\" stockpile and the surge in global demand early in the pandemic.\nThe Audit Scotland report reiterated its earlier finding that the Scottish government did not fully implement recommendations from pandemic preparedness exercises.\nIt also said the government could have done more to ensure access to PPE and training in its use.\nAs global demand surged and overseas factories closed, PPE prices doubled in early 2020.\nThe report said: \"Had NHS NSS been able to buy PPE at the same prices as 2019, it would have spent \u00a337.4m less on PPE stock in the first five months of the pandemic.\"\nCentrally-held stocks of certain key items were \"very low\" in April 2020, with just eight hours' worth of long-sleeved gowns stored by NHS NSS.\nHowever, individual health boards may have had additional supplies of PPE items, the report noted.\nThe report went on to say that 78 contracts worth \u00a3340m were awarded to companies providing PPE between March 2020 and June 2021.\nA total of 29 of these contracts, worth \u00a398m, were awarded to new suppliers with no competition.\nNHS NSS distributed 1.1 billion items of PPE between March 2020 and April 2021.\nThe report recommended taking a longer-term approach to procuring PPE, including planning for future pandemics.\nIt noted NHS NSS was already developing a new stock management system and renting warehouses for PPE.\nStephen Boyle, auditor general for Scotland, said: \"The Scottish government and NHS National Services Scotland worked well together under extremely challenging circumstances to set up new arrangements for the supply and distribution of PPE to health and social care settings.\n\"The challenge now will be in developing a longer-term approach to PPE supply and distribution that includes both business as usual needs as well as preparing for future pandemics.\"\nIn March this year, MSPs on a Holyrood committee urged the auditor general to publish the PPE spending report faster, saying the UK National Audit Office had produced its findings in November 2020.\nScottish Conservative health spokeswoman Annie Wells said: \"This Audit Scotland report once again exposes the reality of PPE shortages in Scotland at the height of the pandemic.\n\"Despite the SNP's spin that PPE supplies never ran out, this report makes clear that at critical moments, less than a day of some key supplies were available.\n\"As frontline staff have made clear, the reality is that our NHS was just hours away from disaster because of PPE shortages.\"\nMary Morgan, chief executive of NHS NSS, said the report recognised the \"crucial role\" played by NSS in ensuring Scotland never ran out of critical PPE during the pandemic.\n\"Our national procurement teams worked 24/7 to overcome unprecedented global demand and the collapse of international supply chains,\" she said.\n\"They worked with partners to develop new supply routes to support our social care colleagues, and made direct deliveries to ensure primary care teams received their essential supplies.\n\"The decisions taken in spring of 2020 had to be made urgently to reduce the risk of our NHS being overwhelmed.\"\nMs Morgan added that lessons learned during the pandemic had already been implemented.\nA Scottish government spokesperson said Covid-19 had brought \"unprecedented global demand\" for PPE.\n\"In the first phase of the pandemic, there were collapses in the international PPE supply chain, combined with greatly increased levels of demand for PPE in Scotland and around the world. \n\"Scotland never ran out of PPE. Work undertaken by the Scottish government and its partner organisations at that time included setting up a whole new Scottish supply chain from scratch, with the creation of hundreds of jobs.\n\"The Scottish government agrees with Audit Scotland that we need to learn from this pandemic and bring that learning into planning for future pandemics - and that work is already under way.\""

      "text": "The Ministry of Justice is removing all children from a key institution detaining young criminals in the UK, amid serious concerns for their safety. \nAll 33 children currently detained at the Rainsbrook Secure Training Centre will be transferred to other institutions. \nJustice Secretary Robert Buckland said private contractor MTC had \"failed to deliver\" vital changes. \nThe company said it was surprised by the move and challenged the findings.\nDuring the peak of the pandemic last year, detainees were being locked up in near solitary confinement as a quarantine measure. \nThree watchdogs were so concerned to find that children were still being held in those conditions in December, despite an order to the centre's management to stop, they ordered ministers to take urgent action. \nThat prompted Justice Secretary Robert Buckland to order major changes to how private contractor MTC ran the facility in Northamptonshire, including new managers responsible for more closely monitoring how the young detainees were being cared for. \nBut in a statement on Wednesday, the Ministry of Justice revealed that a further inspection by the education watchdog Ofsted had rated the centre as \"inadequate\", despite attempts to turn it around. \nIt said that the most urgent concerns about the time children spent locked up had been addressed - but the government did not believe that MTC had done enough to resolve \"wider long-standing issues\". \nMr Buckland said: \"Six months ago, I demanded that MTC take immediate action to fix the very serious failings at Rainsbrook. \n\"They have failed to deliver and I have been left with no choice but to ask that all children are moved elsewhere as soon as possible.\n\"This move will help protect the public by ensuring often vulnerable children get the support they need to turn their lives around - ultimately resulting in fewer victims and safer streets.\"\nThe 33 current detainees will be moved out of the facility to other accommodation within the youth justice system. In practice that means the only other operating secure training centre (STC) or secure children's homes that are dotted around the country. \nIn a statement, MTC said the welfare of children had been its priority and it had been working in close partnership with officials from the Ministry of Justice since late last year. \n\"Given the previous positive assessments, including Ofsted's follow-up visit in January, we were very surprised to receive Ofsted's feedback at the end of last week's inspection,\" said the statement. \n\"We have a number of concerns about their approach and ultimately the conclusions they have reached. We plan to vigorously challenge this as we go through the fact-checking process.\"\nRainsbrook will be mothballed while the MOJ considers its future, including its contract with MTC.\nIt's not clear whether the contract can be automatically terminated. \nThe potential complete closure of Rainsbrook would mean that two of the three STCs in England have been emptied after serious allegations of poor management and care - the other being Medway in Kent."

      "tags": "Hull,Plymouth,Rotherham",
      "text": "A man has been found guilty of murdering two women 21 years apart.\nGary Allen strangled Samantha Class, 29, whose body was found by three schoolchildren on the banks of the Humber Estuary in 1997.\nHe was tried and cleared of her murder in 2000 but the acquittal was quashed last year after he was charged with murdering Alena Grlakova, 38, in 2018.\nJurors at Sheffield Crown Court convicted him of both killings after a seven-week trial.\nSpeaking after the verdict, Ms Class's daughter, Sophia Class, said her family had been \"broken into pieces\" by the loss of her \"caring, gentle and strong\" mother.\n\"Because of Gary Allen, my mum violently and brutally lost her whole life and our lives were turned upside down,\" she said. \"So many memories as a family taken away in one night.\"\nBut, she said, they had finally received justice after 24 years. \n\"I can never have my mother back, I have got to live with that and there will always be a break in my heart, but at least for us all there are no more questions.\"\nIn a statement, Ms Grlakova's husband Viliam Grlak said: \"The verdict will not reduce the pain and suffering that we have had to endure since Alena was so cruelly taken from us but it does give us the justice that we hoped to achieve.\"\nPolice described Allen as a \"despicable, violent man\" and a \"danger to women\".\nProsecutors said Ms Class had been stamped on, strangled with a ligature and run over by a car before being dragged to the water on the night of 25 October 1997. Her body was discovered the following day.\nMs Grlakova's body was found in a stream in Rotherham in April 2019, four months after she was reported missing.\nBoth women were sex workers at the time of their deaths, and jurors heard Allen had spoken to probation officers of his \"hatred\" of prostitutes, whom he branded \"scum\".\nJust weeks after he was acquitted of murdering Ms Class in February 2000, Allen assaulted two sex workers in separate attacks in Plymouth, for which he was convicted and jailed.\nDuring his latest trial, the court was told a year-long Humberside Police sting, involving seven officers, was launched in 2010 to monitor Allen and gather further evidence on Ms Class's murder.\nProsecutor Alistair MacDonald QC said the defendant had made admissions to an undercover officer - known as Ian - about his encounter with a sex worker whom he had strangled and \"dumped in the Humber\".\nMr MacDonald QC told the jury of seven men and five women that Ms Grlakova had been planning to return to her home country of Slovakia before she was killed, describing it as \"one of the tragic ironies of the case\".\nAfter Allen was charged with Ms Grlakova's murder, Director of Public Prosecutions Max Hill QC personally applied to the Court of Appeal in 2019 for his original acquittal to be quashed, arguing that substantial and \"compelling\" new evidence had been gathered.\nHumberside Police said its long-running investigation was \"extremely significant\" and a landmark case, while South Yorkshire Police said its inquiries into Allen continued and it would write to other police forces around the UK to check whether any unsolved murder cases and attacks could be linked to him. \nTwo murders, 21 years apart, and a simple change in the law that allowed prosecutors to right the most extraordinary of injustices. \nWhen Gary Allen left Sheffield Crown Court in February 2000, he thought he had got away with the murder of Samantha Class. \nDNA linked him to the young mother's strangulation and prosecutors had shown he was a liar - yet a jury could not be sure of his guilt. And so he walked free. \nIt would take two decades of focus on Allen - and pushing at the boundaries of one of England's most important criminal laws - for him to be finally convicted. \nRead more from Dominic\nOne of Allen's surviving victims, who he assaulted in Plymouth, appealed for other women who may have been attacked by him to come forward.\nThe English Collective of Prostitutes said: \"Gary Allen took two precious lives and attacked many others. Our hearts go out to the victims and to the family and friends of the women he killed.\" \nSpeaking of Humberside Police's undercover probe, Operation Misty, Det Ch Insp Christine Calvert, who led the recent inquiry for the force, said officer Ian had done \"a fantastic job and deserves every commendation going\".\n\"Gary Allen was a loner. We obviously had highly-trained officers, but they had to be really dedicated over a long period of time to keep that relationship going. It's a fantastic result.\"\nAllen, of no fixed address, is due to be sentenced on Wednesday. Judge Mr Justice Goose told him to \"prepare yourself inevitably for a life sentence\".\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to yorkslincs.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "tags": "Companies,UK economy,Brexit",
      "text": "UK food and drink exports to the European Union almost halved in the first three months of the year, compared with the same period in 2020. \nThe Food and Drink Federation (FDF) figures show EU sales dropped by 47%.\nThe trade body said the decline was largely due to changes in the UK's trading relationships, but said the pandemic was also a factor.\nThe government said it was \"too early to draw any firm conclusions\" on the long term impact of Brexit.\nIt also said the pandemic had depressed demand.\n\"The most recent ONS trade statistics show that for both March and April, overall exports to the EU have exceeded the average levels across 2020,\" a government spokesperson added.\nRachel Hicks, co-founder and co-distiller at Sky Wave Gin said the \"red tape is strangling\" her business. She said that EU sales \"utterly dropped off a cliff\" in the first quarter, meaning her turnover was down 30%. \n\"The real shame is somewhere like Asia - a fast growing region for gin - is going to potentially snaffle all the markets,\" Ms Hicks said.\n\"We are now unable to quickly send gin to our customers all over Europe and have to wait for HMRC to inspect us every time we send gin abroad.\"  \nGraham Flannigan from Berwick Shellfish in Northumberland, is in a similar position. He said his seafood exports had \"come down drastically\" mainly due to Brexit and the impact of lockdowns.\n\"The logistics systems are moving better now but it's the red tape that is having to be built into the cost of the goods and this is having a knock on effect,\" he added. \nDominic Goudie, the FDF's head of international trade, said the drop in exports his federation had recorded was a \"disaster\" for the industry.\n\"It is a very clear indication of the scale of losses that UK manufacturers face in the longer-term due to new trade barriers with the EU.\"\nNew trade barriers were not the only factor affecting cross channel trade. The FDF said that the Covid-19 outbreak accounted for a decline of some 10-15%. \nFigures for the quarter were also affected by companies stockpiling ahead of the Brexit-related changes. \nThe combination of these factors, the FDF says, led to significant falls in the value of leading exports. \nCompared with the first quarter of 2019 - before Covid became a factor - exports of cheese were down 72%; fish sales were down 52% and chocolate was down 37%.\nExports of food and drink to nearly all EU nations fell significantly in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year.\nWorst hit was trade with Ireland - normally the sector's biggest overseas market. It was down by more than 70%. But sales to Germany, Spain and Italy also more than halved.\nFor decades, the UK has sold more food and drink to the European Union than to the rest of the world combined. \nHowever, the fall in shipments to Europe means that is no longer the case. In the first quarter exports to non-EU nations made up 55% of the total.\nThe FDF said this is the first time this has happened in at least 20 years. \nOverall, sales to non-EU countries rose by 0.3% - although there was a significant increase in shipments to China.\nSales to the region, which fell in the first quarter of last year due to Covid-related lockdowns, recovered to reach \u00a3200m - well above their pre-pandemic level of \u00a3163m.\nOn 31 December, the so-called 'implementation period', in place since Britain left the EU, came to an end.\nThat meant trade across the channel became subject to new post-Brexit regulations and customs formalities for the first time. \nThis FDF says this has had a particularly significant impact on the trade in products of animal origin and other perishable foods, because it led to significant delays while formalities were completed.\n\"Trade that would take 12 hours in the past can now take a day or even a week,\" said Mr Goudie.\n\"If you lose two days or even three days it takes a big chunk out of the of shelf life of the product, which makes the trade itself less viable.\""

      "text": "Employers can claim from the furlough scheme for staff who are self-isolating.\nThe entitlement exists despite government guidance stating it is not what the scheme is intended for. \nThe little-known entitlement was first reported by Politico magazine after emails from civil servants complaining about government guidance were leaked. \nOne email from a civil servant said the Treasury was \"reluctant\" to say the scheme could be used in such a way.\n\"Furlough can be used to cover self-isolation, but HMT [the Treasury] are reluctant to say this explicitly in guidance because it could lead to employees being furloughed who do not need to be,\" Politico quoted one of the emails as saying. \n\"Incentive payments are too low to incentivise employees to take tests due to risk of loss of income.\"\nThe emails quoted by the magazine said a senior official was concerned people might avoid taking tests because if they had to self-isolate, their incomes would drop to statutory sick pay level. \nThe Treasury said that far from hiding anything, it was there \"in plain English\" that employers could choose to furlough self-isolating staff. \nStatutory sick pay requires employers to pay at least \u00a396.35 per week when staff are off sick for more than four days, whereas the furlough scheme, also known as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, pays 80% of an employee's normal wages up to \u00a32,500 per month.\nA section in the government guidance on business support titled \"If your employee is self-isolating or on sick leave\", says employees self-isolating or on sick leave as a result of Covid \"may be able to get statutory sick pay\".\nIt adds that the Job Retention Scheme \"is not intended for short-term absences from work due to sickness\" and \"short term illness or self-isolation should not be a consideration when deciding if you should furlough an employee\".\nHowever, the guidance states if employers \"want to furlough employees for business reasons and they are currently off sick, they are eligible to do so, as with other employees\".\nThe guidance also states employers \"can furlough employees who are clinically extremely vulnerable or at the highest risk of severe illness from coronavirus\".\n\"It's up to employers to decide if they will furlough these employees. An employer does not need to be facing a wider reduction in demand or be closed to be eligible to claim for these employees,\" it says.\nTreasury officials argue the guidance makes it clear that employers can choose to put staff on sick pay or use the furlough scheme. \nA Treasury spokesperson said: \"It has always been clear that the purpose of the furlough scheme is to support jobs - we've been upfront about that from the start. \n\"The guidance sets out that the scheme is not intended for short-term absences from work due to sickness or self-isolation. We have a specific support package in place for those self-isolating due to coronavirus, including one-off payments for those on low incomes. \n\"If an employer wants to furlough an employee for business reasons and they are currently off sick then they are eligible to do so as with other employees. This has been set out in guidance since April last year.\" \nBridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, called the news \"shocking\".\n\"The government were advised time and time again how crucial a proper self-isolation system is for curbing the spread of infection, and protecting people's lives and livelihoods,\" she said.\n\"It is shameful and reckless that the chancellor ignored professional advice and put countless people and workplaces at unnecessary risk when he had the opportunity to help.\"\nRachel Harrison, national officer at the GMB union, said:  \"Suppressing advice on furlough eligibility during self-isolation is scandalous and incompetent.  \n\"Lives will likely have been lost and higher infection rates will cost the NHS and employers far more in the long run. \n\"We need to know whether ministers approved the decision to withhold this advice. An urgent investigation should be established with accountability to Parliament.\""

      "text": "About 10,000 young people move out of the care system in the UK every year. For some there's a sudden cut-off with little support on the other side. Kim Emenike describes her experience of what has been described as a \"care cliff\".\nThe summer before Kim Emenike turned 18 her foster carer - who she'd lived with in south London for the best part of a decade - made it clear she wanted Kim out as soon as possible. \nKim's mum had died from cancer when Kim was seven. Her dad wasn't in the picture and there weren't any other blood relatives, so as a young child Kim had been placed into care.\nFor the first five years things were \"absolutely amazing,\" she says. But from the age of about 13 the relationship with her foster carer began to break down.\n\"I don't know if I could ever pinpoint exactly why we weren't getting on - I guess we were just very different,\" she says.\nKim was excelling at school, and had become involved in the local youth council and the UK Youth Parliament. But her foster carer showed little interest.\n\"That created friction between us because these things were very important to me,\" Kim says. \"The situation got really bad, and it was very hard for me mentally and emotionally.\"\nKim's social worker and school were aware of the problem, but it was decided that she should remain in her foster placement until she had completed her GCSEs. \n\"So I had to stay there and get through it,\" Kim says. \"In hindsight, I don't think it was the best decision.\"\nKim had had various social workers over the years, and at 16 was assigned a personal adviser who'd be with her until she was at least 21 and whose job it was to make sure that Kim understood what services and support were available to her as she became independent.\n\"I had a Pathway Plan which gives you an overview of the coming years,\" Kim says, \"but it's essentially just a tick box - I wasn't really prepared for what was about to happen.\"\nIn some cases, young people can remain in their foster placement after they turn 18 - this is called a Staying Put arrangement and gives them a bit more time and support while they figure out how to live independently. But there was no chance of that for Kim.\n\"I knew that was never going to happen - my carer had made it very clear that she didn't want me,\" she says. \nSo Kim needed to find somewhere else to live.\nWhen she had finished her GCSEs, Kim was told she could move out of her foster home and into a hostel and that she should arrange to go and see it. Her foster carer refused to accompany her to the viewing, but a teacher volunteered to go along, to make sure that everything was OK.\n\"I was lucky that my school was very hands-on and I had a good relationship with my teacher, but I don't think that's an experience that everyone has,\" Kim says.\nThe flat at the hostel was pretty basic. She'd need to buy her own toaster and many other essentials - but she had her part-time job at Nando's, and she could plan and save and start budgeting.\nBut then Kim was told that if she wanted the flat she'd have to sign up there and then and move in straight away.\n\"I was shocked and absolutely frightened,\" she says. \"I was 17 and I'd never lived on my own. This was a big transition, and everything at that moment seemed unstable and uncertain. [I thought] surely we were going to agree a date, giving me two or three weeks to prepare?\n\"It was just very daunting, overwhelming and sudden.\"\nAs the alternative was staying somewhere she no longer felt welcome, Kim decided she'd have to take the place at the hostel. Her teacher helped her fill in the paperwork and provided the bin bags into which Kim packed up all her worldly belongings.\n\"I'm so grateful my teacher did all that, but she shouldn't have needed to. Surely social services or my foster carer should have put something in place for my move? Even just given me plastic bags or boxes to put my stuff in,\" Kim says.\nHer foster carer didn't say a word as Kim and her teacher shuttled back and forth from the house to the car carrying all the things Kim had accumulated during the 10 years she'd lived there.\n\"Are you not going to say anything?\" Kim asked her foster carer when it was time to go.\n\"Oh, bye,\" her foster carer said as she came to the door. And that was it.\n\"I'd called it home and saw those people as family,\" Kim says. \"I didn't have anyone else, so to have an exit as blunt as that was hard. I thought, 'Wow, I'm just a statistic.'\"\nLife in the hostel was challenging. All sorts of people were coming and going at all hours, there were fights and disagreements, people threatening each other. A young man who'd recently been released from prison was living on the other side of a thin wall. Downstairs, a woman with severe mental health issues tried to kill herself and it was Kim who found her. Others lived there because they didn't get on with their parents. All of them were vulnerable, homeless and under 25.\nAt night Kim would lie in bed and cry, unable to sleep because of the loud music that would play until the early hours.\n\"At the age of 17, having to deal with all that was crazy,\" she says. \"I was vulnerable myself, I was still a child, and being amongst all that it would have been easy to be coerced into doing something that I didn't want to do, purely because I was being exposed to it.\" \nKim was eligible to claim benefits and she still worked at Nando's, but eventually she had to quit her job to focus on her A-levels.\n\"I was in year 13 and it was hard - it's your biggest year - you're trying to get into uni and you're worrying about your future,\" she says.\nBut even when it was peaceful enough for Kim to be able to concentrate on her school work, the lack of any internet connection at the hostel hampered her ability to study there.\n\"So I'd have to get up at six to get to college to use their Wi-Fi to catch up on work that I hadn't done the night before,\" she says. \"It was a hard environment to be in - not everyone was striving to get into uni or on to an apprenticeship - a lot of them were just sitting there waiting for a council house. I wasn't with like-minded individuals.\"\nWithout her Nando's wages to augment her benefits and unable to access her Leaving Care Grant because she wasn't yet 18, money was tight, too.\n\"With my benefits I had to pay for my gas and electricity, and I also had to pay Council Tax which I think is absolutely absurd if you're 17 and in full-time education,\" she says. \nWere you in care? How was your transition moving out of the care system?\nNeither her foster carer nor her social workers had ever really talked to Kim about the possibility of going to university, but when Kim told her personal adviser she was applying for courses and had various campuses to visit, social services helped cover her costs. \n\"Financially they were great,\" she says. \"But when I actually got to uni they really let me down.\"\nIn 2016, after her A-levels, Kim accepted a place at Loughborough to study International Business.\nHer best friend's parents drove her and all of her belongings north in time for freshers' week, and although she was relieved to at last be leaving the hostel behind, adjusting to this new life was much tougher than she had envisaged.\n\"First year was quite an overwhelming experience and I definitely struggled,\" Kim says.\n\"Everyone else had parents who called them, sent food and money, and would come and see them - but I didn't have any of that. I just felt like an alien, and isolated from everyone else. I felt like I was the only care leaver, like an island.\"\nAs the end of the year approached and the other students returned home to spend Christmas with their families, Kim was left thinking, \"But where do I go?\" And eventually, things became too much.\n\"Mentally I broke down, and I just didn't know who to call,\" she says. \"My social worker had come to see me the week I'd moved in and then I never heard from her again. No emails, no calls, no texts, didn't visit. So when I say I didn't have anyone to call, I literally had no-one.\"\nIn desperation, Kim reached out to the pastoral care manager at her secondary school.\n\"I called her, crying, and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I don't know what I'm going to do - I don't know anyone, I don't know the services...'\"\nWith help from her school, Kim was directed to student wellbeing and inclusion services at her university and booked in for an emergency meeting with someone who dealt with care leavers.\n\"I was able to go and express all my concerns and queries,\" Kim says, \"and just having that person to talk to was very important.\" \nIn time things settled down, but towards the end of the academic year Kim began to panic.\n\"Everyone else was worrying about their results, but I was worrying about being homeless from June to October,\" she says.\nEven with her part-time restaurant job and a bursary she received from social services, Kim couldn't afford to stay in her halls of residence over the summer holidays and had to move in with her best friend's family until the start of the autumn term.\n\"I literally had nowhere else to go,\" she says.\nSocial services didn't know where Kim was living. No-one was keeping an eye on her or making sure she had somewhere safe to stay. She hadn't even heard from her personal adviser since the beginning of term.  \n\"I could have been anywhere,\" she says. \"I could have been homeless.\"\nAnd at the beginning of the next academic year, Kim discovered that she just didn't have enough money to make the deposit on her accommodation. With no-one else to turn to she called social services for help.\nShe asked why her personal adviser hadn't contacted her for more than a year, and was told that the social worker in question had left.\n\"Does that not ring any alarm bells?\" Kim asked them.\n\"We think you just fell through the cracks,\" she was told.\nThey'd tried to contact her, they said. But Kim hadn't heard from anyone and hadn't changed her number or email address.\n\"I know I'm not someone that you need to check in on all the time, but it would have been nice to hear just something from them,\" she says. \"I had absolutely nothing and that's poor.\"\nKim graduated last year. She now has her own place to live and recently started a job as a high-flier in the Civil Service. She has refused to let her past dictate her future, but looking back she feels she should have been better supported in her journey from care to independence.\nFor one thing, she criticises social services for failing to encourage her ambition to study and do well.\n\"The system doesn't push young people to aim higher and pursue their passions. Social services should be driving people to university or apprenticeships or starting up their own businesses,\" she says.\n\"I've spoken to other young care leavers who would have gone to uni or done an apprenticeship had they known certain things would have been in place - but we're not well informed, we're just left to wing it, and at the age of 16 or 17 making decisions without being guided is very hard.\"\nBut her main criticism is that they let her fall off their radar, despite their duty of care.\n\"That's my issue - the safeguarding,\" she says. \"It's not OK that they didn't call in and check on me - I could have been anywhere, I could have been being exploited, and I could have been homeless.\"\nShe urges other young care leavers who might be struggling to reach out if they need help. If social services are unhelpful she points to the organisations Become, the national charity for children in care and care leavers, and Propel, which informs care leavers about the support available at colleges and universities.\nAs she discovered, universities also often have wellbeing services that will help students in difficulty.\nIn fact, during her final year at Loughborough Kim helped create new guidelines for supporting young care leavers starting at the university.\n\"And that was work that I was really proud to be a part of,\" she says. \nKim has recently been told that her own social work case will be wound down this year. \n\"That's quite an interesting feeling. I've been with those guys since I was seven years old and now I'm 23,\" she says.\n\"But I've always been quite independent, and I'm at a stage in life now where I'm able to help myself. I should be OK.\"\nHow did you find the transition from being in care to moving out of the care system?

      "tags": "Northern Ireland Assembly,DUP (Democratic Unionist Party)",
      "text": "Edwin Poots has resigned as leader of DUP after just 21 days in the job. \nIt came after he agreed a deal with Sinn F\u00e9in and the Westminster government to ensure Paul Givan became Northern Ireland's first minister. \nA majority of DUP members in the assembly wanted to delay the process and he faced an internal revolt at a party meeting.\nMr Poots, who took over from Arlene Foster in May, narrowly defeated Sir Jeffrey Donaldson in a leadership vote.\nEarlier on Thursday, Paul Givan was nominated as the new first minister at Stormont while Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle O'Neill returned as deputy first minister.\nThe BBC understands a motion of no confidence was mentioned but not tabled at the meeting of DUP officers.\nParty sources described the meeting as \"robust\" and said it had become clear Mr Poots knew he had to resign.\nIt is thought the process to appoint his successor could move \"at pace\", according to one DUP figure. \nFor 21 days, Edwin Poots was living the dream, leading the party his father helped found, the party he joined as a teenager. \nHis DNA was DUP, but nobody could have predicted how quickly the dream turned sour. \nHe grabbed power by insisting he would be a \"listening leader\" for his assembly colleagues (MLAs) who had felt their voices weren't heard during the Foster years. \nBut ironically, his downfall was sealed when those same MLAs were ignored by their new leader.\nThey demanded that Edwin Poots stall the nomination of Paul Givan as first minister, but he didn't listen. \nHis fate was sealed and his dream was short lived.  \nIn a statement, Mr Poots said: \"I have asked the Party Chairman to commence an electoral process within the Party to allow for a new leader of the Democratic Unionist Party to be elected.\n\"The Party has asked me to remain in post until my successor is elected.\n \"This has been a difficult period for the Party and the country and I have conveyed to the Chairman my determination to do everything I can to ensure both Unionism and Northern Ireland is able to move forward to a stronger place.\"\nResponding to the news, a Sinn F\u00e9in spokesperson said the DUP leadership was \"a matter for that party\".\nIn a statement they added: \"Sinn F\u00e9in has worked for weeks to bring stability to the executive.\n\"We have monumental challenges ahead that will require unity of purpose and urgency. They include tackling the totally unacceptable hospital waiting lists that have left people crucified, in pain and without hope.\n\"That is our focus and should remain the focus of all ministers in the executive.\"\nThe nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood tweeted that he was \"sick of this soap opera\".\n\"We're in the middle of a pandemic, waiting lists are sky rocketing, our economy is in crisis. Maybe it's time for some grown up politics.\"\nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) leader, Doug Beattie said the situation was \"inevitable\". \n\"It doesn`t matter who the leader of the DUP is because they will face the same critical issues which were negotiated and agreed on their watch,\" he added. \nThe planned North South Ministerial Council meeting in Armagh will now not be going ahead on Friday, the Irish government has said. \n\"Given political developments in Northern Ireland today, tomorrow's NSMC Plenary meeting has been postponed at the request of the northern side,\" a statement read.\nFormer DUP MP and Arlene Foster's special adviser Emma Little-Pengelly told BBC NI's The View that there had been \"monumental mistakes\" for his leadership.\nShe said Mr Poots had been \"keen\" to take the leadership and to effect change.\nShe said it had been difficult for him but \"he had no actual plan or strategy for how he was going to address issues in the party\".\n\"The legacy of his leadership is that the secretary of state and UK government will underwrite the Irish Language legislation and cultural package.\"\nProf Jon Tonge, of Liverpool University, who has written extensively about the DUP told the programme Mr Poots should have been better prepared.\n\"We knew what was coming from Sinn F\u00e9in - they wanted New Decade New Approach to be implemented and he should have been prepared for that, squared his party off, knowing Sinn F\u00e9in would smell blood as the DUP would be petrified by an election.\n\"That's how he has ended up where he is now - by not bringing his party with him and those assembly members who supported him weeks ago - deserted him in droves - his position was untenable from this morning.\"\nMr Poots had named Mr Givan as the party's choice to replace Mrs Foster as first minister, while Sinn F\u00e9in said Ms O'Neill would resume her post as deputy first minister.\nThe vast majority of DUP assembly members (MLAs) - 24 to four - voted against Mr Poots nominating Mr Givan as first minister, during a meeting ahead of the special assembly sitting.\nSinn F\u00e9in had wanted commitments from the DUP over a timetable for implementing Irish language legislation, as set out in the New Decade, New Approach deal (NDNA) that restored power sharing in January 2020.\nThe party called on Brandon Lewis to bring in Irish language legislation via Westminster.\nMr Poots had said he was committed to implementing all of the NDNA commitments, including those around Irish language, but not necessarily before the end of the current assembly mandate in May 2022.\nWhen a deal was reached in the early hours of Thursday, Mr Lewis said he was \"disappointed\" the Stormont executive had not brought Irish language legislation forward in the assembly."

      "title": "Covid: Epidemic growing across England, says study",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Covid-19 epidemic in England is growing, scientists tracking it say - with much of it being driven by younger people who are not yet vaccinated.\nThe analysis, from the React-1 study, looked at the period 20 May to 7 June. \nHowever, tentative signs in the latest daily data suggest growth may be beginning to slow.\nThe rollout of vaccinations to younger people is key to reducing further spread, researchers from Imperial College London say.\nSince last year, the team has been inviting a representative sample of the population to take Covid swab tests. The researchers found:\nThe analysis also suggests a strengthening link between cases and hospital admissions, which is also reflected in the government's daily coronavirus data.\nThe number of new infections is rising, with a seven-day average of 8,404 cases. The UK recorded 11,007 cases on Thursday - the highest number since 12,027 were reported on 19 February. \nThe number of hospitalisations has also increased, with 1,177 patients in hospital as of Monday. However, daily deaths remain low, with a weekly average of nine deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nA further 19 deaths were reported on Thursday.\nProf Paul Elliot, who directs the study, said: \"We can take quite a lot of comfort from the fact that when we look in the details, it does appear that there is very, very good protection in the older ages, where there is virtually everyone double vaccinated.\n\"The government has clearly announced that they want to vaccinate all adults in the period between now and 19 July. That will make a very big difference and increase the total amount of population immunity.\"\nHe told BBC News that the study had found the Delta variant first seen in India had overtaken the Alpha (Kent) variant as the UK's dominant strain, and was responsible for an estimated 90% of infections.\nEngland's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said Covid-19 had \"not thrown its last surprise at us\", warning that he is anticipating case rates will continue to rise over the next few weeks due to the Delta variant being \"significantly more transmissible\" than the Alpha variant.\nHe told the NHS Confed Conference he expected a \"further winter surge\" and said he thought new variants may well lead to booster jabs or revaccination being required over the next two to three years.\nThe picture presented by React is one from 10 days ago. But if we look at the daily figures published by the government, there are some encouraging signs, albeit very tentative.\nLast week, cases appeared to be doubling every 10 days, but this week that has slowed to something closer to 14 days. \nIt still means the epidemic is growing - but it is the first sign of a flattening of cases. \nThis, of course, could be a false dawn. The rise in infections has largely been driven by north-west England- the top 20 local-authority areas with the highest rates are all in that region. \nInfections could easily take off in other areas, speeding up the growth of this wave. \nBut if this slowing of growth holds, it is very positive. \nGovernment scientists had feared rapid growth right up to 19 July. \nThis would drive up hospital admissions, albeit, because of the vaccines, at a lower rate than in previous waves. \nIt is still early days, but data is now a little more encouraging than it was. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson cited the Delta variant's rapid spread when he announced a four-week delay to the lifting of remaining Covid restrictions in England\nThe government has accelerated its vaccination drive, setting a new target to vaccinate all over-18s with a first dose and two-thirds of adults with a second dose by the same date.\nEveryone aged 18 and over in England will be able to book their Covid-19 vaccine from Friday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced at the NHS conference.\nHe said a first dose had now been given to four out of five adults (80.1%). \nAs of Wednesday more than 30 million people - 58.2% of adults - have had both doses.\nNew figures published by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday suggest people who test positive for Covid after being vaccinated are less likely to show symptoms and have less of the virus in their body.\nThe ONS analysis swabbed people at random and picked up asymptomatic infections as well as cases that show up in the daily case numbers.\nIt showed that the risk of getting infected was highest in the first three weeks after vaccination and fell after a second vaccination. Just under 40% of people who did get infected after vaccination showed symptoms. \nThere have been about 16,000 suspected cases of coronavirus reinfection detected in England, out of nearly four million cases, according to Public Health England data, although only 53 have been confirmed.\nIn other coronavirus developments:"

      "text": "Most curbs to people's daily lives have been lifted as Wales moves to the lowest level of Covid rules.\nRules limiting socialising in pubs, bars and restaurants have been removed, while nightclubs are able to reopen for the first time since measures brought in to tackle the spread of Omicron were introduced after Christmas.\nSocial distancing rules were also scrapped as Wales moved into alert level zero on 28 January.\nPeople who test positive for Covid must now isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nHowever masks are still required to be worn in most public places in Wales, including shops, hospitals and on public transport. \nBut they are no longer needed for bars and restaurants, and changes to rules due to be announced later, mean they will also no longer be needed when visiting someone in their own room at a care home.\nWhat do the changes mean for people and businesses in Wales, and what can you do and when?\nChanges to rules have been made over the last two weeks, after First Minister Mark Drakeford laid out his plan to ease restrictions by the end of January.\nThe changes saw:\nFrom Thursday, 10 February Wales returns to a three-week review cycle as the country is at alert level zero\nThe lowest set of restrictions since the start of the pandemic, we were last in alert level zero at Christmas.\nUnder it most curbs to our daily life are removed, all businesses are allowed to reopen, but people still have to wear face masks in many public places, and self isolation rules still apply.\nSince 22 December, fully vaccinated adults, children aged between five and 18 and vaccine clinical trial participants identified as a close contact of a positive case of Covid-19 in Wales do not need to self-isolate. \nInstead, the Welsh government strongly advises them to take lateral flow tests for seven days as a precautionary measure. Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests.\nFrom 28 January people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nUntil then, the self-isolation period was seven days, down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on day six and seven. \nThe Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive.\nIt is advising meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated.\nPeople, it said, should leave at least a day between social events.\nFrom 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. \nBut under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January.\nThe rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended.\nPeople are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped.\nWhile wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nLimits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August.\nFor important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures.\nAll guests will need to take a lateral flow test.\nPeople attending weddings, civil partnership or alternative wedding ceremony or reception, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero.\nHowever the Welsh government says it strongly advises people to wear a face covering indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nYou can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply.\nOn 25 January 2022, the Welsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidays for the first time since the start of the pandemic. \nNightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four stage plan, they have been allowed to open from 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. \nHowever, Covid passes are still needed for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. \nFrom 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500.\nOn 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. \nPupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January.\nA legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with \u00a360 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, has been scrapped from 28 January.\nHowever, the Welsh government has said it will remain important to work from home if you can.\nYou have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations.\nIt also means people from other parts of the UK can come here.\nAll holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May."

      "title": "Why cyber gangs won't worry about US-Russia talks",
      "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Joe Biden have agreed to develop a cyber-security arrangement between the two countries after discussing the issue of ransomware at their summit in Geneva.\nMr Biden says he and Mr Putin will start consultations \"to begin to bring some order\" after recent high-profile attacks by criminal gangs on critical US companies. \nBut talks are likely to be complex after both sides disagreed about who was to blame for the growing problem of ransomware. \nPresident Biden says he raised a recent attack which took a major US fuel pipeline offline with Mr Putin. \nThe attack was carried out by hacker group Darkside, which is suspected to be Russian. \nMr Biden says he gave Mr Putin a list of 16 specific critical entities that should be considered \"off-limits\" from future cyber-attacks.\nHowever President Putin told reporters that the Colonial Pipeline attack and others have \"nothing to do with Russian authorities\".\nMr Putin also claimed he had been told by US sources that most cyber-attacks originate from the US, and that Russian attempts to get information about attacks originating from the US are being ignored.\nThe anonymous nature of the cyber world means it is often hard to know exactly who is doing the attacking and from where.\nHowever, over the last few years an undeniable pattern has been observed by experts that points in one distinct direction.\n\"The intelligence and research community believes that the attacks are coming from former Soviet block countries, namely Russia, Ukraine, and others\", says former Russian hacker and now cyber-security expert Dmitry Smilyanets. \n\"There are multiple indications proving that point.\"\nDmitry Smilyanets and other experts point towards four distinct pieces of evidence:\n\"Covert engagement and clandestine operations aimed at ransomware operators and affiliates are also providing extraordinary intelligence,\" Mr Smilyanets who works for cyber-defenders Recorded Future says. \n\"Their knowledge and attribution are very accurate and support the findings of cyber-researchers also looking into this area\". \nIn 2019 two Russian individuals were indicted by US and UK authorities accused of running the Evil Corp ransomware gang but both men remain free in Russia.\nIn his press conference, President Putin told reporters that Russia regularly faces ransomware attacks and cited the example of a Russian healthcare service being hit by hackers, which he claimed was carried out by US hackers.\nHowever, Dmitry Smilyanets says he thinks it's unlikely this incident would have been ransomware or news of any resulting disruption would have been public.  \nThe reason there are so few ransomware attacks on Russia and the former Soviet states is often put down to the much discussed 'One Rule' of Russian hacking - which means you can go after anyone as long as they are not on friendly soil.\nThere's no doubt that ransomware gangs are operating in many other countries.\nHackers in North Korea for example were responsible for the most serious ransomware attack in history that impacted hundreds of NHS hospitals in the UK in 2017.\nOn the same day as the Geneva summit, six suspected criminals were arrested in Ukraine for alleged links to a ransomware group called Clop.\nThe individuals are being accused of being involved with attacks against organisations in the US and South Korea.\nAnother suspected hacker was arrested in Canada in January for his alleged involvement with another ransomware group called Netwalker.\nHowever, none of these recent arrests are thought to have seriously harmed the core criminal enterprises of these well-funded and lucrative ransomware hacking networks. \nMost experts agree that the epicentre of this destructive and lucrative criminal industry which is currently ripping through the world originates from Russia and its former Soviet neighbours.

      "title": "Ganges river: India boatman praised for saving baby girl floating in a box",
      "tags": "Asia,Asia Pacific,India,Yogi Adityanath",
      "text": "A boatman in India's northern Uttar Pradesh state is being praised after he rescued a baby girl found floating in a wooden box in the Ganges river.\nGullu Chaudhary said he was alerted by the cries of the 21-day-old and found her wrapped in a red scarf in the box decorated with images of Hindu deities. \nThe baby has been taken to hospital and her health is being monitored. She will be sent to a shelter home later.\nOfficials are investigating how the baby ended up in the river.\nThey have not speculated on possible motives for the abandonment, but India's gender ratio is one of the worst in the world. Women are often discriminated against socially and girls are seen as a financial burden, particularly among poor communities.\nAlthough most unwanted female foetuses are aborted with help from illegal sex determination clinics, cases of baby girls being killed or abandoned after birth are not uncommon either. \nPolice said the box had a birth horoscope card which had the time and date of the baby's birth, and mentioned her name as Ganga - the Hindi name for river Ganges.\nThe state government said it would bear the costs of the baby's nurturing. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced that the boatman would be rewarded with government benefits, including a house, for showing a \"matchless example of humanity\".\nOfficials in Ghazipur district, where the baby was rescued, told reporters that District Magistrate MP Singh had checked on the baby and that officials were also sent to meet the boatman. \nMr Chaudhary told local reporters that when people on the river bank heard the baby girl's cries, no one stepped forward to help. \"But I rushed to rescue her. When I opened the wooden box, I found her.\"  \nThe incident created a stir as a crowd gathered on the banks of the river. Videos shot at the scene showed the boatman picking up the box from the water and cradling the newborn in his arms. \nHe then took the baby to his house from where police picked her up and the child welfare officials took her to hospital.

      "tags": "Manchester,Manchester Arena attack inquiry",
      "text": "Twenty-two people murdered in the Manchester Arena bomb were \"failed on every level\" by organisations criticised in a public inquiry report, a victim's father has said.\nBomber Salman Abedi should have been identified as a threat by security, the inquiry chairman said.   \nSir John Saunders found there were missed opportunities to avert or minimise the \"devastating impact\".\nMartyn Hett's father said the attack \"should have been prevented\".\nPaul Hett, whose 29-year-old son died in the bombing, said it had been heartbreaking \"to find that Martyn had just been in the wrong place at the wrong time\".\nIn addition to those who died, hundreds more were injured when the Manchester-born bomber, who was of Libyan descent, walked across the arena's foyer at the end of an Ariana Grande concert and detonated a device at 22:31 BST on 22 May 2017. \nThe first of three reports published by the public inquiry, which began in September, levelled criticism at British Transport Police (BTP), the arena operators SMG, and their contracted security providers, Showsec. \nMr Hett said the organisations involved had a duty of care to protect his son and the other victims, adding: \"This inquiry has rightly found that we were failed by them on every level.\" \n\"This atrocity should and could have been prevented, and 22 people would not have lost their lives,\" he said. \nSir John said it was likely Abedi would have detonated his device if confronted but \"the loss of life and injury is highly likely to have been less\".\nOn the night of the bombing the national terror threat was classed as severe, meaning an attack was highly likely.\nThe inquiry chairman said: \"Whilst the threat was not specific to any particular premises, the arena was always a possible target for a terrorist.\n\"Everybody concerned with security at the arena should have been doing their job in the knowledge that a terrorist attack might occur on that night. \n\"They weren't. No-one believed it could happen to them.\"\nSir John found two teenage stewards did not react \"as robustly and effectively as they should have\" when a member of the public, Christopher Wild, raised his concerns about the bomber. \nThe inquiry chairman called this \"the most striking missed opportunity\". \nOther key findings:\nA range of improvements have been recommended. \nMost notably Sir John has supported the introduction of new \"Protect Duty\" legislation to place a duty on venue operators to consider and cater for the risk of a terrorist attack. \nFigen Murray has been campaigning for the legislation, also known an \"Martyn's Law\", in memory of her son, Martyn Hett.\nShe said the report made it clear that \"venue security needs to be improved to help prevent further terror attacks\". \n\"We should not have to live in fear and I am determined to make this law a reality,\" she added. \nThis report makes difficult reading for the families of the 22 people who were murdered at the Manchester Arena.\nBut everyone I have spoken to has said how important it is, and how valuable they find it. \nNothing in the 200-page document can bring their loved ones back but there is a united feeling they do not want anyone else to suffer as they have.\nAnd so, they are committed to this inquiry laying out failures and suggesting ways to improve things for the future. \nThe families I have spoken to know that there is still a long road ahead and are particularly dreading the section of the inquiry which will examine how the 22 died and whether any of them could have been saved. \nThey know that there will be many more painful days like this one before they reach the end of the process. \nJune Tron, mother of 32-year-old Philip Tron from Gateshead, said she hoped laws would be introduced \"to ensure people can go to a concert or a big public event in confidence that they have the best possible protection\".  \n\"It has become clear that was not the case for Philip, 21 others who also lost their lives, and the hundreds more who were seriously injured or left traumatised by what happened,\" she said.\nShe said it was hard to accept that \"Philip and everybody else in the vicinity of the arena that night was placed at risk\". \nSolicitor Neil Hudgell, who represents some of the bereaved families, said collective failings made the arena a sitting target for terrorists, leaving thousands of young people \"open and vulnerable\".\n\"The security around the venue and event was nowhere near what it needed to be,\" he said. \nSpeaking on behalf of seven bereaved families, lawyer Elkan Abrahamson said: \"It has been incredibly disappointing for our families to watch and listen as those with responsibility for the safety of their loved ones failed to accept serious shortcomings and inadequacies in the security arrangements and sought to avoid responsibility and push the blame on to others.\" \nHe added: \"Prosecutions should be commenced without further delay.\"\nArena operator SMG said it would \"continuously challenge ourselves to be better\". \nSMG added that, during the inquiry, experts \"did not see evidence that the security operation in place at Manchester Arena was out of step with the operations being used at other comparable venues\" but added that \"this doesn't give us any comfort\". \n\"Our guests came to the arena to enjoy a show but were met with a horrific tragedy. For that we are truly sorry,\" a spokesperson added. \nSecurity firm Showsec said it had \"learnt lessons\" and improvements were \"already in place\" but it would now \"take time to consider both Sir John's criticisms and his recommendations before responding as he has requested\". \nBTP Chief Constable Lucy D'Orsi said the force had been \"reviewing procedures, operational planning and training\" since the attack and was \"committed to ensuring our staff are supported and prepared to undertake the roles they are required to do\".  \nHome Secretary Priti Patel said the government continued \"to take action in response to the terrorist threat\" and had launched a consultation on the proposed Protect Duty.\nShe said the government would \"carefully consider\" the report and would respond fully in due course. \nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "Brewdog boss James Watt has promised an independent review of the beer firm after fierce criticism from ex-staff.\nMr Watt said it would also conduct an anonymous staff survey to \"paint a comprehensive picture of the Brewdog culture at every level\".\nWriting on LinkedIn the company co-founder apologised to staff for the \"lot of pain\" they have been caused.\n\"I am ultimately responsible for the culture. The letter that ex-colleagues wrote to us is 100% my fault,\" he said.\nThe letter from ex-workers posted on Twitter earlier in the week said a \"significant number\" of former staff had \"suffered mental illness as a result of working at Brewdog\".\nIt made a number of allegations, including that Brewdog fostered a culture where staff were afraid to speak out about concerns.\nIt said Mr Watt and co-founder Martin Dickie had exploited publicity, \"both good and bad\", to further their own business goals and chased \"growth, at all costs\".\nThe fast-growing Scottish brewer and pub chain has enjoyed rapid success and now employs 2,000 staff. But it has also courted controversy with its marketing and commercial decisions.\nIn his LinkedIn post Mr Watt said: \"I want to be very candid about some mistakes that I have made that have detrimentally impacted our culture. \n\"In the hard and fast environment of high growth, I have all too often neglected many important people elements of our business.\n\"Furthermore, despite surviving C-19 due to a phenomenal effort from our amazing team I had to make some very hard decisions to ensure our survival and these decisions have taken a considerable human toll on our business and had a negative impact. \n\"Additionally, some PR mistakes that I have made in our past have also had a detrimental impact on culture. \nI can promise that I will not make these mistakes again.\"\nHe said exit interviews will be sent in the next two weeks to everyone who's left the company in the last 12 months.\nHe promised a salary review that was postponed because of COVID will go ahead.\nHe also committed to forming  \nan employee representative group to \"ensure employees have a clear voice\"."

      "tags": "Conservation,Biodiversity,Wildlife,Nature",
      "text": "The 1,000th captive-bred hazel dormouse has been released into the wild in a UK-wide reintroduction scheme for these threatened mammals. \nBig-eyed and famously sleepy, the dormouse is a woodland and fairy tale icon, but it is a species in decline. \nOnce widespread, the animals have now disappeared from 17 English counties. \nReintroduction, scientists say, is the only way to bring dormice back to habitats from which they have been lost. \nThe project, a collaboration between the wildlife charity People's Trust for Endangered Species (PTES), Natural England and the University of Cumbria, brought 15 breeding pairs to a secret location in the Arnside and Silverdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in Lancashire. \n\"When I started 15 years ago, there were five populations in northern England, and now there's only one,\" said Ian White, who has worked for the PTES for 15 years. \n\"It's a decline in woodland and hedgerow management. Dormice live in the shrub layer of woodland, and in many areas that layer has been stripped out, or the forest has been left to grow up and shade out the understory.\"\nWith its tangle of hazel, willow and bramble, the chosen Lancashire release site is ideal for the rodents, but getting them there has been a time-consuming team effort. \nThe 30 dormice in this most recent (and most northerly) release were bred and reared in captivity at London Zoo. They were kept in quarantine for nine weeks and thoroughly checked for disease or parasites, before being transported more than 250 miles by car. \nThe animals travelled in special dormouse nest boxes that were handmade by prisoners in HMP Doncaster and Humber - as part of a partnership between the PTES and the Department of Justice. \n\"Dormice belong here,\" said Dr Deborah Brady, from the University of Cumbria in Ambleside. \"But 50% of the population has been lost in just the last 20 years, which fits in with the loss of biodiversity we're facing more broadly. \n\"And this is a species that we can practically help - we can do something about that.\" \nThe same team is planning another reintroduction next year in a nearby location. \n\"We should end up with a population of possibly 70 or 80 animals in three very closely connected woodlands. Those animals will hopefully breed and we'll be watching that population really carefully,\" Dr Brady added.\nWith the help of 200 extra carefully monitored dormouse nesting boxes installed in the woodland, as well as footprint tunnels placed along branches the rodents will use to move around the undergrowth, the team will be watching closely to see how well the animals settle into their new home.\nHopefully, said Mr White, there will be dormouse babies in Lancashire this summer. \n\"One of my go-to dormouse facts is that the newborn babies are the size of raisins,\" he said.\n\"The idea, long-term, will be to have dormice in this whole landscape - not just this individual wood.\"\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"

      "tags": "Companies,Live music,Ticketing,Music",
      "text": "UK music fans are sitting on hundreds of thousands of tickets for postponed concerts rather than returning them. \nThe latest four-week delay to fully unlocking Covid restrictions has pushed an additional 5,000 gigs into doubt. \nArtists such as Rag'n'Bone Man, Olly Murs and Rudimental had scheduled shows between 21 June and 19 July and face a choice of postponing or scrapping gigs.\nIndustry body Live estimates the events scheduled for the next four weeks are worth \u00a3500m to the struggling sector. \nIt also means that fans remain out of pocket to see shows they forked out for many months ago. \nAnn Marshall from Surrey has several tickets booked for concerts such as Michael Bubl\u00e9, Simply Red and Genesis, as well as other events - some of which were postponed from last year.\nShe's hopeful that she will eventually get to attend most of them as these were all to celebrate her 60th birthday last year. \n\"I hate to think how much money I've spent!\" she says.\n\"I'm happy to carry things over as I wanted to see them anyway.\"\nOne of the biggest event agencies in the UK, Ticketmaster, said that 83% of fans are choosing to keep hold of their tickets for rescheduled shows. \n\"Fans are entitled to a refund for any cancelled event and for any rescheduled show if they cannot make the new date,\" said Andrew Parsons, Ticketmaster UK managing director.\n\"But it is great to see an incredibly high amount of fans holding onto their tickets. It just goes to show the unwavering demand from fans to get back to live.\"\nFor lots of people hanging onto gig tickets has been a way of supporting the arts during the pandemic, or provided a little glimmer of hope for their post-lockdown life. Plenty may have forgotten they even had any tickets. \nHowever, lots can change in 16 months, so there's plenty of reasons why gig-goers might not be able to make a new gig date. Similarly, they may have better things to do with that \u00a3100 the ticket company is hanging on to.\nIf an event is cancelled then refunds should be automatic, but if it's postponed then you need to ask. You are entitled to a full refund from the ticket provider, they just don't shout about it. \nIf you bought from a secondary ticket seller like Viagogo or StubHub then check their terms, but you may have to sell the ticket on to get any money back.\nIn automated messages seen by the BBC, gig-goers have been explicitly \"advised\" to keep hold of their tickets to postponed shows by vendor SEE. Neither SEE nor Ticketmaster provide explicit information in messages about applying for refunds. The BBC has approached SEE for comment.\nBut the appetite to keep tickets will be reassuring to an industry crippled by the pandemic. \nGreg Parmley, the chief executive of Live - which represents venues, businesses, crew and artists - said the latest delay to lockdown easing had left businesses and fans unable to enjoy the summer.\nIt also comes in spite of the success of the Events Research Programme, which has enabled trial events to go ahead to examine how large gatherings can take place safely. \n\"The government must now follow its own science if it is to avoid the decline of the UK's world-leading live music industry, which absolutely cannot afford to miss out on another summer of cancelled events after a year on pause,\" said Mr Parmley.
