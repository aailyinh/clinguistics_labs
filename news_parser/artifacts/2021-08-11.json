      "title": "Covid-19: More than 75% of UK adults now double-jabbed",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than 75% of UK adults have now received two Covid jabs, the government has said.\nA total of 39,688,566 people have now received both doses, while another 7 million have only had a single dose, according to the latest figures.\nBoris Johnson described the milestone in the vaccine rollout as a \"huge national achievement\".\nBut Oxford Vaccine Group director Prof Sir Andrew Pollard has warned that herd immunity is \"not a possibility\".\nMargaret Keenan became the first person to be vaccinated as part of the UK rollout on 8 December.\nSince then more there have been more than 86.7 million vaccinations delivered, with people receiving their jabs everywhere from sports stadiums to circuses.\nAt the peak of the rollout more than 752,000 jabs were given in a day on 20 March, although the rate has since slowed.\nThe UK reached the milestone of getting 50% of adults double jabbed on 3 June and 25% of adults had received both doses by 27 April.\nA further 32,250 first doses and 137,028 second doses were given across the UK on Monday.\nThe latest data also shows there were 23,510 new cases of Covid as well as a further 146 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test.\nThe prime minister hailed the \"incredible vaccine rollout\" and said it had provided vital protection against the virus for three-quarters of adults.\n\"It's so important that those who haven't been vaccinated come forward as soon as possible to book their jab - to protect themselves, protect their loved ones and allow us all to enjoy our freedoms safely,\" he said.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said the vaccines were \"allowing us to reconnect with the things we love\", while vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said it had been \"phenomenal to see first-hand the enthusiasm of the British public for the vaccines\".\nBut Sir Andrew told MPs the idea of herd immunity was \"mythical\" with the Delta variant, now dominant in the UK, still infecting people who had been vaccinated.\nHe said while vaccines might \"slow the process\" of transmission down, they currently cannot stop the spread completely.\nEarlier Mr Javid said that plans are in place to give the most vulnerable groups a third or booster Covid jab in September.\nThis has been criticised, with Sir Andrew telling the All Party Parliamentary Group on coronavirus that any spare jabs should \"go where they can have the greatest impact\" to protect unvaccinated people abroad.\nThe latest data from Public Health England and Cambridge University suggests that around 60,000 UK deaths and 22 million infections had been prevented by vaccines so far, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said.\nThe government said two doses of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines provided over 90% protection against hospitalisation from the Delta variant, which is now dominant in the UK.\nAll adults in the UK will have been offered the chance to have both doses by mid-September, the DHSC said.\nMinisters will be watching the second dose figure to see how close it edges to 100% in the weeks ahead.\nThe government has already announced that by the end of September, people in England will require full vaccination status to go to nightclubs and some other events with large crowds.\nAnd from next Monday double vaccinated people will no longer be required to self-isolate if they are identified as a close contact of a positive Covid case.\nThe UK vaccine rollout began with people aged 80 and over as well as some health and care staff before moving to those at higher risk of illness from Covid and down through age groups.\nLast week children aged 16 and 17 began to be invited for their jabs following a change in advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nNHS England said nearly 16,000 16 and 17-year-olds had already received their vaccine over the weekend.\nSome children aged 12 and over who are at a higher risk of serious illness from Covid, or live with immunosuppressed adults, will be contacted about vaccines in coming weeks.

      "text": "The Duke of York \"cannot hide behind wealth and palace walls\" and must respond to sexual abuse allegations filed in a US court, his accuser's lawyer told BBC Two's Newsnight.\nPrince Andrew should allow a jury to decide what happened, David Boies, the lawyer of Virginia Giuffre, said.\nMs Giuffre has filed a civil case in New York alleging the duke sexually assaulted her when she was 17.\nThe duke has consistently denied the claims.\nA spokeswoman for the duke said there was no comment on the civil case.\nMr Boies said Ms Giuffre had \"tried every way she can to resolve this short of litigation\". \nHe said Ms Giuffre - who was an accuser of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein - now wants a judge and jury to hear the evidence.\nMr Boies added that \"at this point litigation is the only way to establish once and for all what the truth is - and litigation is the only way to establish once and for all what Prince Andrew's evidence actually is\".\nThe lawyer said people \"ignore the courts at your peril\" and that \"it would be very ill-advised for Prince Andrew to ignore judicial process\".\n\"If he does, it will be a default judgement against him that will be, in effect, enforced not only in the United States, but in virtually every civilised country in the world,\" he said.\nMr Boies said Ms Giuffre intends to send a message to rich and powerful men that the alleged behaviour \"is not acceptable and that you cannot hide behind wealth and power and palace walls\".\nHe said she wanted to be compensated for damage she said was done to her and donate money to a charitable foundation to help victims of sex trafficking.\nBut asked what figure he had in mind, he said that was for a jury to decide - but they would seek compensatory and punitive damages and he believed each would be \"substantial\".\nThe civil proceedings taking place in New York will proceed even if the duke and his legal team do not engage. Prince Andrew does not face the prospect of an extradition hearing as this only applies to criminal charges and not civil cases.\nArick Fudali, a partner at New York legal firm Bloom, which has represented nine of Epstein's victims, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday that \"very few\" of such cases ended up going to trial but there was a \"small chance\" this could.\nThe alternatives are that it is settled beforehand, it is struck out by a judge, or the complainant ceases the action.\nThe complaint claims Prince Andrew sexually abused Ms Giuffre - then known as Virginia Roberts - at the London home of Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and at Epstein's homes in Manhattan and Little St James in the US Virgin Islands.\nIt alleges the duke engaged in sexual acts without her consent, knowing how old she was and \"that she was a sex-trafficking victim\".\nThe case also says the \"extreme and outrageous conduct\" continues to cause Ms Giuffre, now 38, \"significant emotional and psychological distress and harm\".\n\"In this country no person, whether president or prince, is above the law, and no person, no matter how powerless or vulnerable, can be deprived of the law's protection,\" the documents read.\n\"Twenty years ago Prince Andrew's wealth, power, position, and connections enabled him to abuse a frightened, vulnerable child with no one there to protect her. It is long past the time for him to be held to account.\"\nCourt documents allege Prince Andrew and his representatives rejected requests to provide \"whatever facts, context or explanation he might have, and to explore alternative dispute resolution approaches\". \nSpeaking about Ms Giuffre's allegations in 2019, Prince Andrew said he could not remember meeting her.\n\"It didn't happen. I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened. I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever,\" he said.\nIn a later statement, Prince Andrew said: \"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\"His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure. \n\"I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.\"\nMs Giuffre's claim was filed under New York State's Child Victims Act, which allows alleged survivors of childhood sexual abuse to file a case which had already been time-barred or expired."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,ScotRail,Personal protective equipment (PPE)",
      "text": "ScotRail staff are not expected to enforce rules on wearing face coverings on trains, the operator has confirmed.\nOperations director David Simpson said it was not the job of rail staff to enforce the rules and he did not want to put them in \"difficult positions\".\nPassengers who are uncomfortable with others not wearing masks can contact British Transport Police, he said.\nMr Simpson said face masks were mandatory but it was up to passengers to take \"personal responsibility\".\nSocial distancing rules on public transport were lifted as part of Scotland's move out of Covid level zero, however face coverings remain a legal requirement.\nMr Simpson told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"We're not expecting our staff to enforce it.\n\"Our staff can often be in very difficult position in that respect, particularly on evening services where customers are perhaps more refreshed than usual.\n\"What we don't want to do is put staff into difficult, challenging, potentially upsetting environments.\"\nWhile staff will not be required to enforce mask-wearing, passengers will be asked to follow the rules through announcements.\nMr Simpson said CCTV monitoring had shown \"very high\" compliance and said ScotRail would work with British Transport Police (BTP) where there were \"trouble spots\".\nPassengers who are concerned if others are not wearing masks can contact the transport police or move to a different part of the train, Mr Simpson added.\nScotRail is also pushing the message to wear face coverings in an effort to help people feel safe during the Edinburgh Festival, which began on Friday.\nAdditional carriages have been added to trains and more late night services will run throughout the event.\nTransport Scotland said British Transport Police were responsible for enforcing Covid regulations on the railway network.\nA spokesperson said: \"We have published guidance for transport operators to enable them to keep their staff and passengers safe during the pandemic. \n\"This reinforces the importance of signage, announcements and messaging to remind passengers of Covid-19 requirements whilst using public transport.\n\"Transport Scotland and operators continue to reinforce messaging on the continuing legal requirement to wear face coverings in indoor public places including public transport.\"\nTravellers can expect to see further changes as ScotRail bid to increase passenger numbers as life returns to normal.\nMr Simpson said capacity was around 80% of pre-pandemic levels, but with only 50% of the usual passengers.\nThere has been a \"gradual rise\" in demand, particularly at weekends, but with people continuing to work from home the firm has not seen the return of commuter traffic.\nMeanwhile, the ban on the consumption of alcohol on trains remains in place but will be \"kept under review\".\nMr Simpson added: \"That's been very helpful in terms of reducing anti-social behaviour particularly in the evening. Again staff are asked to be vigilant, but we do expect customers themselves to be responsible.\n\"We've put tremendous amount of effort into enhanced cleaning on trains and in stations.\n\"We think face coverings gives an extra level of reassurance about using public transport and we will be making sure timetable matches demand to avoid overcrowding.\"\nLast month the first minister announced there would be a review of social distancing rules on public transport following a row with cross-border rail operators.\nAt the time ScotRail said \"physical distancing can't be guaranteed\" in stations or on trains."

      "tags": "Welsh Ambulance Service,UK ambulance services,A&E,NHS Wales,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "As lockdown restrictions have eased ambulance staff are having the busiest summer of their lives.\nBut the pressure on hospitals to find free beds can mean long waits outside for the paramedic crews until their patients can be admitted.\nSome say they are \"broken\" after spending so much time queuing outside A&Es - unable to respond to new calls.\nBBC Wales' health correspondent Owain Clarke has been given special access to crews, and 999 call managers.\nParamedic Osian Roberts has spent most of his 12-hour shift in the back of his ambulance. \nHe is outside A&E at Glan Clwyd Hospital, in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire.\nHe knows every inch of tarmac in the hospital's ambulance bay, because that is where he spends most of his time.\n\"We know there are people in the community that are screaming out for an ambulance, but as you can see, a lot of ambulances are waiting here,\" he said.\n\"It never ever used to be like this. We used to bring poorly patients in, and we were out on the road again in 15 minutes.\n\"We could do 10 jobs a shift, today we've done two. It's so demoralising.\"\nOsian first arrived at the hospital at 09:30 BST, two hours after clocking on in Llandudno, to bring in a woman in her 90s, who had fallen at a nursing home and hurt her elbow.\nThe patient, who has dementia, was given blood tests and a heart check, but must stay with Osian in the ambulance until a bed becomes available. \nIt is almost three hours until that happens.\n\"It is frustrating,\" Osian said. \"The patient is becoming a bit irritable and uncomfortable, but it's literally one out, one in, in the department.\"\nBy mid-afternoon Osian arrives at the hospital for a second time. \nThe situation is worse - there are eight ambulances queuing.\nOsian is with a man in his 70s who has fallen at home and may have had a mini-stroke. \nHe knows if a patient arrives more urgently in need of help, his will be pushed back. \nThe longer he waits the less able he is to respond to calls. \n\"You feel you've let your community down,\" said Osian. \n\"Although we've done the best we can for the patient in our care, we know there are people out there waiting for ambulances and we can't get to them.\n\"And when we do get to them they're angry and cross, asking 'Where have you been?'\"\nThe patient is transferred to A&E at 18:50, just before the end of Osian's shift. \nThe crew has responded to three calls since starting at 07:30, out of 440 across north Wales that day.\nMatching piling numbers of calls with tied-up ambulances is putting control centre staff under pressure. \nParticularly as they say the service has been dealing with more 999 calls than ever this summer.\nDuty control manager Ceri Roberts has been in the service for 20 years. \n\"This year I think it's the busiest I've seen,\" she said.\n\"August is always a busy month but this time there seems to be no respite at all. We've got over 24 calls waiting for a response at the moment and the longest amber call has been waiting five-and-a-half hours.\" \nThe waits, Ceri said, can be longer.\n\"It's quite heart-breaking at times,\" she said. \n\"You can go home from a shift tonight and come back in tomorrow and see the same patient waiting in the stack, not having had an ambulance at all.\n\"You want to empathise and think, 'gosh, what if that was my parent or my family member?'\"\nThe pressure on the north Wales service, she said, was caused by several factors.\nThey include the relatively elderly population in the area, a backlog in demand - as some have been reluctant to get symptoms checked during the pandemic, people more likely to be out as Covid restrictions have eased and, with fewer people travelling abroad, north Wales being busier than ever.\nSenior paramedic Hefin Jones works on the control centre's clinical desk and gives advice over the phone.\n\"I've been in the service 30 years and I've never seen it as busy as this,\" he said. \n\"It's people coming out of lockdown, people not going abroad as we live in a touristy area. The number of people on Anglesey, say, is three times more than the usual population.\"\nThis is an \"enormous worry,\" he added. \n\"The worst part, which we deal with a lot on the clinical desk, is people who've been waiting long, long hours for an ambulance response, but you don't have an ambulance to send.\n\"As clinicians we try to support them [on the phone] as best as we can.\" \nHefin said the post-lockdown workload had trebled with extreme pressures now routine. \nHe and Ceri urged the public to help ease the strain.\n\"We've had all types of calls, from sunburn, fish-hooks in feet, cramp in legs, through to much more serious calls,\" Ceri said.\n\"I'd like people to think before they dial 999. It's not just a go-to number.\n\"We've got the 111 symptom checker online and that's a good place to start.\"\nShe said the difference would be \"immense\" if people thought more before dialling 999.\n\"It could mean that the patient who was waiting five hours today could have had a response in maybe 10 to 20 minutes,\" Ceri said. \nElsewhere, it is a worrying time for those working on the front line. \nEmergency medical technician, Joanne Martin, is often on shifts relieving crews outside hospitals so they can take breaks.\n\"I've been coming into the hospitals during the crews' meal-break windows to allow them to have 30 minutes away from their vehicles,\" she said.\nShe had no answers to resolve the situation and feared the future held \"bleakness\".\nShe said: \"A lot of my colleagues have applied for other jobs or have left the ambulance service in the past six to 12 months and that's a great loss because they're good, qualified and experienced people.\n\"A lot of us feel pretty broken. It's not a positive future at the minute and a lot of people are weighing up their options.\"\nOsian Roberts said the current pressures are leaving staff demotivated and demoralised.\nMonitoring patients outside hospitals for hours was not the job he trained for 32 years ago. \nHe said: \"Even though the job itself gives you great satisfaction, helping somebody and making somebody better, being here for hours on end with someone who is needy, and someone who is poorly does get you down.\n\"Pre-hospital care for me was about helping people out in the community, and bringing them to hospital, not being part of the hospital on the yard.\n\"I think [the system] needs drastic reforms.\"\nWelsh Ambulance Service chief executive, Jason Killens, apologised to patients who had endured long waits, saying the service across Wales was in \"uncharted territory\".\nHe insisted the service was working hard to deal with the situation and had recruited \"over a couple of hundred\" new staff in the past 18 months.\n\"We're recruiting and training more through the rest of this year, which will be (paramedics) on the streets as we approach winter,\" he said.\nThe Welsh government said getting patients from ambulances and into A&E remained a \"significant challenge\" and recently announced \u00a325m to improve the outcome of emergency calls.\nA spokesman said: \"A range of local and system-wide factors contribute to these delays, including reduced physical capacity within emergency departments, increased levels of demand, and pressures elsewhere in the system.\"\nBetsi Cadwaladr health board chief executive, Jo Whitehead, said it was working with councils to support patients who were fit to go home, but needed more help before they could be discharged safely. \nShe said: \"This will help to improve the flow in our hospitals and discharge rates, which will support our ability to transfer patients from ambulances more quickly.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Flexible working,Google,Employment,Facebook,United States",
      "text": "Google employees in the US who opt to work from home permanently may get a pay cut.\nThe technology giant has developed a pay calculator that lets employees see the effects of working remotely or moving offices.\nSome remote employees, especially those with a long commute, could have their pay cut without changing address.\nGoogle has no plans at this time to implement the policy in the UK.\nEmployees in many businesses have proved that working from home permanently is viable during the Covid pandemic.\nMany companies are looking ahead to how employees will work as the pandemic recedes, even as the US continues to battle the Delta variant of the disease.\nSilicon Valley firms, some of which are keen to get employees back to their desks, are experimenting with employee pay structures.\nBig tech companies including Microsoft, Facebook, and Twitter have offered less pay for employees based in locations where it is more inexpensive to live.\nBut smaller firms such as Reddit and Zillow have said they will pay the same no matter where employees are based, saying that this improves diversity.\nA Google spokesperson said: \"Our compensation packages have always been determined by location, and we always pay at the top of the local market based on where an employee works from.\n\"Our new Work Location Tool was developed to help employees make informed decisions about which city or state they work from and any impact on compensation if they choose to relocate or work remotely.\" \nOne Google employee, who works in Seattle but has a two-hour commute, complained to Reuters of being faced with a 10% pay cut for choosing to work from home full-time.\n \"It's as high a pay cut as I got for my most recent promotion,\" the employee said. \"I didn't do all that hard work to get promoted to then take a pay cut.\"\nJake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said Google's move raises alarms about who will feel the impact most acutely, including families.\n\"What's clear is that Google doesn't have to do this,\" Prof Rosenfeld said. \"Google has paid these workers at 100% of their prior wage, by definition. So it's not like they can't afford to pay their workers who choose to work remotely the same that they are used to receiving.\"\nA Google employee in Stamford, Connecticut, which is an hour away from New York by train, would be paid 15% less working remotely, while there were 5% and 10% differences in the Seattle, Boston and San Francisco areas.\nGoogle will not change employees' pay if they work fully remotely from the same city.\nIn the UK, it's a fundamental part of employment law that employers cannot alter aspects of contracts such as rates of pay without the consent of employees, or without terminating those contracts and renegotiating them, said Emma Bartlett, a partner at employment lawyers CM Murray.\nFrom an employee perspective, it would be demoralising to be paid less for doing the same job, she said, and from a business perspective, it would have the potential to create two tiers of employment, with some employees expected to be in the office, and some not.\nIf people stayed home working for childcare reasons, and women continue to take the main responsibility for childcare, then this could have the effect of widening the gender pay gap, she said.\nWorkers may be treated differently in other respects, she added, and organisations would have to work hard to make sure employees were not treated differently in terms of training, promotion, and access to clients.\nSome businesses, such as US technology giant Cisco, have put in place a hybrid working plan that has no mandates about how often employees go into the office.\nCisco expects that less than a quarter of its workforce will want to be in an office for three or more days a week.\nBut other firms, such as Goldman Sachs, want workers to return to offices.\nThe investment bank's boss, David Solomon, said in February that working from home was \"an aberration\" rather than \"the new normal\".\nThe Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), which represents human resource professionals in the UK, said it was always \"the safest option\" for firms to seek express written agreement from employees before changing the level of their pay.\nIn its guidance to employers, it says that imposing a pay cut is a \"high-risk\" approach, since workers can bring claims for breach of contract or even constructive unfair dismissal. \nRachel Suff, senior employment relations adviser at the CIPD, said: \"Rather than making sweeping decisions on issues like pay and how, where and when people work, businesses should aim to balance individual needs with the needs of the organisation. \n\"It would be quite near-sighted for employers to think about adjusting pay at this early point in hybrid working, given there are so many things to still be ironed out and many people are still yet to return to a physical workspace.\n\"Given the tight labour market, businesses also need to stay attractive and cutting pay could prove to be a false economy if it turns talent away.\""

      "title": "Climate change: Curbing methane emissions will 'buy us time'",
      "tags": "Methane,Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "An aggressive campaign to cut methane emissions can buy the world extra time to tackle climate change, experts say. \nOne of the key findings in the newly released IPCC report is that emissions of methane have made a huge contribution to current warming. \nThe study suggested that 30-50% of the current rise in temperatures is down to this powerful, but short-lived gas. \nMajor sources of methane include agriculture, and leaks from oil and gas production and landfills. \nFor decades, the main focus of efforts to curb global warming has been the ever-rising emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from human activities, such as generating power and clearing forests. \nThere's been good scientific reasons for this, as CO2 is the biggest driver of temperatures responsible for around 70% of the warming that's taken place since the industrial revolution.\nMethane (CH4), though, hasn't had the same focus.\nThat may be changing, as earlier this year, a major UN study highlighted its environmental impact.\nNow, as this week's IPCC report points out graphically, methane's influence has been calculated as adding about 0.5C to the warming the world is experiencing right now.\nSo where is all this methane coming from?\nAround 40% of the gas comes from natural sources such as wetlands - but the bigger share now comes from a range of human activities. \n\"It's a combination of sources, from agriculture, including cattle and rice production, another large source of methane is rubbish dumps,\" said Prof Peter Thorne, an IPCC author from Maynooth University in Ireland.\n\"One of the biggest is from the production, transport and use of natural gas - which is really misnamed and should be called fossil gas.\"\nSince 2008, there's been a big spike in methane emissions, which researchers believe is linked to the boom in fracking for gas in parts of the US.\nIn 2019, methane in the atmosphere reached record levels, around two-and-a-half times above what they were in the pre-industrial era. \nWhat worries scientists is that methane has real muscle when it comes to heating the planet. Over a 100-year period it is 28-34 times as warming as CO2.\nOver a 20-year period it is around 84 times as powerful per unit of mass as carbon dioxide. \nHowever, one key positive about CH4 is that it doesn't last as long in the air as CO2.\n\"If you emit a tonne of methane today, in a decade's time, I would expect half that tonne to remain in the atmosphere,\" said Prof Thorne. \n\"In two decades, time, there would be a quarter of a tonne, so basically, if we managed to stop emitting methane today by the end of this century, emissions would be down to natural levels, that they were in about 1750.\"\nIn the short term, experts believe that if methane emissions were cut by 40-45% over the next decade, you'd shave 0.3C off the increase in global temperature by 2040.\nIn a world where every fraction of a degree counts, that's a potentially huge difference to hopes of keeping the 1.5C threshold alive. \nWhat excites many researchers is the belief that are a range of relatively simple actions that can quickly curb the production of methane. \n\"It's relatively cheap to bring down some of the sources,\" said Prof Euan Nisbet from Royal Holloway University of London.\n\"In particular, I'm talking about leaks from the gas industry, which now are so much easier to find, than they were 10-20 years ago, because the instruments are so much better.\"\n\"Some things we can do quite quickly - in the tropics, you can put soil on top of these huge urban landfills and you can do a lot about stopping crop waste fires.\"\nQuick fixes really do work. In the US, efforts to collect gas from landfill sites saw methane emissions cut by 40% between 1990 and 2016.\nIn agriculture there are also many technical changes related to manure and animal feed that can make a difference in lowering emissions.\nBut getting the really big cuts will require political action.\nIn countries like Ireland and New Zealand, where farming plays a huge role in the economy, these changes are contentious. \nTo succeed, they will have to be fair and equitable.\n\"You can't just say that people can no longer keep cattle or sheep,\" said Prof Thorne. \n\"It needs policies to aid a transition to other means of managing the land, but it is not going to happen by people pronouncing you can't keep livestock any longer, it needs to be a much more nuanced approach.\"\nConsumer choice when it comes to dairy and meat will certainly impact this sector.\nThe oil and gas industry also faces a massive challenge in curbing methane. \nRegulations to date have failed to stop leaks, but there's a growing interest among fossil fuel companies in using technology that can rapidly identify and stem the emissions. \n\"If you look at it from an objective standpoint, the industry is improving, they are improving the leaks, they are improving the number of incidents, but it's not quick enough,\" said Arnel Santos, a 25-year oil industry veteran with Shell and now chief operating office of energy technology company mCloud Technologies.\n\"We need to go faster with respect to this challenge, to really show we can quickly deploy technology to augment what they're doing, because the improvements to date will not be quick enough with what we're seeing.\"\nPerhaps the biggest change that's required is to separate out methane from other warming gases on the international stage.\nThere are worries that because UN climate negotiators deal with all greenhouse gases in the same process, there are concerns they may make trade-offs, comparisons and compromises on methane that muddy efforts to reduce these emissions. \nMany are now calling for a separate process for methane, along the lines of the Montreal Protocol, that successfully brought countries together to regulate ozone-depleting gases. \n\"To halt long-term warming, we need to halt carbon dioxide emissions,\" said Prof Thorne.\n\"But to aid us on that path, we could treat these gases differently. And if we were to treat methane differently, it might buy us time to adapt to the changes that are occurring.\"\n\"It's carbon dioxide that absolutely needs to get to net zero. But if we are to halt long term warming, methane can absolutely help us on the way.\"\nFollow Matt on on Twitter."

      "text": "Shares in WW International, formerly known as Weight Watchers, have dived 25% after the firm said people were putting diets on hold after lockdown. \nThe weight loss firm, which is backed by talk show host Oprah Winfrey, had 4.9 million subscribers at the end of June, down from 5 million last year. \nBoss Mindy Grossman said part of this was a seasonal effect.\nBut she also said people are less worried about what they eat as they venture out of their homes again.\n\"While people are acknowledging their need for recommitting to weight loss and wellness, our recent consumer research shows that, at the moment, they're also asking for a pause to enjoy social reconnection,\" said Ms Grossman.\n\"With both traffic and search under pressure, this sentiment shift appears to be across the weight loss and wellness category.\"\nLike other dieting companies, WW benefited during the pandemic as consumers stuck at home decided to get back into shape.\nMany people had put on weight as they stopped commuting to work and increasingly turned to food and alcohol to manage stress.\nHowever, in the three months to 30 June, subscriber numbers fell or were flat in all its key markets, including North America, the UK and the rest of Europe. Sales of its branded products slipped 6.9%.\nFounded in 1963 in New York City, WW International provides a weight-management programme and food plan to subscribers. It also makes money out of branded goods and services such as magazines and snacks and drinks.\nIts high profile ambassadors include actress Kate Hudson, comedian James Corden, and Ms Winfrey, who bought a 10% stake in the company in 2015 and is a member of its board."

      "title": "New York Governor Andrew Cuomo resigns in wake of harassment report",
      "text": "New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has resigned after an inquiry found that he sexually harassed multiple women, prompting efforts to remove him.\n\"The best way I can help now is if I step aside,\" he said, while continuing to deny the claims. The resignation will take effect in 14 days. \nLt Governor Kathy Hochul will become the first woman to lead New York state.\nMr Cuomo had been facing pressure to resign from fellow Democrats, including President Joe Biden. \nJust a year ago he was basking in adulation as millions of Americans tuned in daily to his no-nonsense televised briefings on the coronavirus pandemic.\nMr Cuomo is the third New York governor in a row to leave office under a cloud of scandal.\nThe independent investigation by the New York Attorney General's office found that Mr Cuomo, 63, sexually harassed 11 women, including state employees. \nWomen alleged that he made sexual comments, inappropriately touched or groped them, and kissed them without consent. \nThe report led many prominent Democrats to turn against Mr Cuomo, including Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, Senate leader Chuck Schumer and New York's two US senators.\nHis fellow New York Democrats had begun plans to impeach him. He is still facing criminal investigations relating to the harassment claims.\nAs he announced his resignation on Tuesday, Mr Cuomo continued to deny allegations of sexual harassment but said he wanted to \"deeply, deeply\" apologise to any women who may have been offended by his actions.\n\"In my mind I've never crossed the line with anyone. but I didn't realise the extent to which the line has been redrawn,\" he said. \nHe added that his instinct was \"to fight through this controversy, because I believe it is politically motivated\". \nBut he said he was resigning because the \"current trajectory\" of the scandal would generate months of distractions and \"cost taxpayers millions of dollars\".\nMr Cuomo said the allegations had harmed his relationship with his daughters.\n\"I have sat on the couch with them, hearing the ugly accusations for weeks. I have seen the look in their eyes, and the expression on their faces. It hurt,\" he said. \nHe said he told them he \"never did and would never intentionally disrespect a woman\".\nFollowing Mr Cuomo's announcement, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a long-time critic of the governor, said \"it was past time\" for him to resign.\n\"I respect the governor's decision,\" Mr Biden told reporters at the White House. \"I respect the decision he made.\"\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki earlier said the president had not spoken to his old friend since the report was published and did not have advance notice of his resignation.\nMr Cuomo's brother, CNN primetime anchor Chris Cuomo, has also faced calls to resign after it emerged he had been advising the governor ahead of his Tuesday announcement. \nThe younger Cuomo in May had apologised to viewers for strategizing with his brother about how to handle the initial misconduct claims. He recused himself from covering the matter on air, and has not commented on the official report. He has since gone on holiday.\nA separate federal inquiry is also looking into whether the governor's office deliberately undercounted the number of Covid deaths in New York care homes.\nThis is a stunning reversal of fortunes for a former heavyweight of the Democratic Party - who was hailed as a national hero during the Covid pandemic just last year. His image now is closer to that of a villain.\nBefore the report came out - and initially after its release - Andrew Cuomo tried to survive the scandal. He knew the #MeToo movement had changed the conversation around sexual assault, after all he had passed legislation with new protections for victims. So in public statements he tried, in a sense, to have it both ways. \nHe said women should be heard, but then tried to discredit his accusers. He said what the women had described as sexual advances were in his view harmless gestures that arose from his upbringing and culture's physical warmth. \nThe pressure did not let up and it became increasingly clear that Andrew Cuomo was backed into a corner. Still, when the resignation announcement did come from this defiant politician, it was major surprise that rocked New York and the country.\nKathy Hochul will become the first female governor of the fourth most populous US state.\nThe 62-year-old is a centrist Democrat from the Buffalo area of New York state. She joined the governor's team in 2014, and has held the largely ceremonial role of lieutenant governor.\nShe was not part of Mr Cuomo's inner circle, but he described her on Tuesday as \"smart and competent\".\nMs Hochul had joined the chorus of politicians denouncing the New York governor last week, and said his resignation on Tuesday was the \"right thing to do\".\n\"As someone who has served at all levels of government and is next in the line of succession, I am prepared to lead as New York State's 57th Governor,\" she said in a statement. \nIt's unclear whether she will seek a full term in the 2022 election."

      "tags": "Companies,Computer hacking,Cryptocurrency,Cyber-security",
      "text": "The hacker behind one of the largest cryptocurrency heists to date has returned almost half of the $600m (\u00a3433m) stolen assets.\nOn Tuesday, the firm affected, Poly Network wrote a letter on Twitter, asking the individual to get in touch \"to work out a solution\". \nThe hacker then posted messages pledging to return funds, claiming to be \"not very interested in money\".\nOn Wednesday, Poly Network said it had received $260m back.\nThe company, a blockchain platform which lets users swap different types of digital tokens, posted on Twitter that it had been sent back three cryptocurrencies, including $3.3m worth of Ethereum, $256m worth of Binance Coin and $1m worth of Polygon.\nA total of $269m in Ether tokens and $84m in Polygon tokens has yet to be recovered.  \nA blockchain is a ledger, or log, of every single transaction made of a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. \nThe ledger is distributed to all the users in the network to verify all new transactions when they occur, instead of being held by any one single authority.\nThe hacker published a three-page-long Q&A session on one of the blockchains essentially in the form of a self-interview, according to Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, a London-based blockchain analytics and compliance firm.\nThe hacker claimed to have always planned to return the tokens and said the heist was carried out to highlight vulnerabilities in Poly Network software.\n\"I know it hurts when people are attacked, but shouldn't they learn something from those hacks?\" the hacker wrote in the notes embedded on the Ethereum blockchain.\nThe hacker claimed to have spent all night looking for a vulnerability to exploit. They said they were worried that Poly Network would patch the security flaw quietly without telling anyone, so they decided to take millions of dollars in cryptocurrency tokens to make a point. \nBut they stressed that they did not want to cause a \"real panic [in] the crypto-world\", so they only took \"important coins\", leaving behind Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that started off as a joke. \n\"Either they just intended to commit theft and steal the assets, or they were acting like a white hat hacker to expose a bug, to help Poly Network make themselves more strong and secure,\" Mr Robinson, who routinely advises governments and law enforcement agencies about crypto-related crimes, told the BBC.\nHe added that the nature of blockchain technology makes it hard for cyber-criminals to profit from stealing digital currencies, because everyone can see the money being moved across the network into the hackers' wallets.\n\"I wonder whether this hacker stole the funds, realised how much publicity and attention they were getting, realised wherever they moved the funds they would be watched, and decided to give it back,\" said Mr Robinson.\n\"The blockchain itself has operated here flawlessly, but the problem is on blockchains like Ethereum, you can write your own smart contracts. Various services have started offering this, including Poly Network. \n\"So whenever a human being writes code, there's a chance they will make a mistake.\"\nPoly Network's platform works by facilitating movement between several blockchains when people trade one cryptocurrency for another, such as trading Binance Coin for Ether.\n\"The Poly Network is the thing that facilitates the movement between these chains - ultimately, it's software, it's code, and code always has imperfections and defects in it,\" James Chappell, co-founder of London-based cyber-security firm Digital Shadows, told the BBC.\n\"And that's true of banks, or any financial system. Unfortunately, what seems to have happened here is a party has spotted a weakness in the implementation and exploited it to fool the network into transferring these tokens incorrectly.\"\nSimilar attacks have happened to several other services in the last 12 months. These include: \nAfter a rollercoaster 24 hours for the crypto community, it seems the hacker intends to return all or most of the stolen money.  \nAs the criminal posted online: \"The pain suffered is temporary, but memorable.\"\nThe claim that it was all an elaborate way to force Poly Network to fix security failings is being treated with scepticism.\nWhy the taunting and boasting online if the motive was honourable? \nThere's some suggestion that the net may have been closing in, as one cyber-security company says it was close to working out the identity of a suspect. \nIt might have been the case that the hacker bit off way more than they could chew and got scared, so returned the money.\nRegardless, the authorities will still no doubt be working hard to find them.\nBut what this story mostly points to is just how powerful hackers can be and how powerless the unregulated, decentralised cryptocurrency world is when someone swipes a large fortune from under its nose."

My. God. It's a movie. I made that up. It's. Not. Real.\" \nBaseless posts and memes which cite the film as a reason not to get vaccinated against Covid have appeared on social media platforms for months, with some being labelled by Facebook as containing misinformation. \nOne meme claims in the film vaccinations cause humans to turn into zombies, both misrepresenting the plot and the fictional nature of the film.\nAnother meme claims the film was set in 2021, which would correspond to the pandemic and the global vaccination rollout - despite the fact the plot was actually set in 2012.  \nI Am Legend is not the only film used by activists to spread misinformation about Covid and vaccines. Other films such as Children of Men and The Matrix have appeared in similar memes and posts."

      "text": "Top grades for A-level results for England, Wales and Northern Ireland have reached a record high - with 44.8% getting A* or A grades.\nThis second year of replacement results after exams were cancelled, has seen even higher results than last year when 38.5% achieved top grades.\nHeads' leader Geoff Barton said it was \"comparing apples with oranges\" to compare these results with other years.\nMore than 200,000 students are also getting vocational BTec results.\nIn Scotland, the pass rates for Highers and Nationals dropped slightly - but scores were still well above pre-pandemic levels.\nThe sharp rise in top grades at A-level means that the proportion getting top A* and A grades has risen by almost 75% since the last time conventional exams were taken in 2019.\nWith more top grades and record numbers applying for university, it will put pressure on places for the most competitive universities and courses.\nThis is likely to be most acute for medicine courses - and students asked to change to another medical school because of a lack of spaces will be offered \u00a310,000 as an incentive.  \nThe Medical Schools Council, representing medical schools across the UK, has launched a \"brokerage programme\" to match applicants to available spaces, with more people than usual getting the required grades.\nUnder this scheme for oversubscribed schools, students that need to move medical schools will receive a payment of \u00a310,000 \"for the inconvenience\".\nOn Tuesday morning, the admissions service Ucas said a record 396,000 students have been confirmed in their first choice course - up 8% on last year.\nDr Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of leading universities, warned increases in the top grades meant that some university courses \"may not be able to accept students who narrowly missed their offer grades this time.\" \nSimon Lebus, interim chairman of the exams watchdog, Ofqual, said: \"We've always said outcomes from this year were likely to be different,\" said  but he assured students they had been \"fairly treated\" and grades, based on teachers' judgements, could be trusted.\nExam board officials said the higher grades this year reflected that no one had a \"bad day\" in an exam and that students had \"multiple chances\" to show that they could do well.\nSchools could use a range of evidence for grades, including \"mini-exams\", coursework and mock exams - with one in five schools having a sample of their grades checked by exam boards. \nDuring the checking process, exam boards queried submitted grades in 15% of schools and colleges, but only 1% were altered.\nNational Association of Head Teachers' leader Paul Whiteman rejected warnings of \"grade inflation\", saying: \"The results in 2021 cannot be easily compared to any other year.\"\nThe Education Policy Institute said grades had been expected to be much higher overall, but of more concern would be \"inconsistencies\" at a local level.\nVocational exam results are also being published - and Kirstie Donnelly, of City & Guilds, said young people should \"explore all the options open to them\", including apprenticeships and degree apprenticeships.\nEngland's Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, praised students for their work in an \"extraordinary and challenging year\".\n\"We should all celebrate their resilience and ability to overcome adversity,\" he said.\nBut Labour's shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the government had not supported young people and \"let them down at every turn\".\nThere was an atmosphere of profound relief pervading the entrance hall of Loughborough College.\nAbout 40 students made the trip in person to collect their A-level and BTec results - rather than the 300 who would usually attend, so the Covid pandemic even affected the result-collecting process.\nShivani had been trying to stay as calm as possible before receiving her grades.\nIn the end it was good news, she got the grades needed to study accountancy and finance at the University of Loughborough.\nIt's not really sunk in yet but she's pleased - and says it's strange not to have sat exams this year and it might seem more real if she had.\nThis year has been hard, Shivani says, and although she has tried to be resilient, it has had an impact on her mental and emotional health. She really \"missed being around people\".\nShe says remote learning helped her in a way -  she lives with her grandmother and her family were very cautious - but she was upset when the exams were cancelled.\n\"There is still a part of me that thinks, I would feel more deserving if I sat the exams - but I realise it is out of my control.\"\nCollege principal Jo Maher said it may have been a challenging year, but the students have been amazingly resilient, and that her staff could not have worked harder.\nFinn says he in a state of \"slight disbelief\" that he's done so well, getting the grades to study law at Oxford University.\n\"Uncertainty has been the overriding aspect of this experience - but I like challenges,\" he says.\n\"There is a lot of talk about grade inflation and I appreciate that is a real concern - but ultimately in the circumstances that have prevailed, the alternatives would not have been fair.\" \nOur experts are on hand to answer your questions about this year's results.\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "text": "Abuse is getting \"worse and worse\" for women in politics, Wales' former education minister has said.\nKirsty Williams said she had felt unable to keep her family safe from the trolling she received on social media.\nThe ex-politician told BBC Walescast that while she would not discourage her daughters from getting into politics, she would be worried if they did.\nAbuse is \"simply priced-in\" for many of her former colleagues in politics, she said.\nThe former Brecon and Radnorshire Member of the Senedd spoke to the BBC Wales podcast as part of a series of profiles of Welsh political figures.\nMs Williams served as a Liberal Democrat representative for the constituency from the start of the assembly in 1999.\nShe became Wales' first woman leader of a Welsh political party in 2008, staying on until after the 2016 election.\nAfter she was left as the only Lib Dem in the Senedd, then-first minister Carwyn Jones brought her into the Labour Welsh government as education minister.\nMs Williams, who ended her 22-year-long career by standing down in May, said she was \"really proud\" to have been a high-profile woman in frontline politics.\nBut over the years she worried about the impact on her family.\n\"Kind people have always been very reassuring that actually, you know, it's a good thing for your girls to see you going out and doing this,\" she said.\n\"You've got a responsibility, haven't you, not to duck those issues and to pass it on to someone else to do the hard yards.\"\nMs Williams, who has three daughters with her husband Richard, said: \"It's got harder and harder, it's got worse and worse. And that's not just for me, that's for lots of my political colleagues.\n\"I think it's particularly difficult for women because there is a particularly nasty misogynistic, really horrible element to some of the social media stuff.\n\"For too many of my colleagues, now it is simply priced-in that that is the price they've got to pay for doing the job that they want to do.\"\nIn 2016, not long after the year's election result, then-newly elected UKIP group leader Neil Hamilton called Ms Williams and Plaid's Leanne Wood \"political concubines\" on the floor of the Senedd.\n\"I had to come home and explain to my daughters what the word concubine meant,\" she told the podcast.\n\"Mum, that man on the television said that you were a concubine. Everyone on the news is talking about it mum - what is that word? What does that mean, mum?\n\"I don't want to have to explain to my prepubescent daughters that's how a male colleague treats a female colleague in the workplace.\"\nAfter he was rebuked for sexist language, Mr Hamilton said he had \"no intention to upset anybody in anyway\".\nMs Williams recently spoke to ITV Wales about death threats that she had received - but she said that in \"some ways\" social media trolling was harder to deal with.\n\"It's really really horrible, but the police deal with that effectively, and they deal with it efficiently.\"\nBut she said her \"inability\" to keep her family \"safe\" from \"pernicious trolling\" and comments were \"much more upsetting than the death threats\".\nIt was only after she exited politics that she became aware of the true nature of some of it, she said.\nSometimes she could laugh off some of the messages, or challenge them - like one man who said on Twitter that she delivered a statement \"like I would deliver a fake orgasm\".\n\"And you're thinking - do you know what, I'm not putting up with that today, I'm going to say something back... I used a little [When] Harry Met Sally gif.\n\"The vile stuff you ignore. When it crosses a line into a sexual element to it, that's when I'm not going to put up with it.\n\"That particular person - I wrote back to them and said does your wife know this is how you spent your Saturday afternoons, and what is your employer going to think about this on Monday morning, when I tell them.\"\nMs Williams said she would \"never discourage\" her daughters from entering politics.\nBut would she be worried for them?  \"Absolutely, in a way I wouldn't be worried for them if they chose a life outside of that public scrutiny.\n\"I would be lying if I said there was a part of me that wouldn't want them to make a contribution.\n\"But there would be a bit of you that would be saying I really wish they would do this out of the public eye.\"\nYou can download the full episode now through BBC Sounds and most other podcast platforms."

      "text": "The first school pupils in Scotland are set to to return from their summer break days after most Covid restrictions were lifted.\nPupils will be back in classrooms in Angus for the first time since the move beyond level zero on Monday.\nThe majority of Scottish schools return on Wednesday and Thursday next week. \nBut there will be no return to the \"normal\" school day as many Covid safety protocols will remain in place for at least six weeks. \nThis includes all teachers and senior pupils being asked to wear face coverings while indoors.\nThere must also be physical distancing of at least one metre (3ft) between all staff, as well as staff and pupils.\nClass \"bubbles\" will be scrapped but the latest Scottish government guidelines advise staff to continue to avoid assemblies or large groupings of children.\nAnd parents will only be allowed inside school buildings where \"agreed by school and strictly necessary\", for example where a child needs support with the transition from nursery to P1.  \nThe government says it is taking a \"precautionary approach\" to the new term as there will be large numbers of unvaccinated children and young people in schools. \nIn the guidance, it describes schools as a \"unique environment\" in this respect, and not comparable to other situations in society where large gatherings can take place. \nHowever, the blanket self-isolation of whole classes following a positive Covid test will no longer be \"routine\".\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said children identified as close contacts will not have to isolate if they test negative, after thousands of pupils had to do so in the summer term.\nAt one point in June there were more than 24,000 in self-isolation, only slightly lower than a peak of almost 30,000 last autumn.\nThe return of schools last August saw the beginning of an upward trend of positive Covid cases.\nAngus is the only council area with schools going back on Wednesday 11 August.

      "tags": "Child abuse,Fort Augustus,Australia",
      "text": "A former monk at a Catholic boarding school has pleaded guilty to child sexual abuse, bringing to an end one victim's eight-year fight for justice.  \nFr Denis \"Chrysostom\" Alexander, who is now 85, admitted two charges of lewd, indecent and libidinous practices against two boys between 1973 and 1976.\nThe offences took place at the Fort Augustus Abbey school in the Highlands.\nAlexander, an Australian national, was first named as a paedophile by a BBC Scotland documentary in 2013. \nOne of his victims was Hugh Kennedy, now aged 58. He was in court and afterwards said his nightmare was \"now finally over.\" \nAlexander has been in custody in Australia and then Scotland since 2017. He will be sentenced next month.\nFort Augustus Abbey, at the southern end of Loch Ness, had been monastery for more than 100 years. The austere Benedictine monks who lived there operated a prestigious fee-paying Catholic boarding school, thought of as one of the best in the country.  \nThe imposing abbey and school buildings were neatly tucked away behind the trees on the outskirts of the town.\nThe monks were rarely seen by locals, and were thought of as an amusing peculiarity. At its peak, about 300 pupils would board at the school.\nHugh Kennedy enrolled in 1974; a wide-eyed, blonde-haired boy of 11 who loved sport.\nHe was exactly the type of boy expected to excel within this environment. \nBut the strict and regularly brutal regime at Fort Augustus, alongside a hierarchical culture of bullying by his peers, would soon have him living in fear. \nOne teacher in particular had started to single him out for special punishment. \nFr Denis Alexander, also known as Fr Chrysostom, was an Australian priest who had arrived at Fort Augustus in the 1950s, around the same time as his fellow Australians, Frs Aidan and Fabian Duggan. \nEach of this trio could be sadistically violent and would be eventually be exposed by the BBC as child sex abusers. \nHugh Kennedy says Alexander would call him to his room, where he would be told to take his pants down and he would cane his bare backside.\n\"He was softening me up, I now understand,\" Hugh says.\n\"I used to ask him why he was doing this but he just told me to shut up.\n\"I was receiving inexplicable beatings. He once made me kneel against the wall for six hours - he was terrorising me.\n\"Then suddenly it turned around on a sixpence. The beatings stopped; I was put back on his social list, which meant special treats like toast in his office, and yoga lessons. I was even made head altar boy. \n\"But this was all part of the grooming process, just to get me used to saying yes to everything.\"\nSoon after, the sexual abuse started. \nOne night, in the dormitory Hugh shared with more than a dozen other boys, he awoke with a start to the smell of whisky close to his face. Alexander had crept into Hugh's dorm and abused him on his top bunk while the boy below him slept.  \n\"By the next day, I'd convinced myself it hadn't happened,\" Hugh says. \nBut the abuse escalated, and during a yoga class, Alexander carried out a serious sexual attack on Hugh. \n\"He told me it was a special thing between the two of us and no-one needed to know about it, and that no-one would believe me in any case,\" Hugh says. \nThe abuse by Alexander stopped, but later he was abused by another man at the school - an art teacher called Bill Owen, who is now dead - fuelling fears that abusive staff had shared victims.\nHugh says the abuse by Owen was serious and lasted several years.\n\"I believe it was organised, that there was a bit of 'pass the parcel' going on,\" Hugh says.\nHugh decided to tell someone about the abuse by Alexander. \nHe told his step-mother and the headmaster at the time, Fr Francis Davidson. \nHowever, Davidson took Alexander's side and allowed the monk to visit Hugh's step-mother at home, to persuade her that her son was lying.\nIt worked, and Hugh was returned to the school. The police were never called. \nFr Chrysostom, who was known as the \"piping monk\" because of his love of the bagpipes, was free to carry on abusing. \nAnd he did. \nNearly a decade ago, alongside producer Murdoch Rodgers, I started investigating allegations of abuse at Fort Augustus. \nWe met former Fort Augustus pupil Brendan, not his real name, who told us he had been repeatedly abused by Alexander when aged 13.\nHe had struggled with his mental health throughout his life, a condition rooted in, he believes, the abuse he suffered at the hands of the monk he knew as Fr Chrysostom\nIt was Brendan's story which started us on our path of investigating Alexander, who we knew had abruptly returned to his native Australia in 1977. \nBrendan had raised the alarm about Alexander's abuse, and his parents complained to the school. The matter was once more dealt with internally by Fr Francis Davidson. There would be no police involvement, but this time Alexander was sent home to Australia. \nI had wanted to find and confront Alexander in Australia but needed more evidence.\nThen Brendan told us about a letter he'd been written by Alexander. It had been an apology - a confession - written to him and his parents on his return to Australia. \nBrendan told us he'd been so angry he'd ripped it into pieces and threw it in the bin. Crucial evidence, apparently destroyed 35 years previously in the heat of the moment \nBut unknown to Brendan, his father had taped it back together and kept it.\nThe letter reads: \"I am writing this letter with some consideration to apologise for the events of last term. I ask forgiveness not only for the incidents themselves but for the considerable distress it must have caused\u2026\n\"All I can say is that I was under severe strain for the past 18 months\u2026\"\nIt was all the evidence I needed. I tracked Alexander down to a quiet suburb of Sydney.\nHe'd been allowed to take up the priesthood in Australia without any prior warnings about his offending being given by the Benedictines.  \nIn fact, he'd been sent a cheque for \u00a350,000 in 2000 by the Benedictines, after the Fort Augustus Abbey had been closed and its affairs wound up. This was despite his confession about abusing children.\nUnfettered by allegations about his past, he worked as a supply priest in Sydney for more than 20 years, attending holy communions and baptisms up until his retirement in the 2000s. \nCameraman Alan Harcus and I watched his home for eight days, waiting for the opportunity to put Brendan's allegations to him. Finally, just hours before we were due to fly home, he emerged from his front door. \nThe former monk refused to engage with my questions, told me to \"go to blazes\" and get off his property, then rammed his car into mine. \nHe'd been defiant, but this was a watershed moment in the investigation. The clock was now running.\nThe confrontation featured our 2013 documentary Sins of Our Fathers, which sparked a chain of events which ultimately would lead to the setting up of the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry and a major police investigation into Alexander and others.\nThe programme and subsequent follow-ups named more than a dozen Fort Augustus monks as abusers and several headmasters, including Fr Davidson, of covering up the abuse. Davidson, who is now dead, resigned from a religious post at Oxford university in the wake of the scandal. \nIn 2013, Hugh Kennedy had just gone to the police about his abuse, and after watching the film, decided to speak publicly.   \nHugh had struggled with his mental health throughout his life and believes his experiences at Fort Augustus contributed to a breakdown of his marriage and put pressure on other relationships. \nHe told me then that he wanted to apologise to his family \"for what I put them through\". \nHe said that Alexander had to face the consequences for his actions, saying, \"I will face Chrysostom if needs be\u2026 because this is a bogeyman that's been on my shoulder my whole life.\"\nToday, he says that had he known what the experience of going through the criminal justice system would be for a survivor of child sexual abuse, he would never have come forward. \n\"It has been eight years of pain,\" Hugh said.\nJuly 2013: BBC airs Sins of Our Fathers, revealing decades of sexual and physical abuse at the Fort Augustus Abbey School and Carlkemp preparatory school, and confronts Fr Alexander in Sydney\nDecember 2015: The Crown announces plans to extradite Fr Alexander back to Scotland\nJanuary 2017: Fr Alexander is arrested in Sydney and remanded in custody\nMay 2017: Fr Alexander is found eligible for extradition by an Australian court. He appeals, claiming he is too ill to travel\nMarch 2019: The attorney general of Australia determines that Fr Alexander be surrendered to the UK. Fr Alexander seeks a judicial review.\nSeptember 2019: The Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry takes evidence about Fort Augustus\nNovember 2019: The Federal Court of Australia dismisses Fr Alexander's application for a judicial review\nDecember 2019: Fr Alexander fails to lodge an appeal against the federal court ruling within the 28-day deadline\nJanuary 2020: Fr Alexander is extradited to Scotland\nJune 2021: Fr Alexander pleads guilty to two charges\nWhat followed for Hugh Kennedy was a rollercoaster eight years of not knowing whether his abuser would ever face justice. \nIt was more than two years before the Crown Office sought Alexander's extradition from Australia, then another two years before he was arrested. In the meantime, the BBC continued to report on Hugh's case and ask questions about the delays.\nAlexander had claimed he was too ill to be extradited and lodged several appeals. He had told the BBC before his arrest that he was being supported by the Catholic Church in Sydney, although this was denied by the church.\nEventually, having expended all legal means of defiance, he was flown to Scotland in January last year.\n\"I was told the matter would be dealt with swiftly and expected a trial within a few months,\" said Hugh.\nBut then the pandemic struck, and justice ground to halt. Even once trials resumed, Hugh felt the case had been put on the back burner. \n\"It was almost as if it would have been easier for them if he just passed away in his cell.\n\"To survive the abuse is one thing, but to survive going through the criminal justice system is another thing altogether. The journey is horrific. \n\"I was continually kept in the dark.\n\"There's so much that could have been done differently. There seems to be no insight into the mental trauma involved for victims. \n\"Initially I put my trust in these people, but then found myself being let down continually. There's a lack of compassion, you're treated dismissively and there seems to be total lack training for staff dealing with these sorts of situations\n\"I would have crumbled if it wasn't for the support I was getting. I've got a fairly strong constitution but I've not been particularly well during this process, and people with lesser capacity would have sunk and gone away.\n\"If the BBC hadn't been continually covering this case, I doubt I had the ability to get it this far. What about all the other people who haven't journalists keeping the story in the public eye? They've got no chance of getting a case like this to court.\n\"Something has to change to make it easier for people to go through this process.\"\nUntil three days ago, Hugh had been living in fear that the case would be abandoned because of Alexander's failing health, or that he would die before going to trial. \nOn Wednesday morning, he was told of Alexander's intention to plead guilty.\nIn a voice racked with emotion, Hugh had struggled to get the words out when he called. \n\"All I've ever wanted was for him to admit what he's done to me and the others,\" he said.\n\"It's finally over.\"\nHe travelled up from the south of England overnight to see his \"bogeyman\" one final time. \nDressed in a green prison jumper, Alexander listened to the court proceedings in his wheelchair.\nHis defence counsel said the man sitting in court was very different to the one who carried out the offences.\nHugh says he is now ready to get on with his life. The ghosts of Fort Augustus are fading, and despite the struggle, he knows he has achieved something that for years had hung in the balance. He'd survived, and he'd won justice. \nHe said: \"There are others who didn't feel able to go through with this. So even if it has been a living nightmare for eight years, I feel I did something right, for Brendan, for me, and for the others who didn't make it this far.\""

East Dunbartonshire and Western Isles will follow on Thursday 12 August, while the other start dates are: \nAberdeen City - Tuesday 17 August \nAberdeenshire - Tuesday 17 August \nAngusWednesday 11 August\nArgyll and ButeMonday 16 August\nClackmannanshire - Wednesday 18 August\nDumfries and Galloway - Thursday 19 August\nDundee - Tuesday 17 August\nEast Ayrshire - Thursday 19 August\nEast Dunbartonshire - Thursday 12 August\nEast Lothian - Wednesday 18 August\nEast Renfrewshire - Wednesday 18 August\nEdinburgh - Wednesday 18 August\nFalkirk - Wednesday 18 August\nFife - Wednesday 18 August\nGlasgow - Monday 16 August\nHighland - Tuesday 17 August\nInverclyde - Wednesday 18 August\nMidlothian - Wednesday 18 August\nMoray - Tuesday 17 August\nNorth Ayrshire - Wednesday 18 August\nNorth Lanarkshire - Monday 16 August\nOrkney Islands - Tuesday 17 August\nPerth and Kinross - Wednesday 18 August\nRenfrewshire - Monday 16 August\nScottish Borders - Wednesday 18 August\nShetland Islands - Wednesday 18 August\nSouth Ayrshire - Thursday 19 August\nSouth Lanarkshire - Monday 16 August\nStirling -Wednesday 18 August\nWest Dunbartonshire - Tuesday 17 August\nWestern Isles - Thursday 12 August\nWest Lothian - Tuesday 17 August\nIn other changes to the guidance, only pupils aged 12 and over will have to wear face coverings on school transport. \nThis brings the school transport rules in line with wider society, after the government announced that children under the age of 12 would no longer need to wear masks in indoor public places. \nThe easing of restrictions since the end of the last term means all drama, music, PE and dance can go ahead - with the mitigations of good ventilation and hygiene. \nResidential school trips can also take place, though there remain limits on the number of children who can share a room or a tent.\nAhead of the return this term, all school staff and secondary school pupils have been asked to take a lateral flow test one or two days before they return.\nThey should then take them twice a week.\nAfter six weeks, \"once all staff have had the opportunity to be fully vaccinated\" the asymptomatic testing programme will be reviewed, the guidance states. \nIn the future one option under consideration is that asymptomatic testing of school children is only used in areas where the virus is prevalent in the local community. \nThe cautious approach to the return to school is largely due to levels of vaccination among pupils.\nMost children returning to school will not have been vaccinated as the jab is only being offered to 16 and 17-year-olds and anyone 12 or over who is at higher risk of falling ill from Covid. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she hopes that the UK's vaccine advisory group will recommend the jab for more young people in the future. \nSchools in Angus are returning before other council areas having taken the decision to end the previous term earlier than normal.\nThe school rolls across the area will include 1,064 new Primary 1 pupils.\nCouncillor Ron Sturrock, vice convener of the council's children and learning committee, said: \"Our schools have worked hard to make sure they are fully prepared, and I know they are really looking forward to welcoming pupils back.\" "

      "title": "How six brothers - and their lions - terrorised a Libyan town",
      "tags": "Khalifa Haftar,Libya,Tripoli,Long Reads",
      "text": "They were the family from hell. For years, until last summer, the Kani brothers held a small Libyan town in their murderous grip, massacring men, women and children to maintain their authority. Now their crimes are slowly being uncovered.\nFor seven months, workers in white chemical protection suits have been returning to the small agricultural town of Tarhuna, about an hour's drive south-east of the Libyan capital, Tripoli. They have marked out neat rectangles with red-and-white tape, across the fields of reddish-brown earth, and from these plots they have lifted 120 dead bodies, though large areas still remain untouched.\n\"Every time I excavate a new dead body, I try to be as gentle as I can,\" says one of the workers, Wadah al-Keesh. \"We believe that if you break a bone, his soul will feel it.\"\nSome appear to be the bodies of young fighters killed in battles around Tarhuna last summer, in the ninth year of Libya's on-off civil war. But many are of civilians - including women, and children as young as five - some bearing signs of torture.\nThe graves are the gruesome legacy of a reign of terror, lasting nearly eight years, imposed on the town by a local family, the Kanis, and the militia they created.\nThree of the original seven Kani brothers are now dead, and the others were made to flee in June 2020 by forces loyal to Libya's UN-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), but even now many residents of Tarhuna are afraid to speak out about their crimes. Some say they are still being threatened from afar by the Kanis' supporters.\nPiecing together the story of the brothers - Abdul-Khaliq, Mohammed, Muammar, Abdul-Rahim, Mohsen, Ali and Abdul-Adhim isn't easy. But what emerges from conversations with those who knew them is a terrifying tale of how a poor family took advantage of the chaos that engulfed Libya after its 2011 revolution against the dictator, Col Muammar Gaddafi - and came to rule their community through sheer ruthlessness.\n\"Those seven brothers were rough people, without any manners. Their social status was zero,\" says Hamza Dila'ab, a trained lawyer and community activist, who remembers meeting them at weddings and funerals before 2011.\n\"They were like a pack of hyenas when they were together. They swore and quarrelled. They could even hit one another with sticks.\"\nWhen the revolution broke out, most people in Tarhuna remained loyal to Gaddafi. The dictator had favoured the town, giving men from its leading families good jobs in his security forces. The Kanis were among the few who backed the revolutionaries - though not out of idealism, says Hamza Dila'ab, but because of a 30-year feud with some cousins, a family of Gaddafi supporters.\nIn the turmoil after the toppling of Gaddafi, the brothers saw their chance.\n\"The Kanis slowly, discreetly managed to get that family assassinated, one by one,\" says Hamza Dila'ab.\nBut that set off a cycle of revenge that led to the murder, in 2012, of the second-youngest Kani, Ali.\n\"Ali was this handsome young Kani brother, and when he died, they turned him into a legend,\" says Jalel Harchaoui, a Libya expert at the Clingendael Institute in the Netherlands, who has researched the family's history. \n\"The brothers decided to respond to his murder not just by finding the people responsible, and killing them. What they actually did was kill their entire families.\"\nThe Kanis gradually took over and built up some existing military forces in the town, creating their own militia of several thousand fighters. Like most of the militias in Libya, it had access to state funds. And moving on from revenge, the remaining brothers used it to stamp their absolute authority on Tarhuna.\n\"Their policy was to terrorise people for no other reason than to create fear. They killed for that reason alone. Anyone in Tarhuna who stood against them would die,\" says Hamza Dila'ab\nHanan Abu-Kleish was at home on 17 April 2017 when a crowd of the Kanis' militiamen burst in. \"One of them put a gun to my head,\" she says. \"He asked me who was in the house, and I said, 'No-one.' But he dragged me to my father's room. They said to him: 'We're going to kill you first.' And they really did. I did everything I could to stop it. But they just pumped bullets into his chest.\"\nThree of Hanan's brothers were also killed that day, and two of her nephews, aged 14 and 16. Other relatives are missing after apparently being abducted by the Kanis' forces. Hanan says there was no motive, other than that her family were relatively well-off and respected in Tarhuna.\nBy then, the Kanis had established their own mini-state in and around Tarhuna, even controlling the uniformed police. They ran a business empire, extorting \"taxes\" from a cement factory and other local businesses, building a shopping mall, and running some legitimate enterprises, including a laundry. They profited from \"protecting\" the traffickers of drugs and migrants whose routes crossed their territory on the way from the Sahara to the Mediterranean coast. And at the same time they boasted of fighting trafficking and creating an island of order in war-torn Libya.\nAt the head of the mini-state was Mohammed al-Kani, a Salafist (a follower of a fundamentalist form of Islam) and the second oldest of the brothers. He was the only member of the family with a little education and a regular paid job - prior to the revolution he'd worked as a driver for an oil company. Frugal and calm, he generally wore a traditional Salafist's gown.\n\"It's usually the case in gangster families that the person at the apex is not particularly frightening or even charismatic,\" says Jalel Harchaoui. \"At the top, you usually find the person who's able to understand all the complicated schemes necessary to make the whole pyramid work. And that was the case with Mohammed.\"\nBelow him, shaven-headed Abdul-Rahim was in charge of \"internal security\" - dealing with any suspected traitor, while gaunt-faced Mohsen was the \"minister of defence\", in charge of the Kanis' militia. \"Abdul-Rahim was the number one killer; after him: Mohsen,\" Hamza Dila'ab remembers. He says he, and many others who fled Tarhuna, informed successive governments in Tripoli about the murders, \"but unfortunately those governments just ignored all the Kanis' crimes, because the Kanis' militia was useful to them\".\nIn 2017, the brothers staged a military parade including heavy weaponry, ranks of uniformed police - and lions. These were the brothers' personal property and it's   rumoured they were fed the flesh of some of the family's victims.     \nThen, in 2019, the Kanis decisively changed sides in the civil war. Abandoning their alliance with the GNA, which controlled western Libya, they invited its greatest enemy, Gen Khalifa Haftar, master of the eastern half of the country, to use their town as his launchpad to attack the capital.\nSuddenly, tiny Tarhuna became the cockpit of an international struggle. Haftar was backed by a strange alliance of France, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates - and Russia, which sent mercenaries to camp in the Kanis' town. Against them, Turkey poured in weapons to support the Tripoli government. And it was probably a Turkish drone that killed Mohsen al-Kani and the youngest brother, Abdul-Adhim, aged 22, in September 2019.\nTheir deaths, and the failure to take Tripoli sparked the bloodiest period Tarhuna has known. \"The murders had to be carried out on a more frequent basis because things were not working out,\" says Jalel Harchaoui. \"How do you make sure your population doesn't conspire with the enemy? So the Kani family had to become more and more paranoid.\"\nBut there were also killings that were apparently motivated by the Kanis' need for equipment to continue the war.\nOne day in December 2019, Tarhuna housewife Rabia Jaballah saw her cousin Tareq shot dead on his doorstep by the Kanis' militiamen. They took away his 4x4 pickup. The next day, as he was being buried, police invaded the cemetery, snatching 10 men from the family, including her husband. They had Tareq's truck - now with a grenade launcher mounted on it. Suddenly she understood the reason for the attack: \"The Jaballah family, we make our living from a car business, mainly 4x4s. So they attacked us to rob us, to use our vehicles for their war.\"\nPro-government fighters finally captured Tarhuna in early June 2020, and the remaining four Kani brothers and their militia fled with Haftar's forces to eastern Libya.\n\"We had so much hope, we didn't sleep that night, the children were happy,\" Rabia Jaballah says.\nThe next morning, she and many others whose husbands, brothers or sons had been kidnapped, rushed to the Kanis' notorious detention centres in search of them. In one prison, to their horror, they found a row of cells 70cm by 70cm - barely big enough to sit in. There were discarded clothes, but the prison was empty.\n\"It completely destroyed our hope,\" Rabia says. \"The walls were covered in blood. I couldn't handle it any more. I had a complete breakdown.\"\nDaniel Hilton of Middle East Eye, one of the very few foreign reporters to have visited Tarhuna since the defeat of the Kanis, made other disturbing discoveries. \"Above the cells were mounds of ash from fires that the people keeping these prisoners would light to turn the cells into ovens, as a form of torture,\" he says. On the floor of another prison he found small shoes in bright colours, belonging to children now believed to be dead or missing.\nKamal Abubakr, head of the GNA government's Authority for Searching and Identification of Missing Persons, says more than 350 people from Tarhuna are registered as missing - though some locals say the real number is closer to 1,000.\nSo far, very few of the bodies found in mass graves have been identified, as DNA-matching work is only just beginning. But Dr Abubakr says the burials discovered so far are more shocking than any others found in Libya since the beginning of the conflict in 2011.\n\"This is the first time we've found women in mass graves, or children. Also we found a body buried with medical equipment, an oxygen mask and intravenous tubes\u2026 a live man taken from the hospital and buried. This is a shock to us as well.\"   \nThe government in Tripoli says it is investigating responsibility for the killings, though Hanan Salah, senior Libya researcher for Human Rights Watch - which published its own report on Tarhuna on Thursday - says it has announced many investigations since its formation in 2015 and she has yet to see a single one that has been completed.\n\"The authorities should act on the grim discovery of mass graves by taking proper steps to identify the bodies and bringing those responsible for abuses to justice,\" she says.\nEchoing Hamza Dila'ab, Hanan Salah suggests that the GNA, which was allied with the Kanis for several years, \"possibly turned a blind eye to some of these very serious allegations, which means that the senior leadership of the GNA, not just the military officers, but also the officials, can be responsible for very serious violations.\"\nPersistent requests by the BBC for an interview with a government official who would respond to this accusation were unsuccessful.\nMeanwhile, the International Criminal Court has opened an inquiry into the Tarhuna killings, and Mohammed al-Kani has been placed on a US Government sanctions list. But, under general Haftar's protection, he and his remaining brothers are unlikely to face justice any time soon.\nIn Tarhuna itself, there are calls for revenge, and Wadah al-Keesh, the young grave excavator, is fearful for the future. \"The people of Tarhuna have just been released from one militia to another - the government is just the face, the militias control the ground,\" he says. \"And they just do their thing, which is terrifying people.\"\nBut at the reburial of one man found in a mass grave, Said Mesbah al-Shoshi, Wadah heard a speech by the victim's brother that seemed to him like a small glimmer of light in a tragic town.     \n\"He said: 'My brother did not give himself to any kind of cause. My brother's cause was just to live and live for his children. We have nothing to do with this war. So if anyone claims people died for a cause, throw them out, because they just want to use the death of others for their benefit. We want to stop the circle of revenge, because it's a disaster for this country.'\n\"And when I heard that, I was about to cry, actually. It was wonderful in a way.\"\nFor years Abood Hamam chronicled the war in Syria for news outlets all over the world without ever revealing his name - and despite being employed by different warring parties. He began as photographer to the presidential couple - Bashar and Asma al-Assad. Later he filmed Islamic State's victory parade. Now, finally, he's broken cover, to encourage exiles to return to his beloved hometown, Raqqa.\n'A picture can kill you - or save your life'"

      "text": "Women can now wear trousers at the Henley Royal Regatta everywhere after it changed its \"draconian\" dress code. \nPreviously women could only wear a dress or skirt with a hemline below the knee to gain access to the Steward's Enclosure at the annual event in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. \nFor the first time in decades women can now wear trousers and trouser suits.\nRegatta chairman Sir Steve Redgrave said organisers believed women should wear trousers if they wished to.\nThe five-time Olympic champion said the dress code at the Steward's Enclosure was only adopted in the late 1970s.\n\"We felt with the introduction of all the new events for females, if they would like to wear trousers, they should be allowed to wear trousers,\" said Sir Steve.\n\"Within investitures they now allow trousers as well, so we've eased our dress code for that same sort of reason.\"\nIt comes after a petition last year by University of Oxford rower Georgia Grant who called the dress code \"draconian\".\nMs Grant said: \"It's quite a small change, but I think for them to sort of concede on it and change something which has existed for years, that's a huge step and it made me feel quite excited about attending the event.\"\nShe added her petition had led to transgender and disabled attendees sharing their struggles over their difficulty choosing what to wear, and that the next step should be \"de-gendering\" the dress requirements. \nThe Steward's Enclosure is only open to stewards who organise the regatta, members - who can reportedly wait years to be given membership - and their guests. \nIt is described by one rowing website as the \"equivalent of the Royal Enclosure at Ascot\", and has the best view of the finish line. \nMen are required to wear lounge suits, or jackets, or blazers with trousers, together with a tie or a cravat. \nIzzie Mayhew-Smith, who was wearing trousers to the Steward's Enclosure, said: \"It was a lot easier to find something to wear in my wardrobe, and I think it's good because men can wear trousers so we should be able to as well.\n\"The regatta becoming more modernised will maybe encourage more people to come and it's not just something for older people that's old fashioned.\"\nLucy O'Neill added: \"Trousers are just more comfortable personally and it's easier to walk around and sit down, so I've enjoyed wearing my trousers today.\"\nIn previous years women could only wear trousers in the Regatta Enclosure - which did not have a formal dress code.\nA trouser ban remains for women at some private member clubs alongside the river where spectators can view the regatta.\nThe annual five-day event, which is taking place from 11-15 August, has resumed after it was cancelled last year for the first time in its history outside of the World Wars due to Covid-19. \nHenley Royal Regatta sees rowers battle it out on the River Thames over five days of racing, attracting huge crowds.\nIt was first staged in 1839 and attracts participants ranging from Olympians, university and school teams, to amateur clubs.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Home Office,Jamaica,UK government,Immigration,Deportation",
      "text": "A Home Office deportation flight left for Jamaica overnight with just seven people on board, after last-minute legal challenges.\nThe flight, which is understood to have taken off from Stansted Airport in Essex just before 01:30 BST, was originally meant to deport 50 people.\nLawyers said it was \"an enormous waste of taxpayers' money\".\nThe Home Office said all those on board were convicted criminals with no legal right to remain in the UK.\nAnd it added that late legal claims can reduce the value for money of these operations.\nSome 18 of the legal challenges were made in the 24 hours before departure.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel is required by law to issue a deportation order for any foreign national who has been given a jail sentence of more than a year. \nPersistent offenders or those convicted of serious crimes may also be deported where it is deemed \"conducive to the public good\".\nCampaigners had been trying to stop the flight, with reports that some may have had a right to British citizenship.\nOn average, a deportation flight costs around \u00a3200,000, so returning the handful of passengers to the Caribbean is likely to have cost the Home Office about \u00a330,000 each.\nThis is not the first time the Home Office has sought and failed to organise a mass deportation to Jamaica. \nIn December, another aircraft intended to have 50 Jamaican nationals on board left with just 13.\nOn that occasion, the Home Office acknowledged some of those due to fly may have been victims of modern slavery.  \nThe home secretary is keen to demonstrate her commitment to securing Britain's borders.  \nBut with record numbers of migrants arriving in small boats on the Kent coast, and continued problems in organising deportation flights, there is obvious frustration in the department.\nMaria Thomas, of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, said some deportees did not fly after claims they were entitled to stay in the UK as part of the Windrush Scheme, which grants residency to many West Indian migrants and their descendants.\nOthers, she said, had tested positive for Covid, while two of her clients - one in his 20s and another in his 30s who have lived in the UK since they were 10 and 11 - were taken to hospital in the afternoon after attempting to take their own lives in a government immigration removal centre.\nMs Thomas described the practice of removing by way of charter flights as \"brutal\". She said: \"It's extremely concerning. \n\"It's an enormous waste of taxpayers' money to charter a plane in these circumstances, particularly in light of an ongoing pandemic.\"\nBella Sankey, director of Detention Action which assists with some of the legal challenges, tweeted that the situation was \"complete chaos\" and the Home Office \"hasn't got a clue what it's doing\".\nThe Home Office said \"extensive checks\" had been carried out to ensure that no-one on board had been eligible for the Windrush Scheme.\nIt said the 43 people who did not fly had committed crimes including murder and rape, and that their combined sentences \"totalled 245 years\".\nDamion Thompson, a Jamaican man who has lived in Leeds for 20 years, was due to be deported on Wednesday.\nIt's been 10 years since he was sentenced to jail for drugs offences - serving 14 months - triggering his automatic removal from the UK.\nHis wife, Linda Rose, said the deportation order had been \"hanging over the family\" ever since, despite several attempts to overturn it.\nNow the family say they have secured a seven-day injunction to try to stop his deportation - but they \"don't want to get too hopeful\".\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"We make no apology for seeking to remove dangerous foreign criminals.\"\nMs Patel said those who were meant to be on board \"have violated our laws and values and have left their victims living with the scars of the crimes that took place against them\".\n\"The British people should be in no doubt of my determination to remove these criminals to protect both the victims of their crimes and the public. The government uses every means to continue to remove foreign nationals who have committed crimes against our citizens,\" she said.\n\"We remove foreign criminals from the UK to different countries every week and this flight is no different.\""

      "tags": "Gurkhas,Ministry of Defence,Nepal",
      "text": "On Saturday morning, Gyanraj Rai ate his breakfast, headed to Downing Street, and began a protest about his pension. He hasn't eaten since.\n\"Better to die than be a coward\" is a motto of the Nepalese Gurkha soldiers, who have been an integral part of the British Army for more than 200 years.\nAnd 63-year-old Mr Rai says he is prepared to die - to starve to death - if the government does not agree to make his pension equal to the British soldiers he fought alongside for 20 years.\nNext to him in wheelchairs near the Downing Street gates are ex-soldier Dhan Gurung, 59, and Gurkha widow Pushpa Rana Ghale, 59, who has travelled from Nepal. \nOn Wednesday they entered their fifth day on hunger strike. They don't even have a gazebo to shelter them from the elements. It was taken down by the Met Police, who said it was \"in breach of local bylaws.\"\n\"This is the last resort to go to hunger strike to the death,\" Mr Rai tells the BBC. \"We want to be treated equally with the British in every aspect. That's why we are here, prepared to die.\"\nMore than 200,000 Gurkhas fought in the two world wars, and in the past 50 years they have served in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Borneo, Cyprus, the Falklands, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan.\nYet Gurkhas who retired before 1997 receive a fraction of the pension the rest of the British Army receive. \nThe Gurkha Pension Scheme (GPS) was based on Indian Army rates for those with at least 15 years' service. \nThe government says it was designed for retirement in Nepal, where the cost of living is significantly lower than in the UK.\nBut in 2009, all retired Gurkhas won the right to live in the UK, following a high-profile campaign led by actress Joanna Lumley, whose father served with the 6th Gurkha Rifles.\nMr Rai, who had travelled from Reading for the protest, says he followed his uncles to join the British Army aged 17.\n\"During service we were given a very small amount of salary compared to our British counterparts,\" he says.\n\"And after our service, the pension was very low. My pension was only \u00a347 a month, where a British veteran used to get over \u00a3800 a month.\"\nHe says his lump sum on leaving the army was \u00a33,000 compared to that of a British veteran who received between \u00a360,000 and \u00a370,000.\nHe says today he receives a monthly pension of \u00a3350 compared to British ex-soldiers of the same rank who receive \u00a31,200 to \u00a31,300.\nWhen the BBC put these figures to the Ministry of Defence it did not dispute them.\nIn 2007, pension rules were changed to give serving Gurkha soldiers equal pension rights with other service personnel in the UK.\nBut the British Gurkha Welfare Society said about 25,000 men who had retired before 1 July 1997 were denied the opportunity to transfer into UK armed forces pension schemes.\nThis is not the first time Mr Rai has gone on hunger strike. He did not eat for 14 nights and 15 days in 2013.\nHe only stopped when a group of MPs announced plans to hold an inquiry into Gurkha pensions and other issues. But Mr Rai says the inquiry did not go far enough.\nDhan Gurung, 59, from Basingstoke, says he followed his grandfather's tracks into the Gurkhas - and into poverty.\nHe served the maximum time permitted for Gurkha soldiers, which was 15 years unless they were granted yearly extensions.\nHe called it a \"big discrimination\" that he was forced to retire when the normal term of engagement for his British counterparts was 22 years.\n\"When I retired in 1994 my monthly pension was \u00a320 only,\" he says. \"How I survived...with my wife, my daughter and my son.\"\nHe says Gurkha families in Nepal were left in poverty so their children could not get an education. \n\"Now they working in Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Israel all over the world in dirty, difficult and dangerous jobs because they didn't have enough education,\" he says. \n\"So they have no choice because of penny pinching pay from the British government.\"\nWhen he remembers the Gurkhas who died fighting for the British Army, Mr Gurung says he feels pain and his \"blood gets hot\".\n\"I remember those who were wounded in the war, after finished war they said 'You are wounded you are not fit for the army'. That's why they sent them back barefoot, empty-handed without pension. Once I remember those things it's really heart-breaking.\"\nOutside Downing Street, Mr Gurung looks tired. The days without food are taking their toll - but he says he has \"full hope, real optimism they will address our issues\".\n\"That's the reason I'm sacrificing my life,\" he says. \"There is no way they can run away from these issues because it is 207 years of historical injustice.\n\"Our message is let's form a high level of dialogue team, confirm the day for the dialogue. If they do that we will postpone our hunger strike.\n\"If they solve the problem we will stop. If they don't want to solve the problem I don't care even if I die because I already sacrificed my life.\"\nA Ministry of Defence spokesperson says: \"We greatly value the huge contribution Gurkhas make to the British Army and ensure they are supported with a generous pension and medical care during retirement in Nepal.\n\"We are committed to ensuring the Gurkha Pension Scheme is sustainable and fair alongside other UK public sector pensions.\""

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has said he does not regret his move to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, as Taliban militants continue to make rapid advances.\nMr Biden urged Afghanistan's leaders to unite and \"fight for their nation\".\nA US-led military campaign began in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks on American soil - but now most of the foreign troops have pulled out.\nThe Taliban group has now seized nine of the country's 34 provincial capitals, and are threatening more.\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Mr Biden said the US was keeping the commitments it had made to Afghanistan, such as providing close air support, paying military salaries and supplying Afghan forces with food and equipment.\nBut he said: \"They've got to fight for themselves.\"\nThe Washington Post cited unnamed officials as saying the capital Kabul could fall to the Taliban within 90 days, based on US military assessments. \nMore than 1,000 civilians have been killed amid fierce fighting between the Taliban and government forces in the past month, according to the UN. Its children's agency Unicef warned this week that atrocities being committed against children were growing \"higher by the day\".\nIn their latest major advances, Taliban militants seized three more provincial capitals in 24 hours - Faizabad, Farah and Pul-e-Khumri.\nOfficials said that on Tuesday the insurgents had raised their flag in the main square and on the governor's office in Pul-e-Khumri, the capital of Baghlan province, which is located about 200km (125 miles) from Kabul. \nA local journalist and provincial council member told the BBC that the western city of Farah had fallen.\nAnd on Wednesday, the Taliban claimed to have taken Faizabad in the north-west of the country.\nOther gains by the militant group this week include the key northern city of Kunduz. It is considered a gateway to mineral-rich provinces and is in a strategically important location close to the border with Tajikistan, which is used for the smuggling of opium and heroin. \nHeavy fighting is continuing in other parts of the country, and US and Afghan planes have been carrying out airstrikes.\nOn Wednesday Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani flew to Mazar-i-Sharif in an apparent drive to rally the defenders in the key northern city which is now threatened by the militants.\nThousands of people have been fleeing their homes in recent days.\n\"We saw bodies lying near the prison... there were dogs next to them,\" one woman who left Kunduz as the Taliban took control told AFP news agency.\nResidents still in the city said shops had begun to reopen as Taliban militants focused their attention on government forces who had retreated to the airport.\n\"People are opening their shops and businesses, but you can still see fear in their eyes,\" one said.\nThe Taliban have rejected international calls for a ceasefire. \nUK Chief of the Defence Staff Gen Sir Nick Carter told the BBC that if the Afghan state fractured, the \"ideal conditions\" could emerge for international terrorism and violent extremism."

      "text": "A British man has been arrested in Germany on suspicion of spying for Russia.\nGerman federal prosecutors said the man - named only as David S - worked at the British embassy in Berlin.\nHe allegedly passed documents to Russian intelligence \"at least once\" in exchange for an \"unknown amount\" of money. \nHe was arrested in Potsdam outside Berlin on Tuesday and his home and workplace have been searched.\nThe German Foreign Ministry said it is taking the case \"very seriously\".\nForeign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters: \"Spying on a close ally on German soil is absolutely unacceptable and we are in full solidarity with our British friends.\"\nThe arrest was the result of a joint UK-German investigation, the statement read. \nIt was intelligence-led and had been going on for some time leading up to the arrest, the BBC's Security Correspondent Gordon Corera says. MI5 and other UK agencies, as well as British police, had been working with the Germans to learn as much as they could about the alleged activity.\nLondon's Metropolitan Police confirmed the arrest of a 57-year-old British national in Germany, as well as the involvement of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command.\nGerman authorities are in charge of the investigation, but officers will continue to work with German counterparts, the police said.\nThe man appeared before an investigating judge in Karlsruhe on Wednesday, where he was ordered to remain under arrest pending further inquiries.\nProsecutors said he was hired as a local staff member at the embassy.\nGerman online news site Focus Online reports that the documents passed on were to do with counter-terrorism, and that the man is not thought to have diplomatic immunity.\nBerlin was the epicentre of Cold War espionage with spies working its streets and alleys in search of secrets. \nIntelligence gathering has changed since those days and often involves cyber-espionage carried out remotely nowadays. \nBut the old ways have not disappeared. Spy services still seek out people whom they can recruit to pass on sensitive information and that makes embassies a prime target with Berlin still a major focus. \nAnd it is not just diplomats who have direct access to secrets who spies are interested in. \nLocally hired staff - ranging from drivers to security guards to cleaners - can also be targeted with cash or other inducements because they can provide access to rooms to plant listening devices or gather information themselves.\nGerman and UK relations with Russia are already strained after several high-profile incidents in recent years. \nThe UK accused Russia of being responsible for a 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury against Sergei and Yulia Skripal - an accusation Russia has repeatedly denied.\nBoth survived the attack. But a local woman died after she came into contact with a perfume bottle thought to have been used in the incident and then discarded.\nGermany meanwhile treated Russian dissident Alexei Navalny after he was poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent on a Russian flight last year. Russian authorities have also repeatedly denied their involvement in this incident.\nLast month German Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Joe Biden vowed to stand together \"against Russian aggression\"."

      "text": "The Taliban have taken control of Afghanistan, almost 20 years after being ousted by a US-led military coalition. \nEmboldened by the withdrawal of US troops, they now control all key cities in the country, including Kabul. \nThe Taliban took some areas from government by force. In other areas, the Afghan National Army withdrew without a shot being fired. \nAlthough renewed clashes had been going on for several weeks, from 6 August the Taliban made a more rapid advance across the country, as they took control of provincial cities.\nThe maps below start in early July and show the 400 or so government districts as they fell to the Taliban.\nUS forces based outside Afghanistan had launched air strikes against Taliban positions earlier last week, but they failed to slow the advance of the insurgents.\nAlthough most US troops left in July, several thousand returned to Kabul at the weekend to help evacuate American and allied personnel from the capital.\nThe airport in the capital was the only official route out of the country after the Taliban took control of all the major border crossings. \nCustoms duty on goods entering the country via crossings they control is now collected by the Taliban - although exact amounts are unclear as the volume of trade has fallen as a result of the fighting. \nBut, Islam Qala on the border with Iran was, for example, capable of generating more than $20 million per month. \nDisruption to the flow of imports and exports has affected prices of essential goods in the markets - fuel and foodstuffs in particular.\nUS troops and their Nato and regional allies forced the Taliban from power in November 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US.\nBut despite a continued international presence in the region, billions of dollars of support and training for the Afghan government forces, the Taliban regrouped and gradually regained strength in more remote areas.\nA  BBC study in 2017 showed the Taliban were in full control of a number of districts. But the research also showed they were active in many other parts of the country, mounting weekly or monthly attacks in some areas, suggesting significantly higher strength than previous estimates. \nIn 2017 about 15 million people - half the population - were reported to be living in areas either controlled by the Taliban or where the Taliban were openly present.\nAdditional reporting by BBC Afghan service"

      "text": "With violence surging in Afghanistan, and the Taliban taking new territories in the north, thousands of people are fleeing their homes to seek safety in the capital Kabul.\nWhen they get there, many of these people face sleeping in abandoned warehouses or on the streets. They're struggling to find food, shelter and other basic necessities, such as medicine and sanitary items.\nBut they feel they have little choice - it is either hardship in Kabul, or potential death in their home region.\nNow, thousands have gathered in makeshift camps on scrubland on the city's outskirts.\nAsadullah, a 35-year-old street vendor from Kunduz province, travelled to the capital with his wife and two young daughters earlier this week after the Taliban set fire to his home.\n\"I was a street worker, I sold food and spices... but when the Taliban attacked we came to Kabul,\" he tells the BBC. \n\"Now we have no money to buy bread, or get some medicine for my child.\"\nAsadullah and his young family spent the night on the streets.\n\"All of our home and belongings caught fire, so we came to Kabul and pray to God to help us. Rockets and mortars hit our home... there were heavy clashes in the past seven days, we had no bread to eat and all the bakeries, shops and bazaars were closed.\"\nA woman, who didn't give her name, told the BBC she fled her home in the northern city of Pul-e-Khumri with her husband and children. Her husband, she says, was wounded in the war.\n\"We had a good life, but because of the bomb blasts we lost our home and came here,\" she says. \"We left our home with only one dress and no money.\"\nHumanitarian organisations have been warning of a rise in internally displaced persons in Afghanistan since US-led forces began withdrawing from the country earlier this year, following 20 years of military operations.\nThe campaign began in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks on American soil. Now, most of the foreign troops have pulled out.\nSince then, clashes between the Taliban and government forces have escalated. The Taliban have taken at least eight of the country's 34 provincial capitals, and are threatening to seize more. \nThe Washington Post has also cited unnamed US officials saying that even Kabul could fall to the Taliban within the next 90 days, based on US military assessments.\nThis unrest has caused a rise in people fleeing their homes for the capital. In July the UN warned that around 270,000 more people were internally displaced in the country after troops started to leave - this number is estimated to have surged in just the last few days.\nAmid all of this more than 1,000 civilians have been killed, according to the UN.\nNGOs say that this mass displacement will hit women and children particularly hard. \n\"We're seeing a lot of increased reporting around health protection needs, gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse and trafficking,\" Jared Rowell, Country Director of the Danish Refugee Council in Afghanistan, tells the BBC.\n\"Early marriage will become a larger problem too as girls and young women are sold off in order to get cash to provide for their families. Those types of issues, which have always been a problem, are going to get more and more severe.\"\nAs well as food, shelter and health and sanitary items, Mr Rowell says, displaced people in Kabul are in desperate need of cash. \n\"It's really important people have access to multi-purpose cash,\" he says. \"Meaning an agency like DRC would give them a cash distribution that they have the autonomy to determine what they spend that money on in order to best support their needs. \n\"Cash is also particularly important at this point in time, especially when they're relocating to a large city like Kabul with high food prices and markets with fluctuating prices due to the current instability.\"\nFor Asadullah, his main hope now is that his family can one day return to their normal life in Kunduz.\n\"We want to go back and continue our lives there,\" he says. \"We hope that one day peace will come to Afghanistan, and our country will be free.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK is moving \"cautiously\" down the age groups as it decides how many under-18s should get a Covid vaccine - because of a \"delicate balance\" between benefits and risks, a scientist says.\nProf Adam Finn said the advice to invite 16 and 17-year-olds for their jab came after a small number of serious cases in this age group.\nHe said scientists want to learn more about any side effects of the jab.\nIt comes as more than 75% of UK adults have now had both jabs.\nProf Finn, who sits on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) which advises the government, told BBC Breakfast: \"Most young people who get this virus get it mildly or even without any symptoms at all.\n\"But we are seeing cases in hospital even into this age group - we've had a couple of 17-year-olds here in Bristol admitted and needing intensive care over the course of the last four to six weeks - and so we are beginning to see a small number of serious cases.\n\"What we know for sure is that these vaccines are very effective at preventing those kind of serious cases from occurring.\"\nAt the moment, 16 and 17-year-olds are only being invited to come forward for an initial dose and, unlike older age groups, no second dose is being scheduled.\nProf Finn said UK experts were \"cautious\" about the nature and timeline for second doses as they wanted to \"learn more about rare side effects\" such as reports of myocarditis - inflammation of the heart muscle - among some young people in the US and Israel. The risk of these incidents has been higher after second doses.\n\"So we're going cautiously down through the ages and we're using the vaccine where it's safe and effective and where the benefits are clear,\" he added.He said the JCVI would advise \"when and what\" the second dose for 16 and 17-year-olds would be after assessing more data. \nProf Finn said that even though 16-year-olds do not need parental consent to get the vaccine, in practice most are guided by parents, whom he hoped would advise their children to accept the vaccine when invited.\nNHS England said nearly 16,000 16 and 17-year-olds had already received their vaccine over the weekend. According to the ONS, there are 1.4 million people of that age in the UK.\nMeanwhile Prof Danny Altmann of  Imperial College London said vaccinating under-18s was \"a good thing\".\nHe told Times Radio that the more unvaccinated people there are in the nation, the more lungs there are \"for virus to percolate in\". \nHe added: \"Therefore it's got to be a good thing to be vaccinating more children down through the age range.\n\"From a medical scientific point of view, I'd say there's nothing special about the virus in their lungs that can't transmit through to their families, through to their schoolteachers, through to their colleagues.\"\nProf Finn also said a third or booster Covid jab is likely to be necessary for people with weak immune systems but it was still unclear whether it would be needed for all over-50s.\nHe said: \"I think it's becoming quite clear that there are a small group of people whose immune responses to the first two doses are likely to be inadequate - people who've got immunosuppression of one kind or another, perhaps because they've got immunodeficiency or they've been receiving treatment for cancer or bone marrow transplants or organ transplants, that kind of thing.\n\"I think it's quite likely we'll be advising on a third dose for some of those groups.\"\nBut Prof Finn said a broader booster rollout remained \"uncertain\" and that experts needed to \"review evidence as to whether people who receive vaccines early on in the programme are in any serious risk of getting serious disease and whether the protection they've got from those first two doses is still strong\".\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid has said that he expects booster jabs to start being rolled out from \"early September\". \nBut the head of the Oxford vaccine group, Prof Sir Andrew Pollard has said doses needed to \"go where they can have the greatest impact\" - to protect unvaccinated people abroad.\nIt comes as the government announced that more than 75% of UK adults are now fully vaccinated, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson describing the milestone as a \"huge national achievement\"."

      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

The anxiety comes in waves.\"\nMolly worries how fair the system of teacher-assessed grades has been on students. \n\"Everybody has had a different experience and everyone has done a different type of assessment and I just don't think, when we get the grades, that it will be a true reflection of how well we could have done.\"\nShe is hoping for an A* and two As on Tuesday, and originally applied to do a psychology degree. But the experience of studying in a pandemic led her to defer to do a high-level diploma in dance at the Northern Ballet School.\nShe is also concerned her qualifications may be less valued in the future. \n\"I feel employers might look at our grades and say that was the year Covid happened and you didn't sit proper exams.\"\nFatima from south London is feeling quite optimistic about achieving her target of three A grades in her A-level exams - in English literature, geography and psychology. \nBut she's not always felt that way. She's had ups and downs throughout the year and her views have fluctuated. She had to go into isolation twice and missed four weeks of school.\nShe says: \"After the second lockdown, I was unsure if I could pass exams but I really just wanted to sit them. When I found out I couldn't do exams, I was really upset.\"\nFatima believes teachers will grade her fairly but worried when exams were cancelled. \n\"I didn't want a repeat of last year, especially because I live in a low-income neighbourhood. Are they going to assume I'm going to get bad grades because of the area I live in? I don't trust the government to decide that for me.\"\nLike Molly, Fatima decided not to go to university - she's doing a two-year public policy apprenticeship at Ofcom.\nShe found her involvement with youth charity The Mix a great help during lockdown. It allowed her to hook up with other young people remotely, to watch and discuss films. \n\"Especially because I'm quite extroverted, being in my house all day is literally the worst thing you could do to me,\" she says.\nHolly Turner from the Mix says the number of conversations around school and education has almost tripled on their helpline year-on-year.\n\"We've seen just how difficult it has been for students since the start of the pandemic. They have experienced severe disruption to their education, and the constant change and uncertainty is having a serious impact on their mental health.\" \nZoya, aged 16, from Lancashire, says she is feeling really nervous about getting her GCSE results, which are out two days after A-levels. \n\"Normally, Year 11 would feel stress at the end of the year but we had stress from the beginning because we'd missed so much.\n\"Last year, in Year 10, they didn't teach us anything new. We were just catching up while studying for our mocks so it was very hectic. So many isolated so much, they were off for most of the school year.\"\nThe experience has not put her off studying. She's aiming to do A-levels next year in psychology, English literature, English language. performing arts and fine arts.\nDavid, 17, will get his results in the three BTec subjects he took in computing, media and criminology. \nBTecs are based more on coursework than exams, and David says he \"found it tough to get into the mindset of working from home,\" especially not seeing his friends from college.\n\"It really affected my mental health at one stage, which took a toll not only on me personally but also my work, because I was finding it hard to have the motivation.\"\nThe lack of resources at home created problems for his coursework. He struggled, for example, to do the work needed for his media course, as he didn't have access to the cameras and lighting equipment available in the college.\nDespite finding the process tiring, David saw it through and has a conditional offer from the University of Hull to study social work, although he is keeping his options open.\nWhat questions do you have about this year's results?\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "title": "Who are the Taliban?",
      "tags": "Pakistan,Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "The Taliban were removed from power in Afghanistan by US-led forces in 2001, but the group has seized control of the country once again following a rapid offensive.\nThe capital, Kabul, was the last major city to fall to the offensive that began months ago but accelerated as the hardline Islamists gained control of territories.\nThe group entered direct talks with the US back in 2018, and in February 2020 the two sides struck a peace deal that committed the US to withdrawal and the Taliban to preventing attacks on US forces. Other promises included not allowing al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas it controlled and proceeding with national peace talks.\nBut in the year that followed, the Taliban continued to target Afghan security forces and civilians, advancing rapidly across the country.\nThe Taliban, or \"students\" in the Pashto language, emerged in the early 1990s in northern Pakistan following the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. It is believed that the predominantly Pashtun movement first appeared in religious seminaries - mostly paid for by money from Saudi Arabia - which preached a hardline form of Sunni Islam.\nThe promise made by the Taliban - in Pashtun areas straddling Pakistan and Afghanistan - was to restore peace and security and enforce their own austere version of Sharia, or Islamic law, once in power.\nFrom south-western Afghanistan, the Taliban quickly extended their influence. In September 1995 they captured the province of Herat, bordering Iran, and exactly one year later they captured the Afghan capital, Kabul, overthrowing the regime of President Burhanuddin Rabbani - one of the founding fathers of the Afghan mujahideen that resisted the Soviet occupation. By 1998, the Taliban were in control of almost 90% of Afghanistan.\nAfghans, weary of the mujahideen's excesses and infighting after the Soviets were driven out, generally welcomed the Taliban when they first appeared on the scene. Their early popularity was largely due to their success in stamping out corruption, curbing lawlessness and making the roads and the areas under their control safe for commerce to flourish.\nBut the Taliban also introduced or supported punishments in line with their strict interpretation of Sharia law - such as public executions of convicted murderers and adulterers, and amputations for those found guilty of theft. Men were required to grow beards and women had to wear the all-covering burka.\nThe Taliban also banned television, music and cinema, and disapproved of girls aged 10 and over going to school. They were accused of various human rights and cultural abuses. One notorious example was in 2001, when the Taliban went ahead with the destruction of the famous Bamiyan Buddha statues in central Afghanistan, despite international outrage.\nPakistan has repeatedly denied that it was the architect of the Taliban enterprise, but there is little doubt that many Afghans who initially joined the movement were educated in madrassas (religious schools) in Pakistan.\nPakistan was also one of only three countries, along with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which recognised the Taliban when they were in power in Afghanistan. It was also the last country to break diplomatic ties with the group.\nAt one point, the Taliban threatened to destabilise Pakistan from areas they controlled in the north-west. One of the most high-profile and internationally condemned of all Pakistani Taliban attacks took place in October 2012, when schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai was shot on her way home in the town of Mingora.\nA major military offensive two years later following the Peshawar school massacre greatly reduced the group's influence in Pakistan though. At least three key figures of the Pakistani Taliban had been killed in US drone strikes in 2013, including the group's leader, Hakimullah Mehsud.\nThe attention of the world was drawn to the Taliban in Afghanistan in the wake of the 11 September 2001 World Trade Center attacks in New York. The Taliban were accused of providing a sanctuary for the prime suspects - Osama Bin Laden and his al-Qaeda movement.\nOn October 7, 2001, a US-led military coalition launched attacks in Afghanistan, and by the first week of December the Taliban regime had collapsed. The group's then-leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, and other senior figures, including Bin Laden, evaded capture despite one of the largest manhunts in the world. \nMany senior Taliban leaders reportedly took refuge in the Pakistani city of Quetta, from where they guided the Taliban. But the existence of what was dubbed the \"Quetta Shura\" was denied by Islamabad.\nDespite ever higher numbers of foreign troops, the Taliban gradually regained and then extended their influence in Afghanistan, rendering vast tracts of the country insecure, and violence in the country returned to levels not seen since 2001.\nThere were numerous Taliban attacks on Kabul and, in September 2012, the group carried out a high-profile raid on Nato's Camp Bastion base.\nHopes of a negotiated peace were raised in 2013, when the Taliban announced plans to open an office in Qatar. But mistrust on all sides remained high and the violence went on.\nIn August 2015, the Taliban admitted they had covered up Mullah Omar's death - reportedly of health problems at a hospital in Pakistan - for more than two years. The following month, the group said it had put aside weeks of infighting and rallied around a new leader in the form of Mullah Mansour, who had been the deputy of Mullah Omar.\nAt around the same time, the Taliban seized control of a provincial capital for the first time since their defeat in 2001, taking control of the strategically important city of Kunduz.\nMullah Mansour was killed in a US drone strike in May 2016 and replaced by his deputy Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada, who remains in control of the group.\nIn the year following the US-Taliban peace deal of February 2020 - which was the culmination of a long spell of direct talks - the Taliban appeared to shift their tactics from complex attacks in cities and on military outposts to a wave of targeted assassinations that terrorised Afghan civilians.\nThe targets - journalists, judges, peace activists, women in positions of power - suggested that the Taliban had not changed their extremist ideology, only their strategy. \nDespite grave concerns from Afghan officials over the government's vulnerability to the Taliban without international support, the new US president, Joe Biden, announced in April 2021 that all American forces would leave the country by 11 September - two decades to the day since the felling of the World Trade Center. \nHaving outlasted a superpower through two decades of war, the Taliban began seizing vast swathes of territory, before once again toppling a government in Kabul in the wake of a foreign power withdrawing.\nThey swept across Afghanistan in just 10 days, taking their first provincial capital on 6 August . By 15 August, they were at the gates of Kabul.\nTheir lightning advance prompted tens of thousands of people to flee their homes, many arriving in the Afghan capital, others heading for neighbouring countries.\nThe Taliban's return to rule brings an end to almost 20 years of a US-led coalition's presence in the country."

      "tags": "China,Huawei,Canada",
      "text": "A court in China has convicted a Canadian businessman of espionage and sentenced him to 11 years in prison.\nMichael Spavor has been detained since 2018, after being arrested with fellow Canadian ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig.\nThe verdict will test a strained relationship between the Canadian and Chinese governments. \nIt comes as an extradition battle involving Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive at Chinese tech giant Huawei, takes place in Canada. \nCritics have accused China of treating both Spavor and Kovrig as political bargaining chips, held as part of what is known as \"hostage diplomacy\".\nIn a statement published on Wednesday, the Dandong court said: \"For the crime of spying and illegal provision of state secrets abroad [Spavor] has been sentenced to 11 years in jail, confiscation of 50,000 yuan ($7,715: \u00a35,578) worth of personal property and deportation.\"\nThe statement did not explicitly state when the deportation would take place but China typically deports convicted foreigners only after they have completed their prison sentence. \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the conviction was \"absolutely unacceptable and unjust\".\n\"The verdict for Spavor comes after more than two-and-a-half years of arbitrary detention, a lack of transparency in the legal process, and a trial that did not satisfy even the minimum standards required by international law,\" he said in a statement. \nSpavor was first arrested in 2018, just days after Ms Meng was detained - and was later charged with espionage. His first trial, which took place in March, ended with no verdict. \nCanadian diplomats including the charge d'affaires to China were then denied entry to the court. \nSpavor is a founding member of the Paektu Cultural Exchange, an organisation which facilitates international business and cultural ties with North Korea.\nCanadian ambassador to China Dominic Barton said he \"condemned\" the conviction. \n\"There is the opportunity for an appeal,\" he told reporters outside the court, according to a report by AFP. \nSeparately, Michael Kovrig - who faces the same charges - also went to trial in March, though no verdict has been announced. \nOn Tuesday, another Canadian citizen lost his appeal against a death sentence for drug smuggling in China.\nThe court said it upheld Robert Lloyd Schellenberg's sentence because evidence against him was \"sufficient\".\nSchellenberg was initially sentenced to 15 years in jail, but a few days later, Canada detained Ms Meng on a US extradition warrant.\nChina at the time warned of unspecified consequences unless Ms Meng was released.\nSchellenberg later appealed against the 15-year prison term, but instead of reducing his sentence, judges ruled that his previous sentence had been too light and instead sentenced him to death.\nAt his hearing, the judges said that evidence proved he was more seriously involved in international drug smuggling.\nAt the time, Zhang Dongshuo, Schellenberg's lawyer, told Reuters that the sentence should not have been increased because no new evidence was presented at the trial.\nMr Barton said it was \"no coincidence\" that Schellenberg's verdict came as Ms Meng's extradition battle was taking place.\nMs Meng's court hearings mark the culmination of two-and-a-half years of legal battles."

      "tags": "Colchester,Spinal muscular atrophy",
      "text": "A baby with a fatal condition has received the world's most expensive drug after a campaign by his parents.\nEleven-month-old Edward, from Colchester, has severe spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) which means he lacks a protein vital for muscle development.\nHe received the new gene therapy Zolgensma, which costs \u00a31.79m, at Sheffield Children's Hospital.\nHis mother Megan Willis said it was \"incredible\" and she was \"so excited and relieved\".\nZolgensma is thought to be the most expensive drug in the world, though NHS England said it had negotiated an undisclosed discount on its \u00a31.79m list price.\nMs Willis, 29, said she was so thankful her son had been granted the drug, which contains a replica of the missing gene SMN1.\nThe family previously said they felt abandoned in their \"race against time\" for Edward to receive the drug, which must be given as early as possible.\nWhen it was approved for NHS use in March, guidelines said it should only be used for babies under six months old who were not already being treated. \nDecisions on babies outside of these parameters, like Edward, would be taken on a case-by-case basis, the guidelines said.\nMs Willis said it was \"so stressful knowing there was a wonder drug out there\" but they could not get hold of it. \nThey had tried to raise the money privately and had started to organise a protest before it was granted.\n\"For so long we have been trying to fight for this drug. I think I am in shock, I can't believe the day is here,\" she said.\nAbout 65 babies are born with SMA in England each year. It causes muscle weakness and affects movement and breathing, meaning most babies do not live past the age of two without intervention.\nNone of the treatments available offer a cure for the condition.\nIn studies, Zolgensma has helped babies breathe without a ventilator, sit up on their own and crawl and walk after a single treatment.\nDr Min Ong, paediatric neurology consultant at Sheffield Children's Hospital, said Edward was the fifth child the hospital had treated with the drug.\n\"It is anticipated to help his motor skills... particularly the use of his hands and he has the potential to be able to sit unsupported and even stand or perhaps walk,\" she said.\n\"It is very exciting because SMA is the most common genetic condition that causes infant deaths and severe disabilities worldwide and we are very thankful to be able to deliver this therapy.\"\nEdward, who was diagnosed at two months old, was receiving injections of another drug called Spinraza every four months.\nSpinraza helps slow degeneration but it involves regular injections in the spine for life, compared to the one-off injection of Zolgensma.\nMs Willis said she felt like her family had been \"reborn\" following the treatment.\n\"Edward has got a very bright future ahead of him. He is the perfect baby and he's a very happy little boy,\" she said.\n\"I feel like the first year of his life has been robbed from us, but he is one next month and we can move on as a family, now that we know he is having the very best treatment.\"\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Schools,A-levels,Private schools,Exams",
      "text": "The former schools catch-up tsar says he is worried about the gap in A-level results between state and private school pupils.\nSir Kevan Collins says he is concerned that the \"educational legacy of Covid could be growing inequality\".\nFor independent school pupils in England, 70% of A-level results were A* or A, compared with 39% for comprehensive pupils.\nA-level results on Tuesday showed record levels of top grades.\nSir Kevan, speaking on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, warned of a \"huge risk\" of widening social gaps in education in the aftermath of the pandemic.\n\"This is a deep problem in our system and one that seems to be growing,\" said Sir Kevan, who resigned in June over a lack of funding for his school recovery proposals.\nIndependent schools, which account for about 16% of A-level students, got higher results before the pandemic - but the gap has widened. \nAccording to Ofqual figures, in 2019 there was a 24 percentage point gap between independent schools and comprehensives in A* and A grades at A-level - this year it has risen to 31 percentage points.\nThe Independent Schools Council, said this year's grading system had been a level playing field and that \"irrespective of type of school\" there had to be evidence of the quality of students' work.\nThe gaps were not just between state and private pupils, said Sir Kevan, but also in different parts of the country, warning that parts of the north of England were falling behind. In London almost 48% of results were A* and A grades, compared with 39% in the North East.\n\"We should be thinking about the inequality throughout the system,\" he said.\nHow schools were helped to recover after the pandemic would \"determine the fate of the English education system\" for the next decade, said Sir Kevan.\n\"We've got to get that right,\" he said.\nIn the wake of this week's record high grades in A-levels, with almost 45% of results at A* or A, there have been suggestions of changing the grading system, such as adopting the 9 to 1 system used in GCSEs.\nBut head teachers have said that any short-term change to a numeric system was \"unrealistic\" - and it is not expected to be part of plans for next year's exams.\nPaul Whiteman of the National Association of Head Teachers said it took four years to plan the switch to using number grades for GCSEs.\nAny such major change would require \"meaningful consultation to ensure the fairest system for students,\" he said.\nGeoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said \"rather than tinkering with different grading systems, the government should be concentrating on providing appropriate support for education recovery\".\nExams are already going to be adapted next summer, to take account of lost time in school, but Mr Barton warned it would be \"very harsh\" on next year's exam candidates to have grades returned straight down to the pre-pandemic levels of 2019.\nMr Barton suggested there would need to be a \"staged readjustment\" from next year.\nLabour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said the gap between results in state and private schools showed the lack of consistency in how grades were decided.\n\"The government didn't set down a clear standardised process early on last year - and schools were really awarding grades in very different ways,\" she said.\n\"There has been an increase in top grades for students from all backgrounds, and the relative increase of the proportion of As and above on last year is no higher in independent schools than in academies,\" said a Department for Education spokeswoman.\n\"We are committed to supporting students from all backgrounds. Ofqual report that the assessment approach this year is likely to have helped prevent previous gaps from widening as much as they would have done without this year's grading process.\""

      "text": "Winchester is the least affordable city to buy a home in, says the Halifax.\nIts figures suggest buying a home in the Hampshire commuter city will cost 14 times average earnings, higher than Greater London at 11 times.\nTypically, buying a home in a UK city will now set buyers back 8.1 times their average earnings, up from 5.6 times a decade ago.\nHouse prices have \"generally continued to outstrip wage growth\", said Halifax managing director Russell Galley.\nWinchester has leapfrogged Oxford as the least affordable city in the annual survey, while Londonderry is the most affordable for the third year in a row.\nIn the Northern Ireland city, a home will cost 4.7 times average earnings.\nOver the past year, the Halifax reckons the average house price in UK cities has grown by 10.3%.\nIts analysis of figures from the Office for National Statistics suggests average earnings for people living and working in cities climbed just 2.1% over the same time period.\nAverage city house prices increased to \u00a3287,440, while comparable average earnings rose to \u00a335,677.\nSurprisingly, cities are slightly more affordable than the average for the UK as a whole, according to the figures.\nBut that may partly reflect more people moving out of cities in search of more space during the pandemic.\nA home in Winchester will now set buyers back an average \u00a3630,432, up 8% in the last year.\nThat leaves it with the highest average house prices of any UK city, ahead of St Albans at \u00a3604,423 and London at \u00a3564,695. \nThe least expensive average house prices among cities are in Londonderry at \u00a3155,917 and Hull \u00a3156,924.\nAverage earnings in Winchester are \u00a345,059, higher than for the UK as a whole and only beaten by St Albans at \u00a359,391 and Greater London at \u00a351,257. \n\"The beauty of Winchester is that you can be both country mouse and city mouse at the same time,\" Katie Cave, director at mortgage broker Clearpoint Finance, told the BBC.\n\"Weekends can be spent taking in the views at the top of St Catherine's Hill, nestled in the heart of a nature reserve. Then come Monday morning, you can hop on the train to London and be at your desk in just over an hour.\"\nEmma Seaton moved from Wandsworth in south London to a village just outside Winchester to get various benefits for her family while her husband could still commute to London. \n\"We moved out here for the stunning, diverse countryside, community feel and accessibility: but it's less than an hour on the train to London,\" said Emma, director of buying agency Prime Purchase. \n\"The villages surrounding the city boast thriving communities with busy shops and pubs and the schools are excellent, and we also enjoy easy access to the coast, the New Forest and the ancient capital of Wessex.\" \nShe said Winchester's bars, cafes, restaurants and plenty of culture were all within easy walking distance of each other, adding to the city's attraction. \n\"Winchester is more manageable than Oxford, which is often snarled up with traffic, making it a nicer city to live in.\" \nThere is some good news: in one in nine UK cities, property has become more affordable in the last 12 months.\nHousing affordability improved in seven cities compared with a year earlier: Oxford, Carlisle, Portsmouth, Durham, Salford, Inverness and Glasgow.\nAccording to the figures, Carlisle and Aberdeen are now more affordable than five years ago, while Inverness is the only city more affordable than 10 years ago. \nAn average home there costs 5.6 times average earnings, down from 6.2 in 2011, as wage growth there has outstripped house price growth.\n\"Affordability is significantly better in the North and there are now just two cities - Plymouth and Portsmouth - with better-than-average affordability in the South,\" said Mr Galley.\n(Figures show the price-to-earnings ratio followed by the average house price and average annual earnings.

      "text": "A police officer who shot dead a convicted terrorist on a south London street has described the moment he \"immediately feared for his life\".\nSudesh Amman, 20, ran towards one of the armed surveillance officers with a knife after stabbing two people on Streatham High Road last February.\nOfficer BX75, whose identity is being protected, said the pair \"locked eyes\".\n\"I thought he was going to stab me and kill me or certainly seriously injure me,\" the Royal Courts of Justice heard.\nThe inquest heard BX75 was part of a nine man surveillance team following Amman, who had been released from prison 10 days earlier.\nHolding his Glock pistol in both hands, BX75 described the moments outside Boots before he decided to shoot Amman, who was holding \"a large butcher's knife\", in the chest.\nHe said: \"I saw him, he saw me - I am 100% confident we locked eyes. \n\"It was my immediate assessment - I was making my way as fast as possible towards him, him towards me - the point of impact was very, very soon.\n\"He was in my immediate personal space. His action was always going to beat my reaction, if I let him beat my next move.\"\nAmman did not react to being shot for the second time, by BX75's colleague BX87, the inquest heard.\nHe fell to the ground after being shot again by BX75 and was later pronounced dead.\nBX87 told the inquest he witnessed Amman \"plunge\" a knife into the upper back of a woman wearing a bright pink jacket. \nAlthough he thought the stab wound would be fatal, the woman and another victim survived.\nBX87 appeared to break down as he described his final confrontation with Amman from behind a screen at the Royal Courts of Justice.\nHe said: \"As I tried to slow myself my vision almost was like a cartoon - the blade of the knife almost doubled in size.\n\"It was a strange feeling. His body was forward. It was pretty clear to me he was intent on attacking me or further members of the public.\"\nHe added: \"I saw Mr Amman take a number of paces towards me, closing the gap further.\n\"It really dawned on me at this point that I was going to get stabbed.\"\nThe inquest previously heard there had been concerns about the 20-year-old's imminent release from HMP Belmarsh on 23 January 2020, part-way through a 40-month sentence for preparing and engaging in acts of terrorism. \nHowever, the request was turned down by the governor because the offence Amman was jailed for could not justify an extension of his sentence.\nJurors have also heard that both the police and MI5 decided against arresting Amman two days before the Streatham attack.\nHe was spotted buying items later used to fashion a fake suicide belt but the Probation Service was \"satisfied\" the purchases had not breached any licence conditions.\nThe inquest continues."

      "tags": "GCSEs,Schools,Exam results 2020",
      "text": "GCSE students have received another set of record grades, in the second year of Covid disruption to exams in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nTop grades (7/As and above) rose to 28.9% from 26.2% last year, while grades 4/Cs and above  - seen as passes - rose to 77.1% up from 76.3%.\nThis is a smaller rise than last year, the first time exams were cancelled and teacher assessed grades were used.\nExams regulators have insisted the process has been fair and thorough.\nTeachers submitted grades for the more than half a million pupils on GCSE courses this year, using evidence such as mock exams, course work and tests. \nThere are different devolved systems for GCSEs:\nThe two years of replacement grades, after exams were cancelled in the pandemic, have had significantly higher results, for GCSEs and A-levels.\nExam officials say it reflects that no one has had a bad day in an exam and that pupils had multiple chances to show their best potential.\nEngland's exam watchdog Ofqual said the system was fair, each centre had its assessment policy reviewed and samples of work were checked during a \"quality assurance\" process.\nExam boards say that below 1% of grades were changed in the checking process.\nAs well as getting GCSEs, more than half a million vocational qualifications were also issued, including for 230,000 BTec students.\nSchools Minister Nick Gibb defended the way GCSE results had been awarded, saying this had been a \"very different year\" and it was right that exams were cancelled. \n\"This was the best alternative to exams,\" he told BBC Breakfast. \"I think people can be confident of the grades that have been awarded this year.\"\nMr Gibb said longer term, he wanted to get back to a pre-pandemic system where there are no \"significant changes\" year-on-year in the grades awarded to students.\nLabour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said the exam results were a \"stark warning\" of a widening social divide.\n\"Children on free school meals have been abandoned by this government and students in state schools are again being outstripped by their more advantaged private school peers,\" she said.\nJon Andrews of the Education Policy Institute think tank warned the higher results should not \"distract us from the huge learning losses that students have faced\". \n\"There is a risk that higher grades awarded to young people conceal the underlying losses that they have experienced from the pandemic.\" \nProf Alan Smithers, of the Centre of Education and Employment Research, at Buckingham University, said it would be difficult for the government to reverse the trend of increasing grades over the coming years - as the higher grades are popular with parents and schools.\n\"It will be quite a task for the government to put the genie back into the bottle,\" he said.\nBut head teachers say the replacement grades used this year will allow pupils to progress to the next stage of their education.\nNational Association of Head Teachers leader Paul Whiteman said it was important that these pupils have access to any additional academic or pastoral support they need as they progress into the next stage of their education.\nGeoff Barton, of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"It is important to focus on the achievements of this cohort rather than fixate on comparisons with other years, which are somewhat meaningless.\"\nSyeda had been hoping for high grades after sitting 62 assessments, instead of the usual exams, at Sydney Russell School in Dagenham, east London.\nAnd her hopes have been realised. \"I did it. I got all 9s in my GCSEs and two distinctions,\" she said. \n\"It's the best possible results and I'm so proud of myself. I think there is a big sense of relief.\" \nHer mum, Shahima came to the school with her to share the experience.\nShe says: \"I'm extremely, extremely proud of Syeda. She's put so much effort and hard work into this and lots of sleepless nights.\"\n\"It has been a bit crazy for everyone involved in this process this year,\" she says.\nRoman is celebrating four grade 7s and four grade 8s in his GCSEs. \n\"I'm definitely satisfied, but in a sense I feel I've been bumped down a few grades due to some exams being very different and out of the ordinary this year compared to other years.\" \nHe says the challenges he's faced over the past two years have had an impact.\n\"It's been a rollercoaster. So many ups and downs and so many battles, both mental battles and physical ones.\"\nHe says he would actually have preferred to sit exams as he feels one exam at the end would have been easier than the constant pressure of lots of tests.\n \"I don't think anyone could have ever imagined stuff like this,\" she says\n\"But the fact is that we have got through it - and hopefully our results tomorrow will prove that we have worked hard.\"\nTo those people who criticise the value of this year's grades, Syeda says: \"I would tell them they should try and be in our place.\"\n\"I don't think anyone can know what it is like unless you are experiencing it yourself.\"\nShe is aiming to sit A-levels next year and study English literature at the University of Cambridge."

      "text": "The Taliban fighters we meet are stationed just 30 minutes from one of Afghanistan's largest cities, Mazar-i-Sharif.\nThe \"ghanimat\" or spoils of war they're showing off include a Humvee, two pick-up vans and a host of powerful machine guns. Ainuddin, a stony-faced former madrassa (religious school) student who's now a local military commander, stands at the centre of a heavily-armed crowd.  \nThe insurgents have been capturing new territory on what seems like a daily basis as international troops have all but withdrawn. Caught in the middle is a terrified population. \nTens of thousands of ordinary Afghans have had to flee their homes - hundreds have been killed or injured in recent weeks. \nI ask Ainuddin how he can justify the violence, given the pain it's inflicting on the people he claims to be fighting on behalf of?  \n\"It's fighting, so people are dying,\" he replies coolly, adding that the group is trying its best \"not to harm civilians\".  \nI point out that the Taliban are the ones who have started the fighting. \n\"No,\" he retorts. \"We had a government and it was overthrown. They [the Americans] started the fighting.\"  \nAinuddin and the rest of the Taliban feel momentum is with them, and that they are on the cusp of returning to dominance after being toppled by the US-led invasion in 2001. \n\"They are not giving up Western culture\u2026 so we have to kill them,\" he says of the \"puppet government\" in Kabul.  \nShortly after we finish speaking we hear the sound of helicopters above us. The Humvee and the Taliban fighters quickly disperse. It's a reminder of the continuing threat the Afghan air force poses to the insurgents, and that the battle is still far from over.  \nWe're in Balkh, a town with ancient roots, thought to be the birthplace of one of Islam's most famous mystic poets, Jalaluddin Rumi. \nWe passed through here earlier this year, when it was still controlled by the government, but the outlying villages were held by the Taliban. Now it's one of around 200 district centres to have been captured by the militants in this latest, unprecedented offensive. \nOne senior Taliban official said the focus in the north had been deliberate - not only because the region has traditionally seen strong anti-Taliban resistance, but also because it is more diverse. \nDespite its core leadership being heavily dominated by members of the Pashtun majority, the official said the Taliban wanted to emphasise they incorporated other ethnicities too.\nHaji Hekmat, a local Taliban leader and our host in Balkh, is keen to show us how daily life is still continuing. \nYoung schoolgirls throng the streets (though elsewhere there are reports of girls being banned from attending). The bazaar remains crowded, with both male and female shoppers. \nWe had been told by local sources that women were allowed to attend only with a male companion, but when we visit that does not seem to be the case. Elsewhere Taliban commanders have reportedly been far stricter.  \nAll the women we see, however, are wearing the all-encompassing burqa, covering both their hair and face. \nHaji Hekmat insists no-one is being \"forced\" and that the Taliban are simply \"preaching\" that this is how women should dress. \nBut I've been told taxi drivers have been given instructions not to drive any woman into the town unless she's fully veiled.  \nThe day after we leave, reports emerge of a young woman being murdered because of her clothing. Haji Hekmat, though, rejects allegations Taliban members were responsible.  \nMany in the bazaar express their support for the group and their gratitude towards them for improving security. But with Taliban fighters accompanying us at all times, it's difficult to know what residents really think.  \nThe group's hardline views are at times in tune with more conservative Afghans, but the Taliban are now pushing for control of a number of larger cities. \nIn the shadow of Mazar-e-Sharif's intricately tiled Blue Mosque, men and women strolled around last week in a visibly more relaxed social atmosphere. \nThe government are still in control in the city and almost everyone I spoke to expressed concern about what the Taliban's resurgence will mean, particularly for the \"freedoms\" younger generations have grown up with. \nBut back in Balkh district the Taliban are formalising their own rival government. They've taken over all the official buildings in the town, bar one large, now abandoned police compound. \nIt used to be the headquarters of a bitter rival, the local police chief, and was partly destroyed in a suicide bombing by the militants as they fought for control of the area.\nThe face of the Taliban's district governor, Abdullah Manzoor, lights up with a broad grin when he talks about the operation, whilst his men chuckle. The fight here, as in so many places in Afghanistan, is deeply personal as well as ideological.  \nSome things haven't changed since the Taliban takeover; orange-clad street cleaners are still reporting for work, as are some bureaucrats. They're overseen by a newly appointed Taliban mayor, seated at a broad wooden desk, with a small white flag of the \"Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan\" positioned in one corner. \nHe used to be in charge of ammunition supplies, now it's taxes - and he tells me proudly the group charges business owners less than the government used to. \nThe transition from military to civilian life is a work in progress, though. A Taliban fighter still grasping his gun, who moves to pose behind the mayor during our interview, is ushered away by more senior figures.  \nIn other places, however, the insurgents' hardline interpretation of Islamic scripture is more visible. At the local radio station, they used to play a mixture of Islamic music and general popular hits. \nNow it's only religious chants. Haji Hekmat says they banned music promoting \"vulgarity\" from being played in public, but insists individuals can still listen to what they want.  \nI've been told, however, of a local man being caught listening to music in the bazaar. To punish him, Taliban fighters are said to have made him walk barefoot in the baking sun, until he lost consciousness. \nHaji Hekmat insists no such thing happened. As we leave the station, he gestures to some of the young men working there, pointing out they don't have beards. \n\"See! We're not forcing anyone,\" he says, grinning.  \nIt's clear the group do want to portray a softer image to the world. But in other parts of the country the Taliban are reported to be behaving much more strictly. The differences may depend on the attitudes of local commanders. \nWith reports of extra-judicial revenge killings and other human rights abuses in some of the areas they've captured, the Taliban have been warned by Western officials they risk turning the country into a pariah state if they try to seize it by force.  \nWhat many associate most closely with the Taliban's previous stint in power, is the brutal punishments meted out under their interpretation of Sharia law.  \nLast month in the southern province of Helmand, the group hanged two men accused of child kidnapping from a bridge, justifying it by saying the men had been convicted.  \nIn Balkh, on the day we visit a Taliban court session, all the cases are related to land disputes. Whilst many fear their form of justice, for others it at least offers the possibility of a quicker resolution than the notoriously corrupt government system. \n\"I've had to pay so many bribes,\" complains one of the litigants as he discusses his previous attempts to resolve the case.  \nThe Taliban judge, Haji Badruddin, says he's not yet ordered any corporal punishment in the four months he's been in office, and emphasises the group has a system of appeal courts to review serious verdicts. \nBut he defends even the harshest penalties. \"In our Sharia it's clear, for those who have sex and are unmarried, whether it's a girl or a boy, the punishment is 100 lashes in public.\n\"But for anyone who's married, they have to be stoned to death\u2026 For those who steal: if it's proved, then his hand should be cut off.\"  \nHe pushes back against criticism of the punishments as incompatible with the modern world. \n\"People's children are being kidnapped. Is that better? Or is it better that one person's hand is chopped off and stability is brought in the community?\" \n\u202fFor now, despite the Taliban's rapid advance, the government remains in control of Afghanistan's biggest cities. The coming months are likely to see protracted and increasingly deadly violence as the two sides wrestle for control. \nI ask Haji Hekmat if he's sure the Taliban can win militarily? \"Yes,\" he replies. \"If peace talks are not successful, we will win, God willing.\"  \nThose talks however, have stalled, and the Taliban's repeated demand for the creation of an \"Islamic government\" appears tantamount to a call for their opponents to surrender. \n \"We have defeated both the foreigners,\" says Haji Hekmat, \"and now our internal enemies.\""

      "text": "Winchester is the least affordable city to buy a home in, says the Halifax.\nIts figures suggest buying a home in the Hampshire commuter city will cost 14 times average earnings, higher than Greater London at 11 times.\nTypically, buying a home in a UK city will now set buyers back 8.1 times their average earnings, up from 5.6 times a decade ago.\nHouse prices have \"generally continued to outstrip wage growth\", said Halifax managing director Russell Galley.\nWinchester has leapfrogged Oxford as the least affordable city in the annual survey, while Londonderry is the most affordable for the third year in a row.\nIn the Northern Ireland city, a home will cost 4.7 times average earnings.\nOver the past year, the Halifax reckons the average house price in UK cities has grown by 10.3%.\nIts analysis of figures from the Office for National Statistics suggests average earnings for people living and working in cities climbed just 2.1% over the same time period.\nAverage city house prices increased to \u00a3287,440, while comparable average earnings rose to \u00a335,677.\nSurprisingly, cities are slightly more affordable than the average for the UK as a whole, according to the figures.\nBut that may partly reflect more people moving out of cities in search of more space during the pandemic.\nA home in Winchester will now set buyers back an average \u00a3630,432, up 8% in the last year.\nThat leaves it with the highest average house prices of any UK city, ahead of St Albans at \u00a3604,423 and London at \u00a3564,695. \nThe least expensive average house prices among cities are in Londonderry at \u00a3155,917 and Hull \u00a3156,924.\nAverage earnings in Winchester are \u00a345,059, higher than for the UK as a whole and only beaten by St Albans at \u00a359,391 and Greater London at \u00a351,257. \n\"The beauty of Winchester is that you can be both country mouse and city mouse at the same time,\" Katie Cave, director at mortgage broker Clearpoint Finance, told the BBC.\n\"Weekends can be spent taking in the views at the top of St Catherine's Hill, nestled in the heart of a nature reserve. Then come Monday morning, you can hop on the train to London and be at your desk in just over an hour.\"\nEmma Seaton moved from Wandsworth in south London to a village just outside Winchester to get various benefits for her family while her husband could still commute to London. \n\"We moved out here for the stunning, diverse countryside, community feel and accessibility: but it's less than an hour on the train to London,\" said Emma, director of buying agency Prime Purchase. \n\"The villages surrounding the city boast thriving communities with busy shops and pubs and the schools are excellent, and we also enjoy easy access to the coast, the New Forest and the ancient capital of Wessex.\" \nShe said Winchester's bars, cafes, restaurants and plenty of culture were all within easy walking distance of each other, adding to the city's attraction. \n\"Winchester is more manageable than Oxford, which is often snarled up with traffic, making it a nicer city to live in.\" \nThere is some good news: in one in nine UK cities, property has become more affordable in the last 12 months.\nHousing affordability improved in seven cities compared with a year earlier: Oxford, Carlisle, Portsmouth, Durham, Salford, Inverness and Glasgow.\nAccording to the figures, Carlisle and Aberdeen are now more affordable than five years ago, while Inverness is the only city more affordable than 10 years ago. \nAn average home there costs 5.6 times average earnings, down from 6.2 in 2011, as wage growth there has outstripped house price growth.\n\"Affordability is significantly better in the North and there are now just two cities - Plymouth and Portsmouth - with better-than-average affordability in the South,\" said Mr Galley.\n(Figures show the price-to-earnings ratio followed by the average house price and average annual earnings.

      "text": "In 1905, before what was dubbed \"game of the century\", Welsh players and fans responded to New Zealand's Haka with Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau.\nIt is believed to be one of the first times an anthem was sung before an international sports match anywhere in the world.\nNow, 116 years later, it is played at rugby and football internationals, as well as Senedd events.\nBut should God Save the Queen, the UK's official anthem, be sung as well?\nIn an article, Archbishop of York, the Most Rev Stephen Cottrell, said it had become seen as \"just the English anthem\".\nHe added that, as part of \"a big vision for one United Kingdom\" to stop the union falling apart, when \"the different nations of the UK find themselves pitched against each other on the sports field we could belt out our English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish anthems. Then sing our national anthem together\".\nRugby writer Peter Jackson believes it is seen by people as \"not the anthem of Wales\" and would be \"booed now even more than it was in the past\".\nHowever, he would not have anthems at all, saying his dad's view when he was growing up in Ireland was \"it only heightened the differences between one set of people and another\".\nGod Save the Queen was played at Croke Park in Dublin before Ireland v England in the 2007 Six Nations.\nMr Jackson described it as a place \"loaded with history of the most emotive kind\" as it was where British forces opened fire on the crowd attending a Gaelic football match in 1920, killing 14 people, including Tipperary player Michael Hogan.\n\"When they played it at the shrine of Gaelic football and Irish republicanism, you could hear a pin drop,\" he said.\n\"Compare that to it routinely being booed in Edinburgh and Cardiff - which are parts of the UK.\"\nGod Save the Queen continues to be played before Northern Ireland football matches while Scotland's rugby and football teams adopted Flower of Scotland in the 1990s.\n\"Each country should play what they want. England for years claimed God Save the Queen, even though it's the anthem of the UK, not England,\" said sports historian Huw Richards.\n\"We weren't bothered about fighting them for it because musically it's such an awful anthem.\"\nHowever, he said it was generally accepted and played as well as Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau before rugby games, until a \"tipping point\" came in the 1970s. \nMr Richards said: \"In 1973, God Save the Queen was played at Cardiff before Wales played Japan and unmercifully jeered, with it identified among Welsh fans as English, who asked 'why are they playing it at our game?'\n\"Then at Twickenham, a few months later, Mae Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau wasn't played - it was suggested it was direct retaliation, with the RFU president thoroughly embarrassed, saying the band took unilateral action.\"\nHe believes this was the point where it was decided God Save the Queen was \"not appropriate for Wales games\" and it was \"quietly dropped\", with the WRU in a \"strong position to be assertive\" because of the great sides it had in the 1970s.\nMr Richards believes if God Save the Queen was a truly representative, UK-wide anthem, there would be more controversy about it not being used, adding: \"It's not about the UK, but celebrates a particular structure. \n\"You see it before France v England - one anthem is an appeal to the entire nation, then the next is about being subjects.\"\nMr Richards believes 116 years of history means that Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau now \"represents who we are\" in a way God Save the Queen simply cannot.\n\"There is a parallel debate over the Prince of Wales feathers on the jersey - many suggest it's a colonial hangover and ask why we still wear them,\" he added.\n\"But now, many people look at them and see Bleddyn Williams, Gareth Edwards and Ieuan Evans. \n\"The meanings of things change over time, with the relationship of previously imposed princes to run the place irrelevant, and in a rugby context, the three feathers represent the great players who have worn them.\"\nIn that sense, for many players as well, history means God Save the Queen has come to represent Wales' greatest rivals. \nAt the 2012 London Olympics, Team GB played football matches in Cardiff, and despite wearing the jersey, Welshmen Craig Bellamy, Ryan Giggs, Joe Allen, Aaron Ramsey and Neil Taylor decided not to sing it. \nRather than being seen as their own anthem, Bellamy simply asked the crowd to respect it by not booing, adding: \"Every national anthem, it doesn't matter if it is your worst enemy, it's just one or two minutes and you should be quiet and respect it and that should be the same for everyone.\""

      "tags": "NI education,A-levels",
      "text": "More than half of A-level entries in Northern Ireland have been awarded top A* and A grades.\nAbout 25,000 pupils received their A-level and AS-level results this morning.\nAlmost 51% of A-level entries were awarded A* or A grades, a record and a rise from about 45% in 2020.\nSome students also received their BTec results on Tuesday - for many, that has become a path into university.\nAs formal exams were cancelled for a second year due to the coronavirus pandemic, schools calculated the grades to be awarded to pupils.\nEducation Minister Michelle McIlveen praised young people's \"incredible resilience\", acknowledging the exceptional circumstances they had faced over the past year.\n\"Our young people have demonstrated a determination not to let this pandemic put their lives on hold,\" she said.\n\"They have been awarded qualifications which reflect their hard work and will enable them to move forward confidently with their future plans.\"\nThe vast majority of AS and A-level entries in Northern Ireland are made through the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) exams board.\nHowever, some pupils take some A-levels through English exam boards.\nThere had previously been a significant rise in the proportion of A-level entries to CCEA awarded top grades in 2020.\nIn 2020, after the change in how results were awarded, 14.5% of A-level entries through CCEA achieved the top A* grade compared with 8.9% in 2019.\nAccording to CCEA, that has risen to 15.8% of entries in 2021.\nAlmost 45% of A-level entries to CCEA in 2020 were awarded A* or A grades compared with 32.2% in 2019.\nThat has risen to 50.8% in 2021.\nAcross Northern Ireland, England and Wales as a whole almost 45% of A-levels entries received A* or A grades.\nPupils in Scotland take Highers and they also received results this morning and some students in Northern Ireland also receive their BTEC results.\nAlana Cahoon from Portadown, County Armagh, said she was \"so relieved and extremely grateful\" after receiving three Bs at A-level.\nThe 18-year-old, who is a member of youth-led charity Pure Mental NI, said it was important that fellow students remembered to take care of their mental health on results day.\n\"It's important not to compare yourself to other people, don't compare yourself to what you see on your Facebook feed and Instagram feeds, Ms Cahoon said. \n\"It's ok if you didn't get what you wanted, everyone has their own path.\"\nProf Paul Seawright, deputy vice-chancellor of Ulster University, told BBC News NI: \"We have over 5,000 places available across four campuses... more than we've ever had.\n\"If you meet the conditions of your offer the university is obliged to take you and we'll be delighted to welcome you.\"\nProfessor David Jones, pro-vice chancellor for education and students at Queens University Belfast, said: \"What we really want is to make sure that we can get as many people in as wish to come.\"\nHe said there were opportunities not only at Northern Ireland's universities but also by entering the further education sector and moving to university through that route.\nFurther education colleges in Northern Ireland estimate that at least 60% of those receiving BTecs go on to further study at college or university.\nBrian Doran, principal of Southern Regional College, said: \"Whatever happens with offers today, it is really important that students understand the many options they have to continue to further study, particularly with the amount of higher education routes available to them at the six further education colleges, through foundation degrees, Higher National Diplomas and Higher Level Apprenticeships.\n\"This year, colleges and universities are working closely together to make sure students are signposted towards these alternative routes.\"\nEllen Fearon, the president of the National Union of Students and Union of Students in Ireland (NUS-USI), said everyone receiving results should feel proud of themselves.\nShe said the government and the education sector had to make sure the necessary places were made available at universities and colleges to accommodate new students.\n\"Students have done their part and it's now on the sector to do theirs,\" she said.\nLimavady High School principal Darren Mornin said every pupils should be congratulated after what had been an incredibly difficult 18 months.\n\"There has obviously been that disruption to face-to-face teaching so they most definitely will have been worried,\" he said.\n\"The results that they are getting today - especially from a Limavady High School point of view - have all been fantastic and I am just so proud of them all.\"\nMeanwhile, at AS-level in Northern Ireland, almost three-quarters of entries (73.9%) received the top A or B grades.\nHowever, those AS results will not count towards a pupil's A-level grade in 2022.\nEvidence for samples of results calculated by schools has been checked by exam boards, including CCEA in Northern Ireland.\nA pupil can appeal their result if they are unhappy with it, with some appeals classed as \"priority\" if a pupil's place on a higher education course depends on a change to their results.\nPupils can appeal if they think an \"unreasonable academic judgement\" was made by their school but CCEA will only change a grade if they decide it does not match the evidence provided by the school.\nThe rise in results will inevitably spark a debate about grade inflation compared to years when pupils sit exams at the end of their course.\nBut the head of England's exam regulator Ofqual has said that grades are a fair reflection of the efforts pupils have made.\nSimon Lebus said teacher assessments give a \"much more accurate reflection\" of what students can achieve.\nPupils awaiting GCSE results will receive them on Thursday.\nCCEA will operate a results helpline from Tuesday until Friday 20 August on 028 9026 1220.\nFormal GCSE, AS and A-level exams are expected to take place again in the 2021-2022 school year."

      "tags": "NI Health,Nursing,Royal College of Nursing",
      "text": "More than 180 nurses resigned from Northern Ireland's largest health trust in the first half of this year, BBC News NI has learned.\nFigures from the Belfast Trust show 315 nurses left between 1 January and 31 July for various reasons. \nMore than half (182) resigned, while 81 nurses retired and 21 transferred within the health service.\nA total of 533 nurses left all of the trusts during that time period but only the Belfast Trust gave a breakdown.\nA nursing union says it is angry and worried about the growing number of members leaving the profession.\nRita Devlin, acting director of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said it was now a safety issue as there were not enough nurses to give patients the care they needed. \nA nursing agency said the number of new registrations it received during the first six months of this year was up by about 10% compared to the same time last year.  \nThe Department of Health said the 533 leavers figure would include retirees and nurses moving to other health and social care organisations.\n\"This level of leavers in recent years is commensurate with the size and composition of the workforce,\" the department said.\nKatharine Walker left the health service in June 2020 - several months after the start of the pandemic. \nSpeaking to BBC News NI, she said she wanted a work-life balance, which was not possible when mostly working nights. \n\"I loved my time working within the NHS but I was only there for four years and I was exhausted. \n\"I can't imagine how the staff are coping at the minute working with Covid and everything else.\n\"I worked in ICU [intensive care unit] and I worked with really incredible people who are so passionate about their job and the things you are seeing are almost indescribable at times.\"\nMs Walker joined an agency, which she says has given her flexibility and the \"slightly\" better pay means she can work fewer hours.\nShe is inundated with requests to work at the minute.\n\"All the hospitals are looking staff,\" she said.\n\"Some wards are really on their knees and it's hard because it plays on your good nature as a nurse because you want to help out but ultimately you have to look after yourself too.\"\nShe doesn't blame management for the staffing issues.\n\"They don't have enough staff to manoeuvre - so maybe if the staffing was there it would help,\" she added.\nMs Devlin said the RCN had been on the record for at least a decade over nursing shortages.  \n\"They are starting to vote with their feet and they are leaving some of the high-pressure areas to go to other places or indeed to go and work for agencies,\" she said.\nKieran McCormick, managing director of Balmoral Healthcare, said nurses were leaving the health service and joining the independent sector so they could be more in control of the hours they work.   \nMr McCormick, who once worked for the health service, said nurses wanted to be respected and generally felt \"fed up and done\".  \n\"I believe the executive is trying to fix it but it's about the whole package - paying them good wages, offering nurses flexible working and allowing them to move around and progress within the system,\" he said.\nChief nursing officer Charlotte McArdle acknowledged that staff shortages were not something that could be \"fixed overnight\" but that a \"clear plan\" for recruitment had been put in place.\nShe also told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that the safety of patients and nurses on wards was paramount.\n\"Any unit that would be unsafe, steps would be taken to ensure that position is rectified and there are a number of things that can be done to make that happen,\" she said.\n\"Bringing in additional staff, closing beds where they have to to maintain a safe staffing level, deploying other staff into that unit, there are steps that can be taken on a daily basis.\n\"Nursing is a safety-critical profession, I would agree with my colleagues in the RCN on that point, but steps are being taken to ensure that safety is maintained and that can be challenging at times but that is a requirement.\" \nPatricia McKeown, regional secretary of the union Unison, said the figures reflected \"the serious pressure that nurses are under working within a health service that is understaffed and under-resourced\".\nShe said that while many nurses would have moved within the health service, a significant number would have chosen to leave the NHS to work for nursing agencies, with pay a \"major factor in that decision\".\n\"These agencies charge a premium to cover staff shortages across the health service whilst vacancies remain unfilled,\" she said.  \nShe said the executive must make pay a priority.\nOut of the nurses who left the Belfast Health Trust, 16 were from the intensive care unit at the Royal Victoria Hospital.  \nThe figures for all leavers from the other trusts are:\nBBC News NI also asked about unfilled posts. \nNot all of the health trusts could provide answers within the time requested, but according to the Southern Trust it has 255 unfilled posts. There are 150 in the Northern Trust. \nThe Department of Health said there were 18,449 registered nurses and midwives with a staff turnover rate of about 1,000 registrants per annum, \"which has been consistent for the past three years\".\n\"It should be pointed out however that this does not represent a reduction in overall staff numbers as the nursing and midwifery workforce has grown by 4.4% from March 2020,\" the department said.\nA spokesperson said the department had been addressing nursing shortages over the past five years through a range of measures.\n\"Since April 2020, over 3,800 new appointments have been made across Health and Social Care services, of which almost 2,200 are Health and Social Care appointments,\" they added.\n\"In addition, we have maintained the highest ever number of pre-registration nurse training places for this year - 1,325.\""

      "title": "Libya's city of ghosts",
      "tags": "Libya",
      "text": "As the senior man in his family, in fact its only surviving adult male, it falls to Abdel Manaam Mahmoud to climb into the grave and lay his brother Esmail's body to rest. Though it may not be his brother he's burying today. \nAround him, the men of Tarhuna gather, pushing the red sandy earth and patting down the mound of dirt with their hands. \nNearby, Mr Mahmoud's father, Hussin, his brother Nuri and his uncle Mohamed are also buried - each a victim of Libya's civil war, casualties of its factional, shifting alliances and all murdered by the same militia who ruled their town. \nThe bodies were found and buried because of Libya's ceasefire signed last year. Since 2011 and the fall of the dictator Muammar Gaddafi, the country has been roiled by chaos, and later, civil war. \nThat war reached a crescendo in recent years, as Gen Khalifa Haftar, now aged 77, attacked from the eastern city of Benghazi and tried to unseat the internationally recognised government in the capital, Tripoli.\nHe had powerful backers: the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Syria, Jordan and France too. His lightning attack on Tripoli became bogged down and was then routed, after Turkey sent a naval force and attack drones to support the government in the east. \nAdded to this toxic mix were mercenaries from Syria, mostly on the government side, under the control of the Turks. Gen Haftar had his own hired guns - Russian contractors and fighters from Sudan and Chad. \nThe body count soared, and a country that had reached and passed the brink many times before teetered on the edge of greater catastrophe. \nBut a ceasefire was agreed, and for the first time in years, Libya has a unified government. Its prime minister is Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, a fantastically rich businessman from the commercial hub of Misrata. While his family has links to the Muammar Gaddafi rule, little is known about the new prime minister, a political neophyte. \n\"He was no-one's b\u00eate noire,\" said one Western diplomat in Tripoli, explaining Mr Dbeibah's appointment by a UN-led process that created the interim government. Elections are supposed to be held in nine months, on Libyan Independence Day - 24 December - but already there are doubts. \n\"It is a tight deadline, but it's not impossible. But of course, again, it starts with all the institutions and authorities of Libya,\" says Jan Kubis, the UN's special envoy on Libya. \n\"Either they will deliver what they have to deliver, to make it happen. If not... they will find pretexts, excuses, not to do it... I hope that this will not happen because the people of the country, they would like to have the elections. \n\"It's not only the proclamations of the authorities and pledges. It's the wish of the people of the country to have the elections on 24 December.\"\nAfter our interview, Mr Kubis headed to Benghazi to meet Gen Haftar, the man many in Tarhuna believe empowered the seven Kani brothers (whom Mr Mahmoud accuses of killing his relatives) in their final killing spree before they quit town. Some suspect the general is sheltering the surviving brothers, some of whom have been added to US and European sanctions lists. \nThe town of Tarhuna was the western launchpad for the attacks on Tripoli and a flashpoint in the steady internationalisation of the country's civil war.\nFrom here, Gen Haftar's forces from the east, his self-styled Libyan National Army, led assaults on the capital. Mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group took up positions in the town too.\nAt the town's cemetery, there are 13 burials today. The men and boys of the town are here in force, they walked in their hundreds after Friday prayers, some using their prayer mats to shade themselves from the afternoon sun.\nAfter the ceremony, Mr Mahmoud said: \"They took my family from their homes. They were simple civilians. In October 2020, the al-Kani militia came to their homes in cars that belonged to the state, they took them away from their homes and killed them.\"\nHe searched for his family for 10 months, in vain. First the bodies of Hussin, Nuri and Mohamed were found. Two months ago, Esmail's body was discovered. \n\"Even in his 42 years of ruling, Gaddafi never committed the kinds of killings that occurred after his rule.  As Libyan civilians, there is no-one to protect us, our lives have become unprotected,\" Mr Mahmoud says.\nThe seven Kani brothers, famous for the three lions they had stolen from the zoo in Tripoli and kept as pets, reigned supreme. Mercurial, their Kaniyat militia switched sides more than once in Libya's civil war. \nTheir rule came to an end in June last year, when government forces, backed by Turkish support, took the town. Turkey sent seven naval frigates to Libya's coast to push back Gen Haftar's forces, and imported thousands of Syrian fighters from Idlib, Aleppo and Deir Ezzor to fight on the ground. \nIn the face of the onslaught, the remaining Kani brothers and their families fled east, their whereabouts unknown. \nTarhuna's cemetery is austere in the Muslim tradition, surrounded by tall thirsty eucalyptus trees and with few headstones; it has only simple grave markers. But Esmail's marker bears a number: 051-000066.\nIt's a DNA reference. Because the body buried today may not be Esmail's. He was only identified by the clothes he was wearing, when he was discovered in a collection of mass graves to the south of the city.\nThe road to the farmhouse is surrounded by almond groves. A cardboard sign across the entry, warns: \"No Entry, Only Missing Person Committee Allowed.\" \nBeyond the farmhouse, fine red soil is piled in high mounds that stretch to the end of the property. There are too many to count, some the size of a single corpse, others far wider. \nIt's Friday, so there is no work today and the site is silent, but the evidence of the meticulous effort to uncover the crimes here is all around. In one pit, four red flags mark out the twisted remains of perhaps four bodies, wrapped together, almost unrecognisable. \nMen, women and children were buried here, some killed by a single bullet to the head, others with their hands bound with signs of torture on their bodies. The dry earth has left the bodies intact, and swollen. Like artefacts from a terrible disaster.\nEsmail's identity will be confirmed when a DNA match is made at a lab in Tripoli. So far, 140 bodies have been found, according to Libya's General Authority for Searching and Identifying Missing Persons. They have confirmed the identities of 22 of the dead by DNA matching. \nIn total, 350 people are missing from the town, although bodies from elsewhere may be buried here. Across Libya, more than 6,000 people have been declared missing since the downfall of Muammar Gaddafi. Only 1,950 have been found.\nAt the edge of the cemetery stands Ahmad Abdel-Mori Saad, who's here to bury a friend. Tarhuna is a city of ghosts, he said.\n\"I have seven siblings who were kidnapped by the Kaniyat. We have buried two of them found in the mass graves,\" he said.  \nMr Saad doesn't know where his other brothers are, but he believes they are dead. He's left to care for all their children, 24 in total.\n\"We do not follow any political parties; we are not policemen or army men\u2026 If you have money, you die; if you have five young siblings, you die; you get in a discussion with me, you die; you don't support me, you die. \n\"You die for nothing, it's a death for no reason at all.\""

      "tags": "Fast food,Companies,Deliveroo",
      "text": "Deliveroo has said demand for its services has strengthened despite Covid restrictions easing.\nThe food delivery firm saw orders double to 148.8 million in the first half of this year, while the value of its transactions also doubled.\nAt the same time, it narrowed its pre-tax losses to \u00a3104.8m, as against \u00a3128.4m a year earlier.\nIt was the first set of results from the company since it floated on the stock market in March.\nDeliveroo initially listed on the London stock exchange at 390p a share, but the price fell sharply on the opening day of trading, 31 March.\nOn Monday, its shares rallied on the news that German rival Delivery Hero had bought a 5% stake in the company worth \u00a3284m.\nBut in Wednesday trading, it was down 3.3% at 351p.\nCooped-up consumers flocked to order from Deliveroo during the earlier stages of the pandemic, when restaurants were closed and people switched to home deliveries.\nThe firm said it expected customer behaviour to moderate later in the year, but it remained \"excited about the opportunity ahead\".\nIt added that its outlook for the remainder of the year continued to be \"optimistic but prudent, combining confidence in continued year-on-year growth in orders with an expectation that average order values revert towards pre-pandemic levels\".\nDeliveroo said its gross transaction value for the six months was \u00a33.4bn, a 99% rise from the same period in 2020. \nIt repeated an earlier forecast that gross transaction value for the whole of 2021 would be 50% to 60% up on last year.\nFounder and chief executive Will Shu said: \"We are seeing strong growth and engagement across our marketplace as lockdowns continue to ease. \n\"Demand has been high amongst consumers. We have widened our consumer base, seen people continuing to order frequently and we now work with more food merchants than any other platform in the UK. \n\"At the same time, more riders are choosing to continue to work with the company because they value the work we offer.\"\nBy Rob Young, business correspondent\nFood delivery companies have been some of the standout winners of the pandemic. With people cooped up at home and dining in restaurants banned, a takeaway was for many the highlight of the lockdown week. Some analysts have questioned how much of that surge in business will persist as restaurants reopen. \nInterestingly, Deliveroo says orders are \"proving resilient\" since the re-emergence of the hospitality industry. But it doesn't expect that to remain the case forever. There are warnings that consumer behaviour \"may moderate\" later in the year and that the value (but not necessarily the number) of orders will return \"towards\" pre-pandemic levels. \nThe company has diversified, though - it now delivers groceries from the likes of Waitrose, Co-op and Aldi. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has described Deliveroo as a \"true British tech success story\". By many measures, it is. But it's not yet a financial success. \nDespite the huge increase in business over the past year, Deliveroo still didn't make a profit. Its losses were smaller than a year ago, but the company ended the first half \u00a3104.8m in the red. Investors - who were lukewarm on the company's shares when they started trading in March - may be wondering: if Deliveroo can't make a profit when eating in restaurants isn't allowed, when can it?\nDeliveroo said it now covered 72% of the UK population. This was ahead of its plans, which had envisaged 67% coverage by the end of this year.\nIn all, it operates in 11 countries, including Australia, Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait.\nHowever, it said it had now decided to pull out of Spain, because \"achieving a top-tier market position would require a disproportionate level of investment with highly uncertain long-term potential returns\".\nThe move comes after the Spanish government announced plans to give more employment rights to workers at food delivery firms and other online services.\n\"Deliveroo appears to be dominating the takeaway scene in many towns and cities, where its distinctive mint green-jacketed riders operate, despite Uber Eats and Just Eat rivals breathing down their neck,\" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\"But investors appeared to have lost a little appetite for shares in early trading, with the company expecting customer behaviour to moderate later in the year.\"\nShe added: \"There is speculation growing that Deliveroo could potentially be a target for takeover, given the rush of acquisitions in the British market.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.  \nThe UK is moving \"cautiously\" down the age groups as it decides how many under-18s should get a Covid vaccine - because of a \"delicate balance\" between benefits and risks, a scientist has said. Prof Adam Finn said the advice to invite 16 and 17-year-olds for their jab came after a small number of serious cases in this age group. He said scientists want to learn more about any side effects of the vaccines. It comes as the UK reported 29,612 new Covid cases and 104 deaths. Almost 40 million Britons have had both doses of a Covid jab - that's 75.3% of the adult population.\nThe former schools catch-up tsar says he is worried the pandemic is widening the gap in A-level results between state and private school pupils. Sir Kevan Collins says he is concerned that the \"educational legacy of Covid could be growing inequality\". For independent school pupils in England, 70% of A-level results were A* or A, compared with 39% for comprehensive pupils. \"This is a deep problem in our system and one that seems to be growing,\" said Sir Kevan. This year's A-Level results showed record numbers of pupils got the top grades after exam gradings were replaced by teacher assessment due to Covid-19.\nGoogle employees in the US who opt to work from home permanently may get a pay cut. The technology giant has developed a pay calculator that lets employees see the effects of working remotely or moving offices. Some remote employees, especially those with a long commute, could have their pay cut without changing address. Google said it had no plans at this time to implement the policy in the UK.

      "tags": "Companies,David Cameron",
      "text": "David Cameron has denied commercially lobbying the government on behalf of a genetics company he worked for.\nIt comes after it emerged he encouraged Health Secretary Matt Hancock to speak at a conference co-hosted by the firm, Illumina, shortly before it won a \u00a3123m government contract. \nAccording to the Times newspaper, Mr Cameron wrote to Mr Hancock personally to recommend he attend the conference.\nMr Cameron's spokesman confirmed both men had attended the conference.\nThe former Prime Minister also mentioned his attendance at the conference on his Twitter account. \nThe conference was co-hosted by Illumina and Genomics England.\nIn the letter, seen by the Times, Mr Cameron wrote to Mr Hancock: \"I understand Jay [Flatley, then executive chairman of Illumina] has sent this direct to your office, but I wanted to i) ensure that you had seen it personally; and ii) strongly endorse their invitation to this significant conference.\"\nThe BBC understands that Mr Cameron did forward a copy of a letter of invitation to the conference to Mr Hancock, after a previous one had been sent directly.\nThe Times reported that a week after the conference at the Four Seasons Hotel, in Hampshire, in September 2019, the company was given a multi-million-pound contract for genetic sequencing without competition. The contract is with Genomics England, a company wholly owned by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).\nThe DHSC said that the contract was \"was awarded in the correct way, through the proper process\".\nDeputy Leader of the Labour Party Angela Rayner said: \"There is rampant cronyism, sleaze and dodgy lobbying that is polluting our democracy under Boris Johnson and the Conservatives. They hand public money to their mates without a second thought.\"\nMr Hancock said that he \"had no involvement in the awarding of these contracts and all normal processes were followed\".\nMr Cameron's spokesman said: \"David Cameron's work for Illumina has never involved any discussion of commercial contracts.\n\"It has predominantly involved promoting the benefits of genomic sequencing and the world-leading example of Genomics England to other countries around the world. He has done this in Australia, the US, the Gulf, India and more recently in online calls with interested parties in Japan and Holland.\nHe said the former Prime Minister had made clear that promoting the science of genomics would occasionally bring him into contact with UK Government Ministers, officials and others, including at international gatherings. \n\"For instance, he and the former Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock, both spoke at an international genomics conference in September 2019 and this was publicised at the time, including on David Cameron's own Twitter account.\n\"As has been made clear on numerous occasions, David Cameron has never lobbied the Government on behalf of Illumina or been involved in any contract or commercial discussions,\" he added.\nThe Department for Health and Social Care said it carried out \"extensive due diligence\".\n\"This contract, signed to help save lives through better diagnosis, was awarded in the correct way, through the proper process and any suggestion of undue ministerial involvement in the decision making is completely wrong.\n\"Extensive due diligence was carried out and as set out in the transparency notice the contact was directly awarded because Illumina was the only company considered to have the technical capability to deliver this crucial work.\nIt said that the 2019 contract \"was a follow-on contract to the original sequencing contract with Illumina in 2014.\""

      "tags": "ITV,Ofcom,Television,Reality TV,Love Island",
      "text": "A recent episode of ITV's Love Island sparked almost 25,000 complaints to regulator Ofcom, a record for the show.\nFriday's instalment saw Faye Winter confront her partner Teddy Soares over footage, shown without full context, from Casa Amor week. \nThe week places male and female contestants in separate villas with the chance to be unfaithful.\nMost of the 24,763 complaints related to Faye's behaviour. Ofcom is deciding whether to launch an investigation.\n\"We've received a high volume of complaints about last week's Love Island, which is consistent with a trend of growing complaints about high-profile TV shows,\" a spokesperson for the broadcasting regulator said.\n\"We are carefully assessing the complaints we've received, before deciding whether or not to investigate.\"\nOfcom said the \"vast majority\" of the complaints related to the fallout from the Movie Night challenge, which involved islanders viewing footage of each other's behaviour while living apart in separate villas during Casa Amor week.\nA clip of Teddy showed him telling Clarisse Juliette, who has since been eliminated, that he was attracted to her.\nHe also told her he was \"technically single\" during a flirty exchange and the pair were then shown kissing during a challenge.\nHowever, he did not act on his remarks outside the game, otherwise remaining faithful to Faye.\nAfter the clip was played to the islanders, Faye, who has admitted to trust issues, launched into an outburst.\nThe heated exchange sparked a debate over Faye's behaviour and Love Island's production values.\nThe New Statesman writer Sarah Manavis questioned whether producers had put pressure on the couple.\nCampaigner and writer Gina Martin similarly felt the show's makers had \"added huge fuel to a fire they knew would explode\".\nResponding to the backlash on Sunday via a statement posted on Faye's Instagram story, her family urged viewers to remember they were watching a \"highly edited TV show which is created for entertainment\".\n\"Faye is human. She may not always get things right,\" they said. \"There are human beings managing the islander's social media pages who will be seriously effected [sic] by your comments. We ask that everyone please remembers this before commenting or messaging.\"\nTeddy and Faye reconciled on Tuesday, with Faye saying: \"I am really sorry for the way I spoke to you.\n\"There's no excuse for the way I spoke to you or how I raised my voice and no-one should have someone speak to them like that.\"\nITV has not commented.\nThe 6 August episode attracted six times the previous highest number of complaints made about a single episode so far this series, which started in late June.\nPreviously, more than 4,000 viewers complained that July's Casa Amor postcard episode was manipulative toward the female islanders.\nThe mental health of Love Island contestants and the aftercare offered to them has come under increased scrutiny in recent years.\nITV introduced revised duty of care protocols this year, including training islanders on how to handle the \"potential negativity\" of social media.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,United States Army,Taliban,US-Taliban peace talks,United States",
      "text": "After 20 years of war, the Taliban has swept to victory in Afghanistan.\nThe group completed their shockingly rapid advance across the country by capturing Kabul on 15 August.\nIt came after foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan following a deal between the US and the Taliban, two decades after US forces removed the militants from power in 2001.\nThe conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions.\nTaliban forces have pledged not to allow Afghanistan to become a base for terrorists who could threaten the West.\nBut questions are already being asked about how the group will govern the country, and what their rule means for women, human rights, and political freedoms.\nBack in 2001, the US was responding to the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington, in which nearly 3,000 people were killed. Officials identified Islamist militant group al-Qaeda, and its leader Osama Bin Laden, as responsible. \nBin Laden was in Afghanistan, under the protection of the Taliban, the Islamists who had been in power since 1996.\nWhen they refused to hand him over, the US intervened militarily, quickly removing the Taliban and vowing to support democracy and eliminate the terrorist threat.\nThe militants slipped away and later regrouped.\nNato allies had joined the US and a new Afghan government took over in 2004 but deadly Taliban attacks continued. President Barack Obama's \"troop surge\" in 2009 helped push back the Taliban but it was not long term.\nIn 2014, at the end of what was the bloodiest year since 2001, Nato's international forces ended their combat mission, leaving responsibility for security to the Afghan army.\nThat gave the Taliban momentum and they seized more territory. \nPeace talks between the US and the Taliban started tentatively, with the Afghan government pretty much uninvolved, and the agreement on a withdrawal came in February 2020 in Qatar.\nThe US-Taliban deal did not stop the Taliban attacks - they switched their focus instead to Afghan security forces and civilians, and targeted assassinations. Their areas of control grew.\nThey emerged in the civil war that followed the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, predominantly in the south-west and the Pakistan border areas.\nThey vowed to fight corruption and improve security, but also followed an austere form of Islam.\nBy 1998, they had taken control of almost all of the country. \nThey enforced their own hardline version of Sharia, or Islamic law, and introduced brutal punishments. Men were made to grow beards and women had to wear the all-covering burka. TV, music and cinema were banned.\nAfter their overthrow they regrouped in Pakistani border areas.\nIn terms of lives lost, it is obviously not easy to say exactly. The number of coalition casualties is much better recorded than Taliban and Afghan civilians.\nResearch by Brown University estimates losses in the Afghan security forces at 69,000. It puts the number of civilians and militants killed at about 51,000 each.\nMore than 3,500 coalition soldiers have died since 2001 - about two-thirds of them Americans. More than 20,000 US soldiers have been injured.\nAccording to the UN, Afghanistan has the third-largest displaced population in the world. \nSince 2012, some five million people have fled and not been able to return home, either displaced within Afghanistan or taking refuge in neighbouring countries. \nBrown University research also puts the US spending on the conflict - including military and reconstruction funds in both Afghanistan and Pakistan - at $978bn (\u00a3706bn) up to 2020.\nHow the Taliban plan to govern Afghanistan remains unclear.\nWomen face an uncertain future. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen says the group will respect the rights of women and minorities \"as per Afghan norms and Islamic values\".\nThe militants had declared an amnesty across Afghanistan and said it wanted women to join its government.\nBut there are fears over women's freedom to work, to dress as they choose, or even to leave home alone under Taliban rule. \nAnother major fear is that the country will once again become a training ground for terrorism.\nTaliban officials insist that they will fully adhere to the US deal and prevent any group from using Afghan soil as a base for attacks against the US and its allies.\nThey say they aim only to implement an \"Islamic government\" and will not pose a threat to any other country.\nBut many analysts say the Taliban and al-Qaeda are inseparable, with the latter's fighters heavily embedded and engaged in training activity.\nIt is also important to remember that the Taliban are not a centralised and unified force. Some leaders may want to keep the West muted by not stirring up trouble but hardliners may be reluctant to break links with al-Qaeda.\nJust how powerful al-Qaeda is and whether it could now rebuild its global network is also unclear.\nThen there is the regional branch of the Islamic State group - ISKP (Khorasan Province) - which the Taliban oppose.\nLike al-Qaeda, ISKP has been degraded by the US and Nato but could use the post-withdrawal period to regroup.\nIts fighter numbers could be only between a few hundred and 2,000 but it may try to gain footholds in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and parts of Tajikistan, which could be a serious regional concern.

      "text": "Four gang members have been convicted of the murder of a \"charismatic and intelligent\" NHS worker who was stabbed in the street in east London.\nDavid Gomoh, 24, was attacked as he talked on the phone to his girlfriend on 26 April 2020. He staggered back home and died in front of his family.\nHe had no links to any gangs but was randomly targeted in Canning Town as part of a feud.  \nHis killers will be sentenced on 17 September. \nVagnei Colubali, 22, from Cambridge, Mohammad Jalloh, 19, from Pinner, north-west London, and David Ture, 19, of no fixed address, were found guilty along with a 17-year-old Telford boy who cannot be named because of his age.\nMr Gomoh's mother Marian said: \"David's murder is without doubt the hardest thing my family and I have been through.  \n\"Nothing will bring back a life that was so full of promise and hope, a life that was brutally taken away from us; but we are grateful that now we can begin to mourn and build a fitting legacy for David.\"\nThe four killers were all connected to a gang based in north Newham, the Old Bailey heard. \nProsecutor Oliver Glasgow QC, said Mr Gomoh's death was part of a \"petty but fatal game of one-upmanship\" played out on the streets of London. \n\"This was a ride out into enemy territory and they were hunting for someone, anyone, to attack\".\nMr Gomoh, who worked at St Barts hospital, was walking from his home in Custom House, east London, to go to the local supermarket.\nHis girlfriend heard the killers ask Mr Gomoh where he was from, followed by sounds of a scuffle.\nCCTV cameras on a bus captured the moment a stolen car - a Dodge Caliber - stopped beside Mr Gomoh and he turned to run.\nThe killers were then driven away.\nDuring the investigation police found sketches by Ture, which revealed a \"picture-book story\" of the murder.\nThe drawings found in Ture's bedroom showed a number of young men carrying out a stabbing in the area of Mr Gomoh's murder and the clothing worn by the defendants that night - elements of which helped identify some of the other killers.\nPolice found DNA evidence on two pairs of sunglasses, one at the scene and another in the abandoned stolen car, linking the 17-year-old and Jalloh to the killing.\nJurors heard Jalloh had two convictions for carrying knives and that Ture had previously pleaded guilty to wounding with a knife.\nThe four defendants first attacked a separate man, who they chased with their weapons, but he got away, jurors heard. \nAll four defendants were found guilty of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent with regard to the earlier attack.\nDet Ch Insp Laurence Smith said; \"The four defendants set out that night ready and armed for savage violence.\n\"What they had not worked out was who their victim would be. \n\"They did not know David, they did not care who he was, or whether he was involved in a rival gang. \n\"He was simply a fair target in their petty game.\""

His injuries are not life threatening. \nAnother person was taken to Morriston Hospital in Swansea. \nSeven other passengers were assessed and discharged at the scene and nobody sustained any life-threatening or life-changing injuries, South Wales Police said.\nCheryl Hedges, from Mumbles, was on the top deck of the bus when it crashed. \nShe said: \"Suddenly, I heard screaming. There were about 14 of us on the open-top - about half were children.\"\n\"I looked across and the young lad across the aisle from me was trapped.\"\nMs Hedges said a bystander then got on the bus to help rescue those on the top deck. \n\"We got help to climb through this smashed window and we were able to get down the stairs,\" she said. \nShe said she had a black eye and cuts on her hands, but was discharged by paramedics at the scene. \nScaffolder Jonathan Powell, who was in front of the bus when it crashed, helped rescue people who were trapped before the emergency services arrived.\n\"As soon as I heard the bang I just turned around, seen the bus with its roof like that and I just run straight to it and just lifted the roof up for people to get out,\" said the 36-year-old from Merthyr Tydfil.\n\"Another gentleman got them through the gap while I held the roof up so everyone could get off.\"\nMr Powell, who was then trapped under the roof himself until the fire service arrived on the scene to free him, sent his best wishes to the 12-year-old boy who remains in hospital.\n\"I'm hoping that he gets better soon,\" he said. \nThe bus involved was one of First Cymru's \"Cymru Coasters\", operating between Swansea Bus Station and Bracelet Bay, near Mumbles Pier.\nJane Reakes-Davies, managing director at First Cymru, said: \"We are deeply saddened to hear of those who sustained injuries in yesterday's incident in Mumbles and wish them a speedy recovery. \n\"I'd like to thank our driver, customers and passers-by for their quick action and efforts in evacuating the bus and alerting the emergency services.\n\"The safety of our passengers and colleagues is our priority and we remain committed to the highest standards to ensure our customers can travel with confidence.\"\nFirst Cymru said it was working with emergency services and authorities to investigate the crash.\nSwansea council said there had been no previous problems on the route, but would not comment further while a police investigation was ongoing.\n\"Our thoughts continue to be with the passengers at this time,\" a spokesman added."

      "tags": "Child abuse,Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry,Fort Augustus,North Berwick",
      "text": "A Catholic boarding school in the Highlands was a \"haven for paedophiles\", a report from the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry has said.\nIt said that sexual abuse by monks at Fort Augustus Abbey, which closed in 1993, was a \"desecration of their vows\".\nThe report came after the inquiry heard evidence of physical, emotional and sexual abuse over many years.\nIt praised the BBC for bringing the issue into the public domain.\nIt was a BBC Scotland documentary in 2013 that first raised the issues of abuse perpetrated by Benedictine monks in Scotland. \nThe inquiry report said a number of the former pupils who provided evidence spoke positively about their involvement with the \"Sins of Our Fathers\" documentary by Mark Daly.\nIn June of this year, one former monk at the school - Fr Denis \"Chrysostom\" Alexander, who is now 85 - admitted two charges of lewd, indecent and libidinous practices against two boys between 1973 and 1976.\nAlexander, an Australian national, was first named as a paedophile by BBC Scotland in 2013.\nOne of his victims was Hugh Kennedy, now aged 58. He was in court and afterwards said his nightmare was \"now finally over.\"\nIf any of the men who first told the BBC of the horrors of Fort Augustus and Carlekemp needed any vindication, then this surely is it. \nAfter months of evidence, inquiry chairwoman Lady Smith has laid bare the evil carried out by monks who were supposed to be caring for young boys.\nWhat they did behind the ancient stone walls of this monastery is aptly described by Lady Smith as a \"desecration of their vows\" as holy men. \nThey beat, bullied, raped and emotionally tortured children as young as five. \nWhen producer Murdoch Rodgers and I started investigating this place in 2012 for our documentary Sins of our Fathers we could hardly believe what we were hearing. \nVictims were carefully selected and groomed. The monks would use increasing levels of violence against the boys until they were nearly helpless - then the sexual abuse would start, coming almost as a relief against the constant beatings.\nThe boys would sometimes tell their parents, even their headmaster what was going on. But their pleas would fall on deaf ears and often result in more abuse.\nOccasionally a monk would cross a line and need dealing with, but police were never called. The problem monk would just be shifted to another monastery or country, with no warnings given, sometimes to reoffend.\nSome have called into question the validity of inquiries such as Lady Smith's. Perhaps they should read her report.\nThe Benedictines have apologised, and some monks have been convicted in criminal courts. But this falls well short of repairing the lasting damage caused to countless children, some of whom did not live to see the publication of this report. \nThe brave men who brought this issue to the fore do not crave vindication; but they deserve our respect and sincere gratitude.    \nThe report also looked at Carlekemp Priory School in North Berwick, which was associated with Fort Augustus.\nLady Smith, who chairs the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry, said: \"Children were sexually abused at both schools. A number of monks were serial sexual predators and, because of the movement of monks between Fort Augustus and Carlekemp, they were able to target victims at both schools.\n\"Children were cruelly beaten by sadistic monks at both schools, and some beatings had sexual overtones. Children were humiliated and punished inappropriately and excessively.\n\"Some children complained to monks in positions of responsibility about being abused. They received either non-existent or inadequate responses.\"\nLady Smith said the children knew they would not be believed so refrained from complaining about abuse. \n\"Complaints made to devout Catholic parents were rejected because they would not accept it was possible that Catholic monks would abuse children,\" she said.\n\"The emotional scars caused by the trauma associated with sexual abuse, physical violence, and the denigration of children, were, for some, long-lasting and debilitating, blighting their adult lives.\"\nHearings in this part of the inquiry took place between 18 June 2019 and 1 October 2019, during which time it heard evidence from 43 witnesses. \nA representative for the English Benedictine Congregation told the inquiry the religious order offered an \"unreserved apology\" to everyone affected by the abuse.\nThe congregation said it accepted that children had been \"robbed\" of their childhoods and the schools had caused lasting damage\nLady Smith added: \"The monks were not trained to look after children on a residential basis. They lacked the capacity and ability to do so. The notion that untrained monks could care for school-aged children was seriously flawed.\"\nLady Smith will take these findings into account when she analyses all the evidence gathered by the inquiry and decides what recommendations to make in her final report.

      "tags": "Fertility,Coronavirus vaccines,Anti-vaccination movement,Fake News,Reality Check",
      "text": "False and misleading claims about Covid-19 vaccines, fertility and miscarriages are still circulating online, despite not being supported by evidence.\nDoctors are extremely cautious about what they recommend during pregnancy, so the original advice was to avoid the jab. \nBut now, so much safety data has become available that this advice has changed and the vaccine is now actively encouraged (as getting Covid itself can put a pregnancy at risk). \nWe have looked at some of the more persistent claims - and why they are wrong.\nThis theory comes from a misreading of a study submitted to the Japanese regulator.\nThe study involved giving rats a much higher dose of vaccine than that given to humans (1,333 times higher). \nOnly 0.1% of the total dose ended up in the animals' ovaries, 48 hours after injection. \nFar more - 53% after one hour and 25% after 48 hours - was found at the injection site (in humans, usually the arm). The next most common place was the liver (16% after 48 hours), which helps get rid of waste products from the blood. \nThe vaccine is delivered using a bubble of fat containing the virus's genetic material, which kick-starts the body's immune system.\nAnd those promoting this claim cherry-picked a figure which actually referred to the concentration of fat found in the ovaries.\nFat levels in the ovaries did increase in the 48 hours after the jab, as the vaccine contents moved from the injection site around the body. \nBut, crucially, there was no evidence it still contained the virus's genetic material.\nWe don't know what happened after 48 hours as that was the limit of the study. \nSome posts have highlighted miscarriages reported to vaccine-monitoring schemes, including the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Yellow Card scheme in the UK and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in the US. \nAnyone can report symptoms or health conditions they experience after being vaccinated. Not everyone will choose to report, so this is a self-selecting database.\nThere were indeed miscarriages reported in these databases - they are unfortunately common events - but this does not mean the jab caused them.   \nA study has found data showing the miscarriage rate among vaccinated people was in line with the rate expected in the general population - 12.5%.\nDr Victoria Male, a reproductive immunologist at Imperial College London, says these reporting systems are very good for spotting side-effects from the vaccine that are normally rare in the general population - that's how a specific type of blood clot was linked in some rare cases to the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nIf you suddenly start seeing unusual symptoms in vaccinated people, it raises a red flag. \nThey are not so good at monitoring side-effects that are common in the population - such as changes to periods, miscarriages and heart problems. Seeing them in the data doesn't necessarily raise these red flags because you'd expect to see them anyway, vaccine or not. \nIt's only if we start getting many more miscarriages than are seen in unvaccinated people that this data would prompt an investigation - and that's not been the case so far.\nSome people have also shared graphs showing a big rise in the overall number of people reporting their experiences to these schemes compared with previous years, for other vaccines and drugs. \nThis has been used to imply the Covid vaccine is less safe. But the rise can't tell us that, it can only tell us that lots of people are reporting - possibly because an unprecedented proportion of the population is being vaccinated and it is a much talked-about subject. \nA widely shared petition from Michael Yeadon, a scientific researcher who has made other misleading statements about Covid, claimed the coronavirus's spike protein contained within the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines was similar to a protein called syncytin-1, involved in forming the placenta. \nHe speculated that this might cause antibodies against the virus to attack a developing pregnancy, too.\nSome experts believe this was the origin of the whole belief that Covid vaccines might harm fertility. \nIn fact syncytin-1 and the coronavirus's spike protein are just about as similar as any two random proteins so there is no real reason to believe the body might confuse them. \nBut now evidence has been gathered to help disprove his theory. \nUS fertility doctor Randy Morris, who wanted to respond directly to the concerns he'd heard, began monitoring his patients who were undergoing IVF treatment to see whether vaccination made any difference to their chances of a successful pregnancy.\nOut of 143 people in Dr Morris's study, vaccinated, unvaccinated and previously infected women were about equally likely to have a successful embryo implantation and for the pregnancy to continue to term. The women were similar in most other respects.  \nThe study is small, but it adds to a large volume of other evidence - and were the claim true, you would expect that to show up even in a study of this size.\nDr Morris pointed out that people spreading these fears had not explained why they believed antibodies produced in response to the vaccine could harm fertility but the same antibodies from a natural infection would not.\nThe problem is, while scientists are rushing to provide evidence to reassure people, by the time they can report their findings people online have moved on to the next thing. \nAs Dr Morris explained: \"The hallmark of a conspiracy theory is as soon as it's disproven, you move the goalpost.\"\nFollow Rachel on Twitter"

      "tags": "Fast food,Companies,Deliveroo",
      "text": "Deliveroo has said demand for its services has strengthened despite Covid restrictions easing.\nThe food delivery firm saw orders double to 148.8 million in the first half of this year, while the value of its transactions also doubled.\nAt the same time, it narrowed its pre-tax losses to \u00a3104.8m, as against \u00a3128.4m a year earlier.\nIt was the first set of results from the company since it floated on the stock market in March.\nDeliveroo initially listed on the London stock exchange at 390p a share, but the price fell sharply on the opening day of trading, 31 March.\nOn Monday, its shares rallied on the news that German rival Delivery Hero had bought a 5% stake in the company worth \u00a3284m.\nBut in Wednesday trading, it was down 3.3% at 351p.\nCooped-up consumers flocked to order from Deliveroo during the earlier stages of the pandemic, when restaurants were closed and people switched to home deliveries.\nThe firm said it expected customer behaviour to moderate later in the year, but it remained \"excited about the opportunity ahead\".\nIt added that its outlook for the remainder of the year continued to be \"optimistic but prudent, combining confidence in continued year-on-year growth in orders with an expectation that average order values revert towards pre-pandemic levels\".\nDeliveroo said its gross transaction value for the six months was \u00a33.4bn, a 99% rise from the same period in 2020. \nIt repeated an earlier forecast that gross transaction value for the whole of 2021 would be 50% to 60% up on last year.\nFounder and chief executive Will Shu said: \"We are seeing strong growth and engagement across our marketplace as lockdowns continue to ease. \n\"Demand has been high amongst consumers. We have widened our consumer base, seen people continuing to order frequently and we now work with more food merchants than any other platform in the UK. \n\"At the same time, more riders are choosing to continue to work with the company because they value the work we offer.\"\nBy Rob Young, business correspondent\nFood delivery companies have been some of the standout winners of the pandemic. With people cooped up at home and dining in restaurants banned, a takeaway was for many the highlight of the lockdown week. Some analysts have questioned how much of that surge in business will persist as restaurants reopen. \nInterestingly, Deliveroo says orders are \"proving resilient\" since the re-emergence of the hospitality industry. But it doesn't expect that to remain the case forever. There are warnings that consumer behaviour \"may moderate\" later in the year and that the value (but not necessarily the number) of orders will return \"towards\" pre-pandemic levels. \nThe company has diversified, though - it now delivers groceries from the likes of Waitrose, Co-op and Aldi. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has described Deliveroo as a \"true British tech success story\". By many measures, it is. But it's not yet a financial success. \nDespite the huge increase in business over the past year, Deliveroo still didn't make a profit. Its losses were smaller than a year ago, but the company ended the first half \u00a3104.8m in the red. Investors - who were lukewarm on the company's shares when they started trading in March - may be wondering: if Deliveroo can't make a profit when eating in restaurants isn't allowed, when can it?\nDeliveroo said it now covered 72% of the UK population. This was ahead of its plans, which had envisaged 67% coverage by the end of this year.\nIn all, it operates in 11 countries, including Australia, Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait.\nHowever, it said it had now decided to pull out of Spain, because \"achieving a top-tier market position would require a disproportionate level of investment with highly uncertain long-term potential returns\".\nThe move comes after the Spanish government announced plans to give more employment rights to workers at food delivery firms and other online services.\n\"Deliveroo appears to be dominating the takeaway scene in many towns and cities, where its distinctive mint green-jacketed riders operate, despite Uber Eats and Just Eat rivals breathing down their neck,\" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\"But investors appeared to have lost a little appetite for shares in early trading, with the company expecting customer behaviour to moderate later in the year.\"\nShe added: \"There is speculation growing that Deliveroo could potentially be a target for takeover, given the rush of acquisitions in the British market.\""

      "text": "Almost 10 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 197 countries worldwide. \nHowever, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world.  \nSome countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population - but others are some way behind.\nWith an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. \nOverall, China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with about three billion and 1.6 billion respectively. The US is third, with more than 530 million.\nMany poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, together with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a Covid vaccine.\nCovax had planned to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of 2021, but downgraded its supply forecast as a the result of global export bans, production challenges and slow regulatory approval processes.\nThe scheme has now distributed more than one billion vaccines.\nThe vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech was the first approved by the WHO, followed by several others.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. \nUnlike Pfizer's jab - which has to be kept at an extremely cold temperature (-70C) - the Oxford vaccine can be stored in a normal fridge, which makes it easier to distribute.\nMost governments have started with doses for the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. After priority groups have been vaccinated, there is a wider rollout among younger age groups. \nThe Pfizer vaccine has been approved for 12 to 15-year-olds in the US, UK, Europe and other countries. The Sinovac vaccine is being used for children as young as three in China and Colombia.\nEarly studies suggest the newly identified Omicron variant of coronavirus is better able to evade vaccine protection than previous strains, though vaccination still offers strong protection against serious illness and hospitalisation. \nA third 'booster' dose of a vaccine does appear to offer protection against infection from Omicron and at least 96 countries have begun booster vaccination programmes.\nWorldwide, more than 100 possible vaccines are undergoing trials to test their efficacy and safety. \nOur World in Data, a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity, collated the information in the map and table above.\nPopulation figures have been sourced from the United Nations' mid-2021 estimates provided by Our World in Data."

for many, that has become a path into university.\nAs formal exams were cancelled for a second year due to the coronavirus pandemic, schools calculated the grades to be awarded to pupils.\nEducation Minister Michelle McIlveen praised young people's \"incredible resilience\", acknowledging the exceptional circumstances they had faced over the past year.\n\"Our young people have demonstrated a determination not to let this pandemic put their lives on hold,\" she said.\n\"They have been awarded qualifications which reflect their hard work and will enable them to move forward confidently with their future plans.\"\nThe vast majority of AS and A-level entries in Northern Ireland are made through the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) exams board.\nHowever, some pupils take some A-levels through English exam boards.\nThere had previously been a significant rise in the proportion of A-level entries to CCEA awarded top grades in 2020.\nIn 2020, after the change in how results were awarded, 14.5% of A-level entries through CCEA achieved the top A* grade compared with 8.9% in 2019.\nAccording to CCEA, that has risen to 15.8% of entries in 2021.\nAlmost 45% of A-level entries to CCEA in 2020 were awarded A* or A grades compared with 32.2% in 2019.\nThat has risen to 50.8% in 2021.\nAcross Northern Ireland, England and Wales as a whole almost 45% of A-levels entries received A* or A grades.\nPupils in Scotland take Highers and they also received results this morning and some students in Northern Ireland also receive their BTEC results.\nAlana Cahoon from Portadown, County Armagh, said she was \"so relieved and extremely grateful\" after receiving three Bs at A-level.\nThe 18-year-old, who is a member of youth-led charity Pure Mental NI, said it was important that fellow students remembered to take care of their mental health on results day.\n\"It's important not to compare yourself to other people, don't compare yourself to what you see on your Facebook feed and Instagram feeds, Ms Cahoon said. \n\"It's ok if you didn't get what you wanted, everyone has their own path.\"\nProf Paul Seawright, deputy vice-chancellor of Ulster University, told BBC News NI: \"We have over 5,000 places available across four campuses... more than we've ever had.\n\"If you meet the conditions of your offer the university is obliged to take you and we'll be delighted to welcome you.\"\nProfessor David Jones, pro-vice chancellor for education and students at Queens University Belfast, said: \"What we really want is to make sure that we can get as many people in as wish to come.\"\nHe said there were opportunities not only at Northern Ireland's universities but also by entering the further education sector and moving to university through that route.\nFurther education colleges in Northern Ireland estimate that at least 60% of those receiving BTecs go on to further study at college or university.\nBrian Doran, principal of Southern Regional College, said: \"Whatever happens with offers today, it is really important that students understand the many options they have to continue to further study, particularly with the amount of higher education routes available to them at the six further education colleges, through foundation degrees, Higher National Diplomas and Higher Level Apprenticeships.\n\"This year, colleges and universities are working closely together to make sure students are signposted towards these alternative routes.\"\nEllen Fearon, the president of the National Union of Students and Union of Students in Ireland (NUS-USI), said everyone receiving results should feel proud of themselves.\nShe said the government and the education sector had to make sure the necessary places were made available at universities and colleges to accommodate new students.\n\"Students have done their part and it's now on the sector to do theirs,\" she said.\nLimavady High School principal Darren Mornin said every pupils should be congratulated after what had been an incredibly difficult 18 months.\n\"There has obviously been that disruption to face-to-face teaching so they most definitely will have been worried,\" he said.\n\"The results that they are getting today - especially from a Limavady High School point of view - have all been fantastic and I am just so proud of them all.\"\nMeanwhile, at AS-level in Northern Ireland, almost three-quarters of entries (73.9%) received the top A or B grades.\nHowever, those AS results will not count towards a pupil's A-level grade in 2022.\nEvidence for samples of results calculated by schools has been checked by exam boards, including CCEA in Northern Ireland.\nA pupil can appeal their result if they are unhappy with it, with some appeals classed as \"priority\" if a pupil's place on a higher education course depends on a change to their results.\nPupils can appeal if they think an \"unreasonable academic judgement\" was made by their school but CCEA will only change a grade if they decide it does not match the evidence provided by the school.\nThe rise in results will inevitably spark a debate about grade inflation compared to years when pupils sit exams at the end of their course.\nBut the head of England's exam regulator Ofqual has said that grades are a fair reflection of the efforts pupils have made.\nSimon Lebus said teacher assessments give a \"much more accurate reflection\" of what students can achieve.\nPupils awaiting GCSE results will receive them on Thursday.\nCCEA will operate a results helpline from Tuesday until Friday 20 August on 028 9026 1220.\nFormal GCSE, AS and A-level exams are expected to take place again in the 2021-2022 school year."

Again staff are asked to be vigilant, but we do expect customers themselves to be responsible.\n\"We've put tremendous amount of effort into enhanced cleaning on trains and in stations.\n\"We think face coverings gives an extra level of reassurance about using public transport and we will be making sure timetable matches demand to avoid overcrowding.\"\nLast month the first minister announced there would be a review of social distancing rules on public transport following a row with cross-border rail operators.\nAt the time ScotRail said \"physical distancing can't be guaranteed\" in stations or on trains."

      "tags": "Khalifa Haftar,Libya crisis,Russia,Libya",
      "text": "A BBC investigation has revealed the scale of operations by a shadowy Russian mercenary group in Libya's civil war, which includes links to war crimes and the Russian military.\nA Samsung tablet left by a fighter for the Wagner group exposes its key role - as well as traceable fighter codenames. \nAnd the BBC has a \"shopping list\" for state-of-the-art military equipment which expert witnesses say could only have come from Russian army supplies.\nRussia denies any links to Wagner.\nThe group was first identified in 2014 when it was backing pro-Russian separatists in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Since then, it has been involved in regions including Syria, Mozambique, Sudan, and the Central African Republic. \nWagner's fighters appeared in Libya in April 2019 when they joined the forces of a rebel general, Khalifa Haftar, after he launched an attack on the UN-backed government in the capital, Tripoli. The conflict ended in a ceasefire in October 2020.\nThe group is notoriously secretive, but the BBC has managed to gain rare access to two former fighters. They revealed what type of person was joining Wagner - and its lack of any code of conduct.\nThere is little doubt that they kill prisoners - something one ex-fighter freely admits. \"No-one wants an extra mouth to feed.\"\nThis supports other parts of the TV documentary - Haftar's Russian Mercenaries: Inside the Wagner Group - by BBC News Arabic and BBC News Russian. Its other revelations include evidence of suspected war crimes, including the intentional killing of civilians.\nOne Libyan villager describes how he played dead as his relatives were killed. His testimony helped the BBC team identify a suspected killer.\nDescribing another possible war crime, a Libyan government soldier also recalls how a comrade, his friend, surrendered to Wagner fighters but was shot twice in the stomach. The soldier has not seen him since, nor three other friends taken away at the same time.\nThe Samsung computer tablet also provides evidence of the mercenaries' involvement in the mining and booby-trapping of civilian areas.\nPlacing landmines without marking them is a war crime.\nJust hours after the release of the BBC's report into Wagner's activities in Libya, the deputy public prosecutor at the Libyan Military Prosecutor's Office, Mohamed Gharouda, announced that an arrest warrant had been issued for the son of late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.\nAccording to the order, which was released internally last week, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi is wanted on charges of war crimes committed by the group during Gen Haftar's offensive against the capital Tripoli.\nHe was arrested during the 2011 uprising in Libya and later sentenced to death in absentia over violence against protesters. In 2017, however, he was released by the militia holding him.\nSaif al-Islam has long been suspected of having connections to Russia and the Wagner group, and is believed to be Moscow's favourite candidate to rule Libya. \nThe tablet was left behind by an unknown Wagner fighter after the group's fighters retreated from areas south of Tripoli in spring 2020. \nIts contents include maps in Russian of the frontline, giving confirmation of Wagner's significant presence and an unprecedented insight into the group's operations.  \nThere is drone footage and codenames of Wagner fighters, at least one of whom the BBC believes it has identified. The tablet is now in a secure location.\nA comprehensive list of weapons and military equipment is included in a 10-page document dated 19 January 2020, given to the BBC by a Libyan intelligence source and probably recovered from a Wagner location.\nThe document indicates who may be funding and backing the operation. It lists materiel needed for the \"completion of military objectives\" - including four tanks, hundreds of Kalashnikov rifles and a state-of-the-art radar system. \nA military analyst told the BBC that some of the weapons technology would only be available from the Russian military. Another expert, a specialist on the Wagner group, said the list pointed to the involvement of Dmitry Utkin. \nHe is the ex-Russian military intelligence man believed to have founded Wagner and given it its name (his own former call-sign). The BBC tried to contact Dmitry Utkin but has received no reply.\nAnd in our visual breakdown of the \"shopping list\" and another document, the expert says the words Evro Polis and General Director suggest the involvement of Yevgeny Prigozhin, a rich businessman close to President Vladimir Putin.\nThe US Treasury sanctioned Evro Polis in 2018, calling it a Russian company contracted to \"protect\" Syrian oil fields that were \"owned or controlled\" by Mr Prigozhin.\nInvestigations by Western journalists have linked Mr Prigozhin to Wagner. He has always denied any link to Evro Polis or Wagner.\nA spokesperson told the BBC that Yevgeny Prigozhin has nothing to do with Evro Polis or Wagner. Mr Prigozhin commented that he had not heard anything on the violation of human rights in Libya by Russians: \"I am sure that this is an absolute lie.\"\nRussia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the BBC it is doing \"its utmost to promote a ceasefire and a political settlement to the crisis in Libya.\"\nThe ministry added that details about Wagner in Libya are mostly based on \"rigged data\" and were aimed at \"discrediting Russia's policy\" in Libya. \nOfficially, it does not exist - but up to 10,000 people are believed to have taken at least one contract with Wagner since it emerged fighting alongside pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014.\nAbout 1,000 Wagner men are estimated to have fought with Gen Khalifa Haftar in Libya from 2019 to 2020.\nThe BBC in Russia asked one of the ex-fighters to describe Wagner. He replied: \"It is a structure, aimed at promoting the interests of the state beyond our country's borders.\"\nAs for its fighters, he said they were either \"professionals of war\", people looking for a job, or romantics looking to serve their country.\nThe other ex-fighter told the BBC there were no clear rules of conduct. If a captured prisoner had no knowledge to pass on, or could not work as a \"slave\", then \"the result is obvious\".\nAndrey Chuprygin, an expert working with the Russia International Council, said the stance of the Russian government was - \"let them join this thing, and we'll see what the result is. If it works out well, we can use it to our advantage. If it turns out badly, then we had nothing to do with it\".\nDownfall of Gaddafi in 2011: Col Muammar Gaddafi's more than four decades of rule end in an Arab Spring uprising.

      "tags": "Julian Assange",
      "text": "The United States has been given a boost in its bid to extradite Julian Assange, who is in prison in the UK.\nIn January, a court in London ruled he could not be extradited because of concerns over his mental health and the risk of suicide in the US.\nA judge has now ruled the US government can be given more grounds to appeal against that decision.\nUS prosecutors want to put the Wikileaks founder on trial for hacking and disclosing classified information.\nThat includes the identities of informants who were helping intelligence agencies in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere, in thousands of classified documents published in 2010 and 2011.\nMr Assange has previously said the case is politically motivated.\nIn January, District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled that while US prosecutors had met the tests for Mr Assange to be extradited for trial, the US was incapable of preventing him from attempting to take his own life.\nAt the High Court earlier, the US gave the UK some assurances about his extradition.\nIt said Mr Assange would not be placed in ADX Florence, a supermax prison in Colorado, before trial, nor would he be subject to the harshest prison conditions, known in US law as Special Administrative Measures, at any point.\nBoth of those were on the condition that they could be imposed if, after these assurances are offered, Mr Assange did something that warranted them. \nAnd the US said that, if he were convicted, he could serve his US sentence in Australia, where he is originally from.\nThe US was allowed to appeal against Judge Baraitser's decision on certain grounds, but Mr Assange's legal team described them as \"narrow\" and \"technical\".\nThe US government bid in the High Court earlier to expand the basis that can be used for its main appeal.\nLord Justice Holroyde said the full appeal would be heard at the High Court on 27 and 28 October.\nClair Dobbin QC, representing the US government, told the court that part of its appeal would focus on the requirement in law that, in order for a decision to be taken not to prosecute or extradite an individual, they must be \"so ill\" that they are unable to resist suicide.\n\"It really requires a mental illness of a type that the ability to resist suicide has been lost,\" she said.\n\"Part of the appeal will be that Mr Assange did not have a mental illness that came close to being of that nature and degree.\"\nMr Assange appeared via video-link , wearing a dark face covering and a white shirt, with what appeared to be an untied burgundy tie.\nOutside the Royal Courts of Justice, former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told Mr Assange's supporters that the US government should \"wind their necks in\" and allow him to go free.\nMr Corbyn said Mr Assange was a reporter \"in the tradition of fearless journalism\" who had highlighted \"a truth that was embarrassing to the US\".\nMr Assange's partner, Stella Moris, was among supporters gathered outside. Some held banners reading \"journalism is not a crime\" and \"no extradition\".\nA torn union flag with the words \"truth on trial\" was tied to the railings outside the court building.\nThe US has opposed releasing Mr Assange from Belmarsh Prison before the appeal is heard.\nIn 2019, he was jailed for 50 weeks for breaching bail conditions after going into hiding in the Ecuadorean embassy in London.\nAt the time he fled to the embassy, he had been facing extradition to Sweden on allegations of sexual assault, which he denied. That case was later dropped.\nHe sought refuge in the embassy for seven years from 2012 until he was arrested in April 2019.\nIf convicted in the US, Mr Assange faces a possible penalty of up to 175 years in jail, his lawyers have said. However the US government said the sentence was more likely to be between four and six years.\nMr Assange faces an 18-count indictment from the US government, accusing him of conspiring to hack into US military databases to acquire sensitive secret information relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, which was then published on the Wikileaks website.\nHe says the information exposed abuses by the US military.\nBut US prosecutors say the leaks of classified material endangered lives, and so the US sought his extradition from the UK.\nExtradition is the process under which one country can ask another to hand over a suspect to face trial."

      "text": "An Iranian asylum seeker cleared of people smuggling has said he was made a \"scapegoat\" by British authorities.  \nFouad Kakaei, who steered a dinghy across the English Channel, was found not guilty at a second trial after appealing against his first conviction.\nHis barrister believes a law intended to prosecute people smugglers is being used on asylum seekers, because they are \"easy targets\".\nThe Home Office said it had a new plan to \"fix the broken asylum system\".\nMore than 19,000 people have reached the UK in small boats since the start of 2020.\nLast year, 54 people were arrested for facilitating illegal entry into the UK across the Channel, according to figures obtained by BBC News.\nHowever, 33 of them were \"subsequently identified as asylum seekers\", with 18 of those going on to face prosecution, the Home Office revealed in a Freedom of Information request.\nMr Kakaei's lawyer Aneurin Brewer said he was concerned the government was \"taking easy targets\" by prosecuting people on the boats.\nMr Kakaei was jailed for two years and two months in January, but the conviction was overturned by the Court of Appeal.\nThe court found it could not be proven he intended to avoid detection and enter the UK illegally, as the dinghy was intercepted by Border Force and all those onboard claimed asylum. \nHe was found not guilty by a jury following a retrial at Canterbury Crown Court in May. \nMr Kakaei paid smugglers for transport into the UK and was put onto a boat, he said.\n\"The condition of the boat was not satisfactory and nobody was able to steer it. I could see everybody's life was in danger, to save myself and the lives of the rest... I started to take control of the boat.\n\"It was a matter of life and death.\"\nDuring his time in custody he said he realised that \"one way or the other they wanted to find me guilty... they wanted a scapegoat\".\nIt was the second crossing Mr Kakaei had made from France. He was deported to Denmark after the first occasion because he had already started an asylum application there, but said authorities rejected his claim.\nHe said he fled Iran because his \"life was in danger\", adding the past five years in Europe had been \"hell\". \nMr Brewer said it was not a crime to arrive in the UK and claim asylum.\nHe said the law used was \"designed to protect or defend vulnerable migrants\" like Mr Kakaei, not prosecute him.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) reviewed all similar cases after Mr Kakaei's successful appeal and subsequently scrapped 12 cases involving people accused of piloting small boats. Seven other cases are still active, it said. \nThe CPS published new guidance that recommends migrants should not be prosecuted in this way without strong evidence. \nHowever, the Nationality and Borders Bill, currently going through the House of Commons, will be tougher on migrants and smugglers.\nA Home Office spokesman said: \"We will welcome people through safe and legal routes whilst preventing abuse of the system, cracking down on illegal entry and the criminality associated with it.\"\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "text": "Facebook has removed hundreds of accounts which it says were involved in anti-vax disinformation campaigns operated from Russia.\nThe company said the network of accounts targeted India, Latin America and the US.\nThey attempted to recruit influencers to spread false claims to undermine public confidence in particular Covid-19 vaccines, it added.\nIn its latest report on \"coordinated inauthentic behaviour\", Facebook said it found links between the network and a botched disinformation campaign from influencer marketing agency Fazze - which is part of a Russian-based company called AdNow.\nLast month a BBC Trending investigation reported how in May this year influencers had been offered money by Fazze to spread false claims about the risks associated with the Pfizer vaccine.\nAccording to Facebook, that was the second wave of attempts by the network to smear Western vaccines. \nTheir investigation found that from November 2020 the same network attempted to falsely paint the AstraZeneca vaccine as dangerous because it uses a harmless adenovirus taken from chimpanzees. \nPosts from accounts in the network spread memes that used images from the Planet of Apes films to give the impression the vaccine would turn people into monkeys.\nThese posts appeared on Facebook in Hindi around the same time the Indian government was discussing emergency authorisation for the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThe campaign used fake accounts, some of which Facebook says probably originated from account farms in Bangladesh and Pakistan.\nFacebook said it had removed 65 Facebook accounts and 243 Instagram accounts for violating their policy against foreign interference.\nBen Nimmo, Facebook's threat intelligence lead, described the campaign as \"a disinformation laundromat\" which planted content on a few online forums and then amplified that content on other platforms.\nThe operation spanned over a dozen platforms. Misleading posts appeared on Reddit and Medium, and petitions appeared on change.org expressing concern about the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nAccording to Facebook's report, these links were then shared by a handful of influencers on Instagram who used the same hashtags and made references to the fact that the AstraZeneca vaccine was derived from chimpanzee adenovirus.\nBoth waves of the campaign were unsuccessful and failed to gain much traction - despite the diverse methods used.\n\"In addition to the previously-exposed efforts to enlist social media influencers, this operation appears to have used a whole range of tactics in a wider effort to seed misleading narratives online about Western-made Covid vaccines,\" said Jack Stubbs, Director of Investigations at social media analytics firm Graphika.\n\"There was a claimed hack-and-leak, the use of pay-to-publish pseudo-news sites, and a network of fake personas on Facebook and Instagram.\"\nDespite the best efforts of the campaign, Facebook's report observed sloppy practices, including mixing languages - such as posting Hindi language memes accompanied by hashtags in Portuguese.\nBBC Trending's investigation showed Fazze was part of a Russian company, AdNow. The BBC made repeated attempts to obtain a comment from AdNow's headquarters in Moscow, but received no response. However, a director of AdNow's British arm told the BBC that Fazze was being shut down.  \nIn response to accusations by a German politician that discrediting Western vaccines was in the interests of the Kremlin, the Russian Embassy in the UK said: \"We treat Covid-19 as a global threat and, thus, are not interested in undermining global efforts in the fight against it, with vaccinating people with the Pfizer vaccine as one of the ways to cope with the virus.\"\nThe BBC has again attempted to contact Fazze for comment but the emails sent to Fazze addresses still bounce back from AdNow's domain.\nFacebook says Fazze is now banned from their platform.\nListen to BBC Trending: The anti-vax influencer plot that flopped on the World Service.

      "text": "The Italian island of Sicily may have registered the hottest temperature ever recorded in Europe - 48.8C (119.8F).\nRegional authorities reported the reading, which needs to be verified by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), near Syracuse on Wednesday. \nAccording to the WMO, the current official record in Europe is 48C, registered in Athens, Greece, in 1977.\nThe latest heatwave in Italy is being caused by an anticyclone - nicknamed Lucifer - moving up from Africa.\nAnticyclones are areas of high atmospheric pressure where the air is sinking.\nLucifer is forecast to head north across mainland Italy, further raising temperatures in cities including the capital, Rome. \nItaly's health ministry has issued \"red\" alerts for extreme heat in several regions and the number of cities that face the highest health risk is expected to rise from eight to 15 by Friday. \nThe Mediterranean heatwave, which has seen some countries record their highest temperatures in decades, has led to the spread of wildfires across southern Italy, with Sicily, Calabria and Puglia the worst-hit regions.\nItalian firefighters on Wednesday said they had been involved in more than 300 operations in Sicily and Calabria over a 12-hour period, battling through the night to control blazes burning thousands of acres of land.\nThree fire-related deaths - two in Calabria and one in Sicily - have been reported by Italian media.\nSeparately, wildfires are continuing across Greece, fuelled by strong winds and parched vegetation. Foreign teams are helping to tackle blazes in what Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has described as a \"nightmarish summer\". \nClimate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. \nOn Monday the UN released a major report saying human activity was making extreme weather events more common."

      "text": "Sky News Australia has removed dozens of videos from its websites, after YouTube suspended the channel for spreading Covid misinformation.\nThe conservative TV network, owned by Rupert Murdoch, has been criticised for promoting conspiracies and questioning public health orders in its broadcasts.\nIn recent days it has taken down about 30 videos without explanation or making corrections.\nSky News Australia has declined to comment.\nBut its parent company, News Corp Australia, told local media the network had taken an \"editorial decision\" to remove the videos.\nFormer Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd was among the first to accuse the channel last week of \"quietly scrubbing incriminating Covid-19 misinformation videos\" from its platforms.\nThe videos had showed network hosts including Alan Jones, Andrew Bolt and Rowan Dean expressing views that have been rejected by global medical authorities.\nOne video showed Mr Jones questioning the legitimacy of the pandemic, erroneously claiming it wasn't worse than the \"common cold\". \nAnother promoted an interview with a pathologist spreading misinformation that Covid was a hoax.\nAccording to Guardian Australia, most of the removed videos talked up the drugs ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.\nBoth drugs have gained attention after being promoted by figures including former US president Donald Trump. But medical authorities, including the WHO, say the evidence for their effectiveness against Covid remains unproven.\nMr Rudd and other critics have described Sky News Australia's broadcasts as dangerous and irresponsible.\nIt comes as millions of Australians remain in lockdown to prevent the spread of Delta outbreaks in Sydney and Melbourne.\nFewer than a quarter of Australians are vaccinated. Frustration over restrictions has also led to several large anti-lockdown protests.\nSky News Australia executives are due to face a parliamentary inquiry on Friday, after YouTube on 1 August penalised the channel's Covid coverage.\nThe network accused the tech giant of censorship, but lawmakers said the platform's decision reflected wider concerns. \nGreens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who is leading the inquiry, questioned why broadcast regulators had not acted first.\nMr Rudd, a noted critic of Mr Murdoch's media outlets, has also written to Australian Communications and Media Authority to demand scrutiny.\n\"While it is unrealistic to believe that we can ever stamp out misinformation\u2026 it is especially alarming that so much of this content has been crafted and distributed by the country's largest media company, News Corporation, principally through Murdoch's Sky News,\" he said.\nSky News Australia has a small TV viewership locally, but a big presence online with a significant global following.\nThe station has said its uploads drew more than 22 million viewers a month."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK is moving \"cautiously\" down the age groups as it decides how many under-18s should get a Covid vaccine - because of a \"delicate balance\" between benefits and risks, a scientist says.\nProf Adam Finn said the advice to invite 16 and 17-year-olds for their jab came after a small number of serious cases in this age group.\nHe said scientists want to learn more about any side effects of the jab.\nIt comes as more than 75% of UK adults have now had both jabs.\nProf Finn, who sits on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) which advises the government, told BBC Breakfast: \"Most young people who get this virus get it mildly or even without any symptoms at all.\n\"But we are seeing cases in hospital even into this age group - we've had a couple of 17-year-olds here in Bristol admitted and needing intensive care over the course of the last four to six weeks - and so we are beginning to see a small number of serious cases.\n\"What we know for sure is that these vaccines are very effective at preventing those kind of serious cases from occurring.\"\nAt the moment, 16 and 17-year-olds are only being invited to come forward for an initial dose and, unlike older age groups, no second dose is being scheduled.\nProf Finn said UK experts were \"cautious\" about the nature and timeline for second doses as they wanted to \"learn more about rare side effects\" such as reports of myocarditis - inflammation of the heart muscle - among some young people in the US and Israel. The risk of these incidents has been higher after second doses.\n\"So we're going cautiously down through the ages and we're using the vaccine where it's safe and effective and where the benefits are clear,\" he added.He said the JCVI would advise \"when and what\" the second dose for 16 and 17-year-olds would be after assessing more data. \nProf Finn said that even though 16-year-olds do not need parental consent to get the vaccine, in practice most are guided by parents, whom he hoped would advise their children to accept the vaccine when invited.\nNHS England said nearly 16,000 16 and 17-year-olds had already received their vaccine over the weekend. According to the ONS, there are 1.4 million people of that age in the UK.\nMeanwhile Prof Danny Altmann of  Imperial College London said vaccinating under-18s was \"a good thing\".\nHe told Times Radio that the more unvaccinated people there are in the nation, the more lungs there are \"for virus to percolate in\". \nHe added: \"Therefore it's got to be a good thing to be vaccinating more children down through the age range.\n\"From a medical scientific point of view, I'd say there's nothing special about the virus in their lungs that can't transmit through to their families, through to their schoolteachers, through to their colleagues.\"\nProf Finn also said a third or booster Covid jab is likely to be necessary for people with weak immune systems but it was still unclear whether it would be needed for all over-50s.\nHe said: \"I think it's becoming quite clear that there are a small group of people whose immune responses to the first two doses are likely to be inadequate - people who've got immunosuppression of one kind or another, perhaps because they've got immunodeficiency or they've been receiving treatment for cancer or bone marrow transplants or organ transplants, that kind of thing.\n\"I think it's quite likely we'll be advising on a third dose for some of those groups.\"\nBut Prof Finn said a broader booster rollout remained \"uncertain\" and that experts needed to \"review evidence as to whether people who receive vaccines early on in the programme are in any serious risk of getting serious disease and whether the protection they've got from those first two doses is still strong\".\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid has said that he expects booster jabs to start being rolled out from \"early September\". \nBut the head of the Oxford vaccine group, Prof Sir Andrew Pollard has said doses needed to \"go where they can have the greatest impact\" - to protect unvaccinated people abroad.\nIt comes as the government announced that more than 75% of UK adults are now fully vaccinated, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson describing the milestone as a \"huge national achievement\"."
