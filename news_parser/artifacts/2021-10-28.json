      "text": "The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall have launched the centenary Royal British Legion poppy appeal.\nPrince Charles and Camilla met 10 volunteers for the charity - each born in one of the decades of its campaign - at Clarence House on Tuesday.\nIt marked the start of the annual drive to raise funds for the Legion.\nThe pandemic meant the collectors did not go out to sell red paper poppies in 2020, but the tradition is resuming ahead of Armistice Day on 11 November.\nThe Royal British Legion supports serving and former personnel and their families. More than 40,000 volunteers across the country will be collecting donations for this year's appeal.\nWearing a red poppy signifies respect and support for the armed forces community and their sacrifice in all conflicts.\nThe flower was a common sight on the Western Front, where British soldiers fought during World War One, and became a symbol of remembrance for those killed.\nThe Prince of Wales said: \"The significance of the poppy is as relevant today as it ever was while our Armed Forces continue to be engaged in operations overseas and often in the most demanding of circumstances.\n\"The simple act of wearing a poppy is only made possible because of volunteer Poppy Appeal collectors who share a common goal - to recognise the unique contribution of the Armed Forces community.\"\nThe Prince of Wales and Camilla spoke to Jill Gladwell, 95, who is marking 80 years of collecting for the appeal, at the launch.\nMrs Gladwell began volunteering as a schoolgirl during the Second World War after being inspired by her mother who collected in the 1920s. Five generations of her family are now involved.\n\"I'm so happy to be back out collecting to support the armed forces community and their families this year,\" she said."

It sat on my desk for two or three days until I used a diamond tester machine.\n\"We then sent it off to our partners in London before it was certified by experts in Antwerp, Belgium, who confirmed it is 34 carat.\"\nThe carat measurement relates to the weight of the stone, whereby heavier stones have a higher carat and higher value.\nMr Lane said the stone's owner, who wanted to remain anonymous, could not recall where or when she acquired it.\n\"She's always visited car boot sales and bought trinkets, but never once did she think it was a real diamond.\n\"She told us she'd been having a clearout and that it nearly went in the bin before her neighbour suggested bringing her items to us to get valued.\"\nMr Lane, who has run the business for five years after buying it from its previous owners, added it was by far the largest-value item he had dealt with.\n\"The colour, the clarity, the size... to find a 34-carat diamond is off the scale.\"\nThe diamond is being kept under lock and key at London's Hatton Garden jewellery quarter until it comes up for auction on 30 November.\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "tags": "Antarctic,Arctic,British Antarctic Survey,COP26,Climate change,Liverpool,Greenwich,David Attenborough",
      "text": "The UK's new polar research ship, the RRS Sir David Attenborough, has completed basic sea trials and is ready to undertake its first expedition.\nThe vessel came up the Thames on Wednesday through the Woolwich Barrier and is now tied up in Greenwich.\nIt is spending a few days at the home of the Prime Meridian to enable the public to see it, but also to mark the start of the COP26 climate conference.\nWorld governments meet in the Scottish city of Glasgow from Sunday.\nThe Attenborough, named after the TV naturalist and BBC presenter Sir David, is the ship the public wanted to call \"Boaty McBoatface\" in an online poll but were overruled by ministers. \nInternational senior scientific advisers are using the Attenborough as a platform to issue a statement about the urgent need to address the climate crisis.\nThey want to see a concerted drive to develop - and use - the technologies that will keep global temperature rise to1.5C and underpin the net zero economies of tomorrow.\nThese technologies include better ways of creating, storing and using low-emissions energy - including improving semiconductors, batteries and low-emitting fuel production - as well as work on heating and cooling, and carbon capture and storage.\n\"I think the first thing to say is sticking to 1.5 is both important and achievable,\" Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, told BBC News.  \n\"But it's only achievable if we get urgent action. If you work back, for example, from 2050, and ask what you need to do, you can't rely on something coming along late in the day and saving us. It's about utilising the technologies we have now, getting them in place as soon as we can at scale. And that in itself requires R&D (research and development), and making sure that we use both technology, and, of course, natural actions, and the behavioural changes that we all need to take.\"  \nThe 129m-long Attenborough has spent the past year in shake-down trials around the British coast.\nIts first ocean voyage will go to Antarctica for the new austral summer research season.\nThe vessel must deliver supplies to the UK's main scientific base, at Rothera, on the continent's peninsula, as well as to other minor stations dotted around the Southern Ocean.\nIt is expected to head south on or around 18 November.\nEngineers will want to check its performance in sea-ice, something they haven't had the chance to do.\nThe Attenborough is what's termed a Polar Class 4 icebreaker, which means it should have the strength to crash through metre-thick floes at a steady pace and without damage to its hull.\nThe \u00a3200m ship is state of the art. It has a helipad (helicopters are essential for exploration and safety), cranes and onboard labs, and it has an enhanced ability to deploy subs and other ocean-survey and sampling equipment.\nThe Attenborough was the product of lessons learned after decades of operations in the frozen south and north, said Dr Rob Larter.\n\"The way science has progressed means you now have to be able to handle much bigger gear. So, that's why this ship has these very big cranes and gantries,\" the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) marine geophysicist told BBC News.\n\"You also need to be very flexible, because there's so many different sorts of science that people want to do now. We have laboratories that come in containers, like for example a radioisotope lab, an ultra-clean chemistry lab and an experimental aquarium. These can all be added to the ship.\" \nThe Attenborough will be at the forefront of understanding how Earth's atmosphere and oceans are warming, and the impacts the temperature rise will have, in particular, on the ice-covered waters and lands of the Arctic and Antarctic.\nSir David was present on Thursday to inspect his namesake.\nHis hope, he said, was that world leaders meeting at COP26 would listen to the science and take action to curb global warming. \n\"I am indeed a very proud man to be standing in this remarkable vessel, to be associated in any way with best, the British Antarctic Survey,\" he told his audience.\n\"May I wish this ship and all who sail in her, and all the scientists who research on board, bon voyage on her forthcoming voyage to the Antarctic. I know that the findings made on this ship in the next few years will be of the greatest value and importance to the welfare of the world. Let us listen to the science.\"\nBAS scientists have already established, for example, how the Southern Ocean, which surrounds Antarctica, actually helps to shield us from the worst effects of global heating. \nOceanographer Dr Emma Boland explained: \"The Southern Ocean takes up about 40% of the carbon dioxide that the oceans as a whole take up, even though it only accounts for 20% of the total ocean surface area. So, it's doing double the work. \n\"And if that CO2 didn't get taken up by the ocean, it'd be in the atmosphere, and global warming at the surface as we experience it, as human beings, would be that much worse.\"\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nScientists have even calculated a value for this \"service\" provided by the Southern Ocean: \u00a360bn per year (\u20ac72bn/yr). In other words, if the Southern Ocean didn't exist, this is how much it would cost to remove the CO2 from the atmosphere in a different way.\nThe new Royal Research Ship is tied up to a pontoon in the Thames a short distance from the famous 19th-Century tea clipper, the Cutty Sark.\nThe public won't be able to board the Attenborough, but they will be able to visit an associated exhibition hosted by the Royal Museums Greenwich called \"Ice Worlds\". This will showcase live virtual tours of the polar ship on a big screen, alongside a range of interactive stands."

      "text": "On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil his Budget.\nHe'll say how much of our money the government will take in taxes, and what they will spend it on.\nEach year, the chancellor of the exchequer - who is in charge of the government's finances - makes a Budget statement to MPs in the House of Commons. \nIt outlines the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. It also includes big decisions on what the government will spend money on - including health, schools, police and other public services.\nThe Budget speech will be delivered on Wednesday 27 October.\nIt usually starts at about 12:30 UK time and lasts about an hour. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will give his response straight afterwards. \nThis year's Autumn Budget is unusual for two reasons: \nAfter the speech, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which monitors government spending - will publish a report on how the economy is doing.\nThe Budget is likely to include help to support businesses and individuals recover from the economic effects of Covid.\nA number of measures have been announced in advance of the Budget, including a rise in the minimum wage from \u00a38.91 per hour to \u00a39.50 and an end to the public sector pay freeze.\nThe chancellor will likely set out some more details of the government's long term ambitions:\nBudget 2021: What has already been announced?\nMeasures such as the furlough scheme - which finished at the end of September - were expensive, and government income is down because it collected less money in tax during the pandemic.\nTo close the gap between higher spending and less money, the government has had to borrow more. \nIn the year ending April 2021, the government borrowed \u00a3320bn - the highest figure seen outside wartime. \nEconomists expect it to borrow around \u00a3180bn more this year, another enormous sum. \nDuring his Budget speech, the Chancellor will set out the latest borrowing forecasts for the years ahead.\nThe government needs to cut the gap between what it spends and what it raises.\nOne major tax rise was announced in September - the \u00a312bn Health and Social Care Levy. This broke a promise the Conservatives made at the last election, not to raise the three biggest taxes - income tax, national insurance and VAT.\nThere has been speculation that graduates may be asked to start paying back student loans earlier.\nAt the same time, the cost of living is rising. So the chancellor may want to cut some taxes, such as the amount of VAT pay on energy bills.\nHe is also expected to announce major changes to the complicated alcohol tax system, which could see sparkling wine become cheaper. \nOverall government spending will rise next year, with big increases already announced for health and schools in England.\nThe government has already said that the NHS in England will receive an extra \u00a35.9bn to help clear the record backlog of people waiting for tests and scans.\nBut other government departments, such as courts, prisons, local government and transport, are braced for cuts to their day-to-day budgets next year. \nThey have already faced a decade of tight spending, and making further cuts will be painful.\nSome parts of the Budget, such as defence spending, affect the whole of the UK. \nOthers, such as education, only affect England. This is because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions.\nScotland has income tax-raising powers, which means its rates differ from the rest of the UK. The Scottish government will publish its Budget on 9 December.\nIf the government announces extra spending on areas that only affect England, the other nations get an equivalent extra sum of money to spend as they choose, according to a rule called the Barnett formula. \nAre you affected by issues covered in this story?

      "text": "The husband of the detained British-Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has said he will continue his hunger strike outside Whitehall after meeting Foreign Secretary Liz Truss.\nRichard Ratcliffe, who began his hunger strike on Sunday, said ministers continued to be \"too timid\" in efforts to bring his wife home from Iran. \nHe was joined at the meeting by his MP Tulip Siddiq.\nThe Foreign Office said it would \"continue to press Iran\" on the case.\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a 43-year-old mother-of-one from Hampstead, in north London, has been detained in Iran since 2016 on spying charges and has not seen the couple's young daughter, Gabriella, for two years.\nShe has been serving the second of two prison sentences, this one on parole for a conviction of propaganda against the Iranian regime. \nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has always denied any wrongdoing, is staying with her mother in Iran - but is not allowed to leave the country.\nBut she faces a return to prison, after losing an appeal against the most recent sentence. Mr Ratcliffe said it was only a matter of time before his wife would be summoned back to jail.\nMr Ratcliffe took a painted stone to the one-hour meeting on Thursday to remind Ms Truss of the government's continued pledge to not leave any stone unturned in their attempts to bring his wife home.\nSpeaking after the meeting, he told the BBC he was \"disappointed\" the government had failed to offer any assurances about securing her release. \n\"My criticism of the British government is they've not prioritised the safety of British citizens in the course of their nuclear negotiations, in the course of their discussions with Iran and other stuff's been more important,\" he said.\"And actually nothing is more important for the government than protecting its own citizens.\"\nTwo tents have been pitched off Whitehall in London, near the Foreign Office and Downing Street, with signs reading \"Free Nazanin\" along with flowers and a collection of small coloured rocks.\nMr Ratcliffe carried out a 15-day hunger strike outside the Iranian embassy in London in 2019.\nOn Monday, Labour MP Ms Siddiq told the House of Commons that Mr Ratcliffe's hunger strike was a plea to Ms Truss and Prime Minister Boris Johnson to \"do more to challenge Iran's hostage-taking and to bring Nazanin home\".\nThe Foreign Office said: \"Iran's decision to proceed with these baseless charges against Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is an appalling continuation of the cruel ordeal she is going through. \n\"Instead of threatening to return Nazanin to prison Iran must release her permanently so she can return home.\"\nIt added it would do \"all we can\" to help Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe return home and would continue to press Iran."

      "text": "Almost 10 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 197 countries worldwide. \nHowever, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world.  \nSome countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population - but others are some way behind.\nWith an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. \nOverall, China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with about three billion and 1.6 billion respectively. The US is third, with more than 530 million.\nMany poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, together with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a Covid vaccine.\nCovax had planned to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of 2021, but downgraded its supply forecast as a the result of global export bans, production challenges and slow regulatory approval processes.\nThe scheme has now distributed more than one billion vaccines.\nThe vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech was the first approved by the WHO, followed by several others.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. \nUnlike Pfizer's jab - which has to be kept at an extremely cold temperature (-70C) - the Oxford vaccine can be stored in a normal fridge, which makes it easier to distribute.\nMost governments have started with doses for the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. After priority groups have been vaccinated, there is a wider rollout among younger age groups. \nThe Pfizer vaccine has been approved for 12 to 15-year-olds in the US, UK, Europe and other countries. The Sinovac vaccine is being used for children as young as three in China and Colombia.\nEarly studies suggest the newly identified Omicron variant of coronavirus is better able to evade vaccine protection than previous strains, though vaccination still offers strong protection against serious illness and hospitalisation. \nA third 'booster' dose of a vaccine does appear to offer protection against infection from Omicron and at least 96 countries have begun booster vaccination programmes.\nWorldwide, more than 100 possible vaccines are undergoing trials to test their efficacy and safety. \nOur World in Data, a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity, collated the information in the map and table above.\nPopulation figures have been sourced from the United Nations' mid-2021 estimates provided by Our World in Data."

      "tags": "Economics,UK economy,Budget 2021,Institute for Fiscal Studies",
      "text": "Millions of people are set to be worse off next year amid spiralling costs and tax rises, says an economic think tank.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that inflation and higher taxes on incomes would negate small wage increases for middle earners.\nLow-income households will also feel \"real pain\" as the cost of living is set to increase faster than benefit payments, it said.\nThe chancellor acknowledged in his Budget that families are under strain.\nPaul Johnson, director of the IFS, said that \"millions will be worse off in the short term\" as a result of soaring costs.\nOn Wednesday, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned that the cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years.\nIts latest forecast predicted that inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% in 2022. \nThe chancellor said it was because of increased demand for energy and supply chain issues as economies and factories recover from coronavirus curbs.\nBut the OBR pointed that supply constraints had been exacerbated by Brexit. \nIt added that once rising prices and rising taxes are taken into account, average household incomes are set to fall next year and won't recover before 2023. \nIn its analysis of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's second Budget of 2021, the IFS described the chancellor's delivery as \"upbeat\".\nBut Mr Johnson added: \"Unfortunately for him, and for us, the outlook for living standards does not match this upbeat tone.\"\nOver the next few years, increases to income tax and national insurance, paired with rising household bills, \"will mean very slow growth in living standards\", he said.\nNew IFS analysis suggests that over the next year, middle earners on about \u00a325,000 will find their pre-tax pay just about outpaces price rises. \nBut once extra income taxes are due, their take-home pay will fall by about 1%, or \u00a3180 per year, after accounting for inflation.\nThat comes after an already tough decade for households, the IFS said. Had average earnings kept pace with trends seen before the financial crisis in 2008, they would have been 40% higher, its research found.\nMr Sunak defended his Budget, telling BBC Breakfast that it had \"cut taxes for millions of the lowest-paid\".\nOn Wednesday, the chancellor announced that the universal credit \"taper\" rate would be cut by 8% no later than 1 December, so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every \u00a31 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p.\nThe National Living Wage will also increase next year by 6.6%, to \u00a39.50 an hour.\nMr Sunak added that it was his job to be concerned about inflation and his new fiscal rules were \"how we build up resilience\".\nBut Paul Johnson said that price rises meant that \"real pain\" would now be felt, as low-income households, which it describes as those working full-time and earning the National Living Wage, wait for their incomes to catch up.\n\"For some in work, that may never happen,\" he said.\nAfter the political theatre of Budget Day, experts spend the following night and day backstage working out the impact on your household finances.\nThe answer to that question, as always, depends on your stage and circumstances in life.\nIf you are low-paid and in work, then the Budget had some comforting news for you - such as the minimum wage rises and universal credit changes - although that won't happen immediately.\nIn contrast, middle-earners and those out of work are facing a more worrying squeeze. Pensioners, concerned about hefty rises in bills to heat their homes, are feeling a bit forgotten.\nFor everyone, the next act is all about the cost of living. If prices rise at the top end of forecasts, then millions of people's financial situation could become quite a drama. \nSetting out his Budget on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said it marked a \"new age of optimism\", announcing across-the-board spending increases for government departments.\nBut the fiscal event has also taken the UK's current tax burden to the highest level seen since the 1950s. \nMr Sunak described \"corrective action\" as necessary in order to pay back huge sums of money, borrowed during the pandemic to fund support programmes such as the furlough scheme.\nBut Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What he's done is use the pandemic as cover for what I think was probably necessary - a big increase in NHS spending, being funded by this increase in National Insurance contributions, and undoing some of the very big cuts we've seen to the justice, further education and school system over the last decade.\"\nHe pointed to the fact that the OBR has also reduced its estimate of the long-term \"scarring\" effect of Covid-19 on the economy from 3% to 2%.\nHe suggested that the chancellor might hope to undo some tax rises in the future.\nMr Johnson also described the stagnation in living standards as \"a very important political point\" in a later interview with the BBC.\n\"If we're not getting better off over time, we're not going to feel so happy with the status quo,\" he said.\nA spokesperson for the Treasury said that the government is \"taking targeted action worth more than \u00a34.2 billion a year to help families with the cost of living\".\nThey described the decision to raise taxes as \"difficult\", but said that households would benefit from further investment in public services.\nThey said government decisions such as freezes to alcohol and fuel duty and the warm home discount \"have been worth nearly \u00a3500 per year extra to households on average, and more than \u00a31,000 for the poorest households\"."

      "text": "The chancellor will increase science spending to \u00a320bn a year by 2024 - \u00a32bn less than he pledged in 2020.\nThe boost was announced in the Budget by Rishi Sunak on Wednesday.\nThere is some disappointment among many scientific leaders - but the commitment to sustained additional investment has been welcomed by some.\nThe President of the UK's Royal Society, Prof Sir Adrian Smith, told BBC news that the settlement sent out a positive signal.\n\"It is not absolutely ideal. But we are grown-ups. There are real pressures on the economy, but the government is saying that it really does recognise that R&D [research and development] is absolutely vital,\" he said.\nAlthough the chancellor's increase is less many had hoped for, it is more than some had feared. Last week, those negotiating with the Treasury told BBC News they were getting clear signals that the commitment to increase spending to \u00a322bn a year would be kicked into the long grass. \nScientific and business leaders lobbied hard, arguing that a long deferral of scientific investment would mean that other countries, which are investing more in research, would overtake the UK.\nThose sources say that the Mr Sunak seems to have listened to those arguments. The chancellor said that the commitment of \u00a322bn would be pushed back by two years to 2026. But that will be after the next General Election, when someone else might have Mr Sunak's job - and take a different view. \nBut the Chancellor has promised to deliver what has been described as a sizeable increase of around \u00a35bn before the end of this Parliament. That's a 33% increase on top of the current research budget of \u00a315bn a year. What is notable is that the bulk of the increase will come in 2023, so a large amount of the additional funding for science is not that far away. \nSome \u00a32bn of that increase is for membership of the EU's collaborative research programme, Horizon Europe. BBC News reported earlier this week that the UK's access to the programme was being used as a bargaining chip in wider negotiations with the EU over the status of Northern Ireland.\nNow that the money has been allocated to the science budget, research leaders have a clear choice between spending it on membership fees or on doing more science. The Treasury itself is understood to feel that spending money on Horizon Europe is an inefficient use of funds but will leave the decision to the scientific community.\nSir Jeremy Farrar, who is director of the Wellcome Trust, believes that, given the financial pressures the chancellor faces, this is not a bad settlement.\n\"We welcome the government's ongoing commitment to making the UK a science superpower. But it will need to continue to increase investment in science to catch up with other leading science nations. The UK's investment in R&D as a proportion of GDP lags behind the OECD average, and it will take time to change that,\" he said.\nScientific and business leaders say that the most important aspect of the science settlement is that they now have a firm timetable and an upward trajectory for science spending. According to the president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, Prof Sir Jim McDonald, that sends out a clear message to the private sector thinking of investing in research and to overseas scientists and businesses thinking of coming to Britain. \n\"The comprehensive package of investment for R&D announced today gives much needed confidence to businesses that the UK is a great place to invest. The measures outlined by the chancellor today will stimulate innovation for a better, faster and more resilient recovery.\"\nFollow Pallab on Twitter."

      "text": "The cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, the government's forecaster has warned.\nIts latest forecast says inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% in 2022.\nHowever, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says figures released since its report was compiled suggest inflation could hit almost 5%.\nThe chancellor acknowledged that household budgets are strained.\nRishi Sunak described the overall economic picture as \"strong\" in the short term, with the OBR now expecting the economy to return to its pre-pandemic level six months earlier than it had forecast previously.\nHowever, he acknowledged the inflation rate was \"likely to rise further\" from its 3.1% rate in September.\nHe said it was due to increased demand for energy and supply chain issues as economies and factories reopening following coronavirus lockdowns.\n\"The pressures caused by supply chains and energy prices will take months to ease,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\"It would be irresponsible for anyone to pretend that we can solve this overnight.\"\nThe UK's exit from the European Union (EU) has exacerbated supply chain problems such at hold-ups at ports or with deliveries, the OBR said in its latest report.\nThe OBR also said the fact that the energy price cap has risen was a big factor behind the rising cost of living. The cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThe independent forecaster suggested that had its figures been more up-to-date, its inflation forecasts would have painted a more bleak picture for consumers and businesses. \nIt previously said it had ended any updates to its forecast on 24 September, earlier than usual, and \"in response to a request from the chancellor\".\nRichard Hughes, chairman of the OBR, told BBC News that if inflation started feeding into wages, rather than just products in the shops, the problem could persist for longer.\nBut the OBR lifted its prediction for economic growth in 2021 to 6.5%, up from its previous forecast of 4%. It has also reduced its estimate of the long-term \"scarring\" effect of Covid-19 on the economy from 3% to 2%.\nThe effectiveness of Covid vaccines and the adaptability of consumers and businesses had sped up the recovery, the OBR said.\nBut it forecast that economic growth would be lower next year than it previously thought, partly down to a better performance in 2021.\nIn 2022, gross domestic product (GDP), which measures all the activity of companies, governments and people in an economy, will increase by 6%, the OBR said, rather than the 7.3% it predicted in March.\nGrowth is forecast to be 2.1% in 2023, 1.3% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025.\nWhile the economy is in a stronger state than had been expected, whether in terms of growth, employment or the public finances - the official analysis makes clear the obstacle inflation poses to standards of living in the coming months. \nThe OBR reckons inflation will hit 4.4.%; it warns it may go as high as 5%. And, it makes clear that leaving the EU has heightened the UK's experience of the bottlenecks that are bumping up business costs, that in turn will lead to higher prices.  \nThat higher cost of living, together with looming tax rises will dampen the effect of wage rises over the next couple of years. \nStrip out inflation and the OBR reckons that household income after tax will only recover to pre-pandemic levels in mid-2023. And those lost years of prosperity increases could weigh on growth - and sentiment in the run up to the next election.\nHigher inflation is also likely to put pressure on how much the chancellor is able to spend in the future.\nBut Mr Sunak has been offered some room for manoeuvre, as the improving economic picture and higher tax incomes means the government will not have to borrow as much.\nBorrowing hit a record \u00a3319.9bn during the 2020 financial year as the government poured money into pandemic support schemes such as furlough.\nIt is now forecast to fall every year between 2021 and 2026. \nJane Mackay, head of tax at audit, tax, advisory and risk firm Crowe, said there was still a \"huge\" Covid bill to deal with, though.\n\"The Budget statement hasn't really given us clarity on who will pay that bill. \n\"The tax increases that were announced before the Budget, including corporation tax rising to 25%, and the NHS and social care levy additional NICs of 1.25%, might suggest the strategy will spread the burden as widely as possible, rather than to make the structural changes to our tax system that may be what is really needed.\"\nA risk of rising inflation as well is that it will increase the amount of interest the government needs to pay back on what it has borrowed for pandemic spending.\nBank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned in September that it \"will have to act\" over rising inflation.\nThe Bank has already said UK inflation is set to exceed 4%, before falling back as the economy recovers from Covid.\nThe UK's central bank can raise interest rates in an attempt to tackle inflation if prices are rising quickly. In theory, when borrowing costs rise - which would make loans such as mortgages more expensive - people spend less and prices are driven down.\nMr Sunak said on Wednesday that he had written to the Bank to \"reaffirm their remit to achieve low and stable inflation\". \nInvestors are expecting interest rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022, in an effort to bring inflation back down to the Bank's 2% target.\nHowever, he gave no suggestion of when the Bank might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%.\nThe governor said that rising energy bills could push inflation higher for longer than previously thought."

      "text": "A man who murdered two sisters at random in a park has been jailed for life, with a minimum term of 35 years.\nDanyal Hussein, 19, repeatedly stabbed Bibaa Henry, 46, and Nicole Smallman, 27, at Fryent Country Park in Wembley, north-west London, on 6 June 2020.\nHe killed them after a birthday party in a supposed \"sacrifice\" he claimed he believed would give him a lottery win.\nTheir bodies were found by Ms Smallman's boyfriend the day after they had been reported missing to police.\nThe defendant, who was convicted of two counts of murder at an Old Bailey trial in July, sat facing away from the court as he was sentenced.\nSpeaking outside court, the sisters' mother Mina Smallman said justice had been done for her \"beautiful girls\".\nOn their killer, she said: \"He's just an obnoxious human being. He is a broken human being who - if he had not been caught - four other families may have been suffering what we have.\" \nJurors had heard how the teenager embarked on a \"campaign of vengeance\" against random women. Hussein apparently thought that if he sacrificed six women, this would help him win a Mega Millions Super Jackpot lottery prize of \u00a3321m.\nHussein stabbed Ms Henry eight times before slashing Ms Smallman 28 times as she fought back. He then dragged the bodies into bushes.\nMs Smallman's boyfriend Adam Stone told the court how he had screamed and fell to his knees upon finding them 36 hours later lying top to toe and intertwined.\nSentencing Hussein, from Blackheath in south-east London, Mrs Justice Whipple said he had dragged the bodies away and posed them in an embrace to \"defile\" them in death. \nShe said: \"You had found these two women. You were a stranger to them. You surprised them, you terrified them and you killed them.\n\"You committed these vicious attacks. You did it to kill. You did it for money and a misguided pursuit of power.\"\nThe judge said the lives of his victims' loved ones had been \"shattered\".\nBy Helena Wilkinson, BBC News\nHussein wasn't in court seven of the Old Bailey today.\nInstead, he watched proceedings on a video-link from Belmarsh Prison, dressed in a grey tracksuit.\nThe court heard he couldn't attend for Covid-related reasons at the jail.\nAt the start of the sentencing hearing, Hussein stared straight ahead, but soon assumed a series of postures including crouching with his feet up on the chair.\nAnd when the judge, Mrs Justice Whipple, addressed him directly he deliberately moved his chair around so he could only be seen in profile.\nIn court, Mina Smallman, the mother of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, maintained a dignified silence throughout and ignored Hussein's antics.\nOn Tuesday, Mina Smallman dismissed an apology from the Metropolitan Police after the force's response to her daughters' disappearance was found to be below standard.\nA report by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said that an inspector closed the police logs after receiving information about the sisters' possible whereabouts from a family member, but that information was \"inaccurately\" recorded by a communications supervisor.\nThis meant that missing persons inquiries for both women were not progressed properly.\nIn addition, two police constables have been charged with misconduct in public office. They allegedly took \"non-official and inappropriate photographs\" of the crime scene before sharing them on WhatsApp, and are due to enter a plea next week.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said in a statement on Thursday that \"it's right that questions are being asked within the Met Police right now\" with regard to searches for missing people in the wake of the case.\nMs Patel said the government was determined to tackle the \"abhorrent issue\" of violence against women and girls, and said the case of the murdered sisters was \"terrible\" and \"tragic\".\nLast week, a self-styled \"black magician\" was kicked off social media after a BBC investigation exposed his influence on Hussein.\nSpeaking after sentencing, Det Insp Maria Green said: \"Danyal Hussein is a dangerous, arrogant and violent individual who from the outset has shown no remorse or acceptance of his actions.\n\"This has been a shocking and chilling case and I know the investigation will stay with all of those involved for a long time to come.\""

      "tags": "Rachel Reeves,Chancellor's Autumn Statement,Rishi Sunak,Budget 2021",
      "text": "Wednesday's Budget - which saw tax and spending rise to record levels - represents a major shift in Tory philosophy, a minister has claimed.\nThe party has traditionally tried to cut taxes and keep spending down.\nTreasury Secretary Simon Clarke said it was still committed to low taxes but made \"no apologies\" for increasing public spending.\nRishi Sunak told MPs the higher tax burden is down to the \"unprecedented crisis\" of the pandemic. \nBut the chancellor also turned on the spending taps in his Budget, after being widely expected to make cuts to in many government departments to help pay down the deficit.\nHe committed to spending increases of \u00a3150bn over three years, including nearly \u00a32bn to help schools in England catch up following coronavirus, \u00a36bn to tackle NHS backlogs and \u00a37bn for transport projects.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank said the spending plans were \"more similar\" to those of the Labour governments in the 2000s than those of George Osborne - a former Conservative chancellor.\nMr Clarke told BBC Newsnight: \"The chancellor was very open about the fact that this is something of a philosophical shift. \n\"What we want to see is to get the economy turbocharged, unlock productivity, and to deliver growth more evenly across UK. That does require some upfront spending.\"\nMr Sunak has sought to calm the fears of some Conservative MPs that the party has abandoned its core economic principles.\n\"Taxes are rising to their highest level as a percentage of GDP since the 1950s - I don't like it, but I cannot apologise for it - it's the result of the unprecedented crisis,\" he said in his Budget speech.\n\"But now, we have a choice,\" he said, adding \"do we want to live in a country where the response to every question is: \"what is the government going to do about it?\"\n\"Or do we choose to recognise that government has limits, that government should have limits.\"\nHe later insisted to ITV's Robert Peston that this was not \"empty rhetoric\", adding that both he and the prime minister wanted to deliver lower taxes by the end of the Parliament.\nHe also told a meeting of backbench Conservative MPs on Wednesday night that \"in the future every marginal pound should be put into lowering taxes\".\nLabour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves told ITV News that it was important to raise money \"but not in the way the government is doing it\". \nShe said the government was introducing big taxes but said \"those taxes are not falling on the banks - bankers got a tax cut\" in reference to a 5% cut in the surcharge levied on banks' profits. \nShe added that Labour would raise taxes on \"online giants who aren't paying their fair share\". \nJust before the chancellor got to his feet, one former minister on the right of the party said he hoped this would be a pivot moment: back to the kind of government action, where Conservatives were seeking to shrink the state, seeking to reduce taxes, seeking to pull back from some of the very big government moves they made because of the pandemic.\nRishi Sunak had a little bit of extra cash to play with, but instead of using that wriggle room he had, to signal the government was going to become smaller, in fact he staked his post out in a landscape where big government is here to stay, and eye-watering levels of tax are here to stay for the foreseeable future (although he seemed to dangle a promise of tax cuts before the next election).\nThat has created Conservative tensions but clearly it's the political calculation of him and Boris Johnson that it's the right thing to do.\nMr Sunak also used his Budget to repeat pre-announced measures, including an end to the public sector pay freeze and an increase to the National Living Wage from \u00a38.91 per hour to \u00a39.50.\nAccording to Office for Budget Responsibility figures, household disposable income is set to rise by 0.8% per year.\nEconomic growth is forecast to rise to 6.3% next year - higher than previously predicted - but it will then slow to 1.3% by 2023.\nNew Budget measures included:\nAnd the chancellor scrapped next year's planned increase in business rates in England and promised more frequent revaluations, and tax breaks for firms that make improvements to their properties, from 2023.\nThe government has faced strong criticism over its decision to reduce the universal credit benefit by \u00a320-a-week. \nMr Sunak did not offer to maintain the \u00a320 uplift - introduced during the pandemic - but instead announced that the \"taper\" would be cut so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every \u00a31 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p.\nMs Reeves said that would not make up for the wider cuts to universal credit which affected five million families.

      "text": "Activists, including two British Olympians, have staged a climate change protest blocking the entrance to the UK's largest oil refinery.\nAbout 15 Extinction Rebellion (XR) demonstrators got on to the site at Fawley, Hampshire, at about 06:30 BST.\nThey included sailor Laura Baldwin and gold medal-winning canoeist Etienne Stott. Other XR protesters scaled two 50ft (15m) oil tanks on the site.\nRefinery owner ExxonMobil said the protest had no impact on its operation.\nThe protest came as Boris Johnson prepares to welcome world leaders in Glasgow for the UN climate summit, COP26,  which starts on Sunday.\nXR said its activists, who have all now left the site, cut through electrified perimeter fences under the cover of darkness before spreading across the site in small groups to lock on to structures.\nExxonMobil said earlier the plant continued to operate and it was not experiencing any impact on production.\nSome of the group, which is calling on the government to ban all\u00a0fossil fuels investments and a halt to expansion plans at Fawley, chained themselves to a pink boat at the site's entrance.\nSpeaking from the pink boat earlier, sailor Baldwin, who competed in the 2004 Athens Games, said: \"Exxon, which are part of the Esso group, are planning to expand their oil exploration - these companies are still putting profits ahead of people.\n\"The government are just not acting on it - they are just not taking it seriously it seems.\"\nIn a statement released by XR, London 2012 Olympic champion Stott said: \"We need our government to rein in these rogue companies as a matter of urgency and show to the world ahead of COP26 that the UK is prepared to take a genuine leadership position.\"\nThe plant is the largest refinery and petrochemical site in the UK and produces almost one fifth of the fuel used by UK vehicles.\nA spokesperson for Hampshire Constabulary earlier said: \"Everyone has the right to free speech and protest. However, officers will take necessary action against the few who deliberately choose to act outside the law.\n\"Police will work to ensure the health and safety of people at these locations, and to minimise the impact on the local community.\n\"No arrests have been made at this stage and we remain at the scene.\"\nExxonMobil added: ''[We believe] that climate change risks warrant action and it's going to take all of us \u2014 business, governments and consumers \u2014 to make meaningful progress. \n''At Fawley, we are also directly helping motorists and farmers to reduce their emissions through the manufacturing of lower carbon fuels...\n''We respect the right to peaceful protest, but our priority is the safety of our people, our neighbours and our operations and we are working with Hampshire police to ensure this is maintained.\"\nLast year, Stott was found guilty of a public order offence after he was arrested on Waterloo Bridge in London when he refused to comply with police orders to leave during an XR protest. \nIt has also been confirmed Sky Rebellion protesters carried out a demonstration at London Southend Airport last week.\nMembers of the group - dressed as Microsoft executives - carried barrels of oil through the check-in area to highlight what they claim is the \"excessive level of corporate flights\" used by the firm.\nThe airport said: \"...a group gathered at the airport to protest Microsoft staff travelling on business flights, despite London Southend Airport not being used by Microsoft employees for business flights.\n\"...the group were intercepted by our security team at the airport terminal and asked to leave. No secure areas were breached as a result of this protest and London Southend Airport is assisting police with their enquiries.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "Criminal charges may still be filed over last week's fatal shooting on a film set in New Mexico, US police say.\nActor Alec Baldwin accidentally shot dead cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded a director on the set of the Western film Rust.\nInvestigators said a \"lead projectile\" had been removed from the director's shoulder, and that it appeared to be a live round.\nThey said there was \"some complacency\" around safety on the set.\n\"All options are on the table,\" District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said of any potential charges. \"No one has been ruled out at this point.\"\nPresenting the department's initial findings, Sante Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said: \"We suspect there were other live rounds found on set.\"\n\"We're going to determine how those got there, why they were there, because they shouldn't have been there,\" he added.\nHe said police had recovered 600 pieces of evidence so far - including three firearms and 500 rounds of ammunition.\nSheriff Mendoza also said the projectile removed from Joel Souza's shoulder had been handed over as evidence.\n\"I think the facts are clear - a weapon was handed to Mr Baldwin. The weapon [was] functional and fired a live round killing Ms Hutchins and injuring Mr Souza,\" he said about the killing.\nThe sheriff told reporters there had been up to 100 people on the set of the film when the shooting happened on Thursday.\nHe also confirmed that two other people had handled the gun, an antique Colt .45 revolver, before it was given to Mr Baldwin - the film's armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed and assistant director Dave Halls.\nMr Halls told investigators he had failed to check all the rounds in the gun before handing it over, according to a court document made public on Wednesday.\nHe reportedly called out \"cold gun\" as he gave it to Mr Baldwin, meaning he believed it to be safe.\nMs Gutierrez-Reed, meanwhile, told investigators that guns had been safely secured shortly before the shooting but ammunition had not been. She said guns were usually kept in a safe that only a few people had access to.\n\"We're going to try to determine exactly how [this] happened and if they should have known that there was a live round in that firearm,\" Sheriff Mendoza said.\nMr Baldwin and the film's producers have hired a private law firm to conduct an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the shooting, according to the Reuters news agency. \nSeveral legal experts, however, have said it is unlikely that criminal charges will be filed against Mr Baldwin.\nThe actor, known for his work on shows like 30 Rock and Saturday Night Live, is named as both an actor and producer on Rust. He is co-operating with investigators and has expressed his shock over what he described as a \"tragic accident\".\nThe incident has sparked debate about safety regulations on Hollywood sets and the use of prop guns on productions. \n\"Obviously I think the industry has had a record recently of being safe,\" Sheriff Mendoza told reporters. \"[But] I think there are some safety issues that need to be addressed by the industry and possibly by the state of New Mexico.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\nThe Budget sees taxes and spending rise to levels not seen in 40 years, according to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who makes \"no apologies\" for spending more on public services in the wake of the pandemic. There has been a \"philosophical shift\" in Conservatism, Simon Clarke says.  Although Chancellor Rishi Sunak says he did not like tax rises, they are as a result of the \"unprecedented crisis\" of the pandemic. Labour agrees it is important to raise money but disagreed with the government's methods. Mr Sunak says he wants deliver lower taxes by the end of Parliament.\nPetrol stations in many parts of China are rationing diesel amid rising costs and falling supplies. Some truck drivers are having to wait entire days to refuel, according to reports on social media. It's part of the global supply chain crisis which has been largely driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, with demand surging as economies re-open. It follows days of similar disruption in the UK earlier this month.\nWhile England scrapped plans for Covid passports - at least for now - Scotland and Wales are like many countries in Europe which are using them to allow people to go into bars, restaurants, cinemas and museums. In Italy, Covid passes are needed to go into workplaces, and Austria's about to join them. So what are the rules? Our correspondents around Europe have been finding out.\nDo you listen to morning radio shows more, less or just as often? It appears we're listening to them less. The latest figures reveal breakfast radio shows including those from Zoe Ball and Greg James now have fewer listeners than before the pandemic. The drop's in part down to fewer people commuting as many still work from home. But industry body Rajar urges caution when making comparison because it's also measuring audiences in new ways.\nPeople were said to be either drinking too much while at home during the pandemic or cutting back, but one thing that wasn't really reported was those who were getting into the spirit of trying something more adventurous. It appears more unusual drinks and wines from countries\u00a0that don't usually interest mainstream consumers\u00a0have been hits. Here's the story.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nRemind yourself of the rules surrounding Covid passports in the UK.\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "China has restricted smaller cities in the country from building \"super high-rise buildings\", as part of a larger bid to crack down on vanity projects.\nThe country is home to some of the world's highest buildings, including Shanghai Tower, which has 128 floors. \nLocal reports also questioned the need for low-density cities to build skyscrapers, suggesting they were built for vanity and not practicality.\nThere is already an existing ban on buildings taller than 500 metres. \nThe announcement was mostly met with approval on Chinese social media site Weibo, with many stating that the super-high skyscrapers were \"not needed... they're just gimmicky\". \nEarlier this year the country issued a ban on \"ugly architecture\". \n\"We're in a stage where people are too impetuous and anxious to produce something that can actually go down in history,\" Zhang Shangwu, deputy head of Tongji University's College of Architecture and Urban Planning had earlier told the South China Morning Post. \n\"Every building aims to be a landmark, and the developers and city planners try to achieve this goal by going extreme in novelty and strangeness.\"\nIn a joint statement issued on Tuesday, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural development and the Ministry of Emergency Management said cities with populations of less than three million people will be restricted from building skyscrapers taller than 150 metres (492 ft). \nThose with populations larger than that will be restricted from buildings taller than 250 metres. \nThe ministry clarified that special exemptions would have to be sought if a city with an urban population of less than three million wanted to build a skyscraper higher than 150 metres.\nHowever, they would not under any circumstances be able to build a building higher than 250 metres. \nSimilarly, cities with an urban population of over three million could under certain circumstances apply to build a skyscraper taller than 250 metres, but with a hard ban on buildings over 500m. \nThose who approve projects that violate these new rules will held to \"lifelong accountability\" the statement added."

      "tags": "Budget 2021",
      "text": "Measures introduced since Boris Johnson came to power, including Wednesday's Budget, will increase the UK's tax burden by \u00a33,000 a year per household. according to the Resolution Foundation.\nThe think tank found policies announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak had boosted incomes by 2.8% for the poorest fifth of households.\nHowever, households on middle incomes would take a 2% hit, it added.\nMr Sunak said his Budget had \"cut taxes for millions of the lowest-paid\".\nThat claim was challenged by the Foundation's figures.\nIt said the changes to the amount families can keep from their earnings if they are on universal credit only partially offset the effect of withdrawing the \u00a320-a-week boost during the pandemic. \nOn average, recipients would lose \u00a3800 a year, it calculated.\nThe \u00a33,000 figure produced by the Resolution Foundation includes business taxes, which are regularly passed on to consumers. \nOf the 4.4 million households on universal credit, about three-quarters (3.2 million households) will be worse off as a result of decisions to take away the \u00a320-a week-uplift, despite the chancellor's new universal credit measures.\nBut 1.2 million households would be better off by \u00a3900 a year than before the Budget. \nResponding to the Foundation's calculations, a Treasury spokesperson told the BBC: \"It's misleading to imply that households will immediately face a \u00a33,000 tax hit, because this figure appears to include business and employers' taxes which aren't applicable directly to households.\n\"The same report shows that the government's policies are set to boost incomes for those at the bottom of the distribution and that higher taxes will mostly impact middle-to-higher income households.\n\"This government's decisions have been worth nearly \u00a3500 per year extra to households on average, and more than \u00a31,000 for the poorest households - and that's before factoring in wage growth, including the rise in the National Living Wage.\"\nTalking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Sunak said pressures on the economy \"will be with us for a while\", but that the government's plan was working and \"we can face the future with a bit more confidence\".\nHe also said that wages were rising and that he had \"cut taxes for millions of the lowest-paid people\", adding that it was his job to be concerned about inflation and his new fiscal rules were \"how we build up resilience\". \nGovernment figures show that when you take account of investment in public services, the average earner has seen improvements worth \u00a3500 a year overall. \nSetting out the Budget on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said his plans were focused on the \"post-Covid\" era and would pave the way for an \"economy of higher wages, higher skills, and rising productivity\".\nHe told MPs the higher tax burden was down to the pandemic. \"Taxes are rising to their highest level as a percentage of GDP since the 1950s - I don't like it, but I cannot apologise for it - it's the result of the unprecedented crisis,\" he said in his Budget speech.\nHe committed to spending increases of \u00a3150bn over three years, including nearly \u00a32bn to help schools in England catch up following coronavirus, \u00a36bn to tackle NHS backlogs and \u00a37bn for transport projects.\nHe also announced that the universal credit \"taper\" rate would be cut by 8% no later than 1 December, so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every \u00a31 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p.\nMeanwhile, the National Living Wage will increase next year by 6.6%, to \u00a39.50 an hour.\nLabour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, welcomed the increases in spending announced by Mr Sunak, but said there were areas that gave her \"cause for concern\".\nHighlighting the need for greater investment in education, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"If we are going to grow the economy sustainably, we have got to invest in our young people.\n\"Unless we ensure that kids catch up from that missed-out education [during the pandemic], there will be a long-term cost to our economy.\" \nThe Foundation's overnight analysis of the Budget and Spending Review 2021 revealed a deteriorating picture on family finances, with household incomes set to stagnate as a result of rising inflation.\n\"Higher taxes aren't a surprise, given the UK is combining fiscal conservatism with an ageing society and a slow-growing economy. But it is the end of low-tax conservatism, with the tax take rising by \u00a33,000 per household by the middle of this decade,\" said Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.\nWith higher growth, inflation and public spending than previously expected, combined with tax rises already in train, the Foundation warns that the UK could be set for a flat recovery for household living standards.\nThe combined effect of universal credit changes, alcohol and fuel duties, higher council tax, income tax and national insurance delivered a 2.8% boost to the incomes of the poorest households. \nBut middle-income households will see incomes drop by 2% and the richest fifth of households will suffer a 3.1% hit by the middle of the decade, the Foundation warned. \nIn the wider population, wages are set to fall next year after inflation. \nIt means the last decade has been the weakest decade for pay growth since the 1930s. \nBy May 2024, real wages will have grown by just 2.4% since 2008 -  compared with a 38% real wage increase between 1992 and 2008. \n\"The chancellor got some really good news for the public finances yesterday - lower borrowing, because the economy's doing slightly better than we all though six months ago. But good news for public finances wasn't good news for household finances,\" the Foundation's Mr Bell told BBC Breakfast.\n\"That's because higher inflation that actually helped the chancellor with his borrowing figures is obviously hurting household budgets, and that's why the Office for Budget Responsibility expects household incomes and wages to actually not grow at all in the next year.\n\"So that's going to be really bad news for everyone worrying about their own budgets.\""

      "text": "A man who sent deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner a threatening email telling her to \"watch your back and your kids\" has been sentenced.\nBenjamin Iliffe, 36, admitted sending the email to the Ashton-under-Lyne MP from his personal account.\nIliffe, of Cambridgeshire, was sentenced to 15 weeks in prison, suspended for 18 months.\nMs Rayner said she had received a number of \"terrifying\" death threats recently which have been \"devastating\". \nIliffe was made the subject of a two-year restraining order and told not to contact Ms Rayner directly or indirectly, not to talk about her on social media and not to go to her office in Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester.\nThe former delivery driver pleaded guilty at Huntingdon Magistrates' Court to sending the email and possessing a quantity of cannabis on Wednesday, when he was arrested.\nThe court heard he warned Ms Rayner to \"watch your back and your kids\" in the email on 16 October, along with calling her a four-letter expletive.\nHe also said it had been \"easy to find\" her personal home address.\nSentencing him, presiding magistrate Andrew Riddington said the offence was \"so serious because of the psychological harm caused to a public servant\".\nHowever, he said the sentence could be suspended because of Iliffe's guilty pleas and the \"remorse shown\".\nA spokesman for Ms Rayner said she had received several threatening and abusive communications in recent weeks.\nIn a statement on social media after Iliffe was sentenced, Ms Rayner said threats she had received \"against my life and the lives of close family have been so terrifying and explicit\".\nShe said they had a \"devastating impact on me, my children and others close to me\". \n\"Dealing with death threats and liaising with the police about safety should not be a standard part of the day-to-day working life of a Member of Parliament or their staff,\" she said.\nA probation officer told the court he had spoken to Iliffe who had said he felt \"angry\" about comments made by Ms Rayner during a Labour Party conference reception in September.\nThe officer said: \"He informed me that following the death of Sir David Amess MP, he felt angry at the victim who - he states - described a member of the Conservative Party previously... as 'scum'.\n\"He stated he wanted to vent, and felt that somebody needed to tell her she was partially responsible for the attack following her use of language.\"\n In her statement, Ms Rayner also said she would \"unreservedly like to apologise for the language I used\", adding she would not use it again. \nIliffe, of Chatteris, was also ordered to complete 100 hours of unpaid work and 35 days of a rehabilitation activity.\nHe was made to pay \u00a385 costs, a \u00a3128 victim surcharge and was fined \u00a350 for the cannabis, which was ordered to be forfeited and destroyed.\nTwo other people have been arrested in connection with alleged malicious communications sent to Ms Rayner.\nGreater Manchester Police said a 70-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of malicious communications earlier, in conjunction with South Yorkshire Police. \nA 52-year-old man was also held in Halifax on suspicion of malicious communications on Wednesday over abusive phone calls made to the Labour MP on 15 October.

      "tags": "Companies,Social media,Meta,Mark Zuckerberg,Facebook,Virtual reality",
      "text": "Facebook has changed its corporate name to Meta as part of a major rebrand. \nThe company said it would better \"encompass\" what it does, as it broadens its reach beyond social media into areas like virtual reality (VR).\nThe change does not apply to its individual platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp, only the parent company that owns them. \nThe move follows a series of negative stories about Facebook, based on documents leaked by an ex-employee.\nFrances Haugen has accused the company of putting \"profits over safety\".\nIn 2015, Google restructured its company calling its parent firm Alphabet, however, the name has not caught on.\nFacebook boss Mark Zuckerberg announced the new name as he unveiled plans to build a \"metaverse\" - an online world where people can game, work and communicate in a virtual environment, often using VR headsets.\nHe said the existing brand could not \"possibly represent everything that we're doing today, let alone in the future\", and needed to change.\n\"Over time, I hope that we are seen as a metaverse company and I want to anchor our work and our identity on what we're building towards,\" he told a virtual conference.\n\"We're now looking at and reporting on our business as two different segments, one for our family of apps, and one for our work on future platforms.\n\"And as part of this, it is time for us to adopt a new company brand to encompass everything that we do, to reflect who we are and what we hope to build.\"\nThe company also unveiled a new sign at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California, on Thursday, replacing its thumbs-up \"Like\" logo with a blue infinity shape.\nMr Zuckerberg said the new name reflects that over time, users will not need to use Facebook to use the company's other services.\nThe word \"meta\" comes from the Greek word meaning \"beyond\".\nTo an outsider, a metaverse may look like a version of VR, but some people believe it could be the future of the internet.\nInstead of being on a computer, people in a metaverse might use a headset to enter a virtual world connecting all sorts of digital environments. \nIt is hoped the virtual world could be used for practically anything from work, play and concerts, to socialising with friends and family.\nFacebook said it intends to start trading its shares under the new stock ticker MVRS from 1 December.\nThe company has had multiple hits to its reputation, with The Washington Post today reporting that Facebook withheld important information about vaccine misinformation from policymakers during the pandemic.\nIt was the latest in a series of stories based on internal documents leaked by ex-employee Ms Haugen to the media. Among other things, the reports have claimed Facebook sat on research that showed Instagram harmed teenage mental health, and struggled to remove hate speech from its platforms outside the US.\nMr Zuckerberg has described the reports as a \"coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company\".\nTrying to name a company is difficult. Zuckerberg says he's chosen Meta, because of its meaning in Greek - \"beyond\". It also alludes to the \"Metaverse\", an online virtual oasis that he wants to build. \nHere's why Facebook, might have a problem with getting everyone to call them Meta. \nFirstly, the move looks like Facebook is trying to divert attention away from the trove of negative stories hanging around the company. Critics believe Facebook has done this because the brand has become toxic. We've already seen Senators ignore the name change, with one describing the move as \"cosmetic\".\nSecondly, the \"Metaverse\" doesn't yet exist. Zuckerberg was keen to stress it was a long-term product. So having a name totally unrelated to your main offering is perhaps a little\u2026strange. Almost all of Facebook's revenue comes from advertising from Facebook and Instagram. \nAnd thirdly, we know that other Big Tech rebrands have failed. Almost no one refers to Google as \"Alphabet\", the name it rebranded itself to in 2015. \nWhat is clear is that running Instagram and Facebook is no longer Mr Zuckerberg's passion. He is interested in creating virtual worlds, that he thinks will transform the human experience. The constant criticism of how he runs his social media companies must be draining. This restructure may give him the ability to focus more on the segments of the company that excite him.\nThe division makes sense in that respect. However, we'll have to wait and see whether people will go along with it. "

      "tags": "Rishi Sunak,NI economy,Conor Murphy",
      "text": "Finance minister Conor Murphy has disputed a claim by the chancellor that Northern Ireland will get an extra \u00a31.6bn per year for public services. \nRishi Sunak said his budget allocation represented the largest annual funding settlement for devolved governments since 1998.\nBut Mr Murphy said it would create \"significant challenges\".\nHe said it would amount to \u00a31.9bn for day-to-day spending over three years - \"nowhere near\" what is required. \nTreasury figures show the budget allocation will mean day-to-day spending in Northern Ireland will increase by an average of 2.1% in real terms each year up to 2025.\nInfrastructure spending will increase by an average of 2.5% a year over the same period.\nThe Treasury said this gave the Northern Ireland Executive \"sufficient funding certainty\" to plan in-year spending and to provide additional future investments in areas such as health, social care and education.\nBut Mr Murphy said when compared to the executive's 2021-22 budget, there will be an additional \u00a3450m, \u00a3670m and \u00a3866m over the next three years for day-to-day spending \"against growing demand for public services\".\nThis, he added, represented a 0.9% real term increase to the executive's budget next year, turning to zero real terms change by 2024-25.\n\"This spending review was the opportunity to deliver a budget which would have enabled the executive to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery,\" Mr Murphy said. \n\"However it provides a marginal real terms increase in funding next year which will be far outweighed by increased demands on public services, particularly in light of the ongoing pandemic.\"\nMr Murphy said a multi-year budget enables the executive to better plan and prioritise its finances.\nHe said his priority was supporting the health service and tackling waiting lists. \nSeparately, there is an initial budget allocation of \u00a350m from the government's levelling up fund.\nIt is for 11 projects including redeveloping the Dundonald Ice Bowl and extending cycle routes across the Belfast City Region.\nMr Sunak also said he will cut Air Passenger Duty (APD) by half on internal UK flights.\nA cut in APD is a long standing request of Northern Ireland politicians and business leaders.\nIt will mean a new domestic band for APD set at \u00a36.50. \nThe rate will apply to all flights between airports in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (excluding private jets). \nThe government has also announced a proposal to solve a NI Protocol related issue concerning the VAT paid on second cars coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. \nMr Murphy has previously already played down expectations that the spending review would mean significant extra resources.\nEarlier this week, he said there was \"little indication\" the government would \"provide the investment needed to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery\".\nHowever, he said the ability to produce a multi-year budget would provide an opportunity to \"better plan and prioritise finances\".\nStormont has not had a multi-year budget since 2011-2015.\nThat has made it difficult for public sector managers to plan services, particularly in health.\nThe finance minister is trying to build consensus among his executive colleagues that the bulk of any additional funds should go to health even if other departments lose out.\nHe aims to publish a draft budget before Christmas which would then go out to consultation before being finalised early next year.\nThe Institute of Directors Northern Ireland said the additional money will be a \"shot in the arm for the local administration\".\n\"It is incumbent now on ministers to deliver on the incredible potential it presents, with a focus, through targeted investment in key services and infrastructure, on ensuring this region is fit to capitalise on the green recovery as we continue to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic,\" said national director, Kirsty McManus. \nRetail NI said the chancellor's 50% rates discount for retailers in England was welcome. The organisation added it was \"absolutely vital\" that Conor Murphy ensures this also applies to small traders in Northern Ireland. \nMatthew Hall, George Best Belfast City Airport chief executive, said the airport had for many years been lobbying government for the abolition of APD.\n\"A 50% reduction in APD is a half-way house in terms of solving a problem which has placed the aviation sector in Northern Ireland at a competitive disadvantage with other regions in attracting new airlines and routes,\" he said. \"Today's announcement by the chancellor will not take effect until April 2023 and does little in the short term to alleviate a sector still decimated by Covid.\"\nSDLP leader and MP Colum Eastwood said the budget was a \"grim spectacle\".\n\"Now we have some certainty on multi-year funding the onus is on Conor Murphy to actually take responsibility and deliver a multi-year plan to tackle our waiting list crisis and present a credible plan for our economy,\" he said. \nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) assembly member Steve Aiken said the extra \u00a31.6bn a year \"underlines the advantage of being part of the fifth largest economy in the world\".\n\"We still have a long way to go to emerge fully from the Covid pandemic but this budget, if properly used to support the needs of Northern Ireland, gives us a good chance,\" he said. \nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson said the multi year budget should help devolved finance ministers plan spending better. \n\"The last two years have been unprecedented, and the Treasury responded in an unprecedented manner to protect jobs and safeguard employers,\" he said. \nBuckfast tonic wine faces a significant tax increase under government plans to reform alcohol duty.\nThe new system, due to start in 2023, will mean higher duty for stronger alcohol, the chancellor said.\nA Treasury fact sheet suggests a 75cl bottle of Buckfast will face additional tax of 81p.\nThe fortified wine is popular in some areas of Northern Ireland and is sometimes called Lurgan Champagne.\nIt has been made by Benedictine monks at Buckfast Abbey in Devon for almost 100 years.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said he was proposing the \"most radical simplification of alcohol duties for over 140 years\".\n\"To radically simplify the system, we are slashing the number of main duty rates from 15 to just six,\" he said.\n\"Our new system will be designed around a common-sense principle: the stronger the drink, the higher the rate. \n'This means that some drinks, like stronger red wines, fortified wines, or high-strength 'white ciders' will see a small increase in their rates because they are currently undertaxed given their strength.\"\nMr Sunak said many lower alcohol drinks were \"currently overtaxed\", adding: \"Rose, fruit ciders, liqueurs, lower strength beers and wines - today's changes mean they will pay less.\""

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has urged protesters targeting the COP26 climate conference not to disrupt the daily lives of Glasgow residents.\nGroups like Extinction Rebellion have said they are planning high-impact actions to pile pressure on the world leaders gathering for the talks.\nOpposition MSPs have called for police to take a \"zero tolerance\" approach.\nThe first minister said officers would facilitate \"appropriate and peaceful protest\" during the two-week event.\nHowever, she called on activists to recognise that Glasgow residents were already putting up with disruption due to the conference, asking them not to add to it.\nThe UN-led summit is set to be a focal point for protests from Sunday onwards, with Greta Thunberg confirming she will take part in a \"climate strike\" event Glasgow on 5 November.\nClimate change activists have told BBC Scotland that they will be staging further \"direct action\" protests in the city in a bid to put pressure on politicians to \"actually listen and step up and take action\".\nGreenpeace has said its members will look to \"have a big impact and contribute to that sense of pressure that world leaders need to feel\", while Extinction Rebellion leaders said they would target \"deliberate disruption where it's going to make the most impact\".\nEven some government ministers have said they plan to join events, with Scottish Green co-leader Lorna Slater saying that \"protest is meant to be disruptive\".\nAt Holyrood, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said there was \"real potential\" for protests that \"risk public safety\", calling for a \"zero tolerance\" approach to actions that disrupt residents from going about their business.\nHe said: \"We all respect the right of protesters to express their views, but we cannot sit back and allow deliberate and dangerous disruption of people's lives.\"\nMs Sturgeon said it was for police to decide how to appropriately handle protests, saying she was confident Police Scotland - which will have 10,000 officers on duty every day of the conference - would handle any issues.\nShe said: \"The chief constable - who I will be having further discussions with over the course of today and tomorrow - has been very clear that there will be a sensitive policing operation that will do everything possible to facilitate appropriate and peaceful protest.\n\"But Police Scotland will respond to any protests that seek to break the law or disrupt people beyond what would be considered reasonable.\n\"People do want to come and make their voices heard, which is understandable given the importance of the issues under discussion.\n\"But I would say to people looking to come to protest in Glasgow, do it peacefully and do with with a recognition that the people of Glasgow are agreeing to host this conference and suffering some disruption because of that, so don't add to that disruption for them.\"\nMs Sturgeon also said she was confident that Glasgow was ready to host the conference, after concerns around cleansing staff going on strike.\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar claimed the city was being \"let down by the SNP\", saying local services were struggling with \"tonnes of waste piling up on our streets, fly-tipping on the rise, and over a million rats\".\nHe said: \"Glasgow deserves better - Nicola Sturgeon is lecturing the world on the global environment while cutting cleansing budgets and neglecting the local environment.\"\nThe first minister said: \"I don't shy away from the problems and challenges that cities like Glasgow - it is not unique here - face in the times we are living through right now.\n\"But nor will I stand here and allow Glasgow, one of the greatest cities in the world, to be talked down for political purposes.\""

      "text": "NI's finance minister has played down expectations of significant extra money as a result of the UK spending review.\nThe chancellor's announcement on Wednesday will set the executive's spending limits for three years.\nConor Murphy said a multiyear budget \"provides an opportunity to better plan and prioritise finances.\"\nHe said there was \"little indication\" that the government would \"provide the investment needed to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery\".\nThe amount of money available to Stormont and the other devolved administrations is set by the Barnett formula.\nIt is a population-based share of additional funding announced for England.\nOn Sunday Chancellor Rishi Sunak said \"strong investment in public services\" would be at the heart of his plans for rebuilding the economy.\nHe said: \"One of the elements of building a stronger economy is having strong public services, and you will see that next week - whether it's the NHS, which we've already taken steps to support significantly to recover from coronavirus, children, schools, skills, all of these things, policing and crime.\"\nAsked if he would raise public sector wages in line with inflation, the chancellor said: \"That will be one of the things we talk about.\n\"Over the past year, we took a decision to have a more targeted approach to public sector pay,\" he continued, but added: \"Going forward we'll have to set a new pay policy and that'll be a topic for next week's spending review.\"\nWriting in the Irish News, Conor Murphy expressed scepticism about what the chancellor would deliver and again called on the executive to prioritise health spending on Stormont's budget.\nHe said: \"While the indications are that the spending review outcome will not be good for the executive, a collective approach can produce a budget that finally brings down waiting lists on a sustainable basis.\"\nMr Murphy also said that increasing domestic rates, a locally controlled property tax, would not give Stormont much extra spending power.\n\"I would caution that a 1% increase in domestic rates generates less than \u00a33m,\" he said.\n\"To put that into context, a 22% increase in domestic rates would be needed to pay for a 1% increase in the health budget.\""

      "text": "The EU's top court has told Poland to pay a daily fine of \u20ac1m (\u00a3850,000) in a row over judicial reforms.\nEarlier this year, Poland was ordered to suspend a controversial disciplinary chamber, but has not yet done so.\nIt is the latest development in a bitter feud with the EU over changes that are seen as weakening the independence of Polish courts.\nThe hefty penalty was immediately denounced as \"blackmail\" by Polish government spokesman Piotr Muller.\nSome fear the escalating situation could put Poland's membership in the EU at risk.\nEarlier this month, Poland's constitutional court ruled that Polish law supersedes EU law when there is a conflict between the two - angering European leaders by, in effect, rejecting the primacy of EU law.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it was a \"direct challenge to the unity of the European legal order\".\nThe disciplinary chamber of Poland's Supreme Court was set up in 2018 to penalise top judges where necessary - the government said it was needed to fight corruption. But critics argue it is being used to punish independent judges because it has the power to sanction the content of their rulings.\nIn July, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ordered it to be shut down as it was neither sufficiently independent nor impartial. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Brussels was making demands with a \"gun to our head\" and insisted that EU institutions have no right to tell Poland how to organise its judiciary. He did agree to dismantle the chamber, however, but never gave a date.\nBBC Warsaw correspondent Adam Easton says the Supreme Court has stopped scheduling new cases for the chamber, but it has continued hearing cases that are already scheduled.\nOne significant factor in the row is that the European Commission is yet to approve \u20ac57bn (\u00a348bn; $66bn) of Covid-19 recovery funds earmarked for Poland, and may not do so until this dispute is settled.\nAn opinion poll on Tuesday suggested that 40.8% of Poles believed their government should concede defeat and end the row, while another 32.5% said it should compromise.\nThe ECJ's ruling on Wednesday stated that the fine of \u20ac1m a day would have to be paid until Poland either suspended the chamber or until the final ruling on its future.\nThe vice-president said the fine was being imposed to deter Poland from further delaying the shut down of the chamber and said it was necessary to \"avoid serious and irreparable harm to the legal order of the European Union\".\nPoland's Deputy Justice Minister Sebastian Kaleta said the ruling \"completely disregards and ignores the Polish constitution and the rulings of the Polish constitutional tribunal\".\nPoland's leader told the European Parliament this month it was \"unacceptable to talk about financial penalties\" and he accused the EU of overstepping its powers.\nHis conservative-nationalist government has already been ordered by the ECJ to pay \u20ac500,000 a day for failing to shut down temporarily the enormous Turow coal mine and power plant close to the German and Czech borders. Poland has refused to pay that fine because it argues the plant heats and provides water to local homes."

      "tags": "Chancellor's Autumn Statement,Rishi Sunak",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out changes to universal credit he says will give low income families an extra \u00a31,000 a year.\nIn an upbeat Budget speech, he said the UK economy had not been hit as hard by the Covid pandemic as expected.\nHe promised more money for schools, business rate cuts and took 3p off the price of a pint of beer.\nLabour said his universal credit measure would not make up for axing the \u00a320-a-week top-up to the benefit.\nThe chancellor painted a positive picture of the health of the UK economy as it emerges from the pandemic, in his autumn statement to a packed House of Commons.\n\"Employment is up. Investment is growing. Public services are improving. The public finances are stabilising. And wages are rising,\" he told MPs.\n\"Today's Budget delivers a stronger economy for the British people: stronger growth, with the UK recovering faster than our major competitors.\"\nHe said unemployment had not hit the levels feared at the height of the pandemic - but inflation was set to rise further, from 3.1% to 4% over the next year.\nMuch of his Budget had been pre-announced, including an end to the public sector pay freeze and an increase to the National Living Wage from \u00a38.91 per hour to \u00a39.50.\nBut Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News the \"almost non-existent\" increase in living standards predicted over the next five years was a \"big blow\" to families.\nHousehold disposable income is set to rise by 0.8% per year, according to Office for Budget Responsibility figures.\nEconomic growth is forecast to rise to 6.3% next year - higher than previously predicted - but it will then slow to 1.3% by 2023.\nNew Budget measures included:\nThe teetotal chancellor also announced plans to \"radically simplify\" alcohol tax, so that it was based purely on the strength of the drink. \nTaxes on sparkling wine, draught beer and cider are to be cut, but will rise for stronger drinks such as red wine and \"white ciders\", from 2023.\nHe also announced that the planned increase in duty on spirits, wine, cider and beer due to take effect from midnight on Wednesday has been cancelled.\nAnd he scrapped next year's planned increase in business rates in England and promised more frequent revaluations, and tax breaks for firms that make improvements to their properties, from 2023.\nIn further moves to boost the leisure industry as it emerges from the pandemic, he announced a 50% business rate discount for pubs, cinemas, restaurants, gyms and other venues.\nRishi Sunak portrays himself as a light touch Tory - who doesn't like heavy taxes, who doesn't like big government. \nBut he's not using the fading of the pandemic emergency to call time on hefty spending. \nNor is the chancellor seizing a moment to argue for a leaner state. \nInstead, his plans increase spending everywhere, in a Budget that on first examination has something for everyone. \nMr Sunak even chose to emphasise how he's restoring spending in some areas to levels not seen since Labour was in charge; less keen to remind you that they were cut back by successive administrations made up of his Tory colleagues. \nDespite dangling the promise of tax cuts by 2024, the Budget seems to confirm the political conclusions of Mr Sunak and Boris Johnson - vows to shrink the state are not going to win them the next election.  \nBut with the threat of inflation, higher taxes and puny, if better growth, the seeming largesse may not be toasted by the public in the months to come, even if they could so with cheaper cider or prosecco.\nThe chancellor waited until the end of his 70 minute speech to announce changes to universal credit, which come after a widely condemned \u00a320-a-week cut to the benefit earlier this month.\nThe universal credit \"taper\" will be cut, so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every \u00a31 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p.\nThe amount people can earn before starting to lose the benefit will also increase by \u00a3500 a year. The new rate will be introduced by 1 December, he told MPs.\n\"This is a tax cut next year worth over \u00a32bn,\" said the chancellor.\n\"Nearly two million families will keep, on average, an extra \u00a31,000 a year.\"\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour welcomed the move but it would not make up for the \u00a36bn cut from universal credit earlier this month, which affected five million families. \n\"Even after this reduction, working people on universal credit still face a higher marginal tax rate than the prime minister. And those unable to work - through no fault of their own - still face losing over \u00a31,000 a year,\" she said.\nThe opposition leader normally responds to the chancellor's Budget speech, but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is self-isolating after testing positive for Covid.\nMs Reeves, who was drafted in to replace him at the last minute, said Mr Sunak had \"no coherent plan\" to deal with cost of living crisis facing many families, with rising energy bills, food prices and tax increases.\nShe told MPs Mr Sunak was a chancellor that \"gives with one hand but takes so much more with the other\".\nThe SNP's leader at Westminster, Iain Blackford, branded the chancellor's planned cut to domestic air passenger duty a \"disgrace\", asking what kind of message it sent to the world on the eve of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.\nThe Liberal Democrats said cutting bank taxes would cost the Treasury more than \u00a33.8bn over the next four years, compared with \u00a31.8bn extra to help school pupils catch up.\n\"He is offering a measly pound a day of extra catch up funding for each child, six times less than the tax cut being offered to the Conservatives' banker buddies,\" said leader Sir Ed Davey."

      "text": "The UK has condemned \"unjustified\" threats from France and summoned the country's ambassador in an escalating row over post-Brexit fishing rights.\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss is calling for talks later, asking Catherine Colonna to explain \"disappointing and disproportionate threats\".\nA British trawler was seized by France and another fined during checks off Le Havre on Thursday.\nFrench authorities said the detained vessel did not have a licence.\nHowever, Environment Secretary George Eustice has insisted the European Union did grant a licence to the trawler and said it was \"unclear\" why, according to reports, it was subsequently withdrawn from the list given to the EU.\nFrance was angered by a decision from the UK and Jersey last month to deny fishing licences to dozens of French boats, and argued that this breached the Brexit deal.\nThe country has warned it would block British boats from some ports next week and tighten checks on UK boats and trucks if the dispute over fishing licences was not resolved by 2 November.\nIn issuing its ultimatum, it said it would begin to impose \"targeted measures\" from next Tuesday, including preventing British fishing boats from disembarking at ports and more checks on UK goods.\nFrance has also warned it could cut electricity supplies to Jersey, a British Crown dependency, as it previously threatened in May.\nThe country's Europe minister Clement Beaune told French TV news channel CNews: \"We need to speak the language of force because, unfortunately, that seems to be the only thing this British government understands.\"\nOn Thursday evening, Ms Truss said in a tweet that she had asked Europe Minister Wendy Morton to summon the French ambassador for talks on Friday. \nA government spokesman said: \"The proposed French actions are unjustified and do not appear to be compatible on the EU's part with the Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) or wider international law.\n\"We regret the confrontational language that has been consistently used by the French government on this issue, which makes this situation no easier to resolve.\"\nThe detained vessel is the Cornelis Gert Jan and its owner, Macduff Shellfish of Scotland, said the vessel was fishing legally in French waters.\nThe firm's Andrew Brown said it appeared the Cornelis, based at Shoreham, in West Sussex, had been \"caught up\" in the ongoing UK-France post-Brexit fishing row.\nHe warned that without \"a speedy resolution\" the vessel's catch could be confiscated by the French authorities, and called on the UK government to \"defend the rights of the UK fishing fleet\".\nFrench maritime minister Annick Girardin said on Twitter the trawler was found to be fishing in the Bay of Seine without the proper licences.\nThe minister said checks on the British vessels were standard during the scallop fishing season. \nBut she added they had also been undertaken against \"the backdrop of the tightening of controls in the Channel, in the context of discussions on licences with the United Kingdom and the European Commission\".\nThe UK maintains the rejected applications that sparked the row did not have enough supporting evidence to show the boats had a history of fishing in Britain's or Jersey's waters.\nA meeting with officials from France, Jersey, the UK and European Commission on Wednesday led to 162 French boats being given licences to fish in Jersey's waters from Friday.\nThe government of Jersey said it was \"extremely disappointed\" by the latest threats of sanctions by France. French trawlers previously protested outside the port of St Helier on the island."

      "tags": "Budget 2021",
      "text": "Measures introduced since Boris Johnson came to power, including Wednesday's Budget, will increase the UK's tax burden by \u00a33,000 a year per household. according to the Resolution Foundation.\nThe think tank found policies announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak had boosted incomes by 2.8% for the poorest fifth of households.\nHowever, households on middle incomes would take a 2% hit, it added.\nMr Sunak said his Budget had \"cut taxes for millions of the lowest-paid\".\nThat claim was challenged by the Foundation's figures.\nIt said the changes to the amount families can keep from their earnings if they are on universal credit only partially offset the effect of withdrawing the \u00a320-a-week boost during the pandemic. \nOn average, recipients would lose \u00a3800 a year, it calculated.\nThe \u00a33,000 figure produced by the Resolution Foundation includes business taxes, which are regularly passed on to consumers. \nOf the 4.4 million households on universal credit, about three-quarters (3.2 million households) will be worse off as a result of decisions to take away the \u00a320-a week-uplift, despite the chancellor's new universal credit measures.\nBut 1.2 million households would be better off by \u00a3900 a year than before the Budget. \nResponding to the Foundation's calculations, a Treasury spokesperson told the BBC: \"It's misleading to imply that households will immediately face a \u00a33,000 tax hit, because this figure appears to include business and employers' taxes which aren't applicable directly to households.\n\"The same report shows that the government's policies are set to boost incomes for those at the bottom of the distribution and that higher taxes will mostly impact middle-to-higher income households.\n\"This government's decisions have been worth nearly \u00a3500 per year extra to households on average, and more than \u00a31,000 for the poorest households - and that's before factoring in wage growth, including the rise in the National Living Wage.\"\nTalking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Sunak said pressures on the economy \"will be with us for a while\", but that the government's plan was working and \"we can face the future with a bit more confidence\".\nHe also said that wages were rising and that he had \"cut taxes for millions of the lowest-paid people\", adding that it was his job to be concerned about inflation and his new fiscal rules were \"how we build up resilience\". \nGovernment figures show that when you take account of investment in public services, the average earner has seen improvements worth \u00a3500 a year overall. \nSetting out the Budget on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said his plans were focused on the \"post-Covid\" era and would pave the way for an \"economy of higher wages, higher skills, and rising productivity\".\nHe told MPs the higher tax burden was down to the pandemic. \"Taxes are rising to their highest level as a percentage of GDP since the 1950s - I don't like it, but I cannot apologise for it - it's the result of the unprecedented crisis,\" he said in his Budget speech.\nHe committed to spending increases of \u00a3150bn over three years, including nearly \u00a32bn to help schools in England catch up following coronavirus, \u00a36bn to tackle NHS backlogs and \u00a37bn for transport projects.\nHe also announced that the universal credit \"taper\" rate would be cut by 8% no later than 1 December, so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every \u00a31 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p.\nMeanwhile, the National Living Wage will increase next year by 6.6%, to \u00a39.50 an hour.\nLabour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, welcomed the increases in spending announced by Mr Sunak, but said there were areas that gave her \"cause for concern\".\nHighlighting the need for greater investment in education, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"If we are going to grow the economy sustainably, we have got to invest in our young people.\n\"Unless we ensure that kids catch up from that missed-out education [during the pandemic], there will be a long-term cost to our economy.\" \nThe Foundation's overnight analysis of the Budget and Spending Review 2021 revealed a deteriorating picture on family finances, with household incomes set to stagnate as a result of rising inflation.\n\"Higher taxes aren't a surprise, given the UK is combining fiscal conservatism with an ageing society and a slow-growing economy. But it is the end of low-tax conservatism, with the tax take rising by \u00a33,000 per household by the middle of this decade,\" said Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.\nWith higher growth, inflation and public spending than previously expected, combined with tax rises already in train, the Foundation warns that the UK could be set for a flat recovery for household living standards.\nThe combined effect of universal credit changes, alcohol and fuel duties, higher council tax, income tax and national insurance delivered a 2.8% boost to the incomes of the poorest households. \nBut middle-income households will see incomes drop by 2% and the richest fifth of households will suffer a 3.1% hit by the middle of the decade, the Foundation warned. \nIn the wider population, wages are set to fall next year after inflation. \nIt means the last decade has been the weakest decade for pay growth since the 1930s. \nBy May 2024, real wages will have grown by just 2.4% since 2008 -  compared with a 38% real wage increase between 1992 and 2008. \n\"The chancellor got some really good news for the public finances yesterday - lower borrowing, because the economy's doing slightly better than we all though six months ago. But good news for public finances wasn't good news for household finances,\" the Foundation's Mr Bell told BBC Breakfast.\n\"That's because higher inflation that actually helped the chancellor with his borrowing figures is obviously hurting household budgets, and that's why the Office for Budget Responsibility expects household incomes and wages to actually not grow at all in the next year.\n\"So that's going to be really bad news for everyone worrying about their own budgets.\""

      "tags": "Rachel Reeves,Chancellor's Autumn Statement,Rishi Sunak,Budget 2021",
      "text": "Wednesday's Budget - which saw tax and spending rise to record levels - represents a major shift in Tory philosophy, a minister has claimed.\nThe party has traditionally tried to cut taxes and keep spending down.\nTreasury Secretary Simon Clarke said it was still committed to low taxes but made \"no apologies\" for increasing public spending.\nRishi Sunak told MPs the higher tax burden is down to the \"unprecedented crisis\" of the pandemic. \nBut the chancellor also turned on the spending taps in his Budget, after being widely expected to make cuts to in many government departments to help pay down the deficit.\nHe committed to spending increases of \u00a3150bn over three years, including nearly \u00a32bn to help schools in England catch up following coronavirus, \u00a36bn to tackle NHS backlogs and \u00a37bn for transport projects.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank said the spending plans were \"more similar\" to those of the Labour governments in the 2000s than those of George Osborne - a former Conservative chancellor.\nMr Clarke told BBC Newsnight: \"The chancellor was very open about the fact that this is something of a philosophical shift. \n\"What we want to see is to get the economy turbocharged, unlock productivity, and to deliver growth more evenly across UK. That does require some upfront spending.\"\nMr Sunak has sought to calm the fears of some Conservative MPs that the party has abandoned its core economic principles.\n\"Taxes are rising to their highest level as a percentage of GDP since the 1950s - I don't like it, but I cannot apologise for it - it's the result of the unprecedented crisis,\" he said in his Budget speech.\n\"But now, we have a choice,\" he said, adding \"do we want to live in a country where the response to every question is: \"what is the government going to do about it?\"\n\"Or do we choose to recognise that government has limits, that government should have limits.\"\nHe later insisted to ITV's Robert Peston that this was not \"empty rhetoric\", adding that both he and the prime minister wanted to deliver lower taxes by the end of the Parliament.\nHe also told a meeting of backbench Conservative MPs on Wednesday night that \"in the future every marginal pound should be put into lowering taxes\".\nLabour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves told ITV News that it was important to raise money \"but not in the way the government is doing it\". \nShe said the government was introducing big taxes but said \"those taxes are not falling on the banks - bankers got a tax cut\" in reference to a 5% cut in the surcharge levied on banks' profits. \nShe added that Labour would raise taxes on \"online giants who aren't paying their fair share\". \nJust before the chancellor got to his feet, one former minister on the right of the party said he hoped this would be a pivot moment: back to the kind of government action, where Conservatives were seeking to shrink the state, seeking to reduce taxes, seeking to pull back from some of the very big government moves they made because of the pandemic.\nRishi Sunak had a little bit of extra cash to play with, but instead of using that wriggle room he had, to signal the government was going to become smaller, in fact he staked his post out in a landscape where big government is here to stay, and eye-watering levels of tax are here to stay for the foreseeable future (although he seemed to dangle a promise of tax cuts before the next election).\nThat has created Conservative tensions but clearly it's the political calculation of him and Boris Johnson that it's the right thing to do.\nMr Sunak also used his Budget to repeat pre-announced measures, including an end to the public sector pay freeze and an increase to the National Living Wage from \u00a38.91 per hour to \u00a39.50.\nAccording to Office for Budget Responsibility figures, household disposable income is set to rise by 0.8% per year.\nEconomic growth is forecast to rise to 6.3% next year - higher than previously predicted - but it will then slow to 1.3% by 2023.\nNew Budget measures included:\nAnd the chancellor scrapped next year's planned increase in business rates in England and promised more frequent revaluations, and tax breaks for firms that make improvements to their properties, from 2023.\nThe government has faced strong criticism over its decision to reduce the universal credit benefit by \u00a320-a-week. \nMr Sunak did not offer to maintain the \u00a320 uplift - introduced during the pandemic - but instead announced that the \"taper\" would be cut so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every \u00a31 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p.\nMs Reeves said that would not make up for the wider cuts to universal credit which affected five million families.

This means the risk of known variants entering the UK has reduced and the government can confidently remove these seven destinations from the red list.\"\nThe list of nations and territories whose Covid vaccinations are recognised by the UK is also being expanded, and will now include more than 135 countries in total.\nThe changes will come into effect at 04:00 BST on Monday.\nThe governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern confirmed they would also be adopting the changes, following the initial announcement by the DfT for passengers arriving in England.\nThe DfT said the red list would be reviewed every three weeks, with data - including the emergence of new variants - monitored in case countries needed to be added back on.\nMr Shapps said the red list system itself would be reviewed again in the new year but it was \"prudent\" for the government to keep several hundred hotel rooms available on \"standby\".\n\"We don't want to re-set up a system from scratch if a particular concern was seen in a particular country and we wanted to be able to have quarantine as a mandatory facility,\" he said.\nScotland's Transport Minister Graeme Dey said the move would help the tourism sector \"take another step back towards normal operations\".\nBut he said: \"The pandemic is not over. The situation will be closely monitored and regularly reviewed and if the situation demands it we will not hesitate to re-impose restrictions.\"\nWales said the changes were \"not without risk\" and it remained \"concerned\" by the speed international travel was opening up.\nOver the next two weeks, quarantine hotels will empty. \nFor many with family and friends in the seven remaining countries on the red list, it will be a relief. \nBut for the travel industry, it's mostly a symbolic move. The announcement won't make a huge difference to the number of flights coming into the UK - the red list had already shrunk dramatically earlier this month. \nInstead, the industry sees it as further reassurance that travel is opening up, not closing down. For the first time this year, no matter where you travel from in the world, if you are recognised as fully vaccinated you won't need to quarantine.\nHowever, the government haven't ruled out quarantine hotels altogether in the future if the global situation changes.\nPandemic travel rules in the UK were simplified earlier this month, when the amber list was dropped completely, and advice against holidays changed for many countries.\nFully vaccinated travellers arriving in England from countries including all EU nations, the US, Australia, India, Pakistan, the UAE and Hong Kong need only have a lateral flow test on arrival. Arrivals in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently must have the more expensive PCR test although this will change on Sunday.\nPeople over the age of 18 who are not fully vaccinated or are arriving from a country not on the approved vaccination list have to self-isolate at home for 10 days after arrival in the UK - and pay for a PCR or lateral flow test in the three days before they travel to the UK, and two tests after their return.\nRed list countries are those the government said should not be visited \"except in the most extreme of circumstances\". The list was introduced as part of measures to reduce the potential risk from travellers infected with coronavirus. \nTravellers arriving from a red list destination have been required to self-isolate in a government-designated hotel for 11 nights at a cost of \u00a32,285.\nMore than 200,000 people have stayed in quarantine in hotels since February. \nThe now-abandoned amber list applied to countries where infections were not seen to be as serious. It initially required passengers to quarantine at home after their arrival, but this restriction was later dropped for the fully-vaccinated when lockdown restrictions ended in July. \nTim Alderslade, from industry body Airlines UK, said the announcement \"should provide further reassurance to passengers as we get closer to the key Christmas and January booking window\". \nHe added: \"We now need to go further by removing testing altogether for the fully vaccinated and committing to reviewing all restrictions by the end of the year.\"\nGary Lewis, from the Travel Network Group representing independent travel businesses, said the industry \"will be breathing a sigh of relief... We hope that this move helps to build customer confidence and reassure people that they can book trips and travel\".\nBut Clive Wratten, head of the Business Travel Association, said \"the lurking threat of further introductions to this list and the continued existence of quarantine hotels means that it does not give travellers the confidence that they need\".\nPaul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, said there was \"no justification\" for the red list to remain, adding: \"The best approach is to check for an individual's vaccine status and ensure they are up to date if they want to travel without restrictions.\"\nConsumer group Which? has advised travellers to be aware the changes only reflect requirements for arriving back in the UK and they still could face restrictions on entry to some destinations, especially if they were not fully-vaccinated.\nUK Covid cases have been rising since the end of September, although there are now signs of a small fall. The UK recorded another 39,842 cases on Thursday, and there were 165 deaths of people with 28 days of a positive test. "

      "text": "Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 350 million confirmed cases and more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. \nThe US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. \nVery few places have been left untouched. \nThe latest available data for the total number of cases in France since the start of the pandemic is from 16 January. \nIn the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands."

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "tags": "HM Treasury,Money,Tax,Personal finance,Personal debt,UK taxes,Rishi Sunak,Budget 2021,Pay",
      "text": "This is not the first, but the second Budget delivered by Chancellor Rishi Sunak this year. It is certainly not the first time we have heard some of the content.\nDespite a swathe of announcements having been released in advance, the measures as a whole will have a significant impact on your finances. This is how the money in your pocket will be affected. \nIf you are working and also receiving universal credit, then you are probably affected by what is officially known as the taper rate. That means the universal credit payment you receive is reduced as you earn more.\nFor every pound earned (sometimes above a base level of earnings known as the work allowance), 63p is automatically deducted from your benefit payment.\nBy reducing that to 55p, the chancellor is allowing people to keep more of what they earn. By raising the work allowance, the same is true.\nDepending on their circumstances around two million would be better off, but another two million claimants will see no benefit because they either do not work or do not earn enough. \nIt is a significant policy in tackling the rising cost of living which will be brought in \"within weeks\" and no later than 1 December. It comes after criticism of cancelling the \u00a320-a-week universal credit uplift given during the pandemic which had benefitted 5.5 million people.\nThere is plenty of evidence of prices going up in the shops and on bills, with the cost of living expected to rise by 4% over the next year according to official forecasters.\nThere has been a freeze on fuel duty for more than a decade and this will continue for at least another year, as drivers are hit by higher prices at the pumps.\nAbout 60% of the price you pay for fuel is tax - a mixture of fuel duty and VAT.\nHowever, there were no measures to assist householders with rising domestic gas and electricity bills.\nThose on minimum wages will receive a significant pay rise in April. For those aged 23 and above the rate - known as the National Living Wage - will go up by 6.6%, as the hourly rate increases from \u00a38.91 to \u00a39.50.\nThere will also be increases in the minimum wage for younger workers. \nIf they also receive universal credit, they could be affected by the taper rate mentioned earlier.\nHow much is the minimum wage?\nPublic sector staff will also receive a pay rise in April when the freeze on wages in place during the pandemic is lifted. How much this amounts to, and whether it equates to more than the rising cost of living, will be decided at later date.\nThe government's official, independent forecasters - the Office for Budget Responsibility - said that real incomes for everyone would typically rise very slowly in the coming years. Household income rises, after taking into account inflation and changes in tax will be no higher than 1.5% a year for each year up to and including 2026.\nIn the year from April 2022, a middle earner's take-home pay will fall by about 1%, or \u00a3180 per year, in real terms.\nDrinking is getting more expensive, with pub chains warning that higher wages and energy costs will mean much higher prices for a pint.\nHowever, Mr Sunak announced an overhaul which he described as \"the most radical simplification of alcohol duties for 140 years\", coming into force in February 2023.\nThis will lead to higher-strength drinks going up in price, but lower duty on drinks ranging from sparkling wine to draught beer.\nThere will be no immediate increase in alcohol duties, contrary to what often happens on Budget day.\nThe cost of smoking is rising again, with an above-inflation rise in duty on cigarettes and an 11% rise in duty on hand-rolling tobacco, taking effect within hours.\nMr Sunak said he planned to reduce taxes during the rest of this Parliament.\nAlthough announced before this Budget, two massive tax decisions had already been made that will affect your money in the coming years.\nIn the last Budget, Mr Sunak said the thresholds as which income tax is paid would be frozen at April 2021 levels for five years (although Scotland has different levels). That means pay rises will push more people into higher tax bands.\nIn September, the government also announced employees, employers and the self-employed would all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance (NI) from April 2022 to fund social care.\nThe cost of a domestic flight ticket could be cut, but very long-haul flights could get more expensive.\nThat is because the chancellor has made changes to Air Passenger Duty - a levy paid by airlines, but ultimately funded by passengers through the cost of their tickets.\nMany homeowners of high-rise flats have faced crippling costs owing to the cladding crisis, following the Grenfell Tower tragedy.\nA levy on the biggest property developers of high rises to pay for the removal of dangerous cladding has been confirmed by the chancellor.\nTo help those of the youngest age, there is extra funding for projects supporting new parents.\nThere is also a new UK-wide programme to improve numeracy skills. The chancellor said that individuals with poor numeracy faced up to \u00a31,600 a year in lost earnings, according to the charity National Numeracy."

Its sister station 5 Live Sports Extra was also up, to 1.6 million.\nThe increase in radio listening as a whole, juxtaposed with the decrease for breakfast show audiences, suggests the figures reflect how listening habits and lifestyles have been changed by the pandemic.\nWhile fewer people might listen to a breakfast show, some radio stations noted their daytime figures were up, likely a result of people listening more while working at home during the day.\nRajar said 89% of the UK population listen to radio at least once a week, with the average listener clocking up just over 20 hours of listening over seven days.\nA great deal of radio listening is now on digital platforms such as DAB, smartphone and tablet apps or websites. Around 74% of people surveyed said they listen digitally every week.\nSmart speakers now account for a large proportion of listening - around 48% of people who own speakers said they used it to listen to radio weekly. \nOf those users, 20% said they listen to radio via a smart speaker on a daily basis.\nRajar figures were suspended during the pandemic, as the industry body was not able to conduct its usual face-to-face research.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Petrol stations in many parts of China have begun rationing diesel amid rising costs and falling supplies. \nSome truck drivers are having to wait entire days to refuel, according to posts on social media site Weibo.\nChina is currently in the midst of a massive power crunch, as coal and natural gas shortages have closed factories and left homes without power. \nAnd this latest issue is only likely to contribute to an ongoing global supply chain crisis, say analysts.\n\"The current diesel shortages seem to be affecting long distance transportation businesses which could include goods meant for markets outside of China,\" said Mattie Bekink, China Director at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\"Depending on the duration and intensity of this crunch, we could well see this contribute to the global supply chain challenges.\"\nThe global supply chain crisis has been largely driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, with demand surging as economies re-open.\nIn China, trucks are only being allowed to fill up 100 litres each - about 10% of their capacity, a truck dealer from Shijiazhuang city in Hebei province told Chinese business news service Caixin.  \nIn other parts of the country, reports suggest rations are even tighter with drivers only allowed to buy up to 25 litres.  \nMeanwhile, in the city of Fuyang, about a seven hour drive south of the key transportation hub of Shijiazhuang, Caixin reports petrol stations are limiting purchases or charging drivers surcharges of up to 300 yuan ($47, \u00a334) to fill up their tanks. \n\"After going to a few [petrol] stations, there is no more diesel, and prices will continue to rise, and large trucks running logistics will not be able to refuel,\" one Weibo user wrote.\nAnother also bemoaned the impact on inflation and deliveries.\n\"Do you get the feeling that food has become more expensive and the express delivery is slower?  It would be better to buy less on 11/11,\" referring to Alibaba's Single's Day, typically one of the biggest days of the year in China's shopping calendar. \nAidan Yao, a senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers, told the BBC while the market is well aware of China's coal shortage, the \"diesel problem is new\".\n\"All fossil fuels have seen a price renaissance lately as the underinvestment in these fuel sources has created a shortfall of supply at a time when demand is surging,\" he said. \n\"Oil, gas, coal prices have all moved in tandem and are through the roof.\"\nOil prices have hit their highest levels since 2014 in recent weeks, causing fuel crises in places such as Europe and the UK. \nPart of this has been driven by coal and natural gas shortages in countries like China and India, which analysts predict will see users switch to oil for power generation and heating. \nSuch demand could boost overall crude consumption by more than half a million barrels of oil a day.\n\"This is merely the latest manifestation of shortages impacting China,\" Jeremy Stevens, Chief China Economist at Standard Bank told the BBC from Beijing.\nHe said companies are already turning to diesel-fuelled generators to keep their factories open during the power crunch. \n\"The heart of the matter is the energy crisis,\" he said. \nBoth Mr Yao and Mr Stevens warned that these current power crises show the dangers of switching to renewables too quickly. \n\"The path to net zero is treacherous and the journey needs to be planned carefully,\" Mr Yao said.\nAdditional reporting by Wai Yee Yip"

      "tags": "Economics,UK economy,Budget 2021,Institute for Fiscal Studies",
      "text": "Millions of people are set to be worse off next year amid spiralling costs and tax rises, says an economic think tank.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that inflation and higher taxes on incomes would negate small wage increases for middle earners.\nLow-income households will also feel \"real pain\" as the cost of living is set to increase faster than benefit payments, it said.\nThe chancellor acknowledged in his Budget that families are under strain.\nPaul Johnson, director of the IFS, said that \"millions will be worse off in the short term\" as a result of soaring costs.\nOn Wednesday, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned that the cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years.\nIts latest forecast predicted that inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% in 2022. \nThe chancellor said it was because of increased demand for energy and supply chain issues as economies and factories recover from coronavirus curbs.\nBut the OBR pointed that supply constraints had been exacerbated by Brexit. \nIt added that once rising prices and rising taxes are taken into account, average household incomes are set to fall next year and won't recover before 2023. \nIn its analysis of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's second Budget of 2021, the IFS described the chancellor's delivery as \"upbeat\".\nBut Mr Johnson added: \"Unfortunately for him, and for us, the outlook for living standards does not match this upbeat tone.\"\nOver the next few years, increases to income tax and national insurance, paired with rising household bills, \"will mean very slow growth in living standards\", he said.\nNew IFS analysis suggests that over the next year, middle earners on about \u00a325,000 will find their pre-tax pay just about outpaces price rises. \nBut once extra income taxes are due, their take-home pay will fall by about 1%, or \u00a3180 per year, after accounting for inflation.\nThat comes after an already tough decade for households, the IFS said. Had average earnings kept pace with trends seen before the financial crisis in 2008, they would have been 40% higher, its research found.\nMr Sunak defended his Budget, telling BBC Breakfast that it had \"cut taxes for millions of the lowest-paid\".\nOn Wednesday, the chancellor announced that the universal credit \"taper\" rate would be cut by 8% no later than 1 December, so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every \u00a31 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p.\nThe National Living Wage will also increase next year by 6.6%, to \u00a39.50 an hour.\nMr Sunak added that it was his job to be concerned about inflation and his new fiscal rules were \"how we build up resilience\".\nBut Paul Johnson said that price rises meant that \"real pain\" would now be felt, as low-income households, which it describes as those working full-time and earning the National Living Wage, wait for their incomes to catch up.\n\"For some in work, that may never happen,\" he said.\nAfter the political theatre of Budget Day, experts spend the following night and day backstage working out the impact on your household finances.\nThe answer to that question, as always, depends on your stage and circumstances in life.\nIf you are low-paid and in work, then the Budget had some comforting news for you - such as the minimum wage rises and universal credit changes - although that won't happen immediately.\nIn contrast, middle-earners and those out of work are facing a more worrying squeeze. Pensioners, concerned about hefty rises in bills to heat their homes, are feeling a bit forgotten.\nFor everyone, the next act is all about the cost of living. If prices rise at the top end of forecasts, then millions of people's financial situation could become quite a drama. \nSetting out his Budget on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said it marked a \"new age of optimism\", announcing across-the-board spending increases for government departments.\nBut the fiscal event has also taken the UK's current tax burden to the highest level seen since the 1950s. \nMr Sunak described \"corrective action\" as necessary in order to pay back huge sums of money, borrowed during the pandemic to fund support programmes such as the furlough scheme.\nBut Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What he's done is use the pandemic as cover for what I think was probably necessary - a big increase in NHS spending, being funded by this increase in National Insurance contributions, and undoing some of the very big cuts we've seen to the justice, further education and school system over the last decade.\"\nHe pointed to the fact that the OBR has also reduced its estimate of the long-term \"scarring\" effect of Covid-19 on the economy from 3% to 2%.\nHe suggested that the chancellor might hope to undo some tax rises in the future.\nMr Johnson also described the stagnation in living standards as \"a very important political point\" in a later interview with the BBC.\n\"If we're not getting better off over time, we're not going to feel so happy with the status quo,\" he said.\nA spokesperson for the Treasury said that the government is \"taking targeted action worth more than \u00a34.2 billion a year to help families with the cost of living\".\nThey described the decision to raise taxes as \"difficult\", but said that households would benefit from further investment in public services.\nThey said government decisions such as freezes to alcohol and fuel duty and the warm home discount \"have been worth nearly \u00a3500 per year extra to households on average, and more than \u00a31,000 for the poorest households\"."

      "text": "The chancellor has said his Budget - including tax cuts to air tax - will help the government meet its net zero carbon targets. \nRishi Sunak used his Budget to slash taxes on domestic flights, which is forecast to lead to 400,000 extra air journeys a year.\nLabour's shadow chancellor said it was \"astonishing\", coming a week before the COP26 climate summit.\nRachel Reeves said people should be encouraged to use trains instead. \nFlying within the UK will become cheaper with air passenger duty halved but the chancellor is also increasing duties on \"ultra long haul\" flights.\nMr Sunak told MPs on Wednesday he wanted to remove an anomaly that meant people were taxed more to fly in the UK than to Europe. \nIt has led to accusations from opposition politicians and environmentalists that cheaper prices will spark a domestic flying boom, at a time when ministers are urgently trying to tackle climate change. \nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast it could lead to more than 400,000 extra passenger journeys a year, a 3.5% increase.\nFriends of the Earth's head of policy, Mike Childs, said the chancellor's plans were \"shockingly bad\" and will \"simply prolong the UK's dependency on fossil fuels\".\nAnd SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, called the move a \"disgrace\" and urged the chancellor to scrap it. \nHe said it proved \"this is not a government that understands the climate challenge that we all face\" because \"the fact is that C02 emissions per mile are much higher on domestic flights than they are on long-haul flights\". \nBut speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Sunak said it was important to look at the decision \"in the round\", alongside the introduction of a new, higher tax band for \"ultra long-haul flights\".\nHe said he wanted to deliver on a previous commitment to reform air passenger duty, \"to return to the system that we used to have, so people flying within the UK are not taxed twice, which we never thought was right\".\nHe added: \"It supports the Union, it supports regional airports which are  big employers but also, if you take a step back, aviation in general only accounts for about 7 or 8% of our overall carbon emissions and of that, I think domestic aviation is less than 5% so it is a tiny proportion.\"\nAnd speaking on BBC Breakfast, the chancellor said the policy would actually help the UK progress towards its net zero objectives.\nHe said: \"Those who fly the furthest will pay the highest rates of APD (air passenger duty), that's consistent with our environmental objectives, that's a new band that will come into force, and, actually, yesterday the independent watchdog (OBR)  said that our plans in the round will reduce carbon emission and move us further along the path to net zero.\"\nOn the issue of air passenger tax changes, the OBR said \"while the Budget includes tax measures that could assist on the path to net zero, it also includes tax measures that will make the job of getting there more difficult\u2026.by lowering the price of motoring and domestic air travel over the next five years.\"\nThe Treasury has stressed that the domestic air duty policy needs to be seen within the context of the government's overall strategy to move to net zero, rather than being viewed in isolation. \nBut Labour said it would not have gone ahead with the cut. \nRachel Reeves told Today she found it \"astonishing that, the week before COP26, where we are supposed to be showing global leadership, we have cut air passenger duty on domestic flights\".\nShe added: \"We should be encouraging people to use our train network for those journeys.\n\"As I said yesterday, if you are a banker on a short haul flight sipping champagne you would have been cheering in the budget yesterday. \n\"If you are on a modest income and you are worried about the rising cost of living, frankly there is very little to cheer.\""

      "tags": "Travel,Travel & leisure industry,Air travel,Grant Shapps,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The remaining seven countries on the UK government's Covid travel red list will be removed from next Monday.\nFully-vaccinated arrivals from Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Peru, Panama, Haiti and Venezuela will no longer have to quarantine in a hotel. \nBut the red list system will be kept in place and a country could be added back on it if cases rise there.\nThe changes announced by the Department for Transport will apply to passengers arriving in all four nations of the UK.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was a \"great boost for travel and all those people employed in the travel sector\".\nHe added: \"We have been able to do this now because the variants of concern that we have been tracking are no longer of concern to the chief medical officers.\"\nThe DfT said \"Delta is now the dominant variant in most countries around the world. This means the risk of known variants entering the UK has reduced and the government can confidently remove these seven destinations from the red list.\"\nThe list of nations and territories whose Covid vaccinations are recognised by the UK is also being expanded, and will now include more than 135 countries in total.\nThe changes will come into effect at 04:00 BST on Monday.\nThe governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern confirmed they would also be adopting the changes, following the initial announcement by the DfT for passengers arriving in England.\nThe DfT said the red list would be reviewed every three weeks, with data - including the emergence of new variants - monitored in case countries needed to be added back on.\nMr Shapps said the red list system itself would be reviewed again in the new year but it was \"prudent\" for the government to keep several hundred hotel rooms available on \"standby\".\n\"We don't want to re-set up a system from scratch if a particular concern was seen in a particular country and we wanted to be able to have quarantine as a mandatory facility,\" he said.\nScotland's Transport Minister Graeme Dey said the move would help the tourism sector \"take another step back towards normal operations\".\nBut he said: \"The pandemic is not over. The situation will be closely monitored and regularly reviewed and if the situation demands it we will not hesitate to re-impose restrictions.\"\nWales said the changes were \"not without risk\" and it remained \"concerned\" by the speed international travel was opening up.\nOver the next two weeks, quarantine hotels will empty. \nFor many with family and friends in the seven remaining countries on the red list, it will be a relief. \nBut for the travel industry, it's mostly a symbolic move. The announcement won't make a huge difference to the number of flights coming into the UK - the red list had already shrunk dramatically earlier this month. \nInstead, the industry sees it as further reassurance that travel is opening up, not closing down. For the first time this year, no matter where you travel from in the world, if you are recognised as fully vaccinated you won't need to quarantine.\nHowever, the government haven't ruled out quarantine hotels altogether in the future if the global situation changes.\nPandemic travel rules in the UK were simplified earlier this month, when the amber list was dropped completely, and advice against holidays changed for many countries.\nFully vaccinated travellers arriving in England from countries including all EU nations, the US, Australia, India, Pakistan, the UAE and Hong Kong need only have a lateral flow test on arrival. Arrivals in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently must have the more expensive PCR test although this will change on Sunday.\nPeople over the age of 18 who are not fully vaccinated or are arriving from a country not on the approved vaccination list have to self-isolate at home for 10 days after arrival in the UK - and pay for a PCR or lateral flow test in the three days before they travel to the UK, and two tests after their return.\nRed list countries are those the government said should not be visited \"except in the most extreme of circumstances\". The list was introduced as part of measures to reduce the potential risk from travellers infected with coronavirus. \nTravellers arriving from a red list destination have been required to self-isolate in a government-designated hotel for 11 nights at a cost of \u00a32,285.\nMore than 200,000 people have stayed in quarantine in hotels since February. \nThe now-abandoned amber list applied to countries where infections were not seen to be as serious. It initially required passengers to quarantine at home after their arrival, but this restriction was later dropped for the fully-vaccinated when lockdown restrictions ended in July. \nTim Alderslade, from industry body Airlines UK, said the announcement \"should provide further reassurance to passengers as we get closer to the key Christmas and January booking window\". \nHe added: \"We now need to go further by removing testing altogether for the fully vaccinated and committing to reviewing all restrictions by the end of the year.\"\nGary Lewis, from the Travel Network Group representing independent travel businesses, said the industry \"will be breathing a sigh of relief... We hope that this move helps to build customer confidence and reassure people that they can book trips and travel\".\nBut Clive Wratten, head of the Business Travel Association, said \"the lurking threat of further introductions to this list and the continued existence of quarantine hotels means that it does not give travellers the confidence that they need\".\nPaul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, said there was \"no justification\" for the red list to remain, adding: \"The best approach is to check for an individual's vaccine status and ensure they are up to date if they want to travel without restrictions.\"\nConsumer group Which? has advised travellers to be aware the changes only reflect requirements for arriving back in the UK and they still could face restrictions on entry to some destinations, especially if they were not fully-vaccinated.\nUK Covid cases have been rising since the end of September, although there are now signs of a small fall. The UK recorded another 39,842 cases on Thursday, and there were 165 deaths of people with 28 days of a positive test. "

      "text": "Scrapped Covid rules could be brought back to allow Wales to have a \"normal\" Christmas, First Minister Mark Drakeford has warned.\nNew measures are already being brought in to tackle Wales' high Covid rates - the worst in the UK.\nCovid passes will be extended to cinemas, theatres and concert halls from 15 November as part of the plans.\nPubs, restaurants and cafes might also require passes if infections climb, amid a \"wider repertoire of actions\".\nThe passes show whether someone has been fully vaccinated or whether they have had a negative lateral flow test in the past 48 hours.\nObtained online, they are already required for nightclubs and many large events.\nAt Friday's coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said about 2,000 cases of a new and possibly more transmissible form of the Delta variant had been identified in Wales.\nThe infection rate in Wales is currently the highest it has ever been, and the highest in the UK.\n\"This is largely being driven by very high levels of infections in younger people and among family members and close contacts at home,\" he said.\n\"Mistakes at a private laboratory in England, which resulted in thousands of people wrongly being told their tests were negative, may have further fuelled the growth in cases in south-east Wales, where rates are highest.\"\nHe added: \"All this means the pandemic is far from over.\"\nThe extension of the Covid pass scheme could be subject to a vote in the Senedd before it is implemented.\nSelf-isolation guidance for people who are fully vaccinated will also change.\nThe government will now ask people to self-isolate if someone in their household has symptoms or tests positive, until they get a negative PCR test. The advice will also apply to those aged five to 17.\nThere are no plans to ban crowds from sports fixtures, as seen at the height of the pandemic.\nMr Drakeford said the Covid pass system had already been \"well-managed and well-observed\" at football matches in Wales.\nWales play New Zealand at Cardiff's Principality Stadium on Saturday in the largest mass event since crowds were allowed back through the turnstiles. \nFans - including the first minister - must show a Covid pass.\n\"That gives me the confidence of knowing everybody else attending the game is either double vaccinated or has had a lateral flow test in the run-up to attending,\" said Mr Drakeford.\n\"By putting these extra measures in place we believe we will be able to keep those venues operating in a way they are now, for longer.\"\nThe Wales Millennium Centre said it welcomed any moves that would help ensure the safety of its audiences and allow it to remain open, particularly before Christmas.\nArtistic director Graeme Farrow said: \"Timing is the only issue because we would have limited time to implement these changes in a climate when it's not easy to recruit more people. However the last thing we want is to close again.\"\nKelly Jolliffe, the landlady at the Greyhound Inn in Usk, Monmouthshire, would also support the need to show Covid passes in pubs, even it meant some customers decided not to come.\n\"I would much rather a pub full of safe people so I'm absolutely for it,\" she said.\n\"I think my customers and staff would feel a lot more comfortable and confident if that came in and I could implement that straight away.\n\"My only concern is the technology needed. We have an old pub with thick stone walls and the wi-fi is not great, but we could easily check a pass on a phone.\"\nHowever Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, tweeted that the proposed extension would be \"catastrophic\" for the industry.\n\"No furlough, grant or other support, a combination of working from home and wider use of vaccine passports would see many businesses struggling to survive,\" she said.\nSteve Reynolds, director of Picturedrome Cinemas, which runs Maxime cinema in Blackwood, Caerphilly county, said he felt cinemas and theatres were being singled out.\nHe said: \"I would ask the Welsh government to really think, 'are cinemas the main spread of coronavirus?' Why are they picking on this section of the entertainment business?\n\"In Blackwood, the cinema would be the only building requiring [Covid passes]. That doesn't seem fair or that it's going to restrict the spread.\n\"We're disappointed because business levels were just starting to get back to somewhere near normal. We'll also have to put extra staff on duty to do this, which would be an expense\"\nWales is currently at alert level zero after most of the remaining lockdown rules were lifted in August, though people are required to wear masks in some indoor public areas.\nMinisters have repeatedly said they do not expect a return to lockdown-style restrictions.\nHowever, they have not ruled it out and have drawn up a plan - called Covid Urgent - for doing so if pressure on the NHS becomes unsustainable.\nIf implemented, it would mean the Welsh government going further than Plan B in England - which Conservative UK ministers have been under pressure to introduce - but much of which is already in place in Wales.\nMr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast \"thousands of people\" are falling ill every day in Wales, effecting the NHS and workplaces.\nLatest figures show the Welsh Covid rate standing at 685.5 per 100,000 people over seven days to last Saturday. \nIt has fallen from 742.4 on 20 October, but remains the highest in the UK, compared to England (480), Northern Ireland (467) and Scotland (324).\nOn Friday, Public Health Wales reported a further seven people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid, bringing the total number of deaths in Wales to 6,141. Another 2,561 cases were also reported.\nMr Drakeford warned that if infections continued to rise in the next three weeks, more restrictions could return.\n\"We are not planning to have a Christmas of the sort we had to endure last year\u2026 but taking the actions we're talking about today will be critical to allowing us to be in that position,\" he said.\n\"None of us wants to see a return to restrictions but if rates continue to rise, the cabinet will have no choice but to consider raising the alert level at the next review.\"\nThe first minister urged the hospitality industry to use the next three weeks \"to prepare for the possibility\" of an extended use of Covid passes.\nBusinesses could also be asked to look at their risk assessments and also review social distancing guidelines in the workplace.\nThe next review is due in three weeks but the Welsh Conservatives and Lib Dems both oppose any expansion of Covid passes.\nThe introduction of the passes was narrowly secured when a Tory Member of the Senedd failed to vote remotely. \nWelsh Tory health spokesman Russell George said his party remained unconvinced they were the right approach, adding: \"We've seen the case numbers in Wales increase since they were introduced.\"\nWelsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds said Covid passes were both \"illiberal and unworkable\". \n\"Recent leaked evidence from the UK government only last week continues to demonstrate that in addition to concerns over civil liberties, the scheme may be counterproductive, pushing people from larger venues into poorly ventilated smaller venues,\" she said.\nPlaid Cymru said a stronger \"vaccination passport\" was a way forward and did not believe the Welsh government had provided evidence that its Covid pass scheme would be effective.\n\"We're looking again for that evidence as we look forward to this second vote,\" the party's health spokesman, Rhun ap Iorwerth said.\nHe called for a \"reset\" on the Covid strategy, adding the Welsh government's actions were \"clearly not working\"."

      "text": "UK government plans to reform alcohol taxation might not apply in Northern Ireland due to the protocol.\nThe new system, due to start in 2023, will mean higher duty for stronger alcohol, the chancellor said.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has pointed out that EU rules on alcohol duty continue to apply in Northern Ireland.\nIFS associate director David Phillips said the structure of alcohol taxes in NI must still conform to EU rules.\nThe protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and as part of that EU excise duty rules continue to apply.\nThe EU sets a minimum rate of tax for alcoholic drinks but it is open to member states to apply tax at a rate higher than the minimum.\nMore relevant to Chancellor Rishi Sunak's proposed reforms is the structure of EU alcohol duties.\nIn simple terms, it means that wine or cider cannot be taxed in proportion to their alcohol content but beers and spirits can be.\nThe chancellor is proposing to change to a system which would mean higher taxes on fortified wines, like Buckfast, and lower taxes on lighter wines, like rose.\nMr Phillips suggested the government could apply some of the reforms in Northern Ireland or separate the Northern Ireland and Great Britain alcohol tax regimes.\nBut he added that could \"further entrench the checks and complexity for trade in alcohol products\".\nThe protocol does make a provision that the EU and UK may review the application of excise duty rules to take into account \"Northern Ireland's integral place in the UK's internal market\".\nThat implies that some sort of special arrangement could be negotiated.\nThe treasury consultation document on the reform says: \"Government is aware that under Article 8 of the Northern Ireland Protocol this directive and other EU legislation continue to apply in Northern Ireland.\n\"Accordingly, the government has announced in its command paper of 21 July 2021 that it is seeking a more flexible settlement regarding excise laws applicable in Northern Ireland.\n\"The government will continue to discuss the application of these reforms to Northern Ireland with the EU during the consultation period of the review.\""

      "tags": "France,Fishing,Brexit,Macduff,Fishing industry",
      "text": "A British trawler has been seized by France and another has been fined, amid an escalating row over post-Brexit fishing rights.\nFrench maritime minister Annick Girardin said the ships were cautioned during checks off Le Havre overnight.\nShe said the first did not comply right away and the second was not allowed to fish in French waters so was detained. \nNo 10 said it was watching events closely and wanted France and EU talks but was ready to respond appropriately.\nEarlier, the environment secretary said he was \"urgently\" investigating the situation in relation to the detained vessel - which has been named as the Cornelis Gert Jan.\nResponding to an Urgent Commons Question from the SNP, George Eustice said the boat was on a list provided by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) initially provided to the European Union.\nHe insisted the European Union did grant a licence to the vessel but it was \"unclear\" why, according to reports, it was subsequently withdrawn from the list.\nMr Eustice said he was awaiting further details from Marine Scotland and was expecting a response in the \"next hour or so\". \nDeidre Brock, the SNP's environment spokesperson, said it was not good enough that the environment secretary had so little information. \nMacDuff Shellfish of Scotland, which owns the Cornelis, said the crew of its vessel were \"in good spirits\" after it was \"ordered into a French port while legally fishing for scallop in French waters\".\nThe captain was questioned after leaving the boat with French authorities and being given legal representation by the company. \nMacDuff Shellfish confirmed the captain had been released and returned to the ship, but the Cornelius was \"not at liberty to leave\" the port while the investigation was ongoing. \nThe firm's Andrew Brown said the crew would remain on board until its release.\nHe said Macduff's \"fishing activity [was] entirely legal\" and it appeared the Cornelis, based at Shoreham, in West Sussex, had been \"caught up\" in the ongoing UK-France post-Brexit fishing row.\nMr Brown warned that without \"a speedy resolution\", the vessel's catch could be confiscated by the French authorities, and called on the UK government to \"defend the rights of the UK fishing fleet\".\nThe firm would \"vigorously defend\" itself against any claims, but its \"priority concern\" was for the welfare of the vessel's crew, he said.\nMs Girardin had said on Twitter the trawler was found to be fishing in the Bay of Seine without the proper licences.\nThe minister said checks on the British vessels were standard during the scallop fishing season. \nBut she added they had also been undertaken against \"the backdrop of the tightening of controls in the Channel, in the context of discussions on licenses with the United Kingdom and the European Commission\".\nIn naval parlance, this is called a shot across the bows.\nTechnically, the French checks on UK trawlers in the Channel overnight do not form part of the raft of retaliatory measures announced in the fishing row.  \nBut there should be no doubt they are intended as a message about what is to come.\nFrom Tuesday, British and Channel Islands fishing boats will not be allowed to offload their catch at French ports.  \nBut that is the least of it.  Only 5% of UK seafood exports to France arrive in this way. The rest comes by freight.\nPotentially far more disruptive will be intensified controls at Calais and other entry points for UK trade by ferry and tunnel.  \nThe French authorities will be conducting what they call a \"gr\u00e8ve de z\u00e8le\" - in other words becoming suddenly punctilious, thorough and on the look out for infractions.  \nAnd it is not just fish imports which will be checked, but everything. \nThe aim will be to create long tail-backs which will play on the news channels - reminding UK viewers of the costs of go-it-alone. \nFrance had warned it would block British boats from some ports next week - as well as tightening checks on UK boats and trucks - if a post-Brexit dispute over fishing licences was not resolved by 2 November.\nOn Wednesday evening, it issued its ultimatum, saying it would begin to impose \"targeted measures\" from next Tuesday, including preventing British fishing boats from disembarking at ports and more checks on UK goods.\nFrance has also warned it could cut electricity supplies to Jersey, a British Crown dependency, as it previously threatened in May.\nMr Eustice said threats of sanctions made by France were \"disappointing and disproportionate\" and appeared to breach the post-Brexit deal and international law.\nHe appealed to MPs to \"remain calm\", saying the UK would not get into a \"retaliatory tit-for-tat\" but warned of a possible \"appropriate and calibrated response\" if France carried out its threats.\nMr Eustice rejected French claims that the process for applying for fishing licences had been slow and difficult, saying officials had granted 98% of post-Brexit licence applications from European boats to fish in UK waters.\nHe said more were expected to be granted following \"constructive\" talks with the European Commission and that he had told the French and the Commission that the UK's \"door remains ever open\".\nFrench politician and member of President Macron's En Marche party, Bruno Bonnell, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that French fishermen were \"losing 25% of their business because of regulation\".\nHe said \"in the Brexit treaty we were not supposed to reach this point of tension\" and disagreed with the licensing figures quoted by Mr Eustice, saying 200 licences had been granted.\nMr Bonnell argued French authorities \"have ways to retaliate if you push too hard\" and he \"would not be surprised if by next week we see significant advances\" in discussions.\nThe UK maintains the rejected applications which sparked the row did not have enough supporting evidence to show they had a history of fishing in Britain's or Jersey's waters.\nA meeting with officials from France, Jersey, the UK and European Commission on Wednesday led to 162 French boats being given licences to fish in Jersey's waters from Friday.\nThe government of Jersey said it was \"extremely disappointed\" by the latest threats of sanctions by France. French trawlers previously protested outside the port of St Helier on the island.\nLabour's shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said the tensions were a result of the government losing control of negotiations and there was real concern \"the botched Brexit deal\" was going to lead to more clashes."

      "text": "The chancellor has said his Budget - including tax cuts to air tax - will help the government meet its net zero carbon targets. \nRishi Sunak used his Budget to slash taxes on domestic flights, which is forecast to lead to 400,000 extra air journeys a year.\nLabour's shadow chancellor said it was \"astonishing\", coming a week before the COP26 climate summit.\nRachel Reeves said people should be encouraged to use trains instead. \nFlying within the UK will become cheaper with air passenger duty halved but the chancellor is also increasing duties on \"ultra long haul\" flights.\nMr Sunak told MPs on Wednesday he wanted to remove an anomaly that meant people were taxed more to fly in the UK than to Europe. \nIt has led to accusations from opposition politicians and environmentalists that cheaper prices will spark a domestic flying boom, at a time when ministers are urgently trying to tackle climate change. \nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast it could lead to more than 400,000 extra passenger journeys a year, a 3.5% increase.\nFriends of the Earth's head of policy, Mike Childs, said the chancellor's plans were \"shockingly bad\" and will \"simply prolong the UK's dependency on fossil fuels\".\nAnd SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, called the move a \"disgrace\" and urged the chancellor to scrap it. \nHe said it proved \"this is not a government that understands the climate challenge that we all face\" because \"the fact is that C02 emissions per mile are much higher on domestic flights than they are on long-haul flights\". \nBut speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Sunak said it was important to look at the decision \"in the round\", alongside the introduction of a new, higher tax band for \"ultra long-haul flights\".\nHe said he wanted to deliver on a previous commitment to reform air passenger duty, \"to return to the system that we used to have, so people flying within the UK are not taxed twice, which we never thought was right\".\nHe added: \"It supports the Union, it supports regional airports which are  big employers but also, if you take a step back, aviation in general only accounts for about 7 or 8% of our overall carbon emissions and of that, I think domestic aviation is less than 5% so it is a tiny proportion.\"\nAnd speaking on BBC Breakfast, the chancellor said the policy would actually help the UK progress towards its net zero objectives.\nHe said: \"Those who fly the furthest will pay the highest rates of APD (air passenger duty), that's consistent with our environmental objectives, that's a new band that will come into force, and, actually, yesterday the independent watchdog (OBR)  said that our plans in the round will reduce carbon emission and move us further along the path to net zero.\"\nOn the issue of air passenger tax changes, the OBR said \"while the Budget includes tax measures that could assist on the path to net zero, it also includes tax measures that will make the job of getting there more difficult\u2026.by lowering the price of motoring and domestic air travel over the next five years.\"\nThe Treasury has stressed that the domestic air duty policy needs to be seen within the context of the government's overall strategy to move to net zero, rather than being viewed in isolation. \nBut Labour said it would not have gone ahead with the cut. \nRachel Reeves told Today she found it \"astonishing that, the week before COP26, where we are supposed to be showing global leadership, we have cut air passenger duty on domestic flights\".\nShe added: \"We should be encouraging people to use our train network for those journeys.\n\"As I said yesterday, if you are a banker on a short haul flight sipping champagne you would have been cheering in the budget yesterday. \n\"If you are on a modest income and you are worried about the rising cost of living, frankly there is very little to cheer.\""

      "text": "A health watchdog has scrapped a previous recommendation of graded exercise therapy for ME.\nThe National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published a long-awaited and contentious final update to guidance on treatment.\nMany patients with ME or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) say the therapy, which encourages patients to slowly increase their levels of activity, makes their condition worse.\nThe advice was due out in August. \nBut NICE pulled the publication at the last minute.\nAt that time, NICE said the delay was necessary to allow more conversations with patient groups and professionals, so that its advice would be supported. \nThere are strong and varied views on how the illness should be best managed.\nThe updated guidance for England and Wales recommends people judge their own \"energy limit\" when undertaking activity of any kind, and a physical activity programme should only be considered in specific circumstances. \nIt warns practitioners: \"Do not advise people with ME/CFS to undertake exercise that is not part of a programme overseen by an ME/CFS specialist team, such as telling them to go to the gym or exercise more, because this may worsen their symptoms.\"\nIt also clarifies advice on a talking therapy, known as CBT, stressing that it is only helpful in treating anxiety around the condition, not the illness itself. \nAnd it emphasises the need for early and accurate diagnosis. \nBaroness Finlay, a consultant in palliative medicine and vice-chairwoman of the guideline committee, said: \"Those with ME/CFS need to be listened to, understood and supported to adapt their lives. The committee members involved in this guideline have worked particularly hard to ensure care becomes more empathetic and focused on the individual's needs.\"\nLouise, 37, told the BBC she agreed that graded exercise should be scrapped as it \"gives people false hope\". \n\"Every time I got to 10-11 minute walks I was crashing and spending weeks in bed,\" she said.\n\"I came to the conclusion on my own, right forget this. You just can't. Some days you cannot physically get out of bed.\"\nME Research UK said the publication was \"a significant step in both the acceptance of ME as a physical illness and recognition of appropriate treatment needs of those affected by the condition\".\nSian Leary from the campaign group ME Action UK, said not publishing the guideline in August had been \"devastating to thousands of people with ME\", who she said had been \"seriously harmed by graded exercise therapy\".\nDr Charles Shepherd, medical adviser to the ME Association, said: \"This new guideline will have a big impact on care for people with ME, and draws a line under the damaging therapies of the past.\"\nDr Alastair Miller, an NHS consultant physician in acute medicine and infectious disease in North Cumbria, said exercise programmes could be helpful: \"It is unfortunate that so much emphasis is given to working 'within current energy limits' rather than a gentle and controlled pushing of those limits.  \n\"However, it is to be welcomed that clinics will still be able to provide appropriate personalised activity and exercise programmes for those patients in whom it is felt to be appropriate.\"\nProf Peter White from Queen Mary University of London said: \"I worry that this guideline seems to suggest that patients need to learn to live with CFS/ME, rather than be helped to recover from it.  \n\"NICE have banned graded exercise therapy, in spite of it being found to be helpful in a major Cochrane systematic review, while recommending an energy management programme, which involves 'staying within your energy limits', for which there is little evidence for it helping, and some evidence that it doesn't.\""

And it is very concerning,\" Gen Milley told Bloomberg.\n\"I don't know if it's quite a Sputnik moment, but I think it's very close to that. It has all of our attention.\" \nHis comment is the first official acknowledgement by the US of claims that China conducted two missile tests over the summer. Reports indicate that it was a nuclear-capable missile that could evade US air defence systems.\nThe 1957 Soviet satellite launch of Sputnik shocked Americans, who feared the Soviets were pulling ahead in technological ability.\nThe event spurred President John F Kennedy to declare the US would land men on the Moon, a goal achieved in less than a decade.\nPentagon spokesman John Kirby refused to comment on the general's remarks, saying: \"This is not a technology that is alien to us, that we haven't been thinking about for a while.\"\nHe added that the US was working to strengthen defence systems and pursuing its own hypersonic capabilities.\nHypersonic missiles are capable of travelling at five times the speed of sound. \nThey are considered more manoeuvrable than conventional missiles and more capable of avoiding interception from air defence.\nLast week the US conducted three hypersonic missile tests at a Nasa facility in Virginia.\nThe tests will be used to \"inform the development\" of future hypersonic missiles, US officials said.\nGen Milley also warned that the Chinese military had grown \"from a peasant-based infantry army that was very, very large in 1979 to a very capable military that covers all the domains and has global ambitions\".\nAccording to CNN, CIA Director Bill Burns described China last week as the greatest technological threat to the United States. Earlier this month he said the spy agency would boost its efforts towards China.\nPresident Joe Biden's White House has characterised the US-Chinese relationship as one of \"strategic competition\".\nGen Milley last month faced calls to resign and was accused of treasonous behaviour after it was reported that he had assured his Chinese counterpart in the last days of the Trump administration that the US would not launch a nuclear strike.\nThe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff later said the calls were \"perfectly within the duties and responsibilities\" of his job."

      "tags": "Economics,Rishi Sunak,Economic growth,UK economy,Budget 2021,Office for Budget Responsibility",
      "text": "The cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, the government's forecaster has warned.\nIts latest forecast says inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% in 2022.\nHowever, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says figures released since its report was compiled suggest inflation could hit almost 5%.\nThe chancellor acknowledged that household budgets are strained.\nRishi Sunak described the overall economic picture as \"strong\" in the short term, with the OBR now expecting the economy to return to its pre-pandemic level six months earlier than it had forecast previously.\nHowever, he acknowledged the inflation rate was \"likely to rise further\" from its 3.1% rate in September.\nHe said it was due to increased demand for energy and supply chain issues as economies and factories reopening following coronavirus lockdowns.\n\"The pressures caused by supply chains and energy prices will take months to ease,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\"It would be irresponsible for anyone to pretend that we can solve this overnight.\"\nThe UK's exit from the European Union (EU) has exacerbated supply chain problems such at hold-ups at ports or with deliveries, the OBR said in its latest report.\nThe OBR also said the fact that the energy price cap has risen was a big factor behind the rising cost of living. The cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThe independent forecaster suggested that had its figures been more up-to-date, its inflation forecasts would have painted a more bleak picture for consumers and businesses. \nIt previously said it had ended any updates to its forecast on 24 September, earlier than usual, and \"in response to a request from the chancellor\".\nRichard Hughes, chairman of the OBR, told BBC News that if inflation started feeding into wages, rather than just products in the shops, the problem could persist for longer.\nBut the OBR lifted its prediction for economic growth in 2021 to 6.5%, up from its previous forecast of 4%. It has also reduced its estimate of the long-term \"scarring\" effect of Covid-19 on the economy from 3% to 2%.\nThe effectiveness of Covid vaccines and the adaptability of consumers and businesses had sped up the recovery, the OBR said.\nBut it forecast that economic growth would be lower next year than it previously thought, partly down to a better performance in 2021.\nIn 2022, gross domestic product (GDP), which measures all the activity of companies, governments and people in an economy, will increase by 6%, the OBR said, rather than the 7.3% it predicted in March.\nGrowth is forecast to be 2.1% in 2023, 1.3% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025.\nWhile the economy is in a stronger state than had been expected, whether in terms of growth, employment or the public finances - the official analysis makes clear the obstacle inflation poses to standards of living in the coming months. \nThe OBR reckons inflation will hit 4.4.%; it warns it may go as high as 5%. And, it makes clear that leaving the EU has heightened the UK's experience of the bottlenecks that are bumping up business costs, that in turn will lead to higher prices.  \nThat higher cost of living, together with looming tax rises will dampen the effect of wage rises over the next couple of years. \nStrip out inflation and the OBR reckons that household income after tax will only recover to pre-pandemic levels in mid-2023. And those lost years of prosperity increases could weigh on growth - and sentiment in the run up to the next election.\nHigher inflation is also likely to put pressure on how much the chancellor is able to spend in the future.\nBut Mr Sunak has been offered some room for manoeuvre, as the improving economic picture and higher tax incomes means the government will not have to borrow as much.\nBorrowing hit a record \u00a3319.9bn during the 2020 financial year as the government poured money into pandemic support schemes such as furlough.\nIt is now forecast to fall every year between 2021 and 2026. \nJane Mackay, head of tax at audit, tax, advisory and risk firm Crowe, said there was still a \"huge\" Covid bill to deal with, though.\n\"The Budget statement hasn't really given us clarity on who will pay that bill. \n\"The tax increases that were announced before the Budget, including corporation tax rising to 25%, and the NHS and social care levy additional NICs of 1.25%, might suggest the strategy will spread the burden as widely as possible, rather than to make the structural changes to our tax system that may be what is really needed.\"\nA risk of rising inflation as well is that it will increase the amount of interest the government needs to pay back on what it has borrowed for pandemic spending.\nBank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned in September that it \"will have to act\" over rising inflation.\nThe Bank has already said UK inflation is set to exceed 4%, before falling back as the economy recovers from Covid.\nThe UK's central bank can raise interest rates in an attempt to tackle inflation if prices are rising quickly. In theory, when borrowing costs rise - which would make loans such as mortgages more expensive - people spend less and prices are driven down.\nMr Sunak said on Wednesday that he had written to the Bank to \"reaffirm their remit to achieve low and stable inflation\". \nInvestors are expecting interest rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022, in an effort to bring inflation back down to the Bank's 2% target.\nHowever, he gave no suggestion of when the Bank might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%.\nThe governor said that rising energy bills could push inflation higher for longer than previously thought."

      "text": "The organiser of the flight in which footballer Emiliano Sala died has been found guilty of endangering the safety of an aircraft.\nSala, 28, and pilot David Ibbotson, 59, died in the crash in the English Channel in January 2019.\nDavid Henderson, 67, of Hotham, East Riding of Yorkshire, was found guilty after a trial at Cardiff Crown Court.\nHe had also previously admitted trying to arrange a flight for a passenger without permission or authorisation.\nIt took the jury seven-and-a-half hours to convict Henderson by a majority verdict. He will be sentenced on 12 November.\nLawyers speaking on behalf of Sala's family said Henderson's convictions were welcomed but his actions were only \"one piece of the puzzle\" of how the plane came to crash.\nArgentine striker Sala and Mr Ibbotson died after their single-engine Piper Malibu plunged into the English Channel on a flight between Cardiff and Nantes in January 2019, set up by Henderson with football agent William \"Willie\" McKay.\nThe footballer was involved in a \u00a315m transfer to Cardiff City from Nantes and was travelling between the two cities at the time of his death.\nThe court heard how Ibbotson, who regularly flew for Henderson, did not hold a commercial pilot's licence, a qualification to fly at night, and his rating to fly the single-engine Piper Malibu had expired.\nHenderson had asked Mr Ibbotson to fly the plane as he was away on holiday with his wife in Paris.\nJust moments after finding out the plane had gone down, Henderson texted a number of people telling them to stay silent, warning it would \"open a can of worms\", the jury was told.\nThe father-of-three and former RAF officer admitted in court he had feared an investigation into his business dealings.\nProsecutor Martin Goudie QC said Henderson had been \"reckless or negligent\" in the way he operated the plane, by putting his business above the safety of passengers.\nMr Goudie said Henderson had created a culture of breaching the air navigation regulations among the pilots he hired.\nFay Keely, who owned the plane, had told Henderson not to allow Mr Ibbotson to pilot the plane again after being contacted by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) about two airspace infringements he had committed.\nDespite this, Henderson allowed Mr Ibbotson to continue flying, and his message to the pilot read: \"We both have an opportunity to make money out of the business model but not if we upset clients or draw the attention of the CAA.\"\nHenderson did not have the permit needed to fly passengers in the American plane, or an Air Operator Certificate (AOC), which was also required.\nMr Goudie accused Henderson of lying in his statements to investigators, and of running a \"cowboy outfit\" after questioning him over failings to keep basic information on his pilots.\nIn his closing speech, he claimed Henderson ran an \"incompetent, undocumented and dishonest organisation\".\nHowever Stephen Spence QC, defending, had said his client's actions were \"purely a paperwork issue\" and had not led to a likelihood of danger.\nHe said his client knew Mr Ibbotson, who had been flying for decades, was an experienced pilot.\nMr Spence told the court the only difference between a commercial licence and the private licence held by Mr Ibbotson was whether you could carry passengers for money or not, rather than ability.\nHenderson also argued on the stand that he had phoned Ms Keely after she forbade Mr Ibbotson from flying and convinced her to let him pilot again.\nMs Keely said she does not remember such a call.\nBBC Wales understands that Cardiff City FC welcomes the verdict and hopes that the outcome will provide a sense of justice and closure to the families.\nDaniel Machover, of Hickman & Rose solicitors, representing the Sala family, said in a statement after the verdict: \"Mr Henderson's convictions are welcome and we hope the CAA will ensure that illegal flights of this kind are stopped. \n\"The actions of David Henderson are only one piece in the puzzle of how the plane David Ibbotson was illegally flying came to crash into the sea on 21 January 2019. \n\"We still do not know the key information about the maintenance history of the aircraft and all the factors behind the carbon monoxide poisoning revealed in August 2019 by AAIB.\n\"The answers to these questions can only be properly established at Emiliano's inquest, which is due to start in February next year.\" \nThe statement added that the Sala family \"fervently hope\" all involved in the inquest, including Piper Aircraft Inc and the AAIB, would provide full disclosure of material.\n\"Only if that happens will Emiliano's family finally know the truth about this tragedy enabling all the lessons to be learned, so that no family goes through a similar preventable death,\" it said.\nKate Staples, the UK CAA's general counsel, extended sympathies to families and friends affected by the fatal crash.\n\"Aviation safety relies upon the integrity of everyone involved in the industry,\" she said.\n\"Unlawful and unsafe activity such as Mr Henderson's is unacceptable and the UK Civil Aviation Authority will always look to prosecute illegal activity.\"\nKevin Ducksbury, the chairman of the Air Charter Association (ACA), said the trade body was \"deeply dismayed\" that \"so many fundamental safety rules, and basic rules of airmanship were disregarded and broken\" in this case. \n\"The ruling confirms that Mr Henderson arranged and coordinated this flight illegally, in which footballer Emiliano Sala tragically lost his life.\n\"The association is profoundly disturbed that this flight was allowed to happen but welcomes the UK CAA's representation in this case,\" he said.\nMr Ducksbury added that the ACA would continue its work to educate the public and wider aviation community, with it's primary cause to stamp out illegal transport."

      "title": "Universal credit: What is the taper rate?",
      "tags": "Money,Personal finance,Universal Credit,Housing Benefit,Benefits,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Universal credit will rise for some people under plans announced by the chancellor in his Budget.\nRishi Sunak has reduced the \"taper rate\" - this affects the amount of money lost by working claimants if they earn more money.\nUniversal credit is a single benefit payment for working-age people, which was introduced to replace a range of different benefits for unemployed and low-paid people, and make the system simpler. \nIt's claimed by more than 5.8 million people in England, Scotland and Wales, both in and out of work - 40% of universal credit claimants are workers.\nClaimants received an extra \u00a320 per week during the pandemic, but this ended at the beginning of this month.\nMost universal credit claimants lose some of their benefits if they earn more money.\nThe rate at which they lose the benefits is known as the taper rate.\nAt the moment the taper rate is 63%, which means that if you earn an extra pound you lose 63p in benefits.\nWorkers with responsibility for children or disabilities that limit their ability to work are allowed to earn a certain amount before they start losing their universal credit, which is called a work allowance. \nThe work allowance means such people can earn up to \u00a3515 a month without losing benefits. Claimants who receive help with housing costs have a lower work allowance. \nThe chancellor has announced that in the coming weeks the taper rate will be reduced to 55p, which would mean that workers would take home 8p more of an extra pound earned.\nAlso, the work allowances for eligible claimants will go up by \u00a3500 a year.\nFor some workers that will make up for the loss of the \u00a320 a week uplift to universal credit.\nEmployees claiming universal credit who earn enough to pay National Insurance (\u00a39,564 a year) will also see the amount of tax they have to pay increase next April. That will affect somebody working more than about 20 hours a week on the minimum wage.\nTake as an example somebody without children, working 10 hours a week on the National Living Wage - which is going up to \u00a39.50 an hour in April.\nThey would earn \u00a395 a week, which means - at the current 63% taper rate - they lose \u00a359.85 of their universal credit. If the taper rate were cut to 55% they would get to take home an extra \u00a37.60 a week.\nHowever, most universal credit claimants are not working, so they would not receive any extra money.\nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) says that 1.4 million households still claim working tax credit and have not moved to universal credit, so they also would not benefit.\nThe cut to universal credit was opposed by many charities, opposition parties, and also some Conservative MPs.\nWriting on Twitter, Resolution chief executive Torsten Bell said that removing the boost would mean \"4.4 million households, with 5.1m adults and 3.5m children, will see their incomes fall by \u00a31,000 overnight. \nThe charity Citizens Advice warned that a third of people on universal credit would end up in debt when the extra payment is removed.\nIt said the average shortfall would be between \u00a351 and \u00a355 a month.\nThe government has defended its decision, saying the \u00a320 uplift was always meant to be temporary and that people getting back into work is the best way to tackle poverty.\nIt is complicated to work out exactly how much universal credit you might receive. Some people, such as those with \u00a316,000 or more in savings, are not eligible.\nOthers may find what they receive depends on their circumstances, including any income their family has, as well as housing and childcare costs.\nIt usually takes five weeks from the date of claiming to receiving a first payment, although an advance loan may be possible.\nAn application for universal credit may put a stop to any tax credits you receive, even if it proves to be unsuccessful.\nYou may be able to claim a reduction in council tax when on universal credit, and get help with childcare costs. There is also support to pay the rent, which works in different ways across the UK. \nIn time, there may also be assistance in paying the mortgage, although there are some strict criteria involved.\nThe main benefit for anyone losing their job after a period in work is new-style jobseeker's allowance (JSA).\nThis is worth \u00a359.20 a week, if you are under 25, or \u00a374.70 a week if you are 25 or over.\nYou can get this for up to six months and it will be paid into your bank, building society, or credit union account every two weeks. Unlike universal credit, your partner's or spouse's income will not affect your claim.\nYou may be able to claim new-style JSA as well as universal credit.\nUniversal credit may not be appropriate or available for everyone. Claiming it can affect other benefits, and it is vital to get some advice - available for free - before applying.\nPlaces offering guidance on this and other benefits questions include:\nHow will you be affected by this?

      "text": "A new bill to pardon miners convicted of offences relating to the strike action in the 1980s has been published by the Scottish government.\nJustice Secretary Keith Brown said the legislation would go \"some way\" to aid reconciliation and to help heal wounds in mining communities.\u00a0\nAbout 1,400 miners were arrested and more than 500 were convicted during the national dispute.\nThe pardon will also apply to miners who have died since the 1984-85 strike.\nThe Miners' Strike (Pardons) (Scotland) Bill follows an independent review into the impact of policing on Scottish communities during the strike.\nThe review, led by human rights lawyer John Scott QC, recommended that the Scottish government introduced legislation to pardon miners convicted of certain offences, such as breach of the peace.\nMr Brown said the miners' strike had been one of the \"most bitter and divisive industrial disputes in living memory\".\n\"This new draft legislation will go some way to aid reconciliation - and to help heal wounds within Scotland's mining communities,\" he said.\n\"A collective pardon will restore dignity to those convicted, provide comfort to their families and, I hope, will bring closure to the sense of injustice members of mining communities may feel.\n\"I am determined to make swift progress on this matter, given the passage of time since 1984-85, which is why we have acted quickly to bring forward and publish this landmark new bill.\"\nHowever, former miner George Purcell, who was arrested at Bilston Glen Colliery in Midlothian during the strike, said the new legislation was a \"token gesture\".\n\"It [the pardon] maybe resolves one of the injustices that were laid against the miners, but it doesn't involve the financial loss - the major injustice that was put against miners that weren't reinstated,\" he said.\nMr Purcell was dismissed from his job after being convicted of breach of the peace and told BBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live programme he had missed out on five years' of work and compensation when the colliery finally closed.\n\"We were involved in an industrial dispute to try and protect our communities and save jobs. We didn't think that the whole of the state machinery would be put against us,\" he said.\n\"When you think of a minor offence like breach of the peace over 37 years ago. Fined \u00a3400 and barred from going near the colliery... that was excessive and extreme.\"\nThe bill will not cast doubt on decisions made by courts at the time and does not quash convictions.\nMillions of people protested against pit closures during the industrial dispute with Margaret Thatcher's government.\nThroughout the summer of 1984 there were violent clashes between striking miners and police, whose numbers often ran into several hundred at each confrontation. \nViolence led to widespread use of the breach of the peace charge. \nThe review found that most of the miners' actions would be unlikely to result in prosecution today."

      "text": "Buying fruit and vegetables out of season should be seen as a luxury in future, Wales' climate change minister has said.\nIt comes as part of a major new strategy to tackle Wales' carbon footprint and encourage people live more environmentally-friendly lives.\nPeople are being asked to cut energy use, drive less and buy local food.\nThe Welsh government said a \"decade of action\" was required to meet climate change targets.\nIt comes as ministers prepare to travel to Glasgow for the COP26 summit.\nThey said their new plan was the start of a \"journey\" towards a net zero economy by the middle of the century.\nBut it focuses specifically on the period between 2021 and 2025, when a 37% reduction in planet-warming gases is required to meet the Welsh government's second carbon budget.\nThe measures will cost an estimated \u00a34.2bn to implement over five years.\nWales' Climate Change Minister Julie James told Radio Wales Breakfast: \"If you're buying oranges out of season, they should be a luxury treat, not something you take for granted. \n\"With our global supply chains, we've lost track of that.\n\"It keeps our local farmers happy, local industries working well and makes our world a more sustainable place for our children and our grandchildren.\"\nEvery citizen, community, group and business in Wales is being asked \"to embed the climate emergency in the way they think, work, play and travel\".\nBut what does the plan say?\nGreenhouse gas emissions from power stations will be \"virtually\" eliminated by 2035, the Welsh government claims.\nNew fossil fuel plants have been banned, and gas generation will be phased out.\nOnly stations that have managed to install carbon capture technology will be able to continue to operate after 2035.\nThe vision is for a \"high renewables system\" - so more wind farms, solar power and tidal schemes.\nNew targets for green energy are to be set out - but are not in this plan.\nHouseholds are encouraged to do the basics to save power like switching off lights, taking up the offer of a smart meter and choosing the most energy-efficient appliances. \nWales has struggled to make a dent in its emissions from transport - with just a 6% fall since 1990.\nMinisters want 35% of trips to be taken by walking, cycling or public transport by 2025, and 39% by 2030.\nThey are also targeting a 10% cut in the number of car miles travelled per person by the end of the decade.  \n\"Major investment\" to make public transport more attractive is promised.\nBy 2025 all new-build affordable homes in Wales will be fitted with green technologies so they do not produce emissions.\nThe government expects private developers to adopt its net zero standards too.\nBut decarbonising Wales' 1.43 million existing homes is the real challenge - the government says about 148,000 will have received retrofit measures to make them more energy efficient by 2025.\nThe 2020s will be spent working with industry, \"developing and scaling up\" options such as carbon-capture and storage technology and hydrogen fuel.\nMinisters said this would help them understand how feasible these were - and that it was important to focus on behavioural changes in the meantime.\nHigh above the Rhondda at Pen y Cymoedd - the largest onshore windfarm in Wales - they've been eagerly awaiting the plan's details.\n\"We are running out of time to really take action on climate change,\" said Berry Jordan, of Vattenfall UK.\n\"We need to work out what the activities are that help us meet net zero and decarbonise our lives and work - from powering our cars, to heating our houses - all of that needs to move to other systems and so we've all got to embrace change.\"\nTurbine technician Michael Leach said he was pleased to be employed in a job that was \"part of the green future that we have to come to accept\".\n\"It's great to know that we've got job security here - it's a good job to have, especially in south Wales,\" he added.\nOver the next 20 years the ambition is to get people eating more healthily and sustainably. This means \"a substantial increase in fruit and vegetables and a decrease in red and processed meats and dairy products\" the plan says.\nThe government says changes in behaviour by consumers and farmers could release some land from agriculture. \nIt wants 10% of farming land to be \"shared\" by 2050 - so new trees and hedgerows can be planted.\n43,000 hectares (106,255 acres) of new woodland is to be planted by 2030, and 180,000 hectares (444,789 acres) by 2050.\nCouncils, health boards and other government-backed bodies will be expected to publish plans by 2023 that could see them reach net zero by 2030.\nThere are plans to force businesses to recycle more to help Wales get from third to the top of global leader boards on tackling waste.\nA wide range of single-use plastics are to be banned.\nWhile the scale of the challenge \"cannot be under-estimated\", it will lead to highly skilled and well-paid jobs and opportunities to redeploy employees from traditional industries, the government said.\nThe plan pulls together 123 policies and proposals, though very few are new announcements.\nThroughout the document, ministers call on the UK government to take action to \"to unlock a green future in Wales\".\nGovernment advisers have said that by 2050, around 60% of the changes needed in Wales are in areas under the UK government's control - from subsidies to encourage the take up of electric vehicles, to upgrading the National Grid.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said: \"While the UK cannot reach its targets without Welsh action, we cannot reach our ambition without the UK government playing its fair part.\n\"We believe that by working together and taking collective action we can deliver a stronger, fairer and greener Wales for future generations.\""

      "text": "The impact of Brexit on the UK economy will be worse in the long run compared to the coronavirus pandemic, the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility has said.\nRichard Hughes said leaving the EU would reduce the UK's potential GDP by about 4% in the long term.\nHe said forecasts showed the pandemic would reduce GDP \"by a further 2%\".\n\"In the long term it is the case that Brexit has a bigger impact than the pandemic\", he told the BBC.\nHis comments come after the OBR said the cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, with suggestions inflation could hit almost 5%.\nSpeaking after Wednesday's Budget, Mr Hughes said recent data showed the impact of Brexit was \"broadly consistent\" with the OBR's assumption that the leaving the EU would \"reduce our long run GDP by around 4%\".\n\"We think that the effect of the pandemic will reduce that (GDP) output by a further 2%,\" he added.\nThe Treasury has been contacted for comment.\nGDP or Gross Domestic Product is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It is a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy.\nIn a growing economy, quarterly GDP will be slightly higher than the quarter before, a sign that people are doing more work and getting (on average) a little bit richer. If GDP is falling, then the economy is shrinking.\nThe UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and officially left the trading bloc on 31 January 2020, however, both sides agreed to keep many things the same until 31 December 2020, before a new trade deal was announced and implemented on 1 January this year.\nBoth the pandemic and Brexit have played a part in current supply chain issues across the UK, and have further exposed the scarcity of lorry drivers, which has resulted in recent shortages of products for businesses and some empty shelves for customers.\nHowever, in the OBR's latest report, the independent body said \"supply bottlenecks had been exacerbated by changes in the migration and trading regimes following Brexit\".\nSupply chain issues has led to the government granting short-term visas to EU workers across certain sectors, including the haulage industry.\nThe British Poultry Council has said turkey farmers will do their best to ensure Christmas \"is as normal as it can be\", but warned shortages are likely, due to a shortage of seasonal overseas workers.\nThe government has assured consumers that turkeys will be available for the festive season and has also deployed temporary visas in a bid to bolster worker numbers."

We'll have another update for you on Friday morning.\nThe last few countries will be removed from England's red list next week, the government has confirmed. Colombia, Peru, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Venezuela and Ecuador are all being taken off from Monday, meaning arrivals will no longer need to pay for a quarantine hotel. But the current travel system will stay and countries could be added back on to the red list in future. \"We have been able to do this now because the variants of concern that we have been tracking are no longer of concern to the chief medical officers,\" said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps.\nShops, restaurants and schools have closed their doors in Moscow, as the city is put in a partial lockdown while Russia battles rising coronavirus deaths and infections. People in the capital can thankfully still go to essential shops like pharmacies and supermarkets, as well as get a takeaway meal from restaurants. Workers across the country have also been given nine days off from Saturday by the government as a means of stamping down the infection rate.\nA paramedic has revealed how he was traumatised  by a patient dying of respiratory issues in the back of an ambulance around Christmas last year. Ollie Springett developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), a mental health condition people can develop after experiencing disturbing events, working on the front line in London throughout the pandemic. He said the tragic death made him feel \"out of control\" and like he \"wasn't any good\" at his job, causing him to take time off work for treatment.\nNorthern Ireland's finance minister has said he does not anticipate that there will be a lockdown this winter. Conor Murphy made the claim ahead of plans to mandatory lift social distancing in pubs and restaurants this weekend. The Stormont politician also defended the \"cautious\" approach of Northern Ireland's government to easing Covid rules compared to the rest of the UK, and argued talks were \"not pointed in [the] direction\" of a lockdown.\nA volunteer army is delivering hundreds of meals to elderly Asian people in New York, at a time when attacks on the community have increased. The meals - which started as an emergency effort at the beginning of the pandemic - include personal handwritten notes in the native languages of the people receiving them. Volunteers said their efforts, which have seen nearly 90,000 meals delivered so far, were offering the community \"more than just meals\", but were also \"feeding souls\". \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nRemind yourself of the current travel rules for arriving in the UK here.\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Rishi Sunak might liken himself to a reluctant taxman, but his strategic decision has been to spend at the same time as keeping borrowing down, so taxation has taken the hit.\nThere are four big figures that tell the broad story here.\nThe really good news is that unemployment is now forecast to peak at 5.2%.\nHowever, a significant spike in inflation to higher than 4%, set to last a year or so, partly reflects rising energy and fuel prices.\nMeanwhile, taxation as a proportion of the economy at 36.2% is at its highest level since the 1950s Labour Atlee government.\nAnd spending as a proportion of the economy, at nearly 42%, is at its highest sustained level since the 1970s.\nAll that leaves the British state under a Conservative government permanently bigger as a legacy of the pandemic.\nBut borrowing at the end of the new forecast is even lower than forecast before the pandemic.\nAnd so the big story is that the corporation tax rises from the March Budget, required to shore up public finances after bad forecasts, have been kept as they were, even as those bad forecasts have been reversed. \nThere might have been some room to delay those tax rises or extend the corporation super deduction.\nBut that extra taxation has been kept to be deployed mainly in terms of extra spending. \nThat spending has been sprinkled towards some help with cost of living, and some surgery on the economy to improve skills and long term productivity. \nUnprotected areas of the public finances forecast for a continuing squeeze have all been topped up. All will now enjoy rising spending.\nTo be clear, the slowing in the rise in unemployment would have been scarcely believable 18 months ago and is the best measure of the pandemic economic rescue plan's success.\nBut before the Budget, I raised the question as to whether, after furlough, the public were becoming used to the idea that the government should solve problems such as rising living costs. \nDespite the chancellor's protestations of his love for low, tax free-market conservatism, his actions show an attachment to higher tax and spending.\nWith new restraints on the ability to borrow, delivering on lowering this tax burden will require the economy to grow far more robustly than the disappointing rates forecast after 2023 of as low as 1.3%.\nSmall wonder that the chancellor was proclaiming a \"new era of optimism\" for the economy. \nTo deliver on his promises to reverse tax rises, that isn't just a hope, it's a necessity.

We will consider what further action is necessary in that light.\"\nDowning Street said the \"disappointing and disproportionate\" threat of sanctions was \"not what we would expect from a close ally and partner\".\n\"The measures being threatened do not appear to be compatible with the Trade and Co-operation Agreement and wider international law, and, if carried through, will be met with an appropriate and calibrated response,\" a spokeswoman said.\nShe said that the UK will raise concerns with both the EU and French government, arguing that it had granted 98% of licence applications from European boats.\nThe UK maintains the rejected applications which sparked the row did not have enough supporting evidence to show they had a history of fishing in Britain's or Jersey's waters."

      "text": "Double jabbed people are catching Covid and passing it on to those they live with, warn experts who have studied UK household cases. \nIndividuals who have had two vaccine doses can be just as infectious as those who have not been jabbed. \nEven if they have no or few symptoms, the chance of them transmitting the virus to other unvaccinated housemates is about two in five, or 38%. \nThis drops to one in four, or 25%, if housemates are also fully vaccinated.  \nThe Lancet Infectious Diseases work shows why getting even more people vaccinated and protected is important, they say.\nUnvaccinated people cannot rely on those around them being jabbed to remove their risk of getting infected, they warn.\nVaccines do an excellent job of preventing serious Covid illness and deaths, but are less good at stopping infections, particularly since the emergence of the more infectious Delta variant which is dominant in the UK. \nAnd over time, the protection offered by vaccines wanes and needs boosting with further doses. \nSince households are where most Covid transmission occurs, making sure every member who is eligible for a vaccine has had one and is up to date with their doses makes sense, say experts. \nAccording to the study, which ran from September 2020 to September 2021 and included 440 households in London and Bolton doing PCR Covid tests: \nProf Ajit Lalvani, of Imperial College London, UK, who co-led the study, said: \"The ongoing transmission we are seeing between vaccinated people makes it essential for unvaccinated people to get vaccinated to protect themselves from acquiring infection and severe Covid-19, especially as more people will be spending time inside in close proximity during the winter months.\n\"We found that susceptibility to infection increased already within a few months after the second vaccine dose - so those eligible for booster shots should get them promptly.\"\nCo-author Dr Anika Singanayagam, also from Imperial, said: \"Our findings provide important insights into the effect of vaccination in the face of new variants, and specifically, why the Delta variant is continuing to cause high Covid case numbers around the world, even in countries with high vaccination rates. \n\"Continued public health and social measures to curb transmission - such as mask wearing, social distancing, and testing - thus remain important, even in vaccinated individuals.\" "

      "tags": "Democratic Party,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden unveiled a revamped $1.75tn (\u00a31.27tn) spending plan on Thursday, calling it a historic investment in the country's future. \n\"No-one got everything they wanted, including me,\" he said, acknowledging the struggle within his party to reach consensus on a pair of landmark bills.\nNarrow margins in Congress require nearly unanimous support from the Democrats for the bills to pass.\nThey include major investments in infrastructure, climate and childcare.\nThe White House has said the plan has the support of all 50 Democrats in the evenly divided Senate and expressed confidence that it could also pass the House. But it remains to be seen whether Mr Biden has actually achieved the level of cooperation needed from within his party to move the spending plan forward. \nThe administration was hoping to have a deal in place before Mr Biden flew off to Europe on Thursday. He is heading for Rome, the Vatican and later to Glasgow, Scotland, for the United Nations climate conference, COP26. \nThis new proposal is a stripped-down version of the roughly $3.5tn social spending plan Mr Biden unveiled earlier this year. \nThe Democratic president was expected to use his Thursday morning meeting with House Democrats to convince progressives in the party that this new version is close enough to the original bill, and to persuade progressives in the House of Representative to pass a separate, $1tn infrastructure bill that has already passed in the Senate. \nIt's a delicate balance for Mr Biden, as he tries to appeal to his party's progressives - who say they need action on the social spending bill before passing infrastructure - and some moderates, for whom the infrastructure bill is priority. Others had concerns over the price tag of the original social spending bill. \nSpeaking on Thursday, Mr Biden said the US was at risk of \"losing our edge as a nation\". \n\"Somewhere along the way we stopped investing in ourselves, and investing in our people,\" he said. \"We can't be competitive in the 21st Century global economy if we continue this slide.\"  \nThe scaled-back spending plan announced by Mr Biden on Thursday is missing several big promises from the original bill. \nPaid family leave was removed entirely - a blow to progressives and American voters who hoped the US would join the majority of other countries in providing paid time off for new parents. The US is one of just eight countries without national paid maternity leave.\nA plan to lower prescription drug prices has also been slashed.\nThe AARP, the nation's largest interest group focused on elderly Americans, released a statement after Mr Biden's announcement saying it was \"outraged\" that the new framework does not lower drug prices. \nThe president on Thursday made the case that his spending plan was \"fiscally responsible and fully paid for\" and that it will not add to the deficit. \nHere is what's proposed:\nA 50-50 seat split in the Senate - and Republican resistance - means Mr Biden must bring his entire party on board if he hopes to pass the spending bill. In the coming days, Mr Biden will know if he has those numbers. \nTwo moderate Democrats, Senators Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, appeared to signal some support for the bill in separate statements on Thursday. \n\"After months of productive, good-faith negotiations with President Biden and the White House, we have made significant progress,\" Ms Sinema said. \"I look forward to getting this done.\"\nBoth Ms Sinema and Mr Manchin are widely seen to have tanked the original bill by refusing to vote for it. \nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is expected to hold a vote on the infrastructure bill - already passed in the Senate - as early as Thursday. To get there, she'll need progressives to agree to it.\nThe head of the House Progressive Caucus, Washington State Representative Pramila Jayapal, said the president made a \"compelling speech\" but said she'd have to wait and see where the progressives stood. \nMs Jayapal has repeatedly insisted that the infrastructure bill and the social spending bill be passed in tandem. \nFor Mr Biden a lot is riding on the fate of these two bills: his presidential legacy. \n\"I don't think it's hyperbole to say that the House and Senate majorities and my presidency will be determined by what happens in the next week,\" he told Democrats on Thursday morning, according to US media.

      "text": "Popular support for governments to take tough action on climate change is growing around the world, according to a BBC World Service opinion poll.\nThe survey of over 30,000 people finds that 56% want their countries to play a leadership role at the critical COP26 meeting next week. \nThe desire to see ambitious goals set in Glasgow has grown substantially since 2015.\nConcern about climate change is also at its highest point since 1998.\nPresidents and prime ministers from around 120 countries will gather in Glasgow next week for the COP26 conference, dubbed the last, best chance of averting dangerous climate change. \nRecent research shows that the plans so far on the table will not prevent global temperatures going far above 1.5C this century - a level that scientists say is the gateway to extreme impacts. \nThe UK, which is presiding over the talks, will hope that in negotiations with leaders they will be able to find a pathway that reduces emissions fast enough to stay below 1.5C.\nThis new poll suggests that people in rich and poor nations alike are supportive of the idea of greater ambition from their leaders. \nAcross the 31 countries polled, an average of 56% of people want their governments to set stronger targets that would address climate change as quickly as possible. \nAnother 36% want their government to take a more moderate approach and support gradual action.  \nJust 8% want their governments to oppose a deal. \nIn the 18 countries where a similar survey was carried out ahead of COP21 in Paris in 2015, the expectation for governments to play a leading role has grown substantially. \nIn 2015, 43% of those polled wanted strong action, but that has risen to 58% now.\n\"In advance of the COP21 meeting in Paris in 2015, global public opinion exhibited relatively strong expectations for governments to deliver an ambitious climate change agreement, which in the end is what transpired,\" said Chris Coulter, the chief executive of Globescan, which carried out the poll. \n\"Now, in advance of the COP26 meeting in Glasgow next week, we are seeing significantly higher levels of expectations - an increase of 25% worldwide - for governments to conclude an ambitious deal. This is an extraordinary shift in a relatively short period of time and the implications being that governments that don't deliver on these expectations could face political consequences.\"\nThere are some interesting changes in some of the biggest emitting countries, particularly China, where the percentage of respondents wanting to see their country play a leadership role has increased from 18% in 2015 to 46% now.  \nIndia also sees a rise from 38% then to 56% now, with the US also showing an uptick from 45% of respondents then to 56% now. \nOnly in Russia did the pollsters find a decline in support for stronger government leadership at COP26, with only 38% backing this approach, down from almost 50% in 2015.\nOn the question of addressing climate change, respondents were fairly evenly divided, with 61% overall saying that governments had the responsibility while 57% said that companies were in the frame. \nOn the issue of individuals, only 36% said that the answers should come from them.\nThis question turned up an interesting age difference with four in 10 respondents under 30 years of age saying that individuals held a great deal of responsibility, while only three in 10 of those over 30 saw it the same way. \nOverall concern about climate change is at its highest level since Globescan first started tracking this concern - in 17 countries -back in 1998. Some 63% of people now see it as a \"very serious\" issue.\nThere have also been large increases in the numbers of people saying that weather patterns have become highly unusual and alarming, particularly in France and the UK, where the numbers have doubled since 2015.\nMore details on the poll can be found here. \nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "text": "Buying fruit and vegetables out of season should be seen as a luxury in future, Wales' climate change minister has said.\nIt comes as part of a major new strategy to tackle Wales' carbon footprint and encourage people live more environmentally-friendly lives.\nPeople are being asked to cut energy use, drive less and buy local food.\nThe Welsh government said a \"decade of action\" was required to meet climate change targets.\nIt comes as ministers prepare to travel to Glasgow for the COP26 summit.\nThey said their new plan was the start of a \"journey\" towards a net zero economy by the middle of the century.\nBut it focuses specifically on the period between 2021 and 2025, when a 37% reduction in planet-warming gases is required to meet the Welsh government's second carbon budget.\nThe measures will cost an estimated \u00a34.2bn to implement over five years.\nWales' Climate Change Minister Julie James told Radio Wales Breakfast: \"If you're buying oranges out of season, they should be a luxury treat, not something you take for granted. \n\"With our global supply chains, we've lost track of that.\n\"It keeps our local farmers happy, local industries working well and makes our world a more sustainable place for our children and our grandchildren.\"\nEvery citizen, community, group and business in Wales is being asked \"to embed the climate emergency in the way they think, work, play and travel\".\nBut what does the plan say?\nGreenhouse gas emissions from power stations will be \"virtually\" eliminated by 2035, the Welsh government claims.\nNew fossil fuel plants have been banned, and gas generation will be phased out.\nOnly stations that have managed to install carbon capture technology will be able to continue to operate after 2035.\nThe vision is for a \"high renewables system\" - so more wind farms, solar power and tidal schemes.\nNew targets for green energy are to be set out - but are not in this plan.\nHouseholds are encouraged to do the basics to save power like switching off lights, taking up the offer of a smart meter and choosing the most energy-efficient appliances. \nWales has struggled to make a dent in its emissions from transport - with just a 6% fall since 1990.\nMinisters want 35% of trips to be taken by walking, cycling or public transport by 2025, and 39% by 2030.\nThey are also targeting a 10% cut in the number of car miles travelled per person by the end of the decade.  \n\"Major investment\" to make public transport more attractive is promised.\nBy 2025 all new-build affordable homes in Wales will be fitted with green technologies so they do not produce emissions.\nThe government expects private developers to adopt its net zero standards too.\nBut decarbonising Wales' 1.43 million existing homes is the real challenge - the government says about 148,000 will have received retrofit measures to make them more energy efficient by 2025.\nThe 2020s will be spent working with industry, \"developing and scaling up\" options such as carbon-capture and storage technology and hydrogen fuel.\nMinisters said this would help them understand how feasible these were - and that it was important to focus on behavioural changes in the meantime.\nHigh above the Rhondda at Pen y Cymoedd - the largest onshore windfarm in Wales - they've been eagerly awaiting the plan's details.\n\"We are running out of time to really take action on climate change,\" said Berry Jordan, of Vattenfall UK.\n\"We need to work out what the activities are that help us meet net zero and decarbonise our lives and work - from powering our cars, to heating our houses - all of that needs to move to other systems and so we've all got to embrace change.\"\nTurbine technician Michael Leach said he was pleased to be employed in a job that was \"part of the green future that we have to come to accept\".\n\"It's great to know that we've got job security here - it's a good job to have, especially in south Wales,\" he added.\nOver the next 20 years the ambition is to get people eating more healthily and sustainably. This means \"a substantial increase in fruit and vegetables and a decrease in red and processed meats and dairy products\" the plan says.\nThe government says changes in behaviour by consumers and farmers could release some land from agriculture. \nIt wants 10% of farming land to be \"shared\" by 2050 - so new trees and hedgerows can be planted.\n43,000 hectares (106,255 acres) of new woodland is to be planted by 2030, and 180,000 hectares (444,789 acres) by 2050.\nCouncils, health boards and other government-backed bodies will be expected to publish plans by 2023 that could see them reach net zero by 2030.\nThere are plans to force businesses to recycle more to help Wales get from third to the top of global leader boards on tackling waste.\nA wide range of single-use plastics are to be banned.\nWhile the scale of the challenge \"cannot be under-estimated\", it will lead to highly skilled and well-paid jobs and opportunities to redeploy employees from traditional industries, the government said.\nThe plan pulls together 123 policies and proposals, though very few are new announcements.\nThroughout the document, ministers call on the UK government to take action to \"to unlock a green future in Wales\".\nGovernment advisers have said that by 2050, around 60% of the changes needed in Wales are in areas under the UK government's control - from subsidies to encourage the take up of electric vehicles, to upgrading the National Grid.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said: \"While the UK cannot reach its targets without Welsh action, we cannot reach our ambition without the UK government playing its fair part.\n\"We believe that by working together and taking collective action we can deliver a stronger, fairer and greener Wales for future generations.\""

meaning some disruption is possible, and the Environment Agency has nine flood warnings in place.\nOn Thursday Honister Pass saw over 30cm (12in) of rain in a 24-hour period.\nMotorists are warned that some roads are only passable with extreme care, and asked only to travel if necessary.\nTrain operators are asking people to avoid travelling on the West Coast Main Line and Cumbria Coastal routes, and there is no service between Barrow and Carlisle until the line has been inspected.  \nOn Thursday a number of roads, including the A591 between Rydal and Grasmere and the A592 Patterdale Road, were flooded.\nKarl Melville, the senior manager at the county council's highways team, said work had been going on all night to try to re-open as many roads as possible.\nHe said: \"We have made some good progress [and] a lot of the roads that were closed are now passable with care.\n\"But obviously this does not take away the very clear advice of if you don't need to travel then don't travel.\"\nThe Environment Agency said 1,200 properties had been protected from flooding by its officers shutting flood gates and removing debris and blockages from grilles and watercourses.\nBut flood duty manager Ben Lukey urged people \"to remain vigilant\".\n\"Surface water and river flooding could still bring disruption to further communities,\" he warned.\nTwo holiday makers and their dog had to be rescued from their accommodation at Southwaite Mill by the Cockermouth Mountain Rescue Team.\nWith water chest high in places, volunteers brought them to safety in a raft.\nCockermouth and District Chamber of Trade chairman Andrew Marshall said huge insurance policy excesses introduced after the floods of 2009 and 2015 meant 90% of businesses would have to pay for any repairs themselves.\n\"Ever since then it's been nigh on impossible to get insurance,\" he said.\n\"If we get flooded this time we've got to pay for the rebuild and everything, which goes into hundreds of thousands.\"\nInsurers have imposed excesses of up to \u00a350,000 for business flooding claims in the area, Mr Marshall said.\nAfter previous floods caused widespread damage to properties the government introduced a scheme to help residents get insurance \"but it wasn't extended to business\", he said.\nGillian Jackson owns holiday lets in Cockermouth, some of which have flooded.\n\"We've been through this before so it's just get up, get on with it,\" she said.\n\"Yes, it's upsetting but we've kind of got a bit hardened to it, got used to it, and we've just got to crack on and sort it out.\" \nOn Thursday afternoon, staff at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant were advised to speak to their bosses about returning home if possible, after checking road conditions.\nIn a message to employees, the company warned detours would be needed around road closures on the A595 at Duddon Bridge, Santon Bridge and Holmrook and that Millom was reported to be unreachable by road.\n\"Shift co-ordinators will maintain minimum safety manning levels in plants but others should head home once clarified with their line managers,\" it said.\nNine flood warnings (where flooding is expected) and 15 flood alerts (where it is possible) were in place on Friday morning.\nIn the 24 hours to 03:00 on Thursday Honister Pass saw 307.4mm (1ft) of rain, according to the Environment Agency.\nThe River Rothay was among those that burst their banks.\nTranspennine Express has advised people not to travel on the West Coast Main Line unless essential and has lifted ticket restrictions until the weekend.\nPhil James from Network Rail told BBC Radio Cumbria on Thursday that the heavy rain was \"widespread\" so it was \"likely to affect many rail routes over the next few days\" and urged people to check National Rail Enquiries for travel details.\nRichard Warren from the Lake District Search and Mountain Rescue Association warned people not to go fell walking during the current conditions. \nHe said: \"It's half-term, Scafell Pike is a bit of a honey pot, there were a lot of walkers out on the road looking very, very wet, the car park had quite a few cars in, so people may have gone up Scafell Pike when the rivers were low.\n\"But when they come down they will find they won't be able to cross the rivers, so the message really is stay off the mountains.\"\nStewart Mounsey, the Environment Agency's flood risk manager for Cumbria said: \"We expect river levels to be peaking this afternoon, the quicker responding ones, and then obviously the River Eden is even bigger so we'll see that responding Friday into Saturday.\"\nEnvironment Agency teams were monitoring the effect of the rain on rivers, focusing on western and southern parts of the county, \"making sure flood defences work\", he said.\nAlan Goodman, from the Met Office, said the rain was \"on the wane slowly as today unfolds\". \n\"There's still more steady rain to come but hopefully it will gradually fragment so the problems we have had on the roads should start to ease.\n\"But yes, there's been an awful lot of rain.\"\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "text": "A zoo in Bosworth and a pool in Halifax are among the beneficiaries of the government's levelling up fund. \nThe \u00a34.8bn pot of money was launched last year and now the Treasury has said which areas were successful in their bids for the first tranche of cash.\nLocal authorities, with the support of local MPs, could apply for money for regeneration and transport projects. \nNewly-appointed levelling-up secretary Michael Gove has said the policy would mean people would see a visible difference in their area.\nHowever, critics of this fund have questioned whether small pots of money for local projects across the UK will transform the economy and create jobs long-term without a country-wide strategy. \nAddressing the Conservative conference earlier this month, Mr Gove said \"levelling up\" was also about long-term economic transformation.\nSuccessful bids for the initial \u00a31.4bn pot of money include:\nAnalysis by political correspondent Ione Wells\nThe government has been under pressure to define what their much-touted policy - \"levelling up\" - actually means. \nWe know it's usually used to describe tackling regional inequality - but has at times been a catch-all phrase to promote everything from more money for tennis courts to tackling crime. \nThe government's new levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, has previously said the first part of it involves people seeing a visible difference in their areas being made more attractive - which the government hopes these pots of cash will start to do. \nBut he's also said levelling up involves long-term economic transformation and job creation. \nCritics of this fund have questioned whether or not small pots for different local projects around the UK - bid for competitively by councils and local MPs - will strategically transform the economy or create jobs long-term. \nThough the government would argue other policies, like their cut to the universal credit taper rate and investment in transport links, are more targeting these things. \nThe fund has also been criticised for not giving devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland a role in handing out the cash, especially where bids involve funding things like infrastructure that might otherwise be a matter for governments there to make decisions on. \nWe also don't know who the 'losers' were in this first round of bids, and which areas missed out on cash.\nIn his Budget speech the chancellor appeared to deliberately address accusations of 'pork-barrel' politics - as bids had to be backed by local MPs and bypassed devolved governments. \nPork barrel politics is term generally used to refer disapprovingly of politicians funnelling money to their own constituents, regardless of need. \nHowever, Mr Sunak specifically referred to the three successful bids in Conservative Stoke-on-Trent seats but also highlighted the successful bids in Ashton under Lyne, Doncaster, South Leicester, Sunderland and West Leeds - which include the seats of Angela Rayner, Ed Miliband, Jonathan Ashworth, Rachel Reeves and Bridget Philipson - all members of Labour's shadow cabinet. \nHe said: \"We are so committed to levelling up that we are even levelling up the opposition front bench.\"\nResponding to the Budget, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the chancellor \"gives with one hand but takes so much more with the other\".\nShe accused Mr Sunak and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of operating a \"classic con game\". \n\"The prime minister is the front man - distracting people with his wild promises -all the while, his chancellor dips his hand in their pocket. \n\"It all seems like fun and games until you walk away and realise your purse has been lifted.\"\nAnalysis by Peter Barnes and Joseph Cassidy, BBC Political Research Unit \nThe list of successful bids includes 76 in England, 11 in Northern Ireland, 10 in Wales and 8 in Scotland (105 total) with a total value of \u00a31.7bn.\nIn some instances more than one parliamentary constituency is set to benefit, and in some cases it's hard to judge how the effects will be shared between constituencies.\nBut BBC analysis suggests the following breakdown by party:\nOver Twitter, Mr Sunak challenged Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, to celebrate the news that as part of the fund, \u00a317.6m would go toward improving Leicester railway station.\n\"Let me know if you want me to retweet,\" he said.\nMr Ashworth hit back tweeting: \"We're still waiting for you to properly compensate our Leicester businesses for forcing a local lockdown on us last year or reverse the increasing numbers of children in poverty across Leicester thanks to your cuts.\n\"Let me know when that's sorted so I can retweet,\" he replied.

World leaders will be pressed on their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions and thereby reduce global warming. \nThe hearings also coincide with efforts by President Joe Biden to pass a flagship spending bill.\nCongressional leaders are racing to find a compromise with Republicans and moderate Democrats on climate provisions of the bill before Mr Biden leaves for Glasgow on Sunday.\nThursday's hearings will be held by the House of Representatives Oversight Committee.\nThe CEOs of Exxon, Chevron and BP America, the president of Shell and the heads of lobby firms the American Petroleum Institute and the US Chamber of Commerce will give evidence.\nDemocratic Representative Ro Khanna, who chairs the Subcommittee on the Environment, said quoted by Reuters that the hearing was the start of a year-long investigation.\n\"The idea is for them to admit to the American people what they have done,\" he said.\nA statement by the committee said the industry had known about the effects of global warming since 1977 but \"for decades spread denial and doubt about the harm of its products\".\nMore recently some major companies publicly supported action to prevent climate change while privately blocking reforms, it added.\nMr Khanna said the inquiry could also involve other industries including advertising and social media.\nDemocrats have drawn parallels with the House's Big Tobacco investigation in the 1990s, which after months of testimony concluded that cigarette companies tried to conceal evidence that their products were addictive and harmful.\nAhead of Thursday's hearings, the companies involved said they were cooperating with the investigation and committed to participating.\nAll four oil giants say they are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and Shell and BP are among a group of companies who wrote to Congressional leaders earlier this month to pledge their support for climate action.\nWe are \"deeply committed to combating climate change and promoting clean and renewable energy and energy efficiency, and... have taken significant steps to reduce emissions and embrace climate-forward business strategies\", the letter said.\nFor more on whether oil companies mislead us on climate change, listen to this BBC podcast, 'How They Made Us Doubt Everything'.

      "tags": "Chancellor's Autumn Statement,Rishi Sunak",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out changes to universal credit he says will give low income families an extra \u00a31,000 a year.\nIn an upbeat Budget speech, he said the UK economy had not been hit as hard by the Covid pandemic as expected.\nHe promised more money for schools, business rate cuts and took 3p off the price of a pint of beer.\nLabour said his universal credit measure would not make up for axing the \u00a320-a-week top-up to the benefit.\nThe chancellor painted a positive picture of the health of the UK economy as it emerges from the pandemic, in his autumn statement to a packed House of Commons.\n\"Employment is up. Investment is growing. Public services are improving. The public finances are stabilising. And wages are rising,\" he told MPs.\n\"Today's Budget delivers a stronger economy for the British people: stronger growth, with the UK recovering faster than our major competitors.\"\nHe said unemployment had not hit the levels feared at the height of the pandemic - but inflation was set to rise further, from 3.1% to 4% over the next year.\nMuch of his Budget had been pre-announced, including an end to the public sector pay freeze and an increase to the National Living Wage from \u00a38.91 per hour to \u00a39.50.\nBut Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News the \"almost non-existent\" increase in living standards predicted over the next five years was a \"big blow\" to families.\nHousehold disposable income is set to rise by 0.8% per year, according to Office for Budget Responsibility figures.\nEconomic growth is forecast to rise to 6.3% next year - higher than previously predicted - but it will then slow to 1.3% by 2023.\nNew Budget measures included:\nThe teetotal chancellor also announced plans to \"radically simplify\" alcohol tax, so that it was based purely on the strength of the drink. \nTaxes on sparkling wine, draught beer and cider are to be cut, but will rise for stronger drinks such as red wine and \"white ciders\", from 2023.\nHe also announced that the planned increase in duty on spirits, wine, cider and beer due to take effect from midnight on Wednesday has been cancelled.\nAnd he scrapped next year's planned increase in business rates in England and promised more frequent revaluations, and tax breaks for firms that make improvements to their properties, from 2023.\nIn further moves to boost the leisure industry as it emerges from the pandemic, he announced a 50% business rate discount for pubs, cinemas, restaurants, gyms and other venues.\nRishi Sunak portrays himself as a light touch Tory - who doesn't like heavy taxes, who doesn't like big government. \nBut he's not using the fading of the pandemic emergency to call time on hefty spending. \nNor is the chancellor seizing a moment to argue for a leaner state. \nInstead, his plans increase spending everywhere, in a Budget that on first examination has something for everyone. \nMr Sunak even chose to emphasise how he's restoring spending in some areas to levels not seen since Labour was in charge; less keen to remind you that they were cut back by successive administrations made up of his Tory colleagues. \nDespite dangling the promise of tax cuts by 2024, the Budget seems to confirm the political conclusions of Mr Sunak and Boris Johnson - vows to shrink the state are not going to win them the next election.  \nBut with the threat of inflation, higher taxes and puny, if better growth, the seeming largesse may not be toasted by the public in the months to come, even if they could so with cheaper cider or prosecco.\nThe chancellor waited until the end of his 70 minute speech to announce changes to universal credit, which come after a widely condemned \u00a320-a-week cut to the benefit earlier this month.\nThe universal credit \"taper\" will be cut, so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every \u00a31 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p.\nThe amount people can earn before starting to lose the benefit will also increase by \u00a3500 a year. The new rate will be introduced by 1 December, he told MPs.\n\"This is a tax cut next year worth over \u00a32bn,\" said the chancellor.\n\"Nearly two million families will keep, on average, an extra \u00a31,000 a year.\"\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour welcomed the move but it would not make up for the \u00a36bn cut from universal credit earlier this month, which affected five million families. \n\"Even after this reduction, working people on universal credit still face a higher marginal tax rate than the prime minister. And those unable to work - through no fault of their own - still face losing over \u00a31,000 a year,\" she said.\nThe opposition leader normally responds to the chancellor's Budget speech, but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is self-isolating after testing positive for Covid.\nMs Reeves, who was drafted in to replace him at the last minute, said Mr Sunak had \"no coherent plan\" to deal with cost of living crisis facing many families, with rising energy bills, food prices and tax increases.\nShe told MPs Mr Sunak was a chancellor that \"gives with one hand but takes so much more with the other\".\nThe SNP's leader at Westminster, Iain Blackford, branded the chancellor's planned cut to domestic air passenger duty a \"disgrace\", asking what kind of message it sent to the world on the eve of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.\nThe Liberal Democrats said cutting bank taxes would cost the Treasury more than \u00a33.8bn over the next four years, compared with \u00a31.8bn extra to help school pupils catch up.\n\"He is offering a measly pound a day of extra catch up funding for each child, six times less than the tax cut being offered to the Conservatives' banker buddies,\" said leader Sir Ed Davey."

The rail firm will be taken over by a company owned and controlled by the Scottish government in March.\nMr Hogg said the union would be able to return to the negotiating table with a new employer.\n\"Abellio ScotRail are not going to be there next year,\" he said. \"It is going to be the operator of last resort and I hope the main focus has to be getting our  industrial relations back on track in order to have a dialogue next year. \n\"We are hoping there is going to be a different approach. For the last 18 months negotiations have been protracted and industrial relations have been virtually been destroyed as a result of tactics taken by Abellio ScotRail and Transport Scotland.\"\nIan McConnell, ScotRail chief operating officer, said: \"We have reached a pay agreement with the RMT trade union that resolves strike action.\n\"We look forward to Scotland's railway playing its part in delivering a successful COP26 next week.\"\nThe union had been given until 17:00 on Wednesday to accept the same deal which had been agreed by three other unions.\nIt then announced ScotRail had accepted a counter offer after the 17:00 deadline. \nThe union confirmed that planned industrial action, scheduled to start on Monday, would be \"withdrawn immediately\" as members welcomed a recent agreement on a pay rise.\nIn a letter sent to union members following talks on Wednesday evening, RMT general secretary Michael Lynch said: \"By accepting the offer all industrial action is now cancelled and I instruct you all to work normally on the days you had previously been instructed to take action on.\"\nMr Lynch said the union's offer was accepted \"unanimously\" by delegates.\nTransport minister Graeme Dey said he was pleased the union reached out to restart discussions based on the offer that had been made to them on Sunday. \nHe added: \"Now an agreement has been confirmed the strike action will thankfully come to an end. \n\"As well as getting the pay rise they deserve, railway workers can now go back to delivering rail services for people right across Scotland and as well as for those attending COP26.\"\nUp to 30,000 delegates are set to descend on Glasgow for COP26, which runs from Sunday to 14 November.\nAnother dispute could see thousands of council workers across Scotland including refuse, recycling, maintenance and school catering and janitorial staff taking strike action during the second week of the climate talks.  \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "text": "Cuts to foreign aid spending will stay in place until at least 2024-25, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said.\nLast year the government broke an election pledge when it cut spending to 0.5% of national income, blaming the economic pressures of Covid.\nDuring his Budget, Mr Sunak said forecasts suggested the cut could be reversed in three years.\nWaterAid said this would mean three more years of dirty water and infant mortalities in vulnerable communities.\nAnd Bond - a network of international development organisations - accused the government of \"accountancy trickery\" for using the aid budget to pay for excess vaccine doses, debt relief and Special Drawing Rights - a term for complex currency handouts from the International Monetary Fund.\nLast week, senior government climate change advisers expressed concern over the Treasury's efforts to broaden the definition of what is included in overseas aid. \nThe promise to spend at least 0.7% of the country's income on international aid became a legal requirement in 2015.\nIn the last general election, the Conservatives told voters it would continue to maintain the spending levels.\nHowever in 2020, the government announced it would cut the aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of GDP.\nDefending the reduction, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government had spent \u00a3407bn during the pandemic and that \"there must inevitably be consequences\".\nThe Treasury said it would return to 0.7% levels, but only when its official figures forecast two things.\nFirstly, that the government wouldn't be borrowing money for day-to-day spending. \nAnd secondly, that underlying debt would be falling as a percentage of national income. \nSetting out his Budget, Mr Sunak said \"forecasts show that we are scheduled to return to 0.7% in 2024-25 - before the end of the Parliament\".\nHe said the UK would \"remain a development superpower and one of the largest ODA [Overseas Development Assistance] donors in the G7\". \nThe footnotes of the Budget tell the real story about overseas aid. \nThe chancellor is not promising to increase the spending target to 0.7 percent of national income in 2024. \nHe is merely saying it might be possible by then. \nThe so-called 'fiscal tests' are flexible to say the least. \nThe Budget paperwork makes very clear that \"should future forecasts deteriorate\", then any decisions about the aid target will be made at the time. \nThe chancellor also fails to note that by 2024, there may well be a different government with different priorities.\nAnd in the intervening years, there is a growing debate not just about the size of the aid budget but also what it is spent on. \nThe Budget documents seem to imply - without being explicit - that the Chancellor will start counting different spending streams towards the 0.5% of the foreign aid target. \nWe await clarity from the Treasury but this could include the cost of overseas vaccine donations and special currency reserve handouts from the International Monetary Fund. \nCharities fear that this will mean that several billion pounds less will be spent on humanitarian and development aid. \nSo the headline from the Budget is that the UK's billion pound aid cuts will continue for at least another three years and in the meantime much less may well be spent on development and humanitarian support than before. \nResponding to this announcement, Green MP Caroline Lucas tweeted: \"Is Rishi Sunak really expecting praise for returning to 0.7% GDP for development aid by 2024/5?  This is still utterly shameful.  The cut should be reversed now.\"\nLabour's Sarah Champion - who chairs the International Development Committee - said it was \"good news\" but added: \"I'll celebrate when the poorest in the world start seeing the cash.\"\nChildren's charity World Vision UK said it was \"pleased to see\" the chancellor's intention but expressed concern levels would not rise for at least three years.\nMeanwhile WaterAid warned that: \"Ten million people will miss out every year until the budget is restored.\n\"The chancellor's delay on restoration means three more years of dirty water, further infant mortality and the wider spread of disease for millions in vulnerable communities.\" \nStephanie Draper, CEO of Bond, accused the government of \"once again balancing the books on the backs of the poorest and jeopardising trust in the UK around the world\".\n\"This makes the UK's standing in addressing global inequality even more questionable, whilst severely undermining crucial COP26 negotiations.\"\nSave the Children said any decision to include other costs in the aid budget meant existing aid programmes faced cuts of around \u00a33.6bn."

Resort hotels in Egypt - a popular destination for Russians - are reported to be fully booked, and Russian flights to Egypt are sold out.\nThe Russian news service Vesti reports some panic-buying because of the new restrictions.

      "text": "Finance minister Conor Murphy has disputed a claim by the chancellor that Northern Ireland will get an extra \u00a31.6bn per year for public services. \nRishi Sunak said his budget allocation represented the largest annual funding settlement for devolved governments since 1998.\nBut Mr Murphy said it would create \"significant challenges\".\nHe said it would amount to \u00a31.9bn for day-to-day spending over three years - \"nowhere near\" what is required. \nTreasury figures show the budget allocation will mean day-to-day spending in Northern Ireland will increase by an average of 2.1% in real terms each year up to 2025.\nInfrastructure spending will increase by an average of 2.5% a year over the same period.\nThe Treasury said this gave the Northern Ireland Executive \"sufficient funding certainty\" to plan in-year spending and to provide additional future investments in areas such as health, social care and education.\nBut Mr Murphy said when compared to the executive's 2021-22 budget, there will be an additional \u00a3450m, \u00a3670m and \u00a3866m over the next three years for day-to-day spending \"against growing demand for public services\".\nThis, he added, represented a 0.9% real term increase to the executive's budget next year, turning to zero real terms change by 2024-25.\n\"This spending review was the opportunity to deliver a budget which would have enabled the executive to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery,\" Mr Murphy said. \n\"However it provides a marginal real terms increase in funding next year which will be far outweighed by increased demands on public services, particularly in light of the ongoing pandemic.\"\nMr Murphy said a multi-year budget enables the executive to better plan and prioritise its finances.\nHe said his priority was supporting the health service and tackling waiting lists. \nSeparately, there is an initial budget allocation of \u00a350m from the government's levelling up fund.\nIt is for 11 projects including redeveloping the Dundonald Ice Bowl and extending cycle routes across the Belfast City Region.\nMr Sunak also said he will cut Air Passenger Duty (APD) by half on internal UK flights.\nA cut in APD is a long standing request of Northern Ireland politicians and business leaders.\nIt will mean a new domestic band for APD set at \u00a36.50. \nThe rate will apply to all flights between airports in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (excluding private jets). \nThe government has also announced a proposal to solve a NI Protocol related issue concerning the VAT paid on second cars coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. \nMr Murphy has previously already played down expectations that the spending review would mean significant extra resources.\nEarlier this week, he said there was \"little indication\" the government would \"provide the investment needed to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery\".\nHowever, he said the ability to produce a multi-year budget would provide an opportunity to \"better plan and prioritise finances\".\nStormont has not had a multi-year budget since 2011-2015.\nThat has made it difficult for public sector managers to plan services, particularly in health.\nThe finance minister is trying to build consensus among his executive colleagues that the bulk of any additional funds should go to health even if other departments lose out.\nHe aims to publish a draft budget before Christmas which would then go out to consultation before being finalised early next year.\nThe Institute of Directors Northern Ireland said the additional money will be a \"shot in the arm for the local administration\".\n\"It is incumbent now on ministers to deliver on the incredible potential it presents, with a focus, through targeted investment in key services and infrastructure, on ensuring this region is fit to capitalise on the green recovery as we continue to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic,\" said national director, Kirsty McManus. \nRetail NI said the chancellor's 50% rates discount for retailers in England was welcome. The organisation added it was \"absolutely vital\" that Conor Murphy ensures this also applies to small traders in Northern Ireland. \nMatthew Hall, George Best Belfast City Airport chief executive, said the airport had for many years been lobbying government for the abolition of APD.\n\"A 50% reduction in APD is a half-way house in terms of solving a problem which has placed the aviation sector in Northern Ireland at a competitive disadvantage with other regions in attracting new airlines and routes,\" he said. \"Today's announcement by the chancellor will not take effect until April 2023 and does little in the short term to alleviate a sector still decimated by Covid.\"\nSDLP leader and MP Colum Eastwood said the budget was a \"grim spectacle\".\n\"Now we have some certainty on multi-year funding the onus is on Conor Murphy to actually take responsibility and deliver a multi-year plan to tackle our waiting list crisis and present a credible plan for our economy,\" he said. \nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) assembly member Steve Aiken said the extra \u00a31.6bn a year \"underlines the advantage of being part of the fifth largest economy in the world\".\n\"We still have a long way to go to emerge fully from the Covid pandemic but this budget, if properly used to support the needs of Northern Ireland, gives us a good chance,\" he said. \nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson said the multi year budget should help devolved finance ministers plan spending better. \n\"The last two years have been unprecedented, and the Treasury responded in an unprecedented manner to protect jobs and safeguard employers,\" he said. \nBuckfast tonic wine faces a significant tax increase under government plans to reform alcohol duty.\nThe new system, due to start in 2023, will mean higher duty for stronger alcohol, the chancellor said.\nA Treasury fact sheet suggests a 75cl bottle of Buckfast will face additional tax of 81p.\nThe fortified wine is popular in some areas of Northern Ireland and is sometimes called Lurgan Champagne.\nIt has been made by Benedictine monks at Buckfast Abbey in Devon for almost 100 years.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said he was proposing the \"most radical simplification of alcohol duties for over 140 years\".\n\"To radically simplify the system, we are slashing the number of main duty rates from 15 to just six,\" he said.\n\"Our new system will be designed around a common-sense principle: the stronger the drink, the higher the rate. \n'This means that some drinks, like stronger red wines, fortified wines, or high-strength 'white ciders' will see a small increase in their rates because they are currently undertaxed given their strength.\"\nMr Sunak said many lower alcohol drinks were \"currently overtaxed\", adding: \"Rose, fruit ciders, liqueurs, lower strength beers and wines - today's changes mean they will pay less.\""

      "text": "E-cigarettes could soon be prescribed on the NHS in England to help people stop smoking tobacco products.\nThe Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency is inviting manufacturers to submit goods for approval to be prescribed.\nIt could mean England becomes the first country in the world to prescribe e-cigarettes as a medical product.\nThere has been much debate over the years about whether e-cigarettes should be used for this purpose.\nE-cigarettes are not completely risk-free but they carry a small fraction of the risk of cigarettes.\nThey do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the most harmful elements in tobacco smoke.\nThe liquid, that is heated up to be inhaled, contains some potentially harmful chemicals also found in cigarette smoke but at much lower levels.\nThis aerosol is commonly referred to as vapour and so the use of an e-cigarette is described as vaping.\nA medically licensed e-cigarette would have to pass even more rigorous safety checks than those required for them to be sold commercially.\nE-cigarettes are the most popular aid used by smokers trying to quit, with more than one-in-four smokers relying on them - more than those who use nicotine-replacement therapy products such as patches or gum.\nBut apart from being used in a number of pilot schemes, they have not been available on prescription.\nHowever, in 2017 the government started promoting them as part of its annual Stoptober campaign.\nIt is estimated that about 3.6 million people use e-cigarettes - most of them ex-smokers.\nAlmost 64,000 people died from smoking in England in 2019.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said e-cigarettes could be an important tool to reduce smoking rates.\n\"Opening the door to a licensed e-cigarette prescribed on the NHS has the potential to tackle the stark disparities in smoking rates across the country,\" he said.\nBut Prof Peter Hajek, director of the tobacco dependence research unit at Queen Mary University of London, said the move sent a positive message that e-cigarettes could help people to quit.\nHe questioned whether it would have the intended consequences as the costs of applying for approval could be a barrier to many manufacturers.\n\"Smokers are more likely to benefit from e-cigarettes if they can select flavours, strengths and products that they like, rather than being limited to whatever becomes licensed. \n\"It also does not seem necessary for the NHS to pay for something that smokers are happy to buy themselves. \n \"Overall, it would seem easier to just recommend existing products which are well regulated by consumer protection regulations.\"  "

      "text": "Taxes on sparkling wine, draught beer and cider are to be cut, but will rise for stronger drinks such as red wine following a shake-up of alcohol duty.\nThe new system, due to start in 2023, will mean higher duty for stronger alcohol, the chancellor said. \nThe duty premium on sparkling wines will end and the duty on draught beer and cider served in pubs will be cut.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak called it the \"most radical simplification of alcohol duties for over 140 years\".\nHe also announced that the planned increase in duty on spirits, wine, cider and beer due to take effect from midnight on Wednesday has been cancelled.\n\"To radically simplify the system, we are slashing the number of main duty rates from 15 to just six,\" the chancellor said.\n\"Our new system will be designed around a common-sense principle: the stronger the drink, the higher the rate. This means that some drinks, like stronger red wines, fortified wines, or high-strength 'white ciders' will see a small increase in their rates because they are currently undertaxed given their strength.\"\nMr Sunak said many lower alcohol drinks were \"currently overtaxed\", adding: \"Rose, fruit ciders, liqueurs, lower strength beers and wines - today's changes mean they will pay less.\"\nIn relation to sparkling wines, Mr Sunak said: \"I'm going to end the irrational duty premium of 28% that they currently pay. Sparkling wines - wherever they are produced - will now pay the same duty as still wines of equivalent strength.\"\nThe cut to sparkling wine duty was welcomed by Kate Goodman, owner of Cheshire drinks importer Reserve Wines, but she was disappointed that the change was not immediate.\n\"Christmas is our busiest period. It would have great to introduce this before that time. We need help to get back on our feet after a pretty crippling 18 months,\" she said.\nReducing duty on lower alcohol drinks will encourage people to buy English wines, said Jonathan Piggins, chief executive of English wine merchant Corkk.\n\"The UK's vineyards are being taken increasingly seriously by the major overseas players and reducing the tax on lower alcohol drinks, will give the country an even more prominent position on the global wine map.\"\nThe changes were less welcomed by Liam Manton, co-founder of Didsbury Gin.\n\"Additional tax on high ABV drinks will present a real challenge to businesses like ours,\" he said, adding that on average 70% of the price of a bottle of gin is already tax.\nIn a move to help struggling pubs, Mr Sunak announced a new lower rate of duty for draught drinks, which he said would cut the cost of a pint by about three pence.\nHe said the \"draught relief will cut duty by 5%\" and \"will apply to drinks served from draught containers over 40 litres\".\nThe chancellor said this would particularly benefit community pubs \"who do 75% of their trade on draught\".\nHe also announced proposals for a new \"small producer relief\" to include small cidermakers and other producers making alcoholic drinks of less than 8.5% alcohol by volume (ABV).\nJez Lamb, founder of Wirral-based craft beer marketplace, Beers @ No.42, said the draught relief favoured the big players in the market, not the smaller, independent breweries who need support most.\n\"It's brilliant to see alcohol duty cut on draught beer but that's only for \"containers\" more than 40L. That is great for the big breweries but so many smaller craft brewers only supply in 30L containers,\" he said.\nCreating a draught rate and simplifying the duty system is positive news, said Nick Mackenzie, chief executive of Greene King, which has 2,700 pubs.\n\"It is a much needed vote of confidence in the great British pub as we face into an uncertain winter, labour disruption and rising costs.\" \nWilliam Robinson, managing director of Stockport brewery Robinsons, said the lower draught beer duty rate and the cancellation of the planned inflation-linked increase in beer duty showed that the chancellor \"recognises the contribution pubs make to the communities they support and serve.\""

      "text": "More than 16,000 people have signed an open letter calling on the BBC to apologise for an online news article about trans women and lesbians.\nThe piece, published on Tuesday, quoted lesbians who felt \"pressured into sex by some trans women\".\nThe letter described the article as \"incredibly dangerous\" and said it had used a \"deeply flawed study\".\nThe BBC said it must \"ensure debate and make sure a wide a range of voices are heard\".\nIt is understood the BBC has received a substantial number of complaints and appreciations from audience members.\nThe open letter was published earlier this week by a campaign group called Trans Activism UK.\n\"The implications proposed by this article suggest that transgender women generally pose a risk to cisgender lesbians in great enough numbers that it is newsworthy, and something the general public should consider as a common occurrence rather than a matter of incredibly rare, isolated experiences,\" the letter reads.\n\"It is vital that the BBC, which is a government-endorsed public service that claims to be committed to achieving impartiality with the output of it's content, rectifies this act with a sincere apology, amendment of the article to clarify the falsehoods and damage within, and commits to realigning with their original mission statement.\"\nIn response, a spokesman for the BBC said: \"The article looks at a complex subject from different perspectives and acknowledges it is difficult to assess the extent of the issue.\n\"It includes testimony from a range of different sources and provides appropriate context. It went through our rigorous editorial processes.\n\"It is important that journalism looks at issues - even where there are strongly held positions. The BBC is here to ensure debate and to make sure a wide a range of voices are heard.\"\nIn the article, journalist Caroline Lowbridge explained she had explored the issue after several people contacted her about pressures to \"accept the idea that a penis can be a female sex organ\", adding that she wanted to discover how widespread the issue was.\nThe women quoted in the piece said they had received a backlash for stating that they are attracted only to women who are biologically female.\nThe article attracted both praise and criticism on social media, and the article was trending on Twitter after publication.\n\"The BBC has published one of the most insidious, disgusting and toxic anti-trans pieces yet,\" said Ryan John Butcher of Pink News.\nBut the hashtag #IStandWithLesbians also began trending, and Shahrar Ali of the Green Party said it was an \"insightful article not for faint-hearted, admirably exploring viewpoints from all sides\"."

      "text": "Ten of the world's most protected forests have become net emitters of carbon, as they are degraded by human activity and climate change.\nThe alarming insight is from a study of\u202f planet-warming gases\u00a0emitted\u00a0from and\u00a0absorbed by\u00a0forests in Unesco World Heritage sites. \nIt revealed 10 \u202fprotected forests had emitted more carbon than they locked away over the past 20 years.\nWorld heritage forests span an area twice the size of Germany. \nThe same research also revealed the network of 257 World Heritage forests around the world collectively removed 190 million tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere every year. \n\"That is nearly half of the UK's annual carbon emissions from fossil fuels,\" said Dr Tales Carvalho\u00a0Resende, from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco), who co-authored the report.\u00a0\n\"We now have the most detailed picture to date of the vital role that [these] forests play\u202fin mitigating\u202fclimate change.\"\u00a0\nBut forests face a raft of pressures, including illegal logging, the expansion of farming and wildfires - which are made more likely by climate change. \nCombining satellite-derived data\u202fwith monitoring information at the site level,\u202fresearchers\u00a0estimated\u00a0the\u00a0carbon\u202fabsorbed\u00a0and\u202femitted by\u202f\u202fWorld\u202fHeritage forests\u202fbetween 2001 and 2020.\nBut as well as calculating the billions of tonnes of carbon absorbed by all that \"biomass\" of trees and vegetation, the research revealed how much pressure some of these sites were under.\nThe sites studied in this assessment have some of the highest levels of official protection.\nThey are deemed globally significant in terms of their natural value to the world and are closely and continuously monitored. \n\"But they're still under significant pressure,\" Dr Carvalho\u00a0Resende said. \n\"The main pressures are agricultural encroachment, illegal logging - human-induced pressures. \n\"But we also found climate-related threats - most specifically wildfires.\"\nIn recent years, what Unesco called \"unprecedented wildfires\", notably in Siberia, the US and Australia, have generated tens of millions of tonnes of CO2. \n\"It's a vicious cycle,\" Dr Carvalho\u00a0Resende said. \n\"More carbon emissions means more wildfires, which means more carbon emissions.\"\nAnd wildfires are not the only climate-related threat. \nHurricane Maria destroyed an estimated 20% of the forest cover in Morne Trois Pitons National Park, Dominica, in 2017.\n\"There's an alarming message from this study,\" Dr Carvalho\u00a0Resende said. \n\"Even the best and most protected forest areas in the world are threatened by the global climate crisis. \n\"So action [to cut global emissions] is really needed now to ensure that these forests - that all forests - can continue to act as carbon sinks and, of course, as important sites for biodiversity.\"\nFollow Victoria on Twitter."

      "tags": "Economics,UK economy,UK national debt,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "Government borrowing fell in September compared with a year earlier as the economy continued to recover from coronavirus lockdowns.\nBorrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - stood at \u00a321.8bn, which was \u00a37bn less than in September 2020.\nBut the figure was still the second-highest for September since monthly records began in 1993. \nBorrowing hit record levels during the pandemic.\nThe government spent billions of pounds on emergency measures to protect wages, such as the furlough scheme, which wrapped up last month.\nAs a result, government debt has been pushed up to more than \u00a32.2 trillion at the end of September this year - about 95.5% of the UK's gross domestic product (GDP), and the highest level recorded since the early 1960s.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that the government has borrowed a total of \u00a3108.1bn so far in the current financial year (April to September), although this is \u00a3101.2bn less than in the same period last year.\nAs well as higher spending on Covid measures, the government has collected less in tax receipts during the pandemic, having given some badly-affected firms tax holidays from VAT, for example. \nAs a result of a lower income from taxes and higher spending, the ONS now estimates that in the 2020-21 financial year the government borrowed \u00a3319.9bn. That amounted to 14.9% of GDP, the highest rate seen since the end of World War Two.\nSome government sources of income have started to recover more recently. In September, the amount it collected through Value Added Tax (VAT) rose by 4.5% in comparison with the same month a year earlier. \nFuel duty payments were also up by 6%, although alcohol and tobacco tax takes fell by 12.7% and 7% respectively.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak is due to deliver a new Budget and growth forecasts on 27 October, as well as new multi-year spending limits for individual government departments.\nThe monthly borrowing figure for September was lower than economists had expected. However, Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said that while the picture had improved for the government ahead of next week's Budget, he did not expect a \"major fiscal giveaway\".\n\"Borrowing has fallen much more quickly than almost everyone expected,\" he said.\n\"That said, the rumours are that the chancellor will still keep a very tight grip on the public finances in next Wednesday's Budget to try and bring down borrowing even quicker and build a fiscal war chest to deploy ahead of the 2024 election.\"\nIn response to the latest official figures, the chancellor said that although debt levels have risen, \"our recovery is well underway - with more employees on payrolls than ever before and the fastest forecast growth in the G7 this year\".\n\"At the Budget and Spending Review next week, I will set out how we will continue to support public services, businesses and jobs while keeping our public finances fit for the future.\"\nProf David Miles, a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee and professor of financial economics at Imperial College, warned that there could be \"a long struggle ahead\" for the chancellor.\nHe told the BBC's Today programme: \"The debt came down very rapidly after the end of the Napoleonic wars, the First World War, the Second World War. \n\"All those people who had been in the army and the other armed forces came back into employment, tax revenue went up, the government was spending less on armaments - that's not going to happen now, so I think it is considerably more difficult to bring down the stock of debt to GDP than it was in the aftermath of those earlier wars.\"\nIn recent years, the government has been able to borrow easily at very low interest rates, which makes its debt more affordable.\nBut rising inflation means that the Bank of England may increase interest rates soon, in an attempt to ensure the cost of living does not increase too quickly.\nThe Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, warned on Sunday that it \"will have to act\" over rising inflation soon.\nAlthough he did not give any indication as to when it might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%, investors are expecting rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022.\nWhat's striking in the public sector finance figures is not how big the borrowing or debt is in the financial year to date. That's the same story we've known for months: the second-highest borrowing in peacetime, second only to last year's even more extraordinary amounts. \nWhat's newer, and more eyebrow-raising, is what the figures show about how rapidly borrowing can fall, before any spending cuts or tax rises have taken effect, simply because the economy is growing. \nWith expected growth this year of 7% or more, tax money is flowing into the Exchequer far faster than was anticipated at the last Budget. And much of the emergency spending required in the more severe lockdown last year no longer has to be spent because the economy has, mostly, reopened. Public sector borrowing (the amount government has to borrow to plug the gap between its income and its spending) has nearly halved, dropping by more than \u00a3100bn.  \nNot only that: all the borrowing accumulated over the years, also known as net debt, is also falling, down two percentage points, from 97.6% of gross domestic product in August to 95.5% in September. \nBoth borrowing and debt are falling, not because of any economic hairshirt the chancellor is requiring us all to wear, but because a successful vaccination programme has helped the economy to recover.
