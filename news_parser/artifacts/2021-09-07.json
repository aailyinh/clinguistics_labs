      "text": "Hermit crabs could be mistaking pollution for food because of an additive released by waste plastics, researchers say.\nA University of Hull study of crabs off the Yorkshire coast revealed that a plastic additive called oleamide causes hyperactivity in the creatures.\nResearchers found the compound could be mistaken for the chemical released by food sources during decomposition.\nIt may mean crabs travel in search of food but find only plastic waste.\nPhD candidate Paula Schirrmacher, who was part of the research team, said: \"Respiration rate increases significantly in response to low concentrations of oleamide, and hermit crabs show a behavioural attraction comparable to their response to a feeding stimulant.\n\"Oleamide also has a striking resemblance to oleic acid, a chemical released by arthropods during decomposition.\"\nThe study, which took place off Robin Hood's Bay in North Yorkshire, suggested \"additive leaching\" may play a significant role in attracting marine life to plastic, added Ms Schirrmacher.\nOleamide has previously been identified as a major constituent in the sex pheromone of cleaner shrimp - a distant relative of the hermit crab - and could be used for chemical signalling in other species, the report found.\nThe creatures can also detect smells in acidified oceans, and were attracted to a chemical cue known as PEA (2-phenylethylamine), according to the study.\nPEA is known to warn mammals and sea creatures of predators and its effectiveness may be increased in an acidified ocean, researchers said.\nRising sea temperatures, combined with increased plastic pollution, may also confuse the breeding cycles of blue mussels and affect reproduction rates, the study found.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "A doctor has been jailed after being caught by a paedophile-hunter group when he travelled four hours to try to meet a 15-year-old girl. \nJamil Rehman, 35, from Derby, messaged a fake social media profile and went to Carmarthen to meet the girl in 2019.\nWhen he got there, the father-of-two was confronted by two men from the group, who called the police.\nHe was sentenced to 20 months in prison after being found guilty of attempting to meet a child following grooming.\nJudge Paul Thomas QC told Swansea Crown Court Rehman made the more than four-hour journey in April 2019 \"for one purpose\", to have \"full sexual intercourse with a 15-year-old girl\".\nA subsequent investigation revealed he had contacted another 13-year-old girl, suggesting a meeting.\nDuring his trial, Rehman, who was training to become a GP at the time, had claimed he was \"seeking to help vulnerable girls\" and he wanted the 15-year-old to be his \"tour guide to the beaches of south-west Wales\".\nHe claimed he had confused the word restaurant with hotel, when arranging to meet her.\nHowever, police discovered orgasm prevention tablets in his car, and roses. Rehman had claimed the pills been obtained for his wife, who is expecting her third child this year.\nAt his sentencing Judge Thomas said he had put forward \"a series of frankly ludicrous explanations to try and persuade the jury that your motivations weren't sexual lust but were positively altruistic\".\nHe said Rehman, who is a Pakistani citizen in the UK on a work visa, had \"clearly targeted\" girls he believed to be vulnerable.\n\"As a man who was training to be a general practitioner, who as you revealed at trial had teenage girls as patients, you would have known full well the potential impact of what you intended to do,\" the judge said.\n\"You did not intend any romantic relationship as you were a married man. You simply wanted to use these girls for your own sexual gratification.\"\nJudge Thomas, who ordered Rehman to placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years, said: \"I cannot conceive of a reason where you will be allowed to continue being a doctor and as such you are unlikely to be allowed to stay.\"\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Rehman had arranged to meet the girl and had booked a hotel room nearby after making comments about kissing and hugging.\nJulie Jones, of the CPS, said it was fortunate he had not met any children.\n\"It serves as a stark reminder to everyone of the dangers that children can face on social media,\" she said.\nThe General Medical Council said Rehman remained suspended while it carried out a fitness to practise investigation.\nA spokesman added: \"We treat criminal convictions extremely seriously and any doctor who receives a custodial sentence will be referred for a public hearing at the medical practitioners tribunal service.\""

      "text": "People across the country have to wear face coverings in certain circumstances when out of the house, to help limit the spread of coronavirus. It is compulsory to wear one on public transport and in shops, supermarkets and shopping centres.\nWhile medical face masks and respirators are prioritised for health and care workers, you might want to try making your own face covering.\nHere's our guide to different types and step-by-step instructions on how to make them.\nWhether you're handy with a sewing machine, like cutting up old t-shirts or just want a quick fix, the principles are the same: the more layers of material the better, and the mask needs to fit snugly around the face, covering the nose and mouth, and you should be able to breathe comfortably. \nOne study has shown that the best materials to use are tightly woven cottons or twill, natural silk or quilted cotton material. But you can also make do with what you have around your home.\nLet's start with a simple one.\nThe government advises washing your hands thoroughly or using hand sanitiser before putting on and after taking off face coverings. \nOur next example uses an old t-shirt, preferably thick cotton or a cotton and polyester mix. And still nothing to sew.\nHomemade masks are not necessarily intended to help the wearer, the government says, but they could help stop you inadvertently passing on the disease to others if you have it but are not showing symptoms.\nIf you do have coronavirus symptoms - such as a high temperature or continuous cough, you should stay indoors and isolate at home.\nWhichever face covering you use, they are not a substitute for other guidance, such as social distancing and hand washing. Hand hygiene especially is just as important as before - so washing your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds when you get home.\nOur third example needs a few stitches, but they can be as simple or as complicated as you like - as long as it all holds in place and survives a few washes.\nThere are plenty of other ways to make a face covering - and many examples on social media from professional, designer logo'd masks to cut-up sports socks.\nHave fun giving them a go. Remember you might need more than one, so you have something to use while the other is being washed. Face coverings should not be used for children under the age of two years or people who might not be able to fit them correctly.\nWhen you have your mask, here are a few reminders of what not to do.\nAll masks shown were made by members of the BBC's Visual Journalism team\nGraphics: Irene de la Torre-Arenas, Joy Roxas"

      "tags": "Social care,Welsh government",
      "text": "Wales will receive extra cash for health and social care services from a new tax, under UK government plans.\nMinisters in Cardiff will receive \u00a3700m a year more to spend by 2024-25. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson called the cash a \"union dividend\" as he unveiled plans to reform the social care system in England.\nBut the Welsh government said the announcement was severely lacking in detail.\nThe prime minister announced he would raise National Insurance (NI) - a UK-wide tax on earners - by 1.25 percentage points, meaning someone earning \u00a330,000 a year would pay an additional \u00a3255. \nFrom 2023, the increase will become a separate tax on earned income, with the cash it generates ringfenced.\nThere are long-standing calls for reform of social care in Wales, as costs steadily increase.\nMr Johnson announced a cap on the cost of care in England, but it will be up to the Welsh government to decide if it wants to do something similar.\nThe service is partially funded through the money the Welsh government receives from the UK Treasury.\nHowever, those who receive care often have to pay a contribution, according to how much income and assets they have.\nPlaid Cymru said the plan to raise NI was unfair.\nUnder the prime minister's plans no-one in England would have to pay more than \u00a386,000 for care across their lifetime.\nAnyone in the country who has assets below \u00a320,000 will have their care costs fully covered by the state. Those with assets between \u00a320,000 and \u00a3100,000 will also get means-tested state support.\nMr Johnson said the devolved nations would altogether get an extra \u00a32.2bn a year, 15% more than what they would raise through the levy.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies said this reflected that earnings in the devolved nations - Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - were lower than England.\nWales already receives \u00a31.2bn from NI - the announcement means this will increase.\nSocial care costs for older people in Wales are expected to rise over the coming years. \nCosts stood at \u00a3586m in 2017-18, and are expected to rise to \u00a3723m by 2022-23.\nThe overall Welsh health and social care budget meanwhile stands at \u00a38.49bn.\nUnder the current system, people in Wales have to pay a maximum of \u00a3100 a week for non-residential care if they have a high level of disposable income, and if they have savings and investments over \u00a324,000.\nIf they have capital over \u00a350,000 they have to pay the full cost of residential care - under that amount councils will help to pay, according to income.\nAt the Welsh Parliament election in May, Welsh Labour said it would pursue a UK-wide solution for social care so it was \"free for all at the point of need\" but held off providing its own solution, saying it would wait and see the UK government's plans.\nTaxes on dividends from shares will also rise by 1.25% as part of the UK government's proposals.\nTimothy Williams's mother has been in a care home in Newport since March 2020 - he said they are spending their savings to pay for it and are in the process of selling her house.\n\"We are rocketing through mam's savings,\" he said. \n\"Both my parents worked all their lives. If they hadn't, the council would pay the fees. It makes my blood boil.\"\n\"I've been in touch with the county council and they won't do anything until her funds get down to \u00a350,000.\n\"Even then, the council will only make up a part of the payments, the family will have to make up the rest.\n\"The prices that homes charge when their residents have a bit of cash and a house is diabolical.\n\"Any assistance that government can give can only be good. But the level of funding that is needed, the chunk of the payments will still fall on the families.\" \nFollowing the announcement Mr Johnson invited Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford and colleagues in Scotland and Northern Ireland to a meeting next month.\n\"We now face together the shared challenge of recovery, above all for our economy and our public services,\" he wrote.\nOn Monday evening it was announced the Welsh government would get an extra \u00a3320m in 2021-22 from \u00a35.45bn extra for the NHS in England.\nMario Kreft, chairman of Care Forum Wales, which represents care providers, said the money gave a \"once-in-a-generation\" opportunity to fix Wales' \"broken\" social care system.\n\"What we have now is an opportunity to sort out social care, which is incredibly important for so many reasons, including the fact that it underpins the NHS,\" he said.\nPlaid Cymru MP Ben Lake said the decision to use NI was a \"deeply unfair and regressive method of raising funds, disproportionately impacting young people, businesses and those on the lowest income.\"\nThe Welsh government said: \"We have set out ambitious plans for social care in this term, including paying social care staff a real living wage and offered to work with the UK government on this very important agenda.\n\"While we support action at UK level to provide much-needed additional and long-term funding for social care, today's announcement by the prime minister is severely lacking in detail.\"\nWelsh ministers now face a big question on what their answer is to the pressures and costs faced by social care services, now the UK government has given its own.\nThat question went unanswered on Tuesday and the Welsh Labour government's response to the prime minister was critical but muted.\nMeanwhile, Boris Johnson's comments that he would direct the new cash to be spent on health and social care in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, raised its own queries.\nBBC Wales was briefed at the time that the cash would be legally ringfenced, but commentators cast doubt on whether that would mean a lot in practice.\nDavid Phillips of the IFS suggested that even if the new money is legally restricted, the devolved governments' control of the rest of their budgets mean they could shift other parts of it elsewhere, should they choose to.\nAnd officials at the Welsh end of the M4 stress that nothing has changed in terms of how their funding works, and the Welsh government already gets cash from National Insurance.\nAlso, part of the \u00a3700m does not arise from the National Insurance increase and comes from elsewhere, so, technically, Welsh ministers could spend that how they like, as they usually are allowed to do when their budget increases."

      "text": "The BBC's director of news Fran Unsworth is to leave the corporation early next year, it has been announced.\nA lifelong BBC employee, she took charge of the BBC's news and current affairs division in 2018.\nShe is also one of the 12 people who sit on the BBC board, which sets the broadcaster's overall strategy.\nUnsworth, who will leave in January, said it had been \"a great privilege\" to work for the BBC for more than 40 years.\n\"I have had a ringside seat at some momentous events, including the Falklands War, the Troubles in Northern Ireland, wars in the Middle East, the death of Princess Diana, 9/11 and countless general elections,\" she said in a statement.\n\"The jobs I've done have not always been easy. Undoubtedly, some were more fun than others. But I am proud to have done all of them - and to work for an organisation which has such a vital and precious role in the UK and around the world.\n\"The BBC is free of commercial and proprietorial pressure. Our bosses are the audiences we serve. I am honoured to have been part of it.\"\nThe 63-year-old's resignation comes at a time of upheaval for the BBC's news division. The department is undergoing a major restructure, which will result in about 250 job cuts, with many jobs moving out of London.\nUnsworth, who earned \u00a3340,000 last year, has also been caught up in a row over the proposed appointment of Jess Brammar - a former deputy editor of Newsnight and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post - to a senior role in BBC News.\nIn July, The Financial Times reported that Sir Robbie Gibb, Theresa May's former communications director who now also sits on the BBC board, had texted Unsworth to voice concerns about the appointment, saying Brammar's past criticism of the government could damage the BBC's reputation for impartiality.\nThe exchange has not been officially confirmed, but when asked about the row in a recent interview, Unsworth stressed that the BBC recruitment process was \"independent\" and \"free from any corporate interest\".\n\"Obviously, there are some people who feel we are subject to influence one way or the other,\" she told the Westminster Media Forum.\n\"But it comes back to the robustness of our editorial processes, people who understand their role as a public service provider, and the need for absolute independence and impartiality in what they do.\n\"We have to withstand any pressure that comes from anywhere, and I think we do that pretty well in general.\"\nUnsworth weathered criticisms of BBC bias from both the Labour and Conservative parties during Brexit, and steered the BBC's coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\"Fran has taken BBC News through one of the most testing periods in its history, providing a vital service during the Covid-19 pandemic, when record audiences turned to BBC News,\" director general Tim Davie said.\n\"She has led BBC coverage during a period of momentous events at home and abroad, alongside leading a huge modernisation programme to reshape BBC News. She will be greatly missed by everyone at the BBC.\"\nShe has also had to deal with several BBC crises, such as when BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty was found to have breached editorial guidelines for criticising Donald Trump's tweets in 2019.\nAfter the BBC editorial complaints unit ruled against Munchetty, Unsworth - along with director general Tony Hall and the rest of the executive board - described the ruling as deeply flawed.\nThey said the BBC was \"not impartial on racism\" and that she was \"completely justified\" in making her comments.\nUnsworth also dealt with the fallout from revelations about equal pay, including the resignation of BBC China editor Carrie Gracie. And while deputy director of BBC News in 2014, she was ultimately responsible for the decision to film a police raid on the home of Sir Cliff Richard.\nThe BBC was later forced to pay the star \u00a32m after he won a privacy case over the reports. \nUnsworth apologised to Sir Cliff and said: \"In retrospect, there are things we would have done differently.\"\nShe began her broadcasting career in local radio in Bristol and Leicester, before becoming a producer on BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat.\nShe moved to BBC Radio 4's The World At One and PM, and worked as a radio producer in Washington during the Gulf War.\nShe spent periods working on both the One O'Clock and Six O'Clock News as a producer and editor, and was head of the BBC's political programming and the first female director of the BBC World Service.\nThe process to appoint her successor as head of news will begin shortly, the BBC said."

The children I've had have been awesome and seeing the changes in them has been so rewarding.\n\"In fact, rewarding doesn't begin to describe the feeling when you witness those special moments.\"\nBarnardo's found a rise in referrals to fostering service since the pandemic began - the number of sibling groups referred to it in the past 12 months rose by 31%.\nNew research shows 14% of adults in the UK would consider fostering a child aged 18 or under in the next five years, but that figure drops to just 6% when asked the same question about fostering siblings.\nMs Davies said her foster children have become family and are close to her own children.\n\"My son is a brilliant role model,\" said Ms Davies. \"The boys all fist pump when they come into the house.\"\n\"We all respect their family so we're not replacing them, we're just adding hopefully to their family environment.\"\nMs Davies said a lot of children in foster care have had a difficult time leading up to it and patience and understanding was needed.\nShe said: \"I think it's an awesome experience. I don't like to call it a job as give you far more than you could give them, really.\"\n\"I think it's extremely important to foster because when the children come to me, within a matter of weeks they've already changed.\n\"They had to protect themselves, they had to survive for different reasons so when you take them on and you allow them to be themselves you allow them to grow up.\n\"And if you allow them to do that, then you are allowing this little person who's got so much to give to be a part of the brilliant community.\n\"You don't need to be perfect to be a foster carer, you don't need to be a brilliant teacher or speak five languages, you just need to help a child feel safe and noticed, that's all it takes. They just want you.\" \nMartin Kaid, head of fostering and adoption services at Barnardo's Cymru, said the average age of foster parents was 55, but applications were welcomed from people of all walks of life.\n\"Your love and support can allow brothers and sisters to stay together and make a huge difference to their lives - and to yours,\" he said.\n\"If you are over 21, have a spare room and the time and commitment to support a child - you could be the special person they need.\""

      "text": "August saw the lowest figure for proposed job cuts for seven years, despite the imminent end of the government's furlough scheme.\nFigures published by the Insolvency Service show that British employers planned 12,687 job cuts in August, a fall of 11% since July.\nThe data suggests that the predicted surge in unemployment this autumn may be smaller than expected.\nAt the height of the pandemic, firms proposed over 150,000 job cuts a month.\nEmployers planning to make 20 or more staff redundant have to notify the Insolvency Service when they start the process.\nThe number of cuts they propose gives an early indication of where the job market is heading, long before official unemployment data, which is several months behind.\nAugust was the first month in which firms with staff on furlough were required to pay 20% of their wages, as well as pension and National Insurance contributions. \nThe scheme ends altogether at the end of September - at this point employers will have to decide whether to pay all their workers' wages themselves, or let them go.\nThe latest available data shows that 1.9 million workers were still on furlough at the end of June, and experts had predicted that many of them would end up being made redundant. \nBut just 12,687 job cuts were proposed in August - the lowest number for seven years.\nSo an autumn surge seems less likely now, said Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies.\n\"Given the exceptionally high labour demand and fewer people in the labour market due to the crisis and Brexit, unemployment is going to keep falling back over the next few months even as the furlough scheme winds up,\" he said. \n\"The end of furlough may well slow or reverse that decline, but the biggest issues in the labour market now are that there's not enough workers rather than not enough jobs.\"\nA number of companies have been reporting problems finding enough workers, with the employers' organisation the CBI warning that staff shortages could last another two years. \nThe number of vacancies is at a record high, according to recent figures. \nThe low number of redundancies being proposed is yet another piece of evidence that the UK jobs market is rebounding much more strongly than experts had dared to hope a year ago.\nIn total, 201 forms notifying redundancies were filed by 143 different employers. Both are among the lowest figures on record. \nUntil recently, figures for proposed redundancies were not routinely published in the UK, except in Northern Ireland.\nLast year the BBC began requesting these figures through the Freedom of Information Act, revealing the extraordinary increase in redundancy plans through the spring and summer of 2020. \nThis year, the Insolvency Service has started to publish these figures every month on its website. \nThe data only covers firms proposing 20 or more job cuts, so smaller firms are not picked up by these figures. Employers sometimes end up making fewer redundancies than they initially propose, but they cannot make more than they propose.\nThe figures are not classified as Official Statistics, which are subject to rigorous quality control procedures.  \nData for Northern Ireland is published by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency as part of its monthly Labour Market Report."

It prohibits any form of threatening or violent behaviour towards anyone obtaining reproductive health services, typically an abortion.\nIn the statement, Mr Garland said his department would enforce FACE, while it \"urgently explores all options to challenge Texas SB8 in order to protect the constitutional rights of women and other persons\".\nAbortion has long been one of the country's most contentious social issues. However, polls from the Pew Research Center indicate nearly six in 10 Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\nThis number has remained relatively stable over the past two decades, but masks a partisan divide: only 35% of Republicans support that position.\nIn conservative Texas, an April poll found nearly half of the state's voters support a six-week ban on abortions."

      "text": "Boris Johnson has vowed to end \"catastrophic costs\" for social care users in England ahead of setting out his long-awaited reform proposals.\nThe prime minister will announce the plans to MPs, alongside money to help the tackle pressures on the NHS caused by the Covid pandemic.\nHe is expected to breach election promises and raise National Insurance (NI) by about 1.25%.\nAnd the plan has prompted a backlash from some of his own Tory MPs.\nCabinet ministers signed off the proposals at a meeting in No 10 earlier, with the PM's official spokesman saying: \"There was strong agreement that this is a long-standing issue, particularly on the social care side, which had been ducked for too long and which needed to be addressed.\"\nMr Johnson will set out the detail in a statement to the Commons at around 12:30 BST and will join the chancellor and Health Secretary Sajid Javid for a press conference at 16:00. \nBut tweeting ahead of his appearance, he promised to set out how the government will \"support the NHS in the biggest catch-up programme in its history\" and announce \"a plan for social care to ensure that older people get the best possible care, without the fear or anxiety of catastrophic social care costs\".\nIt is widely accepted that major changes are needed to the social care system, which helps older and working-age people with high care needs to carry out day-to-day tasks, such as washing, dressing, eating and medication.\nLabour said it agreed with the need of reform, but criticised the proposed rise in NI, saying it would unfairly target young people and lower earners.\nA 1.25% increase to NI would mean someone on a \u00a330,000 salary would pay an additional \u00a3255 per year.\nBut the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg understands that after late night talks, ministers agreed pensioners in work would also have to pay the new \"health and social care levy\" - despite people being exempt from NI payments after reaching state pension age. \nShe also said the government might increase the amount of tax paid on income from share dividends to help cover the cost of the new plans. \nDo you have questions about this story? Get in touch: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist. You can also get in touch in the following ways:\nVaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the plans to \"deal with a broken social care system\" represented \"truly historic and ambitious reform\".\n\"One-in-seven people pay \u00a3100,000 or more for their social care, so in my view that nettle has to be grasped,\" he said. \nThe BBC also understands Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to suspend the so-called \"triple lock\" on pensions - designed so rises in state pensions were not overtaken by the rising cost of living.\nThe promise made by the Tories is that the state pension increases each year in line with the rising cost of living seen in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation, increasing average wages, or 2.5%, whichever is highest.\nOn Monday, an extra \u00a35.4bn over the next six months was announced to help the NHS in England tackle backlogs worsened by the pandemic.\nBut it is thought Tuesday's announcement will also allocate cash for the long-term, to increase hospital capacity in England to 110% of its current level.\nMr Johnson will tell MPs the NHS has been \"put under enormous strain by the pandemic\" and cannot be expected \"to recover alone\".\nHe is also expected to say the government will not \"duck the tough decisions needed\" to help the service and fix England's \"broken\" social care system, again with longer term funding.\nBut Laura Kuenssberg said the \"biggest unknown\" would be how much cash social care gets upfront, having been told support will be \"phased in\", while the NHS would be \"main beneficiary of the NI hike for the first three years\".\nJoyce Pinfield from the National Care Association said the sector was hoping there would be funding for the short and long term.\nShe told the BBC: \"We do need something immediately... because most care providers are at breaking point.\"\nThe government is expected to announce an increase in National Insurance, likely of 1.25 percentage points, to raise billions of pounds to pay for helping the NHS catch up with lost time and treatment after the pandemic, and to help improve and pay for social care in England.\nI'm told the cash raised - potentially more than \u00a312 billion - will be ring-fenced somehow, targeted initially at the health service itself then will switch to social care after three years.\nExpect also promises of changes to how the system works, including limiting the amount that families have to pay for care if need it.\nRead more from Laura\nReports the prime minister will raise NI, a tax paid by workers and employers, to cover costs for the plans has received a terse response from Conservatives. \nThe party made a manifesto commitment not to raise NI, income tax or VAT during the 2019 general election. \nOne cabinet minister has told the BBC a National Insurance hike was \"the wrong thing to do, and the wrong way to go about it\".\nTory former chancellors Lord Hammond, Lord Clarke and Lord Lamont have all criticised the plan, while former Tory PM Sir John Major has called it \"regressive\".\nMr Johnson announced after taking office in 2019 that he had a \"clear plan\" to fix the \"crisis\" facing the sector. \nReports suggested the overhaul will place a limit - or \"cap\" - on the lifetime contributions made by individuals, with the taxpayer funding costs on top of this. \nThis would be a version of a plan suggested by Sir Andrew Dilnot, who advocated a \u00a335,000 lifetime cap in 2011. \nIt was put into law in 2014 under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, but delayed and then eventually ditched under David Cameron.\nHis successor, Theresa May, later suggested and then abandoned a form of the proposals in 2017.\nFormer Labour health secretary and Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said an NI rise was \"flawed\" and \"unfair\" - and suggested ministers should instead ask all pensioners to make a contribution of 10% of their estate, topped up by rises in other taxes, such as capital gains tax.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he wanted \"to introduce the NHS principle to social care - everyone would be required to contribute, but everyone would benefit\".\nMr Burnham said \"for the vast majority of people they'd have peace of mind at a lower cost\" and \"I don't see how you can do this without asking pensioners to make a contribution\". \nMeanwhile, Wayne Fitzgerald, Conservative leader of Peterborough City Council, has said he does not think people would mind a tax if they had confidence that it was going to be used for social care.\nThe social care system is devolved across the four UK nations, meaning governments need to develop separate solutions.\nIn England, social care is generally not provided for free. Typically, only those with savings and assets worth less than \u00a323,250 can get help from their council and there is no overall limit on costs.\nPersonal care, such as help with washing and dressing, is free in Scotland for those assessed by their local authority as needing it. Those in a home still have to contribute towards accommodation costs.\nSome care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland.\nThe SNP has called on the government to scrap any planned rise in National Insurance, saying it would \"unfairly penalise Scottish families by forcing them to pay the bill for the Westminster social care crisis in England\".\nThe party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, added: \"If Boris Johnson breaks yet another manifesto pledge, the Tories will descend even further into irrelevance in Scotland.\""

      "title": "Triple lock pension pledge suspended for one year",
      "text": "The government has confirmed a one-year suspension of the \"triple lock\" formula for annual state pension increases.\nThe move follows government concern that a big post-pandemic rise in average earnings would have meant pensions increasing by 8%.\nWork and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said the average earnings component would be disregarded in the 2022-23 financial year.\nInstead, the rise will be the consumer inflation rate or 2.5%.\n\"Tomorrow, I will introduce a Social Security Uprating and Benefits Bill for 2022-23 only,\" she told the Commons.\n\"It will ensure the basic and new state pensions increase by 2.5% or in line with inflation, which is expected to be the higher figure this year, and as happened last year, it will again set aside the earnings element for 2022-23 before being restored for the remainder of this Parliament.\" \nMs Coffey said the figures had been \"skewed and distorted\" by the average earnings rise, which she described as a \"statistical anomaly\".\nShe said the change meant that pensions would still rise, but less quickly. The triple lock would return the following year, she added. \nUnder the triple lock, pensions increase by inflation, the increase in earnings between May and July or 2.5%, whichever is the greater.\nThe Work and Pensions secretary said she was \"anticipating an unusual change in earnings\" due to the pandemic. \nShe added that earnings between May and July were expected to rise by more than 8%, so a one-year adjustment was needed. \nLast month, the Bank of England said it was expecting inflation to peak at 4%.\nThe Conservatives promised in their 2019 election manifesto to maintain the triple lock formula.\nMs Coffey's announcement came just hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson breached another manifesto commitment by increasing National Insurance to fund health and social care.\nAge UK charity director Caroline Abrahams said: \"If suspending the triple lock for a single year helps get a government deal on social care over the line, then I believe it's a price worth paying, but only if it really is just a one-off measure and not a sneaky way for ministers to ditch the triple lock altogether.\"\nMs Abrahams said that with more than two million pensioners currently living in poverty, there was \"a strong case\" for keeping the triple lock untouched.\nShe added that it was \"imperative that the triple lock reverts to normal next year, to help all those pensioners on low and modest incomes who desperately need it\".\nThe one-year break in the usual calculations for increases in the state pension was widely expected. \nThere is, after all, near-universal agreement that the average annual earnings rise (one leg of the so-called triple lock) will be an anomaly caused by the economic effect of Covid. \nCharities representing the elderly will hold the government to its commitment that this is just a temporary arrangement.\nTheir fear is that the government might be tempted to do the same again - potentially reducing rises in a state pension which is already low when compared with elsewhere in the Western world.\nOthers will consider this as a missed opportunity to reform the universal triple lock system, even though its existence is a Conservative manifesto promise for the rest of this Parliament.

      "tags": "Kabul,War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "The Taliban have declared victory over the province of Panjshir northeast of the capital Kabul, the final pocket of territory which has remained outside their rule.\nThe group posted footage online of their fighters raising their flag there on Monday.\nResistance fighters however said they were still present in \"all strategic positions\" and \"continue to fight\". \nTheir leader has called for a \"national uprising\" against the Taliban.\nIn an audio recording posted on social media Ahmad Massoud, leader of the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRF), blamed the international community for legitimising the Taliban and giving them military and political confidence.\n\"Wherever you are, inside or outside, I call on you to begin a national uprising for the dignity, freedom and prosperity of our country,\" he said.\nThe Taliban took control of the rest of Afghanistan three weeks ago, seizing the capital Kabul on 15 August following the collapse of the Western-backed government. \nIt comes nearly 20 years after US forces led an invasion to topple the Taliban.\nPanjshir, a rugged mountain valley, is home to between 150,000 and 200,000 people. It was a centre of resistance when Afghanistan was under Soviet occupation in the 1980s and during the Taliban's previous period of rule, between 1996 and 2001.\n\"The Taliban haven't captured Panjshir,\" Ali Maisam, spokesman for the NRF, earlier told the BBC, saying he was \"rejecting Taliban claims\".\nA tweet from the group's Twitter handle also said: \"The struggle against the Taliban & their partners will continue until justice & freedom prevails.\"\nBut Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement that \"with this victory, our country is completely taken out of the quagmire of war\".\nThe stunning Panjshir Valley is one of the smallest Afghan provinces, steeped in the biggest of legends. \nIts rugged mountain terrain - with its maze of valleys, crevices and caves - has been its greatest weapon in repelling invaders. The Soviet army never managed to conquer it in the 1980s; the Taliban didn't control it the first time round in the 1990s. \nSo in this battle of opposing narratives, it's possible that the Taliban control the Panjshir's principal public arteries and areas, and a landscape known intimately only by its own inhabitants may now be sheltering the most defiant of resistance fighters. But the Taliban advance, however deep, is of great significance - both in symbolic and strategic terms. It's a sparkling jewel in the new Taliban crown as they embark on re-establishing their Islamic Emirate. \nBut resistance leaders including Ahmad Massoud, son of the legendary commander, and Amrullah Saleh, the vehement Taliban critic, won't go quietly into the night.  \nSince taking power the Taliban have sought to portray themselves as more tolerant, but incidents of brutality and repression are still being reported in parts of Afghanistan. \nAlthough the group has promised to respect the rights of women, many fear a return to the way they were treated when the Taliban were previously in power. Women were forced to cover their faces outside, and suffered harsh punishments for minor transgressions.\nWitnesses have told the BBC that Taliban militants shot and killed pregnant policewoman Banu Negar on Saturday.\nThe Taliban told the BBC they had no involvement in Negar's death and are investigating the incident.\nThere have also been several protests calling for respect for women's rights across Afghanistan. \nOn Monday, a group of women demonstrating in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif told BBC Persian that Taliban fighters had threatened them. \n\"They swore at us and insulted us, and said that we should disperse quickly or else they would beat us to death,\" she said, adding that the militants had also threatened anyone who tried to film them.\nHuman rights groups have also documented revenge killings, detentions and persecution of religious minorities. The Taliban have said officially that they will not seek retribution against those who worked for the former government.\nAs yet the Taliban have not announced the final make up of their new regime.\nSpokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told reporters on Monday morning that all the important decisions have already been made, and that they are now working on the \"technical issues\".\nHe also said an interim government would be announced first, allowing for changes later.\nLater on Monday, US President Joe Biden was asked by a reporter at the White House if he would recognise a Taliban government. \"That's a long way off,\" he said. \nMeanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken travelled to Qatar on Monday for talks with the government about the situation in Afghanistan, and to thank them for their part in helping the US evacuations from Kabul.\nMore than 120,000 people were air-lifted from the Afghan capital in a US-led operation before their forces fully withdrew from the country on 31 August.\nA state department official travelling with Mr Blinken on Monday announced the US had helped evacuate four of its citizens over land - the first US citizens the government has helped leave the country since the withdrawal.\nThe Taliban were aware of the evacuation, the official said, but no details were given about their identity or which country they crossed into from Afghanistan.\nUS Republican congressman Ronny Jackson tweeted after the announcement that the four evacuees came from his district in Texas. \nAre you in Panjshir?

      "text": "Police Scotland has been fined \u00a3100,000 after admitting that failures in its call-handling system \"materially contributed\" to a woman's death following a car crash in 2015.\nIt took officers three days to arrive at the scene after the accident on the M9 was reported by a farmer.\nBy then, driver John Yuill had died and his girlfriend Lamara Bell was seriously hurt. She died in hospital. \nMs Bell's mother, Diane, said her daughter now \"has justice\".\nThe High Court in Edinburgh was told that the mother-of-two would probably have survived if she had been found sooner.\nChief Constable Iain Livingstone said he apologised \"unreservedly\" on behalf of policing in Scotland. \nPolice Scotland pled guilty to a charge under the Health and Safety Act on Tuesday and admitted \"corporate criminal liability\". \nThe force admitted that between 1 April 2013 and 1 March 2016 it:\nAs a result, on 5 July 2015 a police officer at the Bilston Glen call-handling centre failed to record on an IT system the report from a farmer that a car was at the bottom of an embankment off the M9 near Stirling. \nThat led to Ms Bell and her boyfriend Mr Yuill lying in the car for three days, \"unaided and exposed to the elements\".\nThe force admitted that the delay \"materially contributed\" to Ms Bell's death in hospital on 12 July.\nThe court heard that she had suffered serious injuries to her skull and brain and developed acute meningitis. \nThe judge, Lord Beckett, said it was \"unprecedented\" for the police service of Scotland to have been accused and convicted in the High Court.\n\"This case arose from terrible events in which two relatively young people died, one of them after days of severe physical suffering when she must have been in an almost unimaginable state of anxiety,\" he said.\n\"As days and hours went by she must have been in a state of disbelief that no help arose.\"\nProsecutor Ashley Edwards QC said: \"Various experts from a range of specialisms agreed that had Lamara Bell been admitted to hospital within six to eight hours of her primary injury, the secondary complications of the injury leading to her death would have been easier to manage and would have been substantially avoided.\n\"This would in all probability have led to her survival, albeit with some long-term neurological disability.\"\nMs Bell's mother Diane said it was a \"huge relief\" that Police Scotland had \"finally admitted being at fault for Lamara's death\".\nShe said: \"The absence of answers and recognition has been the biggest strain because it is the not knowing that has made everything worse.\n\"But the important thing now is that today we have the conviction.\n\"Finally, we can say - Lamara has justice.\"\nIain Livingstone, who became chief constable in 2018, said Police Scotland had \"failed Lamara and John\" in its duty to keep people safe.\nHe said: \"On behalf of policing in Scotland, I apologise unreservedly to their families.\n\"And if the families agree to do so, I would welcome the opportunity to meet with them, when they are ready, to personally convey my apology.\"\nThe court heard Mr Yuill and Ms Bell went on a camping trip to Loch Earn with friends on Saturday 4 July 2015.\nMr Yuill, who held a provisional licence, was driving his car, supervised by a friend with a full licence.\nThe following morning he drove off with Ms Bell, leaving the others sleeping.\nWhen they failed to return home by evening, their parents called police to report them missing.\nMs Edwards told the court a member of the public noticed a blue car partly obscured by bushes off the M9 motorway and called police at 11:29 on 5 July to report it.\nShe said: \"The call handler did not create an incident for this call on the Storm system. He made a note of it in his book but the information was not transferred to Storm.\n\"The M9 call handler said an incident should have been created in Storm.\"\nThe court heard that on 8 July another member of the public noticed a blue car at the bottom of the embankment and went to investigate.\nMs Edwards said: \"On closer inspection, he saw it was a blue car with two occupants.\n\"He saw a female moving her arms and moaning. \n\"She said: 'Help me, get me out'. He tried to reassure her and called 999.\"\nEmergency services attended and Ms Bell, who was in the passenger seat, was airlifted to hospital with serious injuries, while Mr Yuill was pronounced dead at the scene.\nThe court heard there had been no previous concerns about the call handler's work and that the incident was due to \"human error\".\nIn the early part of 2015, police control centres in Glenrothes and Stirling were closed and their work transferred to Bilston Glen.\nA report later that year said there had been concerns about insufficient staffing, which had led to low levels of performance.\nSir Stephen House, who was chief constable at the time, stood down from his post later in 2015.\nMurdo Macleod QC, representing Police Scotland, said that reviews of the call-handling system were carried out in the wake of the tragedy and that the 38 recommendations had been implemented in full.\nHe said: \"Through significant investment in time and resources, concerted efforts have been made to ensure robust measures are in place to mitigate the risks and lessen the risk that something else might happen again.\"\nThe Scottish government noted that Police Scotland had now admitted \"criminal liability for failings in relation to its call-handling service and apologised to the families\".\nA spokesperson added: \"Ministers acted swiftly following the tragic events in 2015 to direct Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to undertake an independent review of call handling in Police Scotland's Contact, Command and Control Division.\n\"The review resulted in 30 recommendations for improvement and since then the Inspectorate has worked closely with Police Scotland and the Scottish Police Authority to implement wide-ranging changes, including the introduction of a single national command and control system.\n\"The Inspectorate noted the considerable priority Police Scotland attached to its work in implementing all 30 of the recommendations.\""

In Wales, no-one who is eligible for care at home is expected to pay more than \u00a3100 a week towards the costs.\nAnyone with savings and assets under \u00a324,000 will be fully funded by their local authority, with a sliding scale once assets go over that amount.\nFor those in care homes, people can have savings and assets (including the value of their home if they own it) up to \u00a350,000 before they have to pay towards the service.\nAs it is something that mainly affects older people, a rising elderly population is putting increased strain on the system.\nThis is particularly relevant in Wales, which already has the oldest population across the four nations.\nCuts in council funding have led to reductions in the amounts local authorities are paying towards social care, meaning some people are missing out or having to pay more to fund their own care.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has had an impact from a number of angles. Deaths of residents in care homes, an inability to move people into homes because of lockdown, staff sickness, increased personal protective equipment (PPE) costs, a heightened shortage of workers - all of these have put more pressure on the system.\nThe pandemic, compounded with Brexit, has reduced the pool of foreign workers who might normally be available to take up positions in caring.\nAccording to Skills for Care, 16% of workers in the sector were non-British in 2019/20. However under the new immigration system which started in January 2021, care worker was not listed on the skilled worker entry route.\nThe knock-on effect to the NHS is also significant as people cannot be released from hospital unless they have somewhere suitable with the right care in place to go to, meaning bed-blocking at a time of massively increased demand during the pandemic.\nThe \"baseline \" cost of care for the over-65s in Wales was given as \u00a3586m (out of a total social care bill of \u00a31.8bn) in 2019-20, according to Welsh government figures.\nThis has been projected to rise to \u00a3687m in the current financial year (2021-22) and \u00a3723m the following year, although these are now considered to be an underestimate in light of the pandemic.\nThe Welsh government published a white paper earlier this year looking at improving social care.\nIt considered the option of providing all social care free at the point of need, in the same way as the NHS.\nHowever it concluded this would cost an additional \u00a3700m per year on top of the current budget, well beyond the government's ability to provide.\nWith National Insurance contributions being increased, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will get a proportionate share of the proceeds, based on the rise in spending in England.\nThe UK government says there will be a legal requirement that the extra cash will be spent only on health and social care, with a source calling the funding \"very beneficial for Wales\".\nUnder a 1.25% rise in contributions, Wales would receive an extra \u00a3700m by 2024-25, which the source said was 15% more than it raises in National Insurance from its population.\nNational Insurance is paid on earnings above \u00a39,564 at 12% up to \u00a350,268, and then 2% on earnings over that amount, so unlike income tax it does not continue to rise past a certain point.\nIf as projected the Prime Minister raises the rate of tax by 1.25%, a person earning \u00a330,000 would pay an extra \u00a3255 every year.\nYou can find a handy guide here."

      "text": "In the next 24 hours, three hugely important decisions will be made which will have consequences for how we live in older age, and who pays for the increase in any necessary care. \nThese decisions have been repeatedly delayed. Put bluntly, the British political system has lacked the capacity to make tough long-term decisions in this area. The inadequacies of the care system, partly a result of decades of political short-termism, were then cruelly exposed by the pandemic.\nSo, something around \u00a310bn a year has been found to make the care system fit for purpose. Firstly, to increase standards, but also to allow for more people to access it for free.  Lastly, there will be a cap on the overall costs an individual will pay for care. \nThis is the state stepping in to help individuals plan for something that it is currently not possible to plan for - how much should you save to finance for your own care?\nThis will be paid for by a rise in National Insurance, breaking the government's \"tax guarantee\" manifesto commitment \"not to raise the rates of income tax, National Insurance or VAT\". \nThe government looked at other sources of income, but ultimately, only these three big taxes offer the capacity to raise the significant sums needed. \nVAT would be a regressive rise, affecting the poor more. Income tax would have to go up by 2p in the pound and is not fully in the UK Government's control because of devolution. \nNational Insurance is viewed as the best way to raise significant sums of money as it also involves a considerable contribution from businesses. \nIt is also how the then chancellor Gordon Brown did it in 2003, and also the way chosen by similar nations, such as Germany and Japan. \nNational Insurance is also the least unpopular tax to rise.\nNational Insurance is, however, a tax on the working hours of those under the age of 66. It avoids property income, dividends and capital gains. \nAnd while, broadly speaking, higher earners pay more the very wealthiest will not contribute on large swathes of their income. \nSuccessive Conservative election campaigns have previously described a rise such as this as a \"jobs tax\" that will cost tens of thousands of roles.\nIf the government does announce a rise, it will create a generational debate about the whole package. \nThe first beneficiaries of it will be those in need of care, but ultimately it will be their descendants who inherit bigger estates after the government pays care bills.\nThe initial answer in Whitehall is that social care spending also benefits working people. But more specifically, that these significant extra tax revenues in the first three years will go on a temporary boost to NHS spending to deal with massive post-pandemic backlogs. This clearly benefits everybody. \nThe bulk of the social care boost will come in the next Parliament, while - over the next three years - the tax rise will fund the post-pandemic NHS rescue.\nThe pandemic will also be the explanation for a suspension of the triple lock pension guarantee, which determines by how much the state pension rises based on either the Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation, increases in average earnings or 2.5% - whichever of the three is the highest. \nAll earnings figures are distorted by the pandemic, lockdowns and furlough scheme.\nSo a double lock will apply, which in practice means a 3% plus inflation rise in the state pension instead of 8% that would have followed if based on the rise in average earnings. That should save \u00a34bn a year. \nThis package of measures, even in its broad contours, represents generationally significant change for a long-shirked challenge. \nAnd Number 10 and Number 11 are making significant judgements about who should pay the price."

      "text": "The Taliban have fired warning shots to disperse the crowd at a large protest in the Afghan capital, Kabul.\nVideo footage from the scene shows people running to safety, while heavy gunfire can be heard in the background.\nHundreds of protesters took to the streets on Tuesday to denounce Taliban rule and demand women's rights.\nProtesters also chanted anti-Pakistan slogans, as many believe neighbouring Pakistan supports the Taliban, which the country denies.\nA video sent to the BBC shows Taliban fighters firing their guns into the air - a move the group banned last week after several people were reported killed after celebratory aerial fire.\nGuards at a nearby bank opened its basement car park to dozens of women who sheltered from the gunfire for about 20 minutes, one of the protesters told the BBC.\nSome journalists, including the BBC's team, were prevented from filming at the rally. Afghanistan's Tolo news agency reported that its cameraman was arrested and detained by the Taliban for nearly three hours.\nA former government official, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC that Taliban members were taking close-up photos of leading protesters, possibly to help identify them later.\nWomen have been protesting for the past week, but on Tuesday men also joined their calls for equality and safety. Many observers had commented that there were few men at the previous women-led rallies.\nThe protesters were heard chanting \"long live the resistance\" and \"death to Pakistan\" as they marched.\n\"The Islamic government is shooting at our poor people,\" one woman at the protest told Reuters news agency.\nAnother protester, Sarah Fahim, told AFP news agency: \"Afghan women want their country to be free. They want their country to be rebuilt. We are tired... We want that all our people have normal lives. How long shall we live in this situation?\"\nThe demonstrations come one day after Ahmad Massoud, the leader of anti-Taliban fighters in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley, called for a \"national uprising\" by civilians against the militants. \nMany protesters showed support for the resistance forces, who say they are still fighting off the Taliban in Panjshir. \nThe Taliban on Monday claimed victory in the province - the final pocket of territory which has remained outside their rule.\nBy Secunder Kermani, BBC Pakistan and Afghanistan correspondent in Kabul\nThe mood amongst the protesters was one of real anger, directed predominantly at Pakistan but also against the Taliban. \nLarge numbers of young women were among the crowd. One, chanting \"death to Pakistan\", alleged the country's air force had bombed Panjshir, the province where resistance forces have been holding out against the Taliban. \nPakistan has dismissed those claims, but is widely seen as having long supported the Taliban's insurgency. Many in Afghanistan have long deeply resented what they see as Pakistani interference - a feeling exacerbated recently by the visit to Kabul of the head of Pakistan's intelligence services, the ISI.\nTaliban members in police vehicles initially drove alongside the protesters, not preventing them from demonstrating. However, they later fired volleys of bullets into the air to disperse the crowd, and stopped us and other journalists from filming further. \nThese protests are the biggest challenge to the Taliban's authority we have seen so far in Kabul, and include bold and direct criticism of the group. One young woman said, \"We demand freedom of speech, democracy\u2026 I'm not afraid of death.\" "

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nThe prime minister has announced a new health and social care tax will be introduced across the UK to pay for reforms to the care sector and NHS funding in England. The tax will begin as a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance from April 2022, paid by both employers and workers, and will then become a separate tax on earned income from 2023. The proceeds from the tax will lead to \u00a312bn a year being raised, the prime minister says, with the majority going into catching up on the backlog in the NHS created by Covid. This will include things like increasing hospital capacity and creating space for nine million more appointments, scans and operations. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the plan is a \"sticking plaster\".\nFour in five people in the UK aged 16 and over are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to the latest UK government figures. A total of 43,535,098 second doses have now been delivered since the rollout began nine months ago - the equivalent of 80.1% of all people aged 16 and over. Health Secretary Sajid Javid calls it a \"phenomenal achievement\" as the vaccine has \"built a wall of defence around the UK\" and is \"allowing us to live safely with this virus\". \nThe government has denied planning an October lockdown in England, after claims were made in a newspaper report. The i newspaper said plans had been drawn up to extend the school half-term holiday, if the number of hospitalisations continue at the current level. The i said a full lockdown was unlikely - but the government could introduce some rules as part of a \"firebreak\". However the Department for Education said the report was \"not true\" and the prime minister's spokesman also denied the report.\nCases of newly diagnosed sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are down by a third in England, data reveals. Experts say the drop is partly due to people changing their behaviour during the pandemic but also because fewer tests have been done. With few Covid restrictions remaining, people are now being warned not to swap social distancing for an STI - and to get checked if they have risky sex. STIs may be symptomless but can be avoided by using condoms.\nDiscarded face masks could be melted down and recycled to help tackle plastic pollution. It is estimated 129 billion single-use face masks are used every day around the world - with 55 million in the UK. One Welsh firm is now working to turn hospital waste into new masks, made with 65% recycled materials. Old PPE, like face masks, is currently incinerated - producing climate-warming carbon emissions - or sent to landfills.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nNightclubs and other crowded venues in England will only be open to people who can prove their Covid status from the end of this month, the government says.

      "tags": "Scottish government,Gender dysphoria,Transgender people",
      "text": "The Scottish government is proposing to make it easier to legally change gender. Supporters say the plans are vital to ensure transgender people are treated with dignity - but one woman who used hormones and surgery to become a man, only to regret the decision, has described the proposed reforms as \"dangerous\".\nSinead Watson says she didn't have any issues with her gender as a child.\nIt wasn't until she began to grow into a woman in her teens that a feeling of insecurity took hold, and she began to dislike her body and feel uncomfortable in her own skin.\nWhen she was in her early 20s, she told BBC Scotland's The Nine, she typed into Google \"something along the lines of 'I'm a woman, I wish I was a man'.\"\nThe results page introduced Ms Watson to the concept of gender dysphoria, defined by the NHS as discomfort or distress caused by a mismatch between biological sex and gender identity.\nShe says she read the list of symptoms - such as feeling a disconnect from one's body and resentment for one's sexual characteristics - and thought: \"That's what I have.\"\nAfter consulting her GP, Ms Watson was referred to the Sandyford gender identity clinic in Glasgow, one of four in Scotland (the others are in Edinburgh, Inverness and Aberdeen). It is also home to the nation's only such facility for children.\n\"I was very aware that I wasn't going to literally change my sex, but I thought if I could transform to such an extent that I passed and lived socially and legally as male [then] it would solve all the problems I had,\" she says.\nOver the next few years, Sinead had counselling sessions at the Sandyford; changed her name to Sean; began taking testosterone; and finally, after two years on an NHS waiting list, had surgery to remove her breasts.\n\"After the double mastectomy in 2017, there was a period of bliss,\" she says. Soon though \"the novelty of that wore off and I thought, you know, why do I still hate myself?\"\nFor Ms Watson the three years since have been painful. She has now concluded that transitioning was a terrible mistake, that she did not in fact have symptoms of gender dysphoria but individual physical and psychological issues which should, she says, have been diagnosed and treated as such.\nFor now Sinead remains, legally at least, Sean. She changed her gender on her passport and her driving licence but not her birth certificate and is now trying to figure out how to change them back.\nMs Watson says she has serious concerns about a proposed change in the Scotland's laws that would make it easier to change a birth certificate from male to female or vice versa, and potentially to lower the age at which you could do so from 18 to 16.\nSince 2005, trans people have been able to apply to a UK tribunal called the Gender Recognition Panel for a gender recognition certificate to allow them to amend their birth certificate (passports and driving licences can be changed more easily).\nTypically, at present, successful applicants must obtain a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and must swear an oath that they have been living in their new gender for two years and that they intend to do so for the rest of their life.\nThey must provide one medical report outlining their diagnosis and a second detailing any relevant treatment or surgery. Other information, such as utility bills to prove how they have been living, can also be requested by the panel.\nThe Scottish government is proposing to relax some of these requirements, making the process \"less onerous\".\nUnder the proposals applicants would no longer need a clinical diagnosis or medical reports, and the two-year period would be reduced to three months. This would be followed, if an application was accepted, by three months for reflection before the gender recognition certificate was issued.\nCases would be handled by the Registrar General for Scotland, removing the need to apply to the panel.\nApplicants would still have to swear an oath confirming that they intended to live permanently in their acquired gender, and making a false statement would be a criminal offence.\nMs Watson regards some aspects of the proposed new legislation as \"dangerous\" and voices concerns that many more people will end up in her situation as the number of people transitioning rises.\nShe worries especially that young people are being pushed towards a diagnosis of gender dysphoria by a combination of well-meaning doctors and politicians, and the warm embrace of online trans communities.\n\"It's like social contagion,\" she says, recounting her own experience. The system was geared up to help her transition, she argues, but not to help her when she began to have doubts.\n\"I got next to no support off mental health professionals. They seemed very uncomfortable whenever I discussed transition regret. So I'm really fortunate that I have amazing loved ones that were there to help me. I probably wouldn't be here without them, to be honest.\"\nMs Watson said she was particularly worried about the idea that the age limit for legally changing gender could be lowered to 16.\n\"If you don't actually have gender dysphoria and you go down that route you end up like me, where you've irreversibly changed your body with hormones and surgery and you feel humiliated, you feel ashamed of yourself and you feel completely betrayed by the people that allowed this to happen,\" she says.\nNHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, which runs the Sandyford, said the clinic follows internationally-agreed guidelines. Patients undergo full assessments by psychiatrists, sexual health doctors, psychologists and occupational therapists including multiple engagements over an extended period to ensure they fully understand the process. \nIt said treatment and support were tailored to individual needs, and patients were regularly referred to services outwith the clinic for other health needs, including mental health conditions.\nHow many people actually de-transition is in dispute. Ms Watson says she has spoken to \"dozens and dozens\" and is in a group chat with about 50 de-transitioners, although the nature of social media and a desire for anonymity makes it difficult to verify their stories.\nAcademic research estimates that the total number of people who have de-transitioned in Scotland is between 18 and 36, or between 1% and 2% of those who transition.\nSimilarly to Sinead, Emily Frood says she had no idea she was transgender until she was 17 years old.\nShe was born as a boy and had lived her childhood content with her sex until one day, \"it suddenly kind of clicked\".\n\"I'd never thought about it before\u2026 because I had no experience and knowledge of trans people,\" Ms Frood says, adding with a smile: \"It is really bonkers.\"\nNow 21, Ms Frood is in her final year of film and media studies at Queen Margaret University in Musselburgh, East Lothian, and her appearance has changed dramatically.\nNot only is she wearing make-up and a colourful blouse but hormone therapy has stopped the growth of facial hair and redistributed muscle and fat, changing the shape of her body and the contours of her face.\nMs Frood, who hopes one day to win a seat in the Scottish Parliament for the Green Party, uses the personal pronoun \"she\" and calls herself a trans woman, but she describes herself as \"non-binary\" - meaning she does not identify as either male or female.\n\"For trans people,\" she says, \"the lines get blurred a little.\"\n\"I personally don't identify fully with womanhood in a binary way, but kind of somewhere in between that. Just not man. If that makes sense.\"\nThe current heated discussion about transgender rights suggests there are many people in the country for whom this does not in fact make sense.\n\"The kind of anti-trans rhetoric that comes up especially in newspapers and print media is horrendous,\" says Ms Frood.\nSelf-harm and suicide \"are all too common in our community because the progression of our rights is framed as a debate\", she says.\nShe regards critics who insist gender is an immutable biological fact defined by physical characteristics at birth as ill-informed at best.\n\"Anyone who has either studied more than higher grade biology or had any kind of introduction to sociology will understand that gender doesn't work like that and neither does sex,\" she says.\nFor Ms Frood the proposed legislative changes are welcome but don't go far enough. An initial consultation included a recommendation that the Scottish government should recognise non-binary people in law but ministers now say they do not intend to do so.\n\"We were gutted, completely let down and it's quite shameful, to be honest,\" says Ms Frood.\n\"To see that result in a consultation response was incredible and for it to be totally ignored was devastating.\"\nThere is not a definitive figure for the number of transgender people in Scotland but an NHS report published in May 2018 cited an estimate of 0.5% of the population, or some 24,000 adults.\nThe report said the number of trans people accessing NHS gender identity services had risen sharply between 2014 and 2017.\nFrom 2014 to 2015 the number of children aged 16 and below being referred with gender issues more than doubled from 63 to 128.\nBy the end of the period surveyed there was some indication that the rate of increase was slowing but published data is so scarce that it is hard to be sure.\nFor James Morton, manager of the Scottish Trans Alliance, a Scottish government-funded project which campaigns for improved rights for transgender people, the changes, while not perfect, are a welcome step forward.\n\"I've gone through the gender recognition process myself and got a gender recognition certificate and it was really humiliating and really frustrating,\" he says.\nMr Morton says in his case a deeply intrusive psychiatric report was rejected as not detailed enough because, for example, he had not detailed what toys he played with as a child or revealed whether or not he had a sexual partner.\n\"What has that got to do with how I'm living my life?\" he asks.\nThe government is also consulting on one proposal to reduce from 18 to 16 the age at which people can apply to legally change their gender and another to draw up guidance to \"protect and promote\" the rights of trans pupils in schools.\nFor Rhona Hotchkiss that is a worry.\n\"You can't buy a pack of cigarettes or drink a pint at 16, but you can make a decision that will affect the rest of your life,\" she says. \"It just seems bizarre.\"\nMs Hotchkiss became interested in the debate about transgender rights when she was governor of Cornton Vale women's prison near Stirling.\n\"My experience is that it is always an issue to have trans women in with female prisoners,\" she says. This was not just because of what she describes as the occasional \"physical or sexual threat\" but also because \"the very fact of the presence of a male-bodied person\" among vulnerable women causes \"distress and consternation\".\nMs Hotchkiss says she accepts that calling trans women \"male-bodied\" may cause offence and says she has \"no wish to disparage\" anyone, but insists that most trans prisoners \"have done nothing to change their physical appearance, or very little\".\n\"The vast majority of women in prison have been traumatised by male violence, and they are threatened by having a male-bodied person in what is quite an intimate living space,\" she says.\nMs Hotchkiss says she has witnessed aggression from trans prisoners including threats to rape female staff and prisoners, but is not aware of anyone actually being attacked by a trans prisoner in Scotland.\nAt present a trans woman does not have a legal right to insist on being placed in a women's prison but the former governor says she is concerned that the current consultation may open up a path to that changing, making it harder, she argues, to keep women safe.\nHowever, the Scottish Prison Service insists that acquiring a gender recognition certificate \"does not and will not give a prisoner any new legal rights regarding the decisions that are made by the Scottish Prison Service about their accommodation\".\nMs Hotchkiss is one of a number of high profile lesbian, feminist activists who have attracted opprobrium for taking what other feminist activists see as the wrong side in this debate.\nShe says that her belief that \"it is not possible for a man literally to become a woman\" has resulted in her being attacked online as \"a racist, a fascist, a Nazi, a bitch\" and \"much worse words than that\".\nMr Morton points out that transgender people have also been threatened with violence and even attacked.\n\"But I don't think there should be a competition,\" he adds. \"It's unacceptable for anybody to be being abusive towards anybody else and I want all of that to stop.\"\nHe says most of the abuse is online and urges everyone involved in the debate to step away from Twitter, which he regards as a toxic forum.\nMr Morton argues that women are not going to be put at risk in prisons, insisting that the legal ability to keep a trans woman in a male facility or a transgender facility based on individual risk assessments will remain.\n\"There's usually only about 15 to 20 trans people in the Scottish prison system so it's not an unwieldy number of people to do in-depth, individualized assessments of,\" he says.\nMr Morton reckons there is a \"moral panic\" about transgender people which has echoes of the battle, 20 years ago, over Section 28 of the Local Government Act which prevented state schools from teaching that homosexual relationships were acceptable.\nThe Scottish government consultation, which has clearly generated passion, discomfort and even anger, closes on 17 March.\nIf you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, you can find support and advice via BBC Action Line."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nadhim Zahawi,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government has denied newspaper reports that it is planning an October lockdown in England.\nThe i newspaper said plans had been drawn up to extend the school half-term holiday, if the number of hospitalisations continue at the current level.\nThe i said a full lockdown was unlikely - but the government could introduce some rules as part of a \"firebreak\".\nHowever the Department for Education said the report was \"not true\".\n\"It is not true that the government is planning a lockdown or firebreak around the October half term,\" it said in a tweet.\nThe prime minister's spokesman also denied the report. He said plans had been kept for a range of scenarios - \"but these kind of measures would only be reintroduced as a last resort to prevent unsustainable pressure on our NHS\".\n\"I think we've been clear throughout that we will take action, and indeed we have done when necessary to protect our NHS,\" he said.\nBut the spokesman pointed out that when rules were brought in the past, the UK did not yet have the protection from vaccines. \nOn Tuesday the UK recorded another 37,489 coronavirus cases, with 209 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. \nFour in five people in the UK aged 16 and over are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19, the latest figures show. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said it was \"a phenomenal achievement\".\nIf the NHS was at risk of collapse the return of restrictions is possible. Contingency plans are, of course, in place. \nBut the key question is - what is the likelihood of this? Very few of those scientists advising government think it's a likely scenario. \nAnd - as one scientist put it to me - \"if we were going to suggest anything it wouldn't be closing schools\".\nThat's not to say there isn't real concern about winter. \nCovid, plus the return of normal winter viruses made worse by lack of immunity from social distancing and lockdown last year, means the coming months are likely to be very difficult for the NHS. \nCare could be rationed and performance deteriorate as happens quite often in winter.\nBut it is important to remember currently fewer than 7% of beds are occupied by Covid patients - and the numbers are not rising rapidly.\nEarlier, the government's vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said he hoped booster jabs would avoid the need for any new lockdown rules.\n\"Look, vaccines have given us the ability to reduce infections, to save 100,000 lives,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\n\"I'm not going to be arrogant and say to you this is a done deal, it's all over, it's fine, this virus is no longer in pandemic stage. \n\"But I hope through the booster programme we can transition the virus from pandemic to endemic status and deal with it year in, year out... but not have to close down our economy or take the severe measures we had to sadly take in December of last year.\"\nThe first booster vaccines for the most vulnerable are expected this month.\nThe latest advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation - which advises the government on vaccines -  suggests more than 30 million people should receive a booster dose of Covid vaccine.\nThat number includes all over-50s and anyone over 16 who qualifies for a flu jab.\nSeparately to the booster jabs, about 400,000 to 500,000 people in the UK who are severely immuno-suppressed will also be eligible for a third dose of vaccine. This is different to a booster jab, and they may also get a booster at a later date.\nMr Zahawi also emphasised that the flu vaccine was important. \n\"I worry about flu,\" he said. \"We've got a big flu programme that has begun and will continue throughout the winter months as well as, I hope, our Covid booster programme which will begin shortly this month.\"\nThe number of people in hospital with coronavirus has been slowly climbing in recent weeks - although it is still far below the peak in January this year.\nSo far, nearly 80% of adults in the UK are fully vaccinated, while almost 89% have had a first dose.

      "tags": "Jair Bolsonaro,Brasilia,Brazil",
      "text": "Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro struck a defiant note on the country's independence day on Tuesday.\nHe told tens of thousands of his supporters who had gathered in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo that only God would remove him from power.\nHe also launched fresh attacks on Congress and the Supreme Court, institutions he says are persecuting him and his political allies.\nThe court recently approved several investigations into Mr Bolsonaro. \nMr Bolsonaro has always been fond of giving impassioned speeches in which he not only lambasts his critics and calls them names but also portrays himself as the victim of concerted attacks by his rivals. \nBut mounting pressure from several investigations and calls for his impeachment have led to the president's rhetoric becoming ever more belligerent.\nThe rallies he convened for independence day were seen as an attempt to demonstrate he can still draw huge crowds of supporters after recent polls had him trailing his left-wing rival Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva by nine percentage points.\nWhile elections are not due to be held until October 2022, Mr Bolsonaro's approval ratings have also dropped to an all-time low. \nA poll by the Atlas Institute suggested that 61% of Brazilians described his government's performance as bad or very bad, up from 23% when he first took office in January 2019. \nWhile an attempt to impeach the president over his handling of the Covid crisis was blocked by the speaker of the lower house of Congress, Mr Bolsonaro is portraying himself as under attack from Congress and the Supreme Court.\nLast week, he told evangelical leaders - who are among his staunchest backers - that \"I have three alternatives for my future: being arrested, killed or victory\".\nAnd he again took up that theme in his speech on independence day, saying that \"only God will oust me\".\nHe also used his speech to again cast doubts on Brazil's electronic voting system, telling his supporters he would not take part in an election \"farce\" in 2022. \nMr Bolsonaro has long tried to change the exclusively electronic system, which he alleges is open to fraud, to one which provides paper receipts for each vote cast. \nThe electoral tribunal has not only dismissed his attacks as \"disinformation\" but has also opened an investigation into the president's allegations that the system is fraudulent.\nHis critics say he is using the same tactics as former US President Donald Trump to allege widespread fraud in case he loses next year's presidential election.\nAn estimated 140,000 people, many of them waving the Brazilian flag, answered Mr Bolsonaro's call to rally in S\u00e3o Paulo, where they filled Paulista Avenue. \nThe president had earlier attended another rally in the capital, Brasilia, where tens of thousands gathered to express their support for the president.\nThere was a large police presence in Brasilia where threats made by some of the president's supporters to storm the Supreme Court had led to fears that Brazil could see similar scenes to those that played out on 6 January in Washington DC, when supporters of President Trump surged past barricades into the US Capitol.  \nBut while some Bolsonaro supporters broke though a police cordon in the early hours of Tuesday, they did not manage to surround the Supreme Court building. \nMr Bolsonaro did again lash out at the Supreme Court justices, telling the crowd that \"I'm very happy to see that all of Brazil got together for a new independence against the communist dictatorship of the judicial authorities\".\nHe has frequently clashed with Supreme Court justices during his tenure and tried to have one of them impeached after the judge launched two investigations against him.\nMany of his supporters called for the closure of the Supreme Court and Congress, accusing them of abusing their powers and persecuting Mr Bolsonaro.\nMany left-wing and trade union groups which had originally called on their supporters to hold counter-on Tuesday, moved their events to Sunday to avoid clashes with Mr Bolsonaro's supporters.

      "tags": "NI education,Contact tracing,Schools,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Northern Ireland Assembly is to be recalled to discuss the situation regarding Covid-19 in schools.\nThe speaker has decided that the recall, which follows a petition put forward by Sinn F\u00e9in, will take place on Thursday at 12:00 BST. \nSome principals have expressed concern that guidance on testing and tracing has caused a high number of pupils to miss classes.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan has suggested a quicker test could be used.\nEducation Minister Michelle McIlveen said proposals for dealing with Covid school absences were being finalised, and would be discussed with the education sector this week. \nShe said discussions had been ongoing between her department and the Department of Health. \nAssembly members were officially due to resume assembly business on Monday.\nThe recall, proposed by Pat Sheehan MLA, needed 30 signatures to pass.\nEducation Minister Michelle McIlveen needed to give \"clear guidance\" and put in place enough resources to support staff in keeping schools open, he said.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Givan, a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) colleague of the minister, said the executive may need to consider other options for Covid-19 testing and contact tracing in schools.\nIt comes after more than half of the pupils at Larne High School were absent on Monday because they were in close contact with a positive case.\nThe current guidance issued by the Public Health Agency (PHA) last month advised that close contacts of a positive case can avoid self-isolation if they had recently tested positive themselves and present no symptoms.\nOtherwise, if a pupil is a close contact and has no symptoms but has not had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the previous 90 days, they are advised to self-isolate until they have taken a test.\nMr Givan said this policy was supported by all the parties in the executive and should be followed, rather than children having to self-isolate for the previous requirement of 10 days.\nThe word that you hear a lot is \"unsustainable\". Principals are saying they can't go on like this. \nMichael Carville, who is head of Regent House, a secondary school in Newtownards with 1,400 pupils, said to me on Monday that he hasn't done any education since he got back to school at the start of term. It it has been all contact tracing.\nAnd a number of other heads [principals] are in the same position. \nWe are only just a week into term, and there is a recognition right across the board that it cannot go on like this. \nThe problem is, what do we do about it?\nAny major change in self-isolation rules would have to be approved by the executive.\nIt is hard to know if that would be palatable to the executive, or what other changes could be made without executive approval.  \nMr Givan conceded it was \"becoming difficult\" to find available slots for PCR tests and questioned if the education system should \"go back to a system of lateral flow testing\", which are not as accurate but provide quick results.\nHe told BBC News NI that such tests were considered sufficient for access to venues such as sporting events and could be \"carried out at home by parents\".\n\"Every option needs to now be considered because if the system within the Public Health Agency cannot support principals to implement a policy which was to prevent children being put out for 10 days and to have a turnaround of 24 hours, then we need to be considering other options,\" he said.\nBut St John the Baptist Primary School principal Chris Donnelly said lateral flow testing did not give the same security.\nTwo classes at the Finaghy school were sent home because of positive cases last week, he said. \nOver the weekend he asked parents to provide documentary proof of negative PCR tests. \nThe same documentary proof would not be available with a lateral flow test, he said. \nHe said he also had to stop two children from coming into school because they had not been tested.\n\"There's a trade-off in society at the moment. We know that opening the schools can only do one thing. It's only going to lead in an increase in the number of cases,\" he told BBC's Evening Extra programme. \n\"But we understand that society needs to function. If we're going to have that system in place then we need to trust that the system is robust.\n\"I do not think relying on lateral flow tests is robust, I don't think that it would provide the reassurance that parents, that staff members and school leaders need.\"\nBrain Guthrie, head teacher of Ebrington Primary School in Londonderry, said the first positive cases since the school year started were identified at the end of last week.\nHe told BBC Radio Foyle some of the messages coming from the PHA have been mixed.\n\"If a child tests positive here at Ebrington, having reported cases before I am feeling confident enough myself to get information out to parents. We have our letter ready to go, we adjust the date appropriately,\" he said.\n\"I then make the phone call through to PHA and make them aware of that. The only thing is, is the pressure of time, the amount of added administration that is putting on principals.\"\nLori Campbell, who is a mum of four and also works as a childminder in Londonderry, was instructed to take one her children home when she arrived at the school gates on Monday.\n\"Her class was involved in a close-contact situation and they needed us to return home and organise a PCR test,\" Mrs Campbell told BBC Radio Foyle.\n\"It left me in a situation where I was meant to be working, I had another child on board who was then at risk and my husband was at work.\"\nShe said her daughter's Covid-19 test results came back negative.\n\"If her test had came up positive, I would have to close my business and that would be me closed until her PCR test came back clear,\" she said.\n\"That's not a great position to be in and not a great position to then land other parents in who have to come and pick up their child.\"\nMrs Campbell has called for the current testing and tracing protocols in schools to be changed.\nBBC News NI asked the Department of Education and Education Authority (EA) for figures for the number of pupils absent from class, but they directed us to the PHA.\nThe PHA directed us to a Covid-19 bulletin, which has not been updated since August 29.\nStormont education committee chair Chris Lyttle said he had requested that both the PHA and chief medical officer attend Wednesday's education committee meeting. \n\"We need greater clarity on what the evidence is behind the system we have in place, and whether the system is operating as it is supposed to,\" said the Alliance assembly member.\nSDLP education spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said the lack of planning by the Department of Education had \"plunged schools into crisis\".\n\"I have been inundated by school principals complaining about the current guidance, it's not fit for purpose and resulted in them and their staff spending countless hours focused on contact tracing and other Covid-related issues instead of education,\" he said.\nFollowing the absence levels at Larne High School, the PHA set up a mobile testing facility at Larne Leisure Centre.\nThe real business on Thursday may not happen within the assembly chamber but at the executive meeting which is also due to take place.\nThe education and health ministers have been tasked by the executive to go off and listen to what's been said by teachers on the ground, to speak to public health officials and the chief medical officer.\nThey will come back to the executive on Thursday with some proposals as to how they may be able to tackle this current crisis.\nIt was anticipated there was going to be difficulties but ministers have now found themselves in the position where they are going to have to look again at this problem.\nPerhaps the scale of the problem that was coming down the track was underestimated.\nBehind the scenes, there is probably a lot of scrambling going on.\nOn Sunday, the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said some schools had decided not to follow the PHA guidance because they feared it could lead to greater infection rates.\nThe union said some principals would like pupils to have longer self-isolation periods to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to their classmates.\nThe first minister said he wanted the Department of Health to provide an update on the situation at Thursday's executive meeting.\nUp to 12,000 pupils are out of school in the Republic of Ireland, RT\u00c9 has reported.\nAbout 1,300 schools are reporting cases but the \"vast majority\" are traced to community transmission and not picked up in school, according to the Health Service Executive.\nIrish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said \"we are seeing a large number of students having to self-isolate because they have been deemed to be close contacts and they of course will get tested\"."

The hope is by earmarking it for health and care and separating out this levy on all tax bills, that the public won't mind."

      "text": "Israeli authorities have launched a manhunt after six Palestinian prisoners escaped from one of the country's most secure jails overnight.  \nThe men are believed to have dug a hole in the floor of their cell at Gilboa prison, then crawled through a cavity and tunnelled beneath the outer wall.\nOfficials were alerted by farmers who noticed them running through fields. \nThe fugitives include a former leader of the militant group Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade and five Islamic Jihad members.\nAn Israel Prison Service official described the escape as \"a major security and intelligence failure\". Palestinian militant groups hailed it as \"heroic\".\nThe alarm was raised at Gilboa Prison, a high-security facility in northern Israel known as \"The Safe\", when authorities received reports from local farmers about \"suspicious figures\" in nearby agricultural fields.\nWhen prison staff carried out a headcount at 04:00 (01:00 GMT), they found six inmates were missing.\nThe Palestinians are believed to have made their way out of the cell that they shared by digging a hole in the floor of their bathroom. The Jerusalem Post reported that they had used a rusty spoon that they hid behind a poster. \nThe hole led to a hollow space underneath the prison that was created during the facility's construction, when piles were sunk into the ground. An Israeli police commander described it as a \"structural flaw\".\nThe inmates are believed to have moved through the space to reach the prison's outer wall, then dug a tunnel that emerged in the middle of a dirt road just outside.\nThe Shin Bet security service said it believed the prisoners had been in contact with people outside the prison using a smuggled mobile phone and that they had been picked up in a car.\nThe six fugitives include Zakaria Zubeidi, a former commander of the Palestinian militant group Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade in the West Bank city of Jenin, as well as five members of Islamic Jihad. \nFour of the Islamic Jihad members were serving life sentences after being convicted of planning or carrying out attacks that killed Israelis, while the fifth had been held without charge for two years under a so-called administrative detention order, according to Israeli media. \nZubeidi was arrested by Israeli forces in 2019 on suspicion of involvement in a number of shooting attacks and is currently standing trial.\nIsraeli border police and army troops involved in the manhunt have reportedly set up roadblocks to stop the men reaching the nearby occupied West Bank or Jordan, which is about 14km (nine miles) to the east of Gilboa prison.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett spoke to Public Security Minister Omer Bar-Lev and \"emphasised that this is a grave incident that requires an across-the-board effort by the security forces\" to find the fugitives.\nIslamic Jihad described the jailbreak as \"heroic\" and said it would \"shock the Israeli defence system\", while Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said it was a \"great victory\" that proves \"the will and determination of our brave soldiers inside the prisons of the enemy cannot be defeated\"."

      "text": "A number of changes to Covid restrictions have been agreed by the Northern Ireland Executive.\nUnder the new moves, the number of people allowed indoors at domestic settings will rise from 10 to 15.\nMinisters have also agreed to remove table service rules indoors and outdoors at pubs and restaurants.\nPeople will be allowed to play pool, darts and gaming machines while dancing will also be allowed at weddings and civil partnership receptions.\nThe requirement to purchase tickets in advance for live performances will be removed, as will the need for audience members to have allocated seats.\nThe changes are seen as \"limited moves\" and a \"stepping stone\" approach.\nThey will take effect from 17:00 BST on Friday, 10 September.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan, of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), said: \"Today we made good progress and we met for nearly four hours in the executive and considered the current information around health, the economy, impacts on families and the community.\n\"We were able to reach decisions on a number of areas.\"\nHospitality Ulster said the moves were \"incremental changes\" and that it was time to provide indicative dates and a framework of action to move out of the remaining restrictions.\n\"A major strategic decision needs to be taken by the executive to bring forward a detailed and specific roadmap to address the problems that are gathering on the horizon - if not now, when?\" the organisation's Colin Neill said.\n\"Hospitality businesses are left hanging while restrictions continue to place a halt on viable trading. We need the best chance we can get to recover.\"\nHowever, Sinn F\u00e9in Junior Minister Declan Kearney said there was still a very high and dangerous infection level in Northern Ireland.\n\"So the executive I think has taken a very proportionate and measured and incremental approach towards the easements we have adopted today,\" he said.\n\"I don't think we can underestimate the extent of the challenge we still face - a lot of pressure on our health workers, there's still a very high impact on the health service, high levels of hospital admissions and bed occupancy.\"\nThe executive will meet again on Thursday as it keeps the issue of Covid-19 in schools under review.\nThe DUP has been pushing for the executive to agree a plan - complete with dates - to remove all restrictions. \nLast week's meeting was cancelled after Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill tested positive for Covid-19. \nThe legal requirement for social distancing outdoors no longer exists in Northern Ireland.\nHowever, indoor premises such as restaurants and workplaces are still required to comply with at least 1m (3ft).\nThat rule has already been removed in the rest of the UK, but guidance remains that people should socially distance where possible, and in places like hospitals and schools, the rules differ again.\nSome hospitality businesses in Northern Ireland have urged the executive to scrap the requirement for social distancing, saying it continues to affect their trade.\nNightclubs in Northern Ireland remain closed, and dancing is not permitted at indoor venues where music is played."

      "title": "Boris Johnson outlines new 1.25% health and social care tax to pay for reforms",
      "tags": "Tax,Boris Johnson,Social care",
      "text": "A new health and social care tax will be introduced across the UK to pay for reforms to the care sector and NHS funding in England.\nBoris Johnson said it would raise \u00a312bn a year, designed to tackle the health backlog caused by the Covid pandemic and to bolster social care.\nHe accepted the tax broke a manifesto pledge, but said the \"global pandemic was in no-one's manifesto\".\nHowever, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the plan was a \"sticking plaster\".\nLeaders in social care also warned the money was \"nowhere near enough\" and would not address current problems.\nThe tax will begin as a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance from April 2022, paid by both employers and workers, and will then become a separate tax on earned income from 2023 - calculated in the same way as National Insurance and appearing on an employee's payslip.\nThis will be paid by all working adults, including older workers, and the government says it will be \"legally ring-fenced\" to go only towards health and social care costs.\nIncome from share dividends - earned by those who own shares in companies - will also see a 1.25% tax rate increase.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies said the latest tax increases amounted to \u00a314bn. Together with those announced in the March Budget, it said, 2022 had seen the highest tax rises in 40 years.\nThe UK-wide tax will be focused on funding health and social care in England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive an additional \u00a32.2bn to spend on their services. \nThe SNP said the tax would \"unfairly penalise Scottish families - and leave the poorest in society subsidising the wealthy\".\nMPs will vote on the new proposals in the Commons on Wednesday. \nMr Johnson said the proceeds from the tax would lead to \u00a312bn a year being raised, with the majority going into catching up on the backlog in the NHS created by Covid - increasing hospital capacity and creating space for nine million more appointments, scans and operations.\nA portion of the money - \u00a35.4bn over the next three years - will also go towards changes to the social care system, with more promised after that.\nA cap will be introduced on care costs in England from October 2023 of \u00a386,000 over a person's lifetime.\nAll people with assets worth less than \u00a320,000 will then have their care fully covered by the state, and those who have between \u00a320,000 and \u00a3100,000 in assets will see their care costs subsidised.\nJune Clay, 92, from Hornchurch, had to go into a nursing home four years ago.\nAs a property owner, June had to \"self-fund\", so sold her house to afford fees which over four years have risen to nearly \u00a31,200 a week.\nHer capital is almost all gone. The local authority will help, but only up to \u00a3640 a week - while the cheapest homes locally charge \u00a3900.\nNow her children, in their 60s, are considering re-mortgaging their own homes and using their pension savings to pay for her care.\n\"I made a promise to my mum, that she would stay in that home... I'm worried sick about it,\" says daughter Sharon.\nBut she fears the reforms will be \"smoke and mirrors\" that will not meet the full costs of care.\nMr Johnson insisted that with the new tax, \"everyone will contribute according to their means\", adding: \"You can't fix the Covid backlogs without giving the NHS the money it needs.\n\"You can't fix the NHS without fixing social care. You can't fix social care without removing the fear of losing everything to pay for social care, and you can't fix health and social care without long-term reform.\"\nBut Labour's Sir Keir said the new tax broke the Conservatives' pledge at the last election not to raise National Insurance, income tax or VAT. \nHe also said the rise would target young people, supermarket workers and nurses, rather than those with the \"broadest shoulders\" who should pay more. \nThe Labour leader added: \"Read my lips - the Tories can never again claim to be the party of low tax.\"\nThe leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey - who is a carer himself - also said the tax was \"unfair\", and that the government's plan missed out solutions for staffing shortages, care for working age adults and unpaid family carers. \nMr Johnson said no Conservative government wanted to raise taxes - but he defended the move as \"the right, reasonable and fair approach\" in light of the pandemic, which saw the government spend upwards of \u00a3407bn on support. \nLater, during a press conference, the prime minister said he didn't want to raise taxes further but did not promise there would be no further rises before the next election - despite being asked repeatedly to rule it out. \nMeanwhile, the government has also announced it will suspend the so-called \"triple lock\" on pensions for one year following concerns that a big post-pandemic rise in average earnings would have led to pensions increasing by 8%.\nThe government is raising about \u00a312bn a year for three years with these tax rises. \nJust over \u00a32bn of that goes to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland under rules on how UK government spending is split. \nThat leaves \u00a310bn a year for health and social care in England. Most, but not all, of that has been earmarked against particular parts of health and social care. \nAbout \u00a36bn a year has been earmarked for the NHS. \nAnother nearly \u00a32bn a year will go to social care. \nA bit less than half of that will go towards the new funding model (helping people to pay for care) and a bit more than half going on delivering care - training for staff, support for councils and work on making the care and health services work better together. \nSome of the remainder will be spent on tax. The Department of Health and Social Care, and the NHS, are big employers and so a tax rise for employers will mean they have to pay more. \nBut there's still at least a \u00a31bn increase in the DHSC budget that goes into \"other\", with the government saying they'll announce further details in the coming weeks. \nAhead of the announcement, there was a backlash from number of Tory MPs, who said they were against a rise in National Insurance.\nBut questioning the PM after his statement in the Commons, many backbenchers instead sought reassurance that the money raised from the new tax would definitely go towards social care. \nFormer health secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's World At One that he thought the government had listened to concerns about only making changes to National Insurance, especially as it would \"disproportionately target younger people\" and not pensioners.\nHe said: \"This new tax is more broadly based and the 10% of pensioners who work will pay it as well.\"\nHowever, there was anger from the social care sector over the amount they had been promised as a result of the tax. \nChief executive of the UK Home Care Association, Dr Jane Townson, said: \"This is nowhere near enough. It will not address current issues and some measures may create new risks.\"\nChairman of the Independent Care Group, Mike Padgham, said it was a \"huge opportunity missed for radical, once-in-a-generation reform of the social care system\", adding it would not address the staffing crisis which was \"sending the sector into meltdown on a daily basis as care providers struggle to cover shifts\".\nAnd the general secretary of the Unison union, Christina McAnea, said: \"A detailed plan is needed first to mend and future-proof a sector broken by years of neglect. \n\"Only then will the cost of making good the damage become clear.\" \nThe sums are eye-watering, but they've still left health and care bosses disappointed.\nThe Covid pandemic has had a huge toll on the NHS, requiring an overhaul of how services are run and creating a growing backlog in care.\nEven with this money, it will take the health service years to catch up.\nPart of the reason for that is that despite the headline figure of \u00a336bn over three years, by the time the money is shared out across the four UK nations and social care takes a chunk, the frontline of the NHS in England is left with little more than half the \u00a310bn a year health bosses were asking for.\nCouncils are perhaps even more disappointed. \nThe case for social care predates the pandemic. Governments have been dodging it since the late 1990s so the fact that changes are on the way is being welcomed.\nBut the cap only solves one part of the problem - protecting people's assets when they face catastrophic costs.\nYou will still need to be eligible for care to benefit from the cap. Access is rationed so only the most frail qualify - currently half of requests for help are turned down.\nCouncils say the money will do little to help them tackle this."

      "tags": "NI education,Contact tracing,Schools,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Northern Ireland Assembly is to be recalled to discuss the situation regarding Covid-19 in schools.\nThe speaker has decided that the recall, which follows a petition put forward by Sinn F\u00e9in, will take place on Thursday at 12:00 BST. \nSome principals have expressed concern that guidance on testing and tracing has caused a high number of pupils to miss classes.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan has suggested a quicker test could be used.\nEducation Minister Michelle McIlveen said proposals for dealing with Covid school absences were being finalised, and would be discussed with the education sector this week. \nShe said discussions had been ongoing between her department and the Department of Health. \nAssembly members were officially due to resume assembly business on Monday.\nThe recall, proposed by Pat Sheehan MLA, needed 30 signatures to pass.\nEducation Minister Michelle McIlveen needed to give \"clear guidance\" and put in place enough resources to support staff in keeping schools open, he said.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Givan, a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) colleague of the minister, said the executive may need to consider other options for Covid-19 testing and contact tracing in schools.\nIt comes after more than half of the pupils at Larne High School were absent on Monday because they were in close contact with a positive case.\nThe current guidance issued by the Public Health Agency (PHA) last month advised that close contacts of a positive case can avoid self-isolation if they had recently tested positive themselves and present no symptoms.\nOtherwise, if a pupil is a close contact and has no symptoms but has not had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the previous 90 days, they are advised to self-isolate until they have taken a test.\nMr Givan said this policy was supported by all the parties in the executive and should be followed, rather than children having to self-isolate for the previous requirement of 10 days.\nThe word that you hear a lot is \"unsustainable\". Principals are saying they can't go on like this. \nMichael Carville, who is head of Regent House, a secondary school in Newtownards with 1,400 pupils, said to me on Monday that he hasn't done any education since he got back to school at the start of term. It it has been all contact tracing.\nAnd a number of other heads [principals] are in the same position. \nWe are only just a week into term, and there is a recognition right across the board that it cannot go on like this. \nThe problem is, what do we do about it?\nAny major change in self-isolation rules would have to be approved by the executive.\nIt is hard to know if that would be palatable to the executive, or what other changes could be made without executive approval.  \nMr Givan conceded it was \"becoming difficult\" to find available slots for PCR tests and questioned if the education system should \"go back to a system of lateral flow testing\", which are not as accurate but provide quick results.\nHe told BBC News NI that such tests were considered sufficient for access to venues such as sporting events and could be \"carried out at home by parents\".\n\"Every option needs to now be considered because if the system within the Public Health Agency cannot support principals to implement a policy which was to prevent children being put out for 10 days and to have a turnaround of 24 hours, then we need to be considering other options,\" he said.\nBut St John the Baptist Primary School principal Chris Donnelly said lateral flow testing did not give the same security.\nTwo classes at the Finaghy school were sent home because of positive cases last week, he said. \nOver the weekend he asked parents to provide documentary proof of negative PCR tests. \nThe same documentary proof would not be available with a lateral flow test, he said. \nHe said he also had to stop two children from coming into school because they had not been tested.\n\"There's a trade-off in society at the moment. We know that opening the schools can only do one thing. It's only going to lead in an increase in the number of cases,\" he told BBC's Evening Extra programme. \n\"But we understand that society needs to function. If we're going to have that system in place then we need to trust that the system is robust.\n\"I do not think relying on lateral flow tests is robust, I don't think that it would provide the reassurance that parents, that staff members and school leaders need.\"\nBrain Guthrie, head teacher of Ebrington Primary School in Londonderry, said the first positive cases since the school year started were identified at the end of last week.\nHe told BBC Radio Foyle some of the messages coming from the PHA have been mixed.\n\"If a child tests positive here at Ebrington, having reported cases before I am feeling confident enough myself to get information out to parents. We have our letter ready to go, we adjust the date appropriately,\" he said.\n\"I then make the phone call through to PHA and make them aware of that. The only thing is, is the pressure of time, the amount of added administration that is putting on principals.\"\nLori Campbell, who is a mum of four and also works as a childminder in Londonderry, was instructed to take one her children home when she arrived at the school gates on Monday.\n\"Her class was involved in a close-contact situation and they needed us to return home and organise a PCR test,\" Mrs Campbell told BBC Radio Foyle.\n\"It left me in a situation where I was meant to be working, I had another child on board who was then at risk and my husband was at work.\"\nShe said her daughter's Covid-19 test results came back negative.\n\"If her test had came up positive, I would have to close my business and that would be me closed until her PCR test came back clear,\" she said.\n\"That's not a great position to be in and not a great position to then land other parents in who have to come and pick up their child.\"\nMrs Campbell has called for the current testing and tracing protocols in schools to be changed.\nBBC News NI asked the Department of Education and Education Authority (EA) for figures for the number of pupils absent from class, but they directed us to the PHA.\nThe PHA directed us to a Covid-19 bulletin, which has not been updated since August 29.\nStormont education committee chair Chris Lyttle said he had requested that both the PHA and chief medical officer attend Wednesday's education committee meeting. \n\"We need greater clarity on what the evidence is behind the system we have in place, and whether the system is operating as it is supposed to,\" said the Alliance assembly member.\nSDLP education spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said the lack of planning by the Department of Education had \"plunged schools into crisis\".\n\"I have been inundated by school principals complaining about the current guidance, it's not fit for purpose and resulted in them and their staff spending countless hours focused on contact tracing and other Covid-related issues instead of education,\" he said.\nFollowing the absence levels at Larne High School, the PHA set up a mobile testing facility at Larne Leisure Centre.\nThe real business on Thursday may not happen within the assembly chamber but at the executive meeting which is also due to take place.\nThe education and health ministers have been tasked by the executive to go off and listen to what's been said by teachers on the ground, to speak to public health officials and the chief medical officer.\nThey will come back to the executive on Thursday with some proposals as to how they may be able to tackle this current crisis.\nIt was anticipated there was going to be difficulties but ministers have now found themselves in the position where they are going to have to look again at this problem.\nPerhaps the scale of the problem that was coming down the track was underestimated.\nBehind the scenes, there is probably a lot of scrambling going on.\nOn Sunday, the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said some schools had decided not to follow the PHA guidance because they feared it could lead to greater infection rates.\nThe union said some principals would like pupils to have longer self-isolation periods to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to their classmates.\nThe first minister said he wanted the Department of Health to provide an update on the situation at Thursday's executive meeting.\nUp to 12,000 pupils are out of school in the Republic of Ireland, RT\u00c9 has reported.\nAbout 1,300 schools are reporting cases but the \"vast majority\" are traced to community transmission and not picked up in school, according to the Health Service Executive.\nIrish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said \"we are seeing a large number of students having to self-isolate because they have been deemed to be close contacts and they of course will get tested\"."

      "text": "The NHS in England will get an extra \u00a35.4bn over the next six months to respond to Covid-19 and tackle the backlog caused by the pandemic, the government has announced.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the money would go \"straight to the front line\" and provide treatments people were not getting quickly enough.\nMore than 5 million people are waiting for NHS hospital treatment in England.\nThe rest of the UK will get an extra \u00a31bn in total, ministers said.\nThe \u00a35.4bn, which is for England only,  is broken down into:\nThe prime minister said: \"The NHS was there for us during the pandemic but treating Covid patients has created huge backlogs.\"\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said the way the health service dealt with \"one of the biggest challenges in its history\" had been \"phenomenal\". \nHe said the extra \u00a35.4bn in England was critical to ensure the health service had what it needed to manage the ongoing pandemic and help tackle waiting lists.\nBut he warned waiting lists would get worse before they got better as people came forward for help, adding: \"I want to reassure you the NHS is open, and we are doing what we can to support the NHS to deliver routine operations and treatment to patients across the country.\"\nThe NHS is under sustained pressure as it grapples with a huge backlog of procedures put on hold due to Covid, with hundreds of thousands of people waiting more than a year.\nStaff shortages combined with infection-control measures that mean hospitals have fewer beds at their disposal have led to calls for a long-term funding settlement. \nLast month, Mr Javid predicted \"a huge increase in demand\" with patients who had stayed away during lockdown returning to the health service for overdue treatment. \nIn a report in August, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated up to 14 million people could be on waiting lists in England by next autumn. \nThe cash boost once again illustrates just what impact Covid has had. The NHS has already had close to an extra \u00a310bn this year on top of the \u00a3136bn it was due to get.\nMinisters hope this will help the NHS get through what promises to be a difficult winter. \nNot only are hospitals having to cope with Covid, there are signs that the normal winter viruses will return with a bang. \nLast winter there was very little flu, while other viruses such as RSV, which hospitalises thousands of young children every year, were kept largely at bay by lockdowns and social distancing.\nThe result is that people's immunity to these viruses will have waned - or for the very young not had a chance to develop at all.\nThere is also the need to tackle the growing backlog in non-emergency care, such as knee and hip operations. The waiting list is already at record levels and the NHS still has not been able to get back to pre-pandemic levels of treatment.\nIt is why the extra money is being welcomed but some in the NHS are still wondering whether it will be enough.\nNHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the money provided welcome certainty for the NHS, which had \"pulled out all the stops\" to restore services, while caring for thousands of seriously ill Covid patients requiring hospital treatment during the toughest summer on record.\n\"This additional investment will enable the NHS to deliver more checks, scans and procedures as well as helping to deal with the ongoing costs and pressures of the pandemic as the NHS heads in to winter,\" she said."

      "text": "Record numbers of 18-year-olds in the UK have accepted university places this year, according to updated figures from the Ucas admissions service.\nThere will be 272,500 of this age cohort starting at UK universities - up by 7% on last year.\nBut a sharp fall in EU students coming to the UK means overall university numbers are slightly down this year.\nUcas head Clare Marchant said students had worked hard for places despite \"incredibly trying circumstances\".\nThese latest figures show rising numbers of UK students of all ages getting university places, up to 448,000, along with more overseas students coming to the UK from countries such as China and Nigeria.\nThe \"resilience\" of rising demand for university places has confounded earlier warnings about the impact of Covid, says the admission service's head of data, Richard O'Kelly.\nDespite the switch to online learning, lack of access to social activities, Covid outbreaks and complaints about value for money, more UK students have accepted places than before the pandemic.\nBut the overall figure of almost 508,000 new students is slightly down on this point last year, after a 56% fall in students from EU countries such as France, Germany and Italy.\nIt means there will be more students from Peru than Denmark, more from Kuwait than the Netherlands - and more from China than all the EU countries combined.\nApplications are still open for this year's courses, but the trends show record numbers of UK school-leavers heading to university.\nAlmost 38% of 18-year-olds have so far decided to go to university, the highest ever proportion. Although entry numbers for those aged 19 and over are slightly down on last year.\nNick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said the continuing rise in UK student numbers showed \"young people are voting with their feet and behaving entirely rationally\". \n\"They are not snowflakes who melt under heat. They are rational, ambitious and full of aspiration.\"\nMr Hillman said university was still an ambition for families and that \"when the labour market is in flux and the world is in crisis, getting more education is a very sensible response\".\nOn the fall in EU student numbers, he said it reflected the higher fees they would be charged after the UK left the EU.\nThe update on university admissions, a month after exam results, shows a relatively high number of applicants still to decide on whether to take a place - with the suggestion they might have narrowly missed out on a preference and are considering whether to reapply next year.\nFigures for England show the regional divide is getting wider, with increasing numbers of students coming from London, the South and the Midlands, while numbers have fallen in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.\nCompared with 2012, the number of students from London has risen by 26%, while in the North East, numbers have slightly fallen.\nClare Marchant said she expected numbers of acceptances to continue increasing over the next few weeks.\n\"We know that some students, particularly mature applicants looking to study at their local university or college, often make a late decision through clearing, so we expect numbers to rise before the end of the cycle,\" she said.\nA spokesman for the Russell Group said its universities \"made more offers this year to UK 18-year-olds, including those from the most deprived areas, reflecting their determination to be fair and flexible so students were not disadvantaged by this year's changes to the assessment system\". \nA Universities UK spokeswoman said: \"It's brilliant to see record numbers of students recognising the benefits of a university degree.\n\"Embarking on a degree is a uniquely exciting time, with the skills and experience students set to gain lasting a lifetime, giving them an edge in the employment market and generating significant benefits for the UK as we rebuild from the pandemic.\""

      "text": "Netflix will continue to provide age ratings on all its content following a successful trial in collaboration with the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC).\nThe streaming service and the regulator jointly announced they would continue to have a long-term partnership.\nLast November, Netflix became the first UK streaming service to carry a BBFC age rating on 100% of its content.\nRatings on the platform are decided based on an algorithm.\nThe trial period saw Netflix staff manually tag things like violence, sex scenes and swearing in its films and TV shows.\nThat data was then fed into the algorithm using technology developed in collaboration with the BBFC to determine an appropriate age rating.\nNetflix applies BBFC standards to content, which the regulator sets based on its existing classification guidelines. The BBFC audits the content each month to ensure that the streamer is maintaining high levels of accuracy.\nThe BBFC, which has traditionally set ratings such as PG, 12 and 18 itself, encouraged other streaming services to follow Netflix's lead.\nThe long-term collaboration comes after the government announced a review into whether or not to strengthen the rules on age ratings for streaming services to bring them into line with traditional broadcasters.\nNetworks including the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 have to comply with regulator Ofcom's code covering issues like harm, offence, accuracy and impartiality. But most streaming platforms do not.\nStreaming services like Amazon Prime, Now and Disney+ could face tighter regulation in the UK in the future, the government said in June.\nCulture minister Caroline Dinenage welcomed the continued collaboration of Netflix and the BBFC, adding the government wanted parents and young people \"to be able to make informed choices about what content is appropriate for them to watch\". \n\"The BBFC's age ratings are well trusted and widely recognised, which is why I am pleased that this long-term agreement will see their ratings continue to be used across Netflix's content for years to come,\" she said.\nThe BBFC said a large majority of British viewers welcomed age ratings to help them choose appropriate content for themselves and their families.\nNetflix said it applied BBFC standards to films and television shows, which the regulator has set based on large-scale public opinion research and auditing ratings to ensure consistency. \nAll films and TV series on the platform now carry a BBFC age rating, along with a line of ratings information, to indicate to viewers that the content adheres to the existing BBFC standards.\nDavid Austin, chief executive of the BBFC, said: \"Parents have been very clear that they want and expect online content to carry the same age rating it would carry offline, in the cinema or on DVD.  \n\"Crucially for child protection, BBFC ratings guarantee that age classifications reflect UK parental and child expectations on issues such as sexual violence and drugs use.\"\nJessica Stansfield, director of ratings at Netflix, said the company's members were their \"number one priority\", adding: \"We are proud to be the first and only streaming service to voluntarily carry BBFC age ratings on 100% of our catalogue.\"\nThe announcement comes amid an ongoing debate about differences in regulation between existing broadcasters and newer streaming services.\nCurrently, the broadcasting regulator Ofcom's website contains a statement explaining that \"Netflix is based in the Netherlands and therefore not within Ofcom's jurisdiction\".\nDespite that, Netflix announced in 2019 it would collaborate with the BBFC to assign accurate age ratings on the platform."

      "text": "Alice Thompson wanted to work shorter hours to pick her daughter up from nursery, but ended up resigning.\nThe former estate agent spent tens of thousands of pounds pursuing the case against her former employer.\nShe was awarded \u00a3185,000 by an employment tribunal and this week told the BBC it was \"a long, exhausting journey\".\nThe tribunal ruled she had suffered indirect sex discrimination when the firm refused to consider her request.\nMs Thompson was a successful sales manager at a small independent estate agents in central London before she became pregnant in 2018.\n\"I'd put my heart and soul into an estate agency career for more than a decade,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour.\n\"That's no mean feat, it's quite a male dominated environment to work in. And I'd worked really hard to build relationships with clients.\"\nWhen she wanted to return to work after maternity leave, she asked her employer if she could work shorter hours, a four day week, and leave at 5pm, rather than the normal end-of-day at 6pm, to pick her daughter up from nursery.\nHer manager said they couldn't afford for her to work part time.\n\"I made a request for flexible working that wasn't seriously considered,\" Ms Thompson says.\n\"I proposed what would have worked for me. If that didn't work for the company, I would have been more than happy to hear a counter offer, what might work for them.\n\"If they needed me for the full hours, maybe eight 'til five instead of nine 'til six, that's something I could have worked around. \n\"But it was shut down, every avenue, not listened to, not considered. And I was left with no other option but to resign.\n\"How are mums meant to have careers and families? It's 2021 not 1971.\"\nShe said she was motivated to pursue the legal challenge in order to prompt change.\n\"I've got a daughter and I didn't want her to experience the same treatment in 20, 30 years' time, when she's in the workplace.\"\nShe said her effort was worth it to \"stand up for what is right\".\nThe tribunal found that the firm's failure to consider more flexible working put Ms Thompson at a disadvantage, and upheld her claim. The judge awarded her almost \u00a3185,000 for loss of earnings, loss of pension contributions, injury to feelings and interest.\n\"Losing a job unexpectedly is always a cause of unhappiness, shock, and sometimes anger, as shown by the way many employees react to redundancy, even when there has been proper consultation, and even when it is never suggested their performance was not good enough,\" the tribunal found.\n\"Here the claimant resented that flexible working appeared not to be considered properly - as in our finding it was not - and felt that this was an injustice because of her sex, which it was.\"\nRead more here from\nHowever several other claims Ms Thompson made regarding her treatment, including discrimination because of pregnancy and maternity, and harassment, were denied by the tribunal.\nThe tribunal found that the director of the Manors estate agency, Paul Sellar, had moved a staff trip to New York from November to August so Ms Thompson could fly in when pregnant, and there were checks to see when the latest was that she could fly.\nWhen there, she did not join the other six for a boat trip.\n\"She did go shopping and then back to the hotel. In our finding she was upset that the others had had a good time drinking and were late back. She may have felt excluded, but it was not because of any action on the part of the respondent,\" the judges said.\nOn the return journey from New York, Mr Sellar commented that Ms Thompson did not seem to have enjoyed the trip, and she replied that she had felt isolated and became tearful.\nA few days later he suggested she should not have gone to New York.\n\"We can understand that Mr Sellar may have found her response ungrateful when the group trip had cost him \u00a325,000,\" the judges said.\nWhile she was determined to pursue the legal action she told Woman's Hour it was challenging.\n\"It's a very emotional process once you've had a child. You have a new identity as a mum, you're trying to figure things out on that field, and then you're going back to work as well,\" said Ms Thompson.\nBut she said workplaces that didn't support returning mothers risked \"missing out on some fantastic women, who have been really successful, because they are short-sighted and don't want to be flexible\".\nShe said many women had reached out to her in the wake of the ruling, many of whom had similar experiences but didn't have the mental or financial capacity to pursue a claim. \n\"It did come at a huge financial cost... and obviously there's the risk you might not get that money back if you lose, but there's a greater picture to trying to make some small change in the world for the better.\"\nThe BBC approached Manors for comment.\nHave you been affected by issues covered in this story?

      "text": "Mexico's Supreme Court has ruled that criminal penalties for terminating pregnancies are unconstitutional. \nThe ruling, for the northern state of Coahuila, prevents women from being prosecuted for getting an abortion.\nAbortion is currently severely restricted in all but four of the country's states.\nSupreme Court Justice Luis Maria Aguilar described the move as a \"historic step for the rights of women\". \nOn Tuesday, the court ordered the state of Coahuila to remove sanctions for abortion from its criminal code. \nThe decision could pave the way for the decriminalisation of abortions across the country. \nCurrently, abortion is only legal in a handful of states, except in cases of rape or where the mother's life is in danger. \nA judicial source said the ruling will affect the whole of Mexico, allowing women in states where abortion is criminalised to undergo the procedure with a judge's order. \nThe Information Group on Reproductive Choice (GIRE), which campaigns for abortion rights, described the decision as \"historic\".\n\"We hope that throughout the country women and people with the ability to carry a child have the conditions and freedom to determine their reproductive destiny,\" it said.\nCoahuila borders the US state of Texas, where the Supreme Court allowed a state law banning all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. \nThe ruling could open up avenues for people from Texas seeking legal abortions.\nThe decision to decriminalise abortion in what is Latin America's second largest Catholic nation might appear surprising. \nHowever, the debate in Mexico has been gradually moving towards removing the illegality for some time. \nHigh profile protests by feminist and women's rights campaigners have underlined the need for greater reproductive rights in Mexico. \nSpecifically, the Supreme Court was asked to rule on a law in the northern state of Coahuila which punishes women who have illegal abortions with jail terms of up to three years. \nThe 11 Supreme Court judges unanimously voted to decriminalise abortion in that state, and under Mexican law, it will now apply to all the other states in the country.\nIt is likely to take some time to be applied across the nation, but in effect the decision provides each state with a roadmap towards new legislation. \nFurthermore, it should mean that women who were jailed for having abortions will be immediately released. \nThe decision is likely to anger more conservative politicians in Mexico and the Catholic Church. However, the church's influence has been waning in recent years and the government considers itself staunchly secular. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "text": "A group of K-pop fans in China have become the latest victims of a crackdown on celebrity culture.\nTwenty-two fan accounts have been suspended by Chinese social media site Sina Weibo for what it called \"irrational star-chasing behaviour\".\nThey include fans of Korean pop band BTS who crowdfunded on the platform to customise an aeroplane for singer Park Ji-Min's 26th birthday.\nWeibo accused one fan account of \"illegal fundraising\" for the stunt.\nIn a statement, the company said it \"firmly opposes such irrational star-chasing behaviour and will deal with it seriously\".\nIt also pledged to \"purify\" online discussions and \"regulate community order\" on its platform.\nThe BTS account was suspended from posting for 60 days. Other accounts supporting K-pop acts Blackpink, GOT7 and EXO - who have Chinese members - were given 30-day bans.\nThe move comes amid a wider clampdown on the entertainment industry in China, and fan culture in particular.\nLast week, two government agencies published guidelines saying they would ban broadcasts by \"vulgar internet celebrities\" and \"feminine-looking men\" because they do not portray the values the country wants to promote. \nIn June, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) also announced 10 measures to \"clean up\" what it called the \"chaos\" of celebrity fan clubs.\nIt said it would prohibit activities that persuade children to contribute money to their idols, and disband social media groups that are deemed a \"bad influence\". Attempts to rank celebrities based on popularity will also be banned.\nEarlier this year, media analyst Kerry Allen told the BBC that Beijing was increasingly concerned that \"fan clubs can mobilise, either in person or online, to stage protests for their favourite stars\".\nK-pop fans are known for their ability to organise impressive stunts - frequently raising thousands of dollars to promote their idols on billboards in New York's Times Square, for example.\nBut they have also turned to political activism, using the sheer weight of their numbers to overload social media hashtags used by opponents of the Black Lives Matter movement last summer, and disrupting one of Donald Trump's campaign rallies by reserving tickets they had no intention of using.\nChina's Communist Party has encouraged the growth of its entertainment industry in recent years, but is worried about the influence of celebrities on the country's values.\nStars - and now, it seems, their fan clubs - increasingly face stringent censorship, and serious consequences if they fall foul of the authorities.\nEarlier this month, one of China's most prominent actresses, Zhao Wei, was all-but deleted from China's internet, with her films and TV shows taken off streaming platforms and her fan page deleted from Weibo.\nSocial media users were also censored when trying to discuss Zhao, who starred in films like My Fair Princess and Shaolin Soccer and served on the jury at the 2016 Venice Film Festival.\nChinese state newspaper The Global Times said no official reason had been given, but referenced historical allegations of financial impropriety against Zhao and her husband.\nWeeks earlier, a similar fate befell one of Zhao's former colleagues - the actor Zhang Zhehan - who was scrubbed from the internet after pictures surfaced of him at Japan's controversial Yasukuni Shrine to war dead.\nActress Zheng Shuang also found herself castigated at the start of September after being fined $46m for tax evasion.\nA household name who starred in the TV series Meteor Shower, she posted a lengthy statement on social media apologising for the \"negative impact\" of her actions on society.\nNonetheless, China's broadcasting authority banned TV stations from airing Zheng's shows or hiring her for future productions.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

How can we make a difference when it seems like everything has a bad impact on the climate?\nRadio 1 Newsbeat has been chatting to sustainable bloggers for tips on easy changes we can make to help reduce our impact.\nThe first is not to beat yourself up if you forget your bag for life or your reusable cup - it will probably just add to your eco-anxiety.\n\"I never had the notion that I had to be perfect,\" says Shia Su from zero-waste blog Wasteland Rebel.\n\"I had no intention of going zero-waste. I read about it and I just thought it was cuckoo and unrealistic,\" she says.\nBut one day she decided to take a jar to her local coffee shop instead of asking for a takeaway one - and she grew greener from there. \nSo how did Shia get to the point where she now says she can fit her entire year's waste into a litre-sized jar?\nHer second tip - shared by most of the bloggers we spoke to - is about turning your good intentions into good habits.\nDo whatever you can, and after a while it will become a habit,\" she says.\n\"Normally, when you leave the house you grab your phone, you grab your wallet, you grab your keys. \n\"After a while you'll grab your bottle, your food container and then you're good to go - it will become a habit.\"\nAnd the third tip that all our bloggers share is probably the one which involves the biggest change.\nIt's about living a minimal lifestyle - cutting out needless buys.\n\"Living a sustainable lifestyle is about consuming less in general,\" Shia says. \"I only buy a new piece of clothing if another one needs replacing.\"\nShia says it's not as hard as it sounds: \"A lot of things have already been done - we're just going back to them.\n\"Ask your grandparents, they can teach you a lot about how to not create trash. \n\"It's a really nice bonding experience as well. I think it makes them smile when I get out my hanky to blow my nose [instead of a disposable tissue].\"\nWe got other eco-bloggers and Instagrammers to give us their top tips on different areas of life.\nTolmeia Gregory blogs about ethical fashion under the name TollyDollyPosh.\nGo vintage: \"Do things like shopping second-hand and vintage, going to your local charity shop. You can also buy on sites like eBay and Depop.\"\nBuy less: \"If you can, just not shopping at all is a really great way to do it. Embracing what you already own and what's already in your wardrobe. There's a great phrase you hear a lot: 'Loved clothes last'\".\nLook for eco-friendly materials: \"Look out for more natural fibres - go for cotton over polyester. Not only do they feel a lot nicer when you wear them, but don't contain things like microfibres that go into our water and into marine life when we wash our clothes.\"\nLearn to DIY: \"It doesn't take much to learn how to hand-sew and stitch up a hole. Or if you have a pair of ripped jeans that are becoming a bit too ripped, you could always cut them and keep them as shorts.\"\nImmy Lucas is a blogger and YouTuber who goes under the name Sustainably Vegan.\nConsider a more plant-based diet: \"I don't think everyone has to go vegan to make a huge change. The more realistic thing is for the majority of people cutting down meat consumption to a couple of days a week.\"\nEat as locally as possible: \"If you're eating soy beans that are shipped from China or bananas that have been shipped from Colombia, that's not as sustainable as if you're eating apples grown in Kent. If you support your local farmers' market, you're also supporting more low-scale food agriculture which tends to be more kind to the Earth.\"\nEat as seasonally as possible: \"If you're eating tomatoes from the UK that aren't in season, then you know they've been grown in some huge greenhouse that uses a massive amount of resources to basically fake the weather. So you're using a massive amount of heat energy to grow the tomatoes out of season.\"\nThink about packaging: \"There are zero-waste shops where you buy unpackaged food. But you can also go to the supermarket, and make better choices by buying unpackaged fruit and vegetables, or opting for cans and cardboard that are widely recycled instead of plastic. So there are better choices that you can make in regular shops.\"\nNicole Whittle - AKA VeganBeautyGirl - blogs about living a vegan life.\nDitch the face wipes: \"Just use a good old flannel like your nan's got in her bathroom, and a nice oil-based cleanser to help break down make-up at the end of the day. If you've got a baby and you need that on-the-go reliability, then you can find biodegradable wipes.\"\nBuy package-free: \"You can get shampoo, conditioner and body wash bars - they might cost a bit more but they last much longer. So the cost-per-use is a lot lower.\"\nThink about your menstrual products: \"Tampons and pads are single-use items, and not everyone disposes of them properly. The big change you can make is going to a menstrual cup, which is a silicone cup that catches all the blood and can be reused each month - they're not as scary as they sound. There's also menstrual underwear these days which is a lot more sustainable.\"\nBig brands can also be eco-friendly: \"A lot of the big beauty brands are really taking inspiration from the vegan environmental movement. It's great to see these changes happening. It's taken them a while but these brands have seen that there's future in these sorts of products.\"\nFlorine Hofmann runs The Wasted Blog, where she tries to find eco-friendly alternatives to everyday habits.\nThink about your journey: \"We're so fortunate here in Europe - I usually try to take the train whenever I can. I'm conscious of trying to fly as little as possible.\"\nPack sustainably: \"I recently bought a second-hand suitcase because it was already something that was made, and it was cheaper. I try to pack as minimally as possible - for instance my toiletries I try to reduce to soap and a shampoo bar, stainless steel razor and toothbrush. I don't want that much plastic trash in another country. I try to leave as little behind as possible.\"\nPlan where you eat: \"I usually do some research beforehand. I'm a massive foodie, so it's very important in my everyday life. But also because I want to support restaurants for instance that do think about their waste or whether they compost or not.\"\nLocal knowledge is best: \"I love renting a bike in a new city and just exploring new areas. You find the best spots through talking to people and getting all the hidden gems.\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

      "text": "Discarded face masks could be melted down and recycled to help tackle plastic pollution.\nIt is estimated 129 billion single-use face masks are used monthly around the world, with 55 million a day in the UK.\nThe Welsh government has set a target on creating no waste in Wales by 2050 and a recycling expert wants the NHS to set an example by recycling PPE.\nOne Welsh firm is now working to turn hospital waste into new masks with 65% recycled materials.\nOld PPE like face masks, which people in the UK go through about 19 billion every year, is currently incinerated - producing climate-warming carbon emissions - or sent to landfills.\nMat Rapson, managing director of Cardiff-based Thermal Compaction Group - or TCG, said was a \"huge problem\".\n\"We use 55 million masks a day in the UK and globally the figure is 129 billion masks, a lot of which is being discarded into landfills,\" he said.\nTCG is already working with seven hospital trusts across the UK, which are using thermal heating devices to melt down PPE.\nThe firm heats single-use masks, gowns and curtains to 300C, sterilising all pathogens, and is recycling 300,000 defective masks each month, which would have otherwise been incinerated or sent to landfill.\nIt turns them into 1m-long blocks that are 99.6% polypropylene - made up of about 10,000 masks - which can be used to make products such as plastic chairs, buckets and toolboxes. \n\"If a mask goes into landfill, or worse beaches or rivers, it takes 450 years to decompose,\" Mr Rapson said.\n\"It's ridiculous. We're just discarding these single-use disposable items, but they're not single-use, they can be recovered and remade multiple times.\n\"The ideal is that all hospital PPE waste gets recovered and made back into masks for hospitals.\"\nLinda Ball, chief executive of Upcycled Plastics, said the firm was making masks using plastic waste recovered from the sea.\nShe said the manufacturing process resulted in a 36% reduction in carbon emissions, and she believed the NHS, the UK's largest user of disposable PPE, could cut its impact significantly by switching to recycled PPE.\nShe said: \"The biggest problem that we have in the medical industry is single-use plastic.\n\"If we keep buying stuff from China and bringing it over here, the amount of carbon usage is insane.\"\nShe said recycling masks, however, was a challenge as the ear hoops, the filter and the nose piece are often made from different types of plastic.\nDr Rob Elias, director of the Biocomposites Centre at Bangor University, said all PPE should be made in a way that it can be easily recycled, with one type of material making it \"a heck of a lot easier to recycle in the future.\"\nHe said polypropylene in a mask can be recycled \"five to six times\" before it breaks down, but the challenge is \"these recycling processes tend to be quite small at the moment, so they lack the scale\".\n\"When you scale up the production process, you get massive energy savings.\"\nBut Dr Elias said it was a \"great example\" of the circular economy, where single-use products like disposable masks are put back into the economy for reuse instead of being thrown away. \nThat is one of the key goals of the Welsh government's Beyond Recycling strategy, which aims to have no waste produced in Wales by 2050.\nProf Gary Walpole, director of the Circular Economy Innovation Community Project at Swansea University, said recycling was something we should be doing an \"awful lot more of\" and public sector bodies such as the NHS could set an example by recycling PPE.\n\"The basic premise of circular economy is to keep all products within the circular loop as long as possible,\" he said.\n\"There's a lot of energy that goes into creating products like plastic, so the longer you can keep that plastic in use, by reusing it, the less energy use, the less raw material use, and therefore the less carbon you emit.\"\nBut Prof Walpole said getting the private sector to adopt this approach on a wider scale was difficult. \nHe said one possible way forward would be to have the Welsh government mandate large organisations, such as the NHS and local authorities, into making the change.\n\"The public services buy a lot of goods and services, so it's a good place to start a different way of thinking,\" he said. \n\"This particular company is taking plastic products from the NHS where there are high volumes so they are able to leverage economies of scale, prove the concept, and then offer it out into the private sector.\"\nIt was also one solution to an increase in litter during the pandemic, including face masks and disposable gloves, according to Keep Wales Tidy.\nThe campaign group said there has been a \"significant and widespread increase in personal protective equipment being littered all over the country\", posing a danger to wildlife and public health. \nMr Rapson said: \"Plastic's not the problem, it's the infrastructure and we have one of the solutions here in Wales.\n\"Plastic is not disposable, it's not single use, we can actually embrace plastic and use it multiple times.\"\nThe Welsh government said: \"We are aware of the TCG Sterimelt proposals and welcome innovation from industry to tackle the challenges of single-use plastics in healthcare settings as we move towards a circular economy by 2050.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nLong-term funding arrangements to help the NHS respond to the Covid pandemic are expected to be tied up with proposals for social care reform, when Boris Johnson sets out his plans to MPs later. That's in addition to an extra \u00a35.4bn the prime minister has allocated over the next six months to tackle the health service backlog in England caused by the pandemic. The government is expected to cover the costs with a 1.25% rise in National Insurance - breaching an election promise in the process.\nNicola Sturgeon is to set out the Scottish government's plans for the year to come at Holyrood later, with the economic and social recovery from the pandemic likely to be among the first minister's priorities. The Scottish Conservatives have called for this to be the key focus, ahead of \"political goals\" such as independence.\nThere are signs that a predicted surge in unemployment may be smaller than expected when the furlough scheme closes at the end of this month. Figures published by the Insolvency Service show British employers planned 12,687 job cuts in August, a fall of 11% since July and the lowest figure for seven years. At the height of the pandemic, firms proposed more than 150,000 job cuts a month.\nOne of the many ways the pandemic has affected everyday life is the creation of a backlog of driving tests that has left thousands of would-be motorists frustrated and feeling like life is being held up. Katie McKerral was hoping to pass in January but must now wait until next year, meaning she can't go for the police job she wants and leaves her relying on others when she and her toddler daughter need to get around.\nAs of 17:00 BST on Friday in Northern Ireland, you'll once again be able to dance in celebration of a marriage and play pool or darts - or use a gaming machine - in pubs. The Stormont executive agreed to ease restrictions, including removing table service rules indoors and outdoors at hospitality settings and increasing the numbers allowed indoors at domestic settings from 10 to 15.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nGetting ready for uni?

All four have denied involvement.\nThe Malaysian Airlines flight was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on 17 July 2014 when it was downed. It crashed in the Donetsk region, about 50km (30 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. \nAll 298 people on board the Boeing 777 airliner were killed - including 283 passengers and 15 crew members. The victims were from 10 different countries, but most were Dutch nationals.\nDutch prosecutors have said the suspects had a role in bringing down the flight with a Russian ground-to-air missile over a combat zone in eastern Ukraine. Russia has denied responsibility.\nThe trial of the four suspects, Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinsky, Leonid Kharchenko and Oleg Pulatov, opened in the Netherlands last year after a case was brought by Dutch prosecutors following an international investigation.\nAll four are suspected of being pro-Russian separatists helping rebels fight Ukrainian government troops in eastern Ukraine. Only one suspect, Mr Pulatov, has employed a team of Dutch lawyers to represent him.\nOn Monday, judge Hendrik Steenhuis said the trial had been \"highly emotional for the relatives\", as he gave them the opportunity to testify in court for the first time.\nThe first relative to speak in court was Ria van der Steen, whose father and stepmother were among the victims.\nMs van der Steen told the court of a recurring nightmare in which she searched for her father in the blazing wreckage to tell him he was dead. \n\"It smelt of fire, it smelt of death,\" she said. \"I kept yelling, 'Dad, where are you now?'.\"\nShe said her father was identified by a tiny fragment of bone from his hand, as that was all that was left of his body.\nSecond to testify was Australian Vanessa Fizk, whose parents died in the crash.\nAppearing via video link from Australia, Ms Fizk said the perpetrators \"deserved punishment for their heinous actions\". \nHer brother James expressed similar sentiments, saying his parents were the victims of a conflict they had no role in.\n\"The misinformation from Russia, the lack of involvement from Russia, and their denials baffles me,\" he said.\nFamilies from eight nations, including the UK, will testify at the trial. A verdict is expected late next year."

(The first \u00a320,000 of someone's assets is protected under the proposals).\nHowever, someone with a \u00a3500,000 house would be left with \u00a3414,000 after reaching the cap - leaving them about 83% of the value.\nFurther changes to the cap were announced last week. \nThe government said:\nSo, if someone's care costs \u00a3860 a week and they are meeting the cost themselves, it would take 100 weeks to hit the cap.\nHowever, if the same person receives council help it would take longer than 100 weeks.\nThat means poorer people receiving means-tested help will make contributions from their own money for longer.\nSally Warren, director of policy at The King's Fund health charity said \"These changes will mean that the people who need the most protection from catastrophically high care costs - those with low to moderate levels of wealth - will get less protection than wealthier people.\" \nThe government, however, says it wants to ensure people get support but are not unfairly reaching the cap at an artificially faster rate than others. \nThe cap doesn't cover living costs, like rent, food and utility bills. The guidance says people will have to meet these costs \"including after they reach the cap\".\nThe government has confirmed living costs will be up to \u00a3200 a week.\nTen years ago, an independent review by Sir Andrew Dilnot proposed a lifetime cap of \u00a335,000 for social care costs - but this was not introduced.\nSir Andrew said the changes the government was now introducing were \"a significant step forward\".\nBut he said the move would not stop the less well-off facing \"catastrophic costs\"."

However it says some online learning will continue - partly to minimise disruption in the event of future Covid spikes.\nStudents should ask their institution about plans for their course. \nStudents are likely to be asked to wear a face covering in crowded areas such as libraries, and will be encouraged to take regular Covid tests. Staff will be asked to test twice a week. \nThe pandemic cost pupils nearly a third of their learning time between March 2020 and April 2021, according to research from the LSE and the University of Exeter.

      "text": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been hit by gravel thrown by protesters during a campaign stop.\nHe was returning to his bus after visiting a brewery when he was pelted by gravel. He was not injured. \nMr Trudeau called a snap election in mid-August, in the hope of gaining a majority government for his left-of-centre Liberal party.\nBut his campaign has been disrupted by demonstrations against Covid-19 vaccine mandates and other restrictions.\nJust over a week ago, the prime minister was forced to cancel an election rally after a crowd of angry protesters ambushed the event.\nSpeaking to journalists on his campaign plane after the incident in London, Ontario, Mr Trudeau said he may have been hit on the shoulder.\nAccording to a reporter with Canada's CTV National News, two people travelling on a media bus were also hit by the gravel, although they were not injured.\nOn Tuesday, the Liberal leader called the actions of the protestors \"absolutely unacceptable\". \n\"Nobody should be doing their jobs under the threats of violence or acts that put them in danger,\" he said during a Montreal campaign stop. \"But it's not just political rallies where this is happening.\" \nProvincial politicians, public health officials, restaurant owners and healthcare workers have faced harassment in incidents across the country in recent weeks.\nErin O'Toole, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, described the incident as \"disgusting\".\n\"Political violence is never justified and our media must be free from intimidation, harassment, and violence,\" he tweeted.\nMr Trudeau's plans for vaccine mandates have become a a key issue ahead of the 20 September election.\nIn Canada, all federal party leaders have championed Covid vaccines, though there are some policy differences. \nLast month, the government announced that all civil servants - including workers in federally regulated sectors, like rail - must be vaccinated by the end of October or risk losing their jobs.\nCommercial air, cruise and interprovincial train passengers must also be vaccinated to travel.\nThe Conservatives prefer incentives, like allowing for paid time-off for the jab, and requiring regular Covid testing for unvaccinated workers and Canadians travelling across the country. \nCanada has one of the highest Covid vaccination rates in the world.\nProtests dogging Canadian prime ministers is not a new phenomenon - and many prime ministers, including Mr Trudeau, have faced security threats. \nStill, journalists covering the Liberal campaign say the anti-vaccine protest mobs following Mr Trudeau are more chaotic and sustained than they've seen in the past. \nFor his part, the Liberal leader says he won't back down against what he calls a \"small fringe element\" of Canadian society. \nHe also brushed off the latest altercation, comparing it to an incident a few years ago where a woman hurled pumpkin seeds his way. \nOther politicians on the campaign trail have condemned the protesters' behaviour and, in some cases, have spoken out about the vitriol they have personally experienced both online and in-person. \nThe aggressive tactics of anti-vaccine activists in Canada directed at Prime Minister Trudeau are part of a global trend. \nA movement born on social media - muddled with extreme conspiracy theories worlds apart from political and medical debates - has become increasingly violent both on social media and out on the streets. \nLike Trudeau, medics, journalists and politicians in the UK and US have found themselves the targets of harassment from a minority who are part of these protest groups. Their activists believe - without evidence - that they are orchestrating sinister global plots involving the Covid-19 vaccines.\nDiscussion of trials for war crimes and executions have become commonplace in the channels used by these groups. Their members come predominantly from English-speaking countries.\nIn this case, gravel might seem relatively benign, but social media experts fear far worse attacks - as what's happening on social media spills out into the real world.

      "tags": "Afghanistan,Taliban,Mullah Muhammad Hassan Akhund",
      "text": "The Taliban have announced an interim government in Afghanistan, declaring the country an \"Islamic Emirate\". \nThe new cabinet, entirely male, is made up of senior Taliban figures some of whom are notorious for attacks on US forces over the last two decades.\nIt will be led by Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund, one of the movement's founders, who is on a UN blacklist.\nThe interior minister is the feared FBI-wanted leader of the Haqqani militant group, Sirajuddin Haqqani.\nThe Taliban seized control of most of Afghanistan more than three weeks ago, ousting the previous elected leadership.\nThe announcement of the acting cabinet is a key step in the formation of a permanent Taliban government. The new leadership will face significant challenges, not least stabilising the country's economy and gaining international recognition.\nThe Taliban have previously said they wanted to form an inclusive government. However, all of the cabinet ministers announced on Tuesday are already established Taliban leaders, and no women were included.\nA statement attributed to Taliban Supreme Leader Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada told the government to uphold Sharia.\nThe Taliban want \"strong and healthy relations with our neighbours and all other countries based on mutual respect and interaction\", said the statement, released in English - with the caveat that they would respect international laws and treaties \"that are not in conflict with Islamic law and the country's national values\".\nHibatullah Akhundzada has never made a public appearance. This is the first message appearing to come from him since the Taliban took control last month.\nHassan Akhund, the new interim prime minister, served as deputy foreign minister from 1996 to 2001, when the group was last in power. He is influential on the religious side of the movement, rather than the military side.\nHis appointment is seen as a compromise, after recent reports of in-fighting between the some relatively moderate Taliban figures and their hardline colleagues.\nSirajuddin Haqqani, the new acting interior minister, is head of the militant group known as the Haqqani network who are affiliated with the Taliban and have been behind some of the deadliest attacks in the country's two-decade-long war - including a truck bomb explosion in Kabul in 2017 that killed more than 150 people.\nUnlike the wider Taliban, the Haqqani network has been designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the US. It also maintains close ties to al-Qaeda.\nAccording to the FBI's profile on Haqqani, he is \"wanted for questioning in connection with the January 2008 attack on a hotel in Kabul... that killed six people, including an American citizen\".\nIt adds: \"He is believed to have coordinated and participated in cross-border attacks against United States and coalition forces in Afghanistan. Haqqani also allegedly was involved in the planning of the assassination attempt on [former] Afghan President Hamid Karzai in 2008.\"\nThe Haqqani network has also been blamed for an attack on the US embassy and nearby Nato bases in Kabul on 12 September 2011. Eight people - four police officers and four civilians - were killed in that attack.\nA movement which has long moved in the shadows, whose names would surface only on the world's terrorism watch lists, is now announcing titles used in governments the world over. \nActing prime minister Mullah Akhund appears as a compromise candidate after reported rivalries among leading military and political figures who will serve under him. \nIts caretaker nature also provides breathing space as the Taliban move from guns to government. \nIt also underlines the Taliban view that a Taliban victory can only mean Taliban rule. Sources say they pushed back against calls for an \"inclusive\" government. They balked at including former political figures and officials, who've had their turn at the top, and especially those tainted by corruption. \n\"Why should we let others pick our cabinet when other countries pick their own? \"was one retort. \nAs for women, there was never a chance they would be given a ministerial role; the Ministry of Women's Affairs seems to have been, for now, abolished altogether.  \nOther appointments to the new government include:\nREAD MORE: Who's who in the Taliban leadership\nAsked why no women were given posts, one senior Taliban figure told the BBC that the cabinet had not been finalised yet.\nThe government announcement came on the day Taliban fighters fired shots at a protest of hundreds of people, mainly women, in Kabul.\nFootage from the scene showed people running to safety, while heavy gunfire - warning shots fired by militants - was heard in the background.\nThe Taliban now claim full control of Afghanistan, saying they have defeated resistance fighters who were holding out against them in the Panjshir valley, north of Kabul.\nThe National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRF) said in a statement that it \"considers the announcement of the Taliban's caretaker cabinet illegal and a clear sign of the group's enmity with the Afghan people\"."

      "tags": "Internet privacy,Information Commissioner's Office,G7 summits,GDPR",
      "text": "The UK's information commissioner is to ask some of the most powerful countries in the world to join forces against cookie pop-ups online. \nElizabeth Denham will meet with her counterparts in the G7 (Group of Seven) nations on Tuesday. \nEach country will raise a technology problem they believe can be solved with closer co-operation, with Ms Denham taking aim at cookie banners.\n\"No single country can tackle this issue alone,\" Ms Denham said. \n\"That is why I am calling on my G7 colleagues to use our convening power. Together we can engage with technology firms and standards organisations to develop a co-ordinated approach to this challenge.\"  \nCookie pop-ups are widely disliked by internet users and businesses - who see them as an annoying obstacle - and by privacy advocates, who believe so-called \"dark patterns\" trick people into accepting privacy invasions, rather than read through pages of settings on every website. \n\"I often hear people say they are tired of having to engage with so many cookie pop-ups,\" Ms Denham said. \"That fatigue is leading to people giving more personal data than they would like.\" \nThe Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) - the UK's national data watchdog - said it would pitch a \"vision for the future\". \nIn it, web browsers or even device-wide settings will \"allow people to set lasting privacy preferences of their choosing, rather than having to do that through pop-ups every time they visit a website\". \nThat would \"ensure people's privacy preferences are respected\" while improving the experience, it said. \nThe ICO said it believes such an approach is \"already technologically possible and compliant with data protection law\". \nHowever, achieving it would require co-operation among different technology firms or standards organisations. \nThere is already a considerable amount of debate over the future of tracking cookies, with Apple limiting them by default in its software and Google pursuing a new standard that does not have the buy-in of other software makers. \nThe ICO said it believes that the combined weight of the G7 authorities \"could have a major impact\" in steering big tech firms to develop a solution. \nJim Killock, the executive director of Open Rights Group, said that even though the ICO's proposal was something he supported, \"most\" cookie banners were already breaking UK law.\n\"If the ICO wants to sort out cookie banners then it should follow its own conclusions and enforce the law,\" he said.\n\"We have waited for over two years now for the ICO to deal with this, and now they are asking the G7 to do their job for them. That is simply outrageous.\"\nMs Denham is now the outgoing commissioner. \nIn late August, the government announced plans to replace her with current New Zealand Privacy Commissioner John Edwards - while Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden fired an opening salvo in the war on cookie pop-ups.\nHe told the Telegraph that the new commissioner would \"shake up\" data rules, including promising to do something about cookies. \nMr Dowden suggested that \"high risk\" sites would still need similar notices, but that many of them are \"pointless\" - and said that such changes are a \"prize\" of leaving the EU. \nPrivacy expert Pat Walshe said: \"It increasingly seems to me that the ICO is captured by government.\"\n\"So called 'cookie pop ups'... are a manifestation of an underlying business model based on the intrusion and erosion of privacy online.  That underlying privacy eroding model and technology should be the focus.\"\n\"The ICO conducted a study on ad-tech - it's not made one bit of difference and has not enhanced privacy online at all,\" he said.\nThe UK is expected to adhere to similar privacy standards as the EU as part of an agreement over \"data adequacy\" - a complex area governing how private information is stored and shared across borders. \nBut the G7, as a collection of some of the world's wealthiest liberal democracies, has members both inside and outside the EU. \nMs Denham will be making her pitch to the privacy regulators in Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the United States, and Germany.  \nAny co-ordinated solution would probably take a long time to be rolled out, because new internet standards usually have a long formal process. \nUntil then, Ms Denham said she - as the regulator, \"expect[s] businesses to comply with current laws\".

People have probably just given up as it will take more time and effort that they have to give right now.\"\nAs a result of her vaccine status issue, Ms McGoldrick has postponed her October plans to travel to Copenhagen - partly for leisure, but also to do work experience related to her university course in international relations.\nShe said she thought she was doing the right thing by getting her vaccine as quickly as possible, but the bureaucracy and cancelled plans that resulted had been a \"bit of a blow\".\n\"It's the fact that we've been cooped up for so long,\" she said. \"I felt when I got two doses I had done everything I was supposed to do.\""

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Social care,NHS",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has vowed to end \"catastrophic costs\" for social care users in England ahead of setting out his long-awaited reform proposals.\nThe prime minister will announce the plans to MPs, alongside money to help the tackle pressures on the NHS caused by the Covid pandemic.\nHe is expected to breach election promises and raise National Insurance (NI) by about 1.25%.\nAnd the plan has prompted a backlash from some of his own Tory MPs.\nCabinet ministers signed off the proposals at a meeting in No 10 earlier, with the PM's official spokesman saying: \"There was strong agreement that this is a long-standing issue, particularly on the social care side, which had been ducked for too long and which needed to be addressed.\"\nMr Johnson will set out the detail in a statement to the Commons at around 12:30 BST and will join the chancellor and Health Secretary Sajid Javid for a press conference at 16:00. \nBut tweeting ahead of his appearance, he promised to set out how the government will \"support the NHS in the biggest catch-up programme in its history\" and announce \"a plan for social care to ensure that older people get the best possible care, without the fear or anxiety of catastrophic social care costs\".\nIt is widely accepted that major changes are needed to the social care system, which helps older and working-age people with high care needs to carry out day-to-day tasks, such as washing, dressing, eating and medication.\nLabour said it agreed with the need of reform, but criticised the proposed rise in NI, saying it would unfairly target young people and lower earners.\nA 1.25% increase to NI would mean someone on a \u00a330,000 salary would pay an additional \u00a3255 per year.\nBut the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg understands that after late night talks, ministers agreed pensioners in work would also have to pay the new \"health and social care levy\" - despite people being exempt from NI payments after reaching state pension age. \nShe also said the government might increase the amount of tax paid on income from share dividends to help cover the cost of the new plans. \nDo you have questions about this story? Get in touch: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist. You can also get in touch in the following ways:\nVaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the plans to \"deal with a broken social care system\" represented \"truly historic and ambitious reform\".\n\"One-in-seven people pay \u00a3100,000 or more for their social care, so in my view that nettle has to be grasped,\" he said. \nThe BBC also understands Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to suspend the so-called \"triple lock\" on pensions - designed so rises in state pensions were not overtaken by the rising cost of living.\nThe promise made by the Tories is that the state pension increases each year in line with the rising cost of living seen in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation, increasing average wages, or 2.5%, whichever is highest.\nOn Monday, an extra \u00a35.4bn over the next six months was announced to help the NHS in England tackle backlogs worsened by the pandemic.\nBut it is thought Tuesday's announcement will also allocate cash for the long-term, to increase hospital capacity in England to 110% of its current level.\nMr Johnson will tell MPs the NHS has been \"put under enormous strain by the pandemic\" and cannot be expected \"to recover alone\".\nHe is also expected to say the government will not \"duck the tough decisions needed\" to help the service and fix England's \"broken\" social care system, again with longer term funding.\nBut Laura Kuenssberg said the \"biggest unknown\" would be how much cash social care gets upfront, having been told support will be \"phased in\", while the NHS would be \"main beneficiary of the NI hike for the first three years\".\nJoyce Pinfield from the National Care Association said the sector was hoping there would be funding for the short and long term.\nShe told the BBC: \"We do need something immediately... because most care providers are at breaking point.\"\nThe government is expected to announce an increase in National Insurance, likely of 1.25 percentage points, to raise billions of pounds to pay for helping the NHS catch up with lost time and treatment after the pandemic, and to help improve and pay for social care in England.\nI'm told the cash raised - potentially more than \u00a312 billion - will be ring-fenced somehow, targeted initially at the health service itself then will switch to social care after three years.\nExpect also promises of changes to how the system works, including limiting the amount that families have to pay for care if need it.\nRead more from Laura\nReports the prime minister will raise NI, a tax paid by workers and employers, to cover costs for the plans has received a terse response from Conservatives. \nThe party made a manifesto commitment not to raise NI, income tax or VAT during the 2019 general election. \nOne cabinet minister has told the BBC a National Insurance hike was \"the wrong thing to do, and the wrong way to go about it\".\nTory former chancellors Lord Hammond, Lord Clarke and Lord Lamont have all criticised the plan, while former Tory PM Sir John Major has called it \"regressive\".\nMr Johnson announced after taking office in 2019 that he had a \"clear plan\" to fix the \"crisis\" facing the sector. \nReports suggested the overhaul will place a limit - or \"cap\" - on the lifetime contributions made by individuals, with the taxpayer funding costs on top of this. \nThis would be a version of a plan suggested by Sir Andrew Dilnot, who advocated a \u00a335,000 lifetime cap in 2011. \nIt was put into law in 2014 under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, but delayed and then eventually ditched under David Cameron.\nHis successor, Theresa May, later suggested and then abandoned a form of the proposals in 2017.\nFormer Labour health secretary and Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said an NI rise was \"flawed\" and \"unfair\" - and suggested ministers should instead ask all pensioners to make a contribution of 10% of their estate, topped up by rises in other taxes, such as capital gains tax.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he wanted \"to introduce the NHS principle to social care - everyone would be required to contribute, but everyone would benefit\".\nMr Burnham said \"for the vast majority of people they'd have peace of mind at a lower cost\" and \"I don't see how you can do this without asking pensioners to make a contribution\". \nMeanwhile, Wayne Fitzgerald, Conservative leader of Peterborough City Council, has said he does not think people would mind a tax if they had confidence that it was going to be used for social care.\nThe social care system is devolved across the four UK nations, meaning governments need to develop separate solutions.\nIn England, social care is generally not provided for free. Typically, only those with savings and assets worth less than \u00a323,250 can get help from their council and there is no overall limit on costs.\nPersonal care, such as help with washing and dressing, is free in Scotland for those assessed by their local authority as needing it. Those in a home still have to contribute towards accommodation costs.\nSome care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland.\nThe SNP has called on the government to scrap any planned rise in National Insurance, saying it would \"unfairly penalise Scottish families by forcing them to pay the bill for the Westminster social care crisis in England\".\nThe party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, added: \"If Boris Johnson breaks yet another manifesto pledge, the Tories will descend even further into irrelevance in Scotland.\""

      "text": "As Westminster has been cranking up for a busy autumn, so too has frantic and fraught speculation about the government's first big move of the political season. \nAt around noon on Tuesday, Boris Johnson will unveil his plan to \"fix\" the system in England that looks after some of the most vulnerable people in society.\nIt will come more than two years, an election, and a pandemic after he first promised to do so.\nDespite thousands of column inches and hours and hours of earnest public debate already, there is a huge amount that we don't know about what will be on offer. \nAnd as I write on Monday evening, most of the cabinet is not fully in the loop. Let's start though with what we do expect.\nThe government is expected to announce an increase in National Insurance, the tax paid by workers and employers, likely of 1.25%, to raise billions of pounds to pay for helping the NHS catch up with lost time and treatment after the pandemic, and to help improve and pay for social care in England. \nI'm told the cash raised, potentially over \u00a312 billion, will be ring-fenced somehow, targeted initially at the health service itself then will switch to social care after three years. \nExpect also promises of changes to how the system works, including limiting the amount that families have to pay for care if need it.\nAs I wrote before the summer, for months it's been likely that the plan would be based on reforms put forward by Sir Andrew Dilnot years ago, not least because the legislation required is also on the statute book. \nThe social care changes do relate to the system in England, because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have different mechanisms when it comes to its provision. \nBut if extra National Insurance income is spent in the way we'd expect, there will be more money for every part of the UK too. \nIt's likely there would have to be a specific vote in Parliament to set the level of the limit, or \"cap\" for families in England. \nBut the Dilnot framework already exists, which reduces the need for months of wrangling or Commons complications.\nIndeed, whispers today suggest that ministers might push for a vote sooner rather than later on the increase to NI, potentially branded as the \"Health and Social Care Levy\".\nAnd by tying the long-term changes to the care system to extra cash the NHS says it needs because of the pandemic, it could make it harder for critics to oppose the plan.  \nI'm told the proposals include increasing current hospital capacity to 110% of its current level, to help make up for lost time and treatments during the pandemic. \nIt's potentially one thing for an angry MP to argue against a costly and complicated change to the social care system. It's quite another to vote against extra money for the health service.\nWe also know that Boris Johnson is willing to break a manifesto pledge by raising National Insurance, and up for going ahead with a tax rise that proportionately hits the young and less wealthy harder than the richer and older generation. \nOne minister suggested that unfairness would be balanced out with the chancellor's expected ditching of the so-called triple lock that protects the level of pension payments. \nThat might help government ministers with their script, but it doesn't smooth the edges of what many see as a blunt increase to a tax paid by millions. \nAnd it is abundantly clear that many Conservatives, including Cabinet ministers, are very unhappy with the proposed tax increase.\nThat's not just because it breaks the promise in their 2019 election manifesto, once seen as politically sacred documents, not to raise NI. \nBut also because the details of the reforms that are meant to take place alongside it are sketchy.\nWhich takes us to what we don't know - a lot. \nFirst, we don't know what kind of changes will be made to the care sector yet.\nWhat about the workforce? What about local authorities' role? What will the limits be on what families have to pay for care? \nAnd what about so called \"hotel\" costs, for food and accommodation in residential care?\nCrucially, what kind of guarantee will there be that the huge amount of extra cash raised will actually go to the NHS and then on to social care, when it's a rise in general taxation? \nWhat will happen to the money due to social care in three years' time if the NHS comes to believe that it actually needs to keep the extra finances? \nHow much extra will the NHS itself, and social care providers, have to stump up in extra NI themselves? As a huge employer, the NHS could find itself on the hook for hundreds of millions of pounds. \nWhen the details of the plan - named \"A Build Back Better Plan for the NHS and Social Care,\" I'm told (what else, I hear you cry) - emerge in black and white at lunchtime on Tuesday, it's likely more questions will emerge in response.\nThere will be noise. There are arguments ahead. The opposition parties are bristling. \nThe prime minister may receive only ragged support from his party for the plan. \nBut Boris Johnson has had enough of answering \"wait and see\" when asked for his plan on social care, and is unwilling to go into the next election with this long-running dilemma not resolved."

If you live in certain parts of Wales you should be asking yourself: 'Am I getting fair service from my MP when I need them?'\"\nMeanwhile, Labour MP for Rhondda Chris Bryant said \"it is a deliberate campaign by the Conservatives\" to get people who typically vote against them to vote for them.\nMr Bryant also criticised the UK government's proposal to pass a law requiring people to show an approved form of identification in order to vote. \n\"Many people in my constituency and people who live in transient communities in cities who normally tend to vote labour are going to find it more difficult to register, vote and participate in democracy\", he added.\nBut according to Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, \"it's no longer clear whether the Conservatives will necessarily lose significantly less than Labour\" in Wales after proposed boundary reform."

      "text": "Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has signed a decree aimed at restricting the powers of social media companies to remove accounts and content.\nMr Bolsonaro said a change of regulations was needed to combat the \"arbitrary removal\" of profiles.\nHe said the new legislation would help protect freedom of speech.\nThroughout the coronavirus pandemic, Twitter and Facebook have removed many posts shared by the president and his supporters that were deemed misleading.\nThe new decree aims to provide clarity on the powers of social media companies to police content on their platforms, the president's office said.\nDetails of the decree released so far simply state that tech giants will have to provide \"just cause and motivation\" before removing an account or content. \nIt is unclear, however, exactly how the order will be enforced.\nThe announcement comes on the eve of what are expected to be large pro-Bolsonaro demonstrations across Brazil. \nSupporters of the president will be protesting against the country's Congress and Supreme Court, which last month added Mr Bolsonaro's name to a list of people being investigated over the alleged production of misinformation.\nCritics have said the marches, which coincide with the country's Independence Day celebrations, represent a danger to democracy.\nMr Bolsonaro and his allies have frequently had posts on social media removed since the start of the pandemic. \nIn July, YouTube removed around 15 videos from a channel belonging to Mr Bolsonaro for spreading misinformation about Covid-19. \nSome of the posts removed included videos that promoted the use of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug, and the anti-parasitic drug Ivermectin as treatments against the coronavirus - neither has been proven to be an effective treatment against the virus.   \nLast year, Facebook complied with an order by the Brazilian Supreme Court to block the accounts of dozens of Mr Bolsonaro's top allies accused of promoting misinformation against federal judges. \nMr Bolsonaro has since encouraged supporters to engage with him on alternative platforms such as Telegram and Parler.

      "title": "Boris Johnson outlines new 1.25% health and social care tax to pay for reforms",
      "tags": "Tax,Boris Johnson,Social care",
      "text": "A new health and social care tax will be introduced across the UK to pay for reforms to the care sector and NHS funding in England.\nBoris Johnson said it would raise \u00a312bn a year, designed to tackle the health backlog caused by the Covid pandemic and to bolster social care.\nHe accepted the tax broke a manifesto pledge, but said the \"global pandemic was in no-one's manifesto\".\nHowever, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the plan was a \"sticking plaster\".\nLeaders in social care also warned the money was \"nowhere near enough\" and would not address current problems.\nThe tax will begin as a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance from April 2022, paid by both employers and workers, and will then become a separate tax on earned income from 2023 - calculated in the same way as National Insurance and appearing on an employee's payslip.\nThis will be paid by all working adults, including older workers, and the government says it will be \"legally ring-fenced\" to go only towards health and social care costs.\nIncome from share dividends - earned by those who own shares in companies - will also see a 1.25% tax rate increase.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies said the latest tax increases amounted to \u00a314bn. Together with those announced in the March Budget, it said, 2022 had seen the highest tax rises in 40 years.\nThe UK-wide tax will be focused on funding health and social care in England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive an additional \u00a32.2bn to spend on their services. \nThe SNP said the tax would \"unfairly penalise Scottish families - and leave the poorest in society subsidising the wealthy\".\nMPs will vote on the new proposals in the Commons on Wednesday. \nMr Johnson said the proceeds from the tax would lead to \u00a312bn a year being raised, with the majority going into catching up on the backlog in the NHS created by Covid - increasing hospital capacity and creating space for nine million more appointments, scans and operations.\nA portion of the money - \u00a35.4bn over the next three years - will also go towards changes to the social care system, with more promised after that.\nA cap will be introduced on care costs in England from October 2023 of \u00a386,000 over a person's lifetime.\nAll people with assets worth less than \u00a320,000 will then have their care fully covered by the state, and those who have between \u00a320,000 and \u00a3100,000 in assets will see their care costs subsidised.\nJune Clay, 92, from Hornchurch, had to go into a nursing home four years ago.\nAs a property owner, June had to \"self-fund\", so sold her house to afford fees which over four years have risen to nearly \u00a31,200 a week.\nHer capital is almost all gone. The local authority will help, but only up to \u00a3640 a week - while the cheapest homes locally charge \u00a3900.\nNow her children, in their 60s, are considering re-mortgaging their own homes and using their pension savings to pay for her care.\n\"I made a promise to my mum, that she would stay in that home... I'm worried sick about it,\" says daughter Sharon.\nBut she fears the reforms will be \"smoke and mirrors\" that will not meet the full costs of care.\nMr Johnson insisted that with the new tax, \"everyone will contribute according to their means\", adding: \"You can't fix the Covid backlogs without giving the NHS the money it needs.\n\"You can't fix the NHS without fixing social care. You can't fix social care without removing the fear of losing everything to pay for social care, and you can't fix health and social care without long-term reform.\"\nBut Labour's Sir Keir said the new tax broke the Conservatives' pledge at the last election not to raise National Insurance, income tax or VAT. \nHe also said the rise would target young people, supermarket workers and nurses, rather than those with the \"broadest shoulders\" who should pay more. \nThe Labour leader added: \"Read my lips - the Tories can never again claim to be the party of low tax.\"\nThe leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey - who is a carer himself - also said the tax was \"unfair\", and that the government's plan missed out solutions for staffing shortages, care for working age adults and unpaid family carers. \nMr Johnson said no Conservative government wanted to raise taxes - but he defended the move as \"the right, reasonable and fair approach\" in light of the pandemic, which saw the government spend upwards of \u00a3407bn on support. \nLater, during a press conference, the prime minister said he didn't want to raise taxes further but did not promise there would be no further rises before the next election - despite being asked repeatedly to rule it out. \nMeanwhile, the government has also announced it will suspend the so-called \"triple lock\" on pensions for one year following concerns that a big post-pandemic rise in average earnings would have led to pensions increasing by 8%.\nThe government is raising about \u00a312bn a year for three years with these tax rises. \nJust over \u00a32bn of that goes to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland under rules on how UK government spending is split. \nThat leaves \u00a310bn a year for health and social care in England. Most, but not all, of that has been earmarked against particular parts of health and social care. \nAbout \u00a36bn a year has been earmarked for the NHS. \nAnother nearly \u00a32bn a year will go to social care. \nA bit less than half of that will go towards the new funding model (helping people to pay for care) and a bit more than half going on delivering care - training for staff, support for councils and work on making the care and health services work better together. \nSome of the remainder will be spent on tax. The Department of Health and Social Care, and the NHS, are big employers and so a tax rise for employers will mean they have to pay more. \nBut there's still at least a \u00a31bn increase in the DHSC budget that goes into \"other\", with the government saying they'll announce further details in the coming weeks. \nAhead of the announcement, there was a backlash from number of Tory MPs, who said they were against a rise in National Insurance.\nBut questioning the PM after his statement in the Commons, many backbenchers instead sought reassurance that the money raised from the new tax would definitely go towards social care. \nFormer health secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's World At One that he thought the government had listened to concerns about only making changes to National Insurance, especially as it would \"disproportionately target younger people\" and not pensioners.\nHe said: \"This new tax is more broadly based and the 10% of pensioners who work will pay it as well.\"\nHowever, there was anger from the social care sector over the amount they had been promised as a result of the tax. \nChief executive of the UK Home Care Association, Dr Jane Townson, said: \"This is nowhere near enough. It will not address current issues and some measures may create new risks.\"\nChairman of the Independent Care Group, Mike Padgham, said it was a \"huge opportunity missed for radical, once-in-a-generation reform of the social care system\", adding it would not address the staffing crisis which was \"sending the sector into meltdown on a daily basis as care providers struggle to cover shifts\".\nAnd the general secretary of the Unison union, Christina McAnea, said: \"A detailed plan is needed first to mend and future-proof a sector broken by years of neglect. \n\"Only then will the cost of making good the damage become clear.\" \nThe sums are eye-watering, but they've still left health and care bosses disappointed.\nThe Covid pandemic has had a huge toll on the NHS, requiring an overhaul of how services are run and creating a growing backlog in care.\nEven with this money, it will take the health service years to catch up.\nPart of the reason for that is that despite the headline figure of \u00a336bn over three years, by the time the money is shared out across the four UK nations and social care takes a chunk, the frontline of the NHS in England is left with little more than half the \u00a310bn a year health bosses were asking for.\nCouncils are perhaps even more disappointed. \nThe case for social care predates the pandemic. Governments have been dodging it since the late 1990s so the fact that changes are on the way is being welcomed.\nBut the cap only solves one part of the problem - protecting people's assets when they face catastrophic costs.\nYou will still need to be eligible for care to benefit from the cap. Access is rationed so only the most frail qualify - currently half of requests for help are turned down.\nCouncils say the money will do little to help them tackle this."

I just had someone pay me $40 in Bitcoin for a fare to the airport but it's rare. Only around 10% of customers prefer to pay with Bitcoin.\"\nDaniel says the cost of converting Bitcoin into the local currency - the US dollar - is high at 10%, so he is using the money like a savings account.\nHe hopes to grow his wallet to around $1,000 in Bitcoin but is scared about the currency crashing.\n\"It is one of the things that worries me the most. Losing money from long days of work would not be OK.\"\nThe value of Bitcoin has risen and fallen dramatically in the last year.\nIt went from about $10,000 for a single coin in September 2020 to a high of $63,000 in April 2021 then falling to $30,000 in July this year.   \nThe value of Bitcoin has risen in recent weeks to $51,000 which some analysts have linked to the El Salvador news. \nOn Monday, a viral post on the three-million-strong Bitcoin page on Reddit read: \"So\u2026 We all buying $30 worth of Bitcoin on Tuesday?\"\nHowever, a survey by the Central American University (UCA) found that only 4.8% of the 1,281 people who took part understood what Bitcoin was and how it was used.\nMore than 68% of those questioned said they disagreed with using cryptocurrency as a legal tender.\nJeanette Sandoval, 70, sells groceries for home delivery with her son.

Work that was put on hold when coronavirus struck.\nShe will hope that will assuage her critics in the independence movement who don't think she's pushing hard enough for indyref2, with her party conference due this weekend. \nIt has also angered Conservatives and other supporters of the UK who think she is putting nationalist politics ahead of Covid recovery - a recovery the first minister insists remains her top priority. \nThe Conservatives were critical of the plans, with leader Douglas Ross saying Ms Sturgeon's priorities were all wrong.\nHe said: \"Another independence referendum is front and centre of the first minster's plans for the year ahead.\n\"Nicola Sturgeon is giving us a new white paper for independence instead of a plan for jobs, a plan to tackle drug deaths or a plan for NHS recovery.\"\nScottish Labour's Anas Sarwar said the government was \"short on big ideas\", saying: \"This isn't good enough, it isn't bold enough and it won't do enough.\"\nHe added: \"Barely a week goes by without someone from the government front bench declaring something mundane, rebadged or self-serving as historic. \n\"But the drier truth is that despite the SNP's rhetoric, the only historic thing today is levels of poverty in our streets, the numbers waiting for treatment in our hospitals and the depth of the economic crisis facing our country.\"\nAnd Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said there was \"little in the way of new hope\" in the programme, saying there was merely \"old hype, reheated and rebatched\"."

A few more Covid admissions, which could be prevented, will cause us to stop operating because we simply haven't got the capacity to do both.\"\nDuring this latest surge, the hospital's 14-bed ICU was divided in two. \nOn one side, doctors and nurses battled to help save the lives of those who have had serious surgery or major trauma.\nJust a few metres away, on the other side of a wall, they were battling Covid and Dr Gardiner said beds were \"at a premium\".\nIndeed, there was just one spare ICU bed for the patient whose surgery went ahead.\nOther operations were also cancelled.\nAccording to Dr Gardiner, chronic staff shortages meant specialist staff could not be spread across the Belfast Trust's three separate hospital sites.\nAnd one-to-one nursing care, the gold standard for ICU, was no longer possible.\nDr Gardiner said they were at \"the very limit with what we can achieve\".\n\"My biggest fear is that we won't be able to keep going with cancer surgery; that we will be overwhelmed with Covid admissions; with routine winter admissions and that we will have to stop routine cancer surgery.\n\"We do not want to be faced with having to ask or decide who is going to get their operation and who is not; who is going to get an ICU bed and who is not.\"\nIn Covid ICU - the hospital's \"red zone\"  - the battle to save lives is constant.\nIt's hideously bright, stiflingly hot and the cacophony of hissing ventilators, beeping alarms and buzzing machinery bombard the senses. \nWhile the atmosphere is almost oppressive, each alert is a sign that the fight is not lost.\nAll patients are heavily sedated and hooked up to numerous pieces of medical equipment.\nNone are capable of speaking.\nAt one point, it took seven staff to prone [turn] a woman in her 60s.\n\"That helps us to improve the oxygen level,\" explained consultant Martin Duffy.\n\"We have been doing it very frequently during the last 18 months.\"\nAt other beds, physiotherapists pumped chests, moved feet or arms while nurses dabbed ice lollies around the mouths of patients.\nNaomi Dalzell, a specialist respiratory ICU physio, said: \"These patients are often ventilated for four, five or six weeks or even more than that. \n\"They lose a significant amount of muscle strength while they are here. We start the rehab as early as we can [but] there's a long road ahead.\"\nJanette Ancog was among dozens who have been re-deployed to ICU, having usually worked as a nurse at Musgrave Park Hospital.\n\"It will be scary thinking ahead if the surge will go high again,\" she said, \"but we will just get through with it - we are here for each other.\"\nThe onslaught of another gruelling winter was also at the forefront of Emma Cody's mind.\nShe had just finished another challenging 12-hour nursing night shift and described the anxiety as \"immense\".\n\"I don't know how we are going to keep going at this level,\" she said. \"It's not sustainable. The burnout is immense. \n\"Everybody hits a breaking point and a lot of people have, and a lot of people will, still hit that. It is a worry.\"\nMeanwhile, in a high-dependency unit, cancer patient Michael McAliskey was grateful that the struggling system was still able to cope.\n\"I am in a lucky position where I got some treatment before I passed the point of no return,\" he said.\nDr Gardiner has appealed for political unity on the contentious issue of transforming the health service.\n\"I don't think there has been politics in the treatment of Covid or the way we have responded to it. Everyone has been behind that,\" he said.\n\"But now we need to move on and accept that in order to get cancer surgery done, to treat Covid, to treat emergencies, to treat all the things that we are expected to treat we need political support. \n\"We need public co-operation in their behaviour, their actions and understanding of what we are actually up against.\""

She died later in hospital.\nThe inspector's report highlighted weaknesses in the roll-out of Police Scotland's new call handling system and made 30 recommendations for improvement.\nPolice Scotland has now said officers in its service centre will undergo specialist training to make an \"enhanced assessment of threat, risk, harm and vulnerability\" for every caller.\nThey said the information from the \"enhanced assessment\" would determine the most appropriate and proportionate police response.\nAssistant Chief Constable Hawkins said: \"Every caller is different and our response should be too. \n\"The new approach will ensure we can provide better service to the public by taking more information from the caller so that we can make a more robust assessment of risk, threat and harm and vulnerability.\n\"The new model will also increase our ability to despatch police officers to urgent incidents, which means we can get to the people who need us most, when they need us most.\"\nThe assistant chief constable said the current response to calls to the 101 and 999 service was based on \"pre-determined policies, procedures and system grading\". \nHe said he wanted to get away from having a 'one size fits all' approach to certain types of calls.\n\"This means that we might deal with the same type of call differently depending on the needs of the caller, after assessing their vulnerability and the risk posed to them,\" he said.\n\"For example, we might send officers if an elderly person calls to report that their garden shed has been broken into, but someone who is in a less vulnerable situation may actually request that we set up an appointment at their convenience or that an officer calls them back.\"\nThe new approach will be introduced in phases, starting with Lanarkshire, and Dumfries and Galloway in summer 2019, prior to a proposed roll out across Scotland."

      "text": "Some schools have decided not to follow Covid-19 self-isolation guidance over concerns it could lead to increased transmission, a leading teachers' representative body has said. \nThe National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said the issue is over close contact advice for pupils.\nSome principals have asked parents to consider longer isolation periods.\nThe Public Health Agency (PHA) guidance is based on Department of Health (DoH) policy guidance.\nIf a pupil is flagged as a close contact, and has not tested positive for the virus in the previous 90 days, the PHA recommends they self-isolate until they have taken a PCR test. \nIf the test is negative, they can return to school and do not have to self-isolate for 10 days, but are advised to take another test on day eight of their 10-day exposure period. \nHowever, the NAHT has said some principals would like pupils to have longer self-isolation periods. \n\"The reason for that is some of the guidance coming from the PHA seemed to allow the possibility of increased transmission when at the same time our school leaders are doing everything they can to prevent transmission within our schools,\" said Graham Gault, the president of the NAHT in Northern Ireland.\n\"Our principals have understandably made some decisions in order to err on the side of safety.\"\nMr Gault's comments comes two days after Education Minister Michelle McIlveen acknowledged that schools are under pressure just days into the new term due to the number of Covid-19 cases and contact-tracing.\nShe announced that \u00a35.5m of extra funding was being made available to help schools and that a PHA helpline would open for longer hours from Monday.\nIn a statement on Sunday, she said she was aware of some of the issues and the problems they were causing schools. \nShe said her department would continue \"to monitor funding requirements as the pandemic progresses in order to secure adequate funding to keep our schools open and protect our children and young people\". \nSome principals have told BBC News NI that they would not be following the PHA close-contact guidance at their school. \nDianne Dawson, who heads up Braniel Primary in east Belfast, informed parents in a video message last week the school would not be following PHA advice.\nShe said it would require pupils who are close contacts to self-isolate for 10 days.\n\"I believe this is the best way to keep most of our children in school most of the time,\" she said.\n\"The other way they will be in and out, and in and out, for up to 18 days if they test positive any time up until day 8 then another 10 days of self-isolation and a negative test\"\n\"I don't personally feel they have thought this through for schools.\"\nSt Aloysius Primary School in Lisburn has also written to parents to inform them it would be deviating from the PHA guidance. \nThe letter said a child who is a close contact of a positive case in a household must self-isolate for 10 days. \nIt added the \"vast majority\" of Lisburn primary schools were taking this approach. \nAround 250 pupils at Larne High School - a third of the school population - have been identified as close contacts of positive cases and now require a negative PCR test before they can return.\nThe school's principal, Stephen Reid, said the lack of a test centre in the town is slowing pupils return to the classroom.\n\"That's putting additional pressure onto families,\" he said.\n\"What that will mean is either families have to travel a significant distance, yesterday [Saturday] for example the only testing sites available were Belfast, Antrim or Ballymena for people in the Larne area.\n\"It's very difficult at this stage to see how this settles and how we manage it going forward,\" he said.\n\"The pupils who will return negative, and return to school in the next few days, within a fortnight could again be a close contact and have to go through the process again.\""

      "tags": "Tax,Personal finance,Social care,Pay,Income tax",
      "text": "National Insurance payments are increasing in April, to fund social care in England and help the NHS recover after the pandemic.\nBut there has been criticism that the move is unfair on the lower-paid, especially when the cost of living is rising.\nEmployees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance (NI) from April 2022.\nBut from April 2023, National Insurance will return to its current rate.\nInstead, the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy.\nThis levy - unlike National Insurance - will also be paid by state pensioners who are still working.\nFrom April, people earning under \u00a39,880 a year, or \u00a3823 a month, won't have to pay National Insurance, or the new levy when it is introduced.\nHowever, those earning more than \u00a312,875 a year will pay more.\nFor example, an employee on \u00a320,000 a year will pay an extra \u00a389 a year. Someone on \u00a350,000 will pay \u00a3464 more. \nNational Insurance is a UK-wide tax.\nAlthough the government decision to increase it is focussed on funding health and social care in England, the tax increase is also expected to raise an additional \u00a32.2bn for services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThere are concerns the increase will have a higher impact on the lower-paid.\nThis is because workers pay 12% National Insurance on earnings between \u00a39,564 (\u00a39,880 from April) and \u00a350,268. However, earnings above this amount attract a rate of just 2%. \nSo, if your income rises above \u00a350,000, National Insurance takes a smaller proportion of your wages. \nThe Health and Social Care Levy will work the same way as National Insurance.\nThe government is also going back on a promise made in its 2019 election manifesto not to raise National Insurance.\nHowever, Boris Johnson said the increase was because of Covid and the burden it placed on the NHS.\nThe government says the changes are expected to raise \u00a312bn a year.\nInitially, this will go towards easing pressure on the NHS .\nA proportion will then be moved into the social care system.\nThis mainly helps older people and people with high care needs, with tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and taking medication.\nThe aim is to make sure people in England pay no more than \u00a386,000 in care costs from October 2023 (not including accommodation and food).\nAnyone with assets - like their home, savings and investments - worth less than \u00a320,000 will have their care fully covered by the state.\nThose with between \u00a320,000 and \u00a3100,000 in assets will have their care costs subsidised.\nAt present, to get your care paid for by your local council, you must have a very high level of need and also savings and assets worth less than \u00a323,250 in England.\nBelow that level the amount you pay reduces until you have less than \u00a314,250, at which point the council pays for your care if you qualify.\nThe care system is under pressure because of an ageing population and the pandemic. It has been hit by staff shortages and falling government spending.\nThis has also put pressure on the NHS because people cannot be discharged from hospital if they don't have anywhere suitable to go.\nIn Wales, no-one who is eligible for care at home is expected to pay more than \u00a3100 a week.\nIn Northern Ireland, no-one over the age of 75 pays for home care.\nScotland provides free personal care for people who are assessed as needing support at home, whatever their age.\nIn Scottish care homes, people get free care if they have savings or assets of less than \u00a318,000. \nThose with savings and assets of between \u00a318,000 and \u00a328,750 have to fund part of their care. \nPeople with more than that have to fund their own care, apart from a \u00a3193.50 a week contribution towards personal care and \u00a387.10 a week towards nursing care.\nUPDATE: Figures for how much the increase in National Insurance will cost were updated to take into account the rise in the primary threshold from April 2022 in line with inflation."

      "tags": "Energy industry,UK economy,Climate change,Coal mining,National Grid",
      "text": "The UK fired up an old coal power plant on Monday to meet its electricity needs.\nWarm, still, autumn weather has meant wind farms have not generated as much power as normal, while soaring prices have made it too costly to rely on gas.\nAs a result, National Grid ESO - which is responsible for balancing the UK's electricity supply - confirmed coal was providing 3% of national power.\nIt said it asked EDF to fire up West Burton A, which had been on standby. \nOn Tuesday, the use of coal returned to 2.2% of the UK's electricity generation.\nA National Grid ESO spokesman said there had been a three-day coal-free run in mid-August, but the country had relied on some coal power every day since then.\nLast year, coal contributed 1.6% of the country's electricity mix. That was down from 25% five years ago.\nBoth the government and National Grid ESO have committed to phasing out coal power completely by 2024 to cut carbon emissions. However, coal is still used when it is better value than gas.\nA small temporary uptick in the use of coal should be kept in perspective, said Dave Jones, electricity analyst at Ember, a think tank promoting the shift away from fossil fuels.\n\"No-one thought we'd use zero coal this year,\" he said.\n\"We're going through a process where year-on-year you're relying on coal less and less. As long as you know you can make it to that fixed date, which is still three years away, it's OK. We're well on track for that journey, probably ahead of schedule.\"\nBut higher gas prices could help accelerate the shift from gas to renewables over the next few years, he added.\nThe UK government has made commitments to reducing the use of gas for power generation, but has not set a fixed deadline. \nMore coal has been burnt this summer in particular, due to soaring prices for natural gas.\nAcross Europe, shortages and increased demand from Asia have seen the cost of gas increase to the highest level on record, according to Reuters.\nA cold start to the year meant countries across the continent dipped into their gas reserves, which would normally be replenished in the summer months when demand tends to be weaker.\nBut the economic rebound, as countries reopen from Covid-19 lockdowns, meant higher-than-expected demand led to a shortage of gas.\nby Rebecca Wearn, Business Reporter\nBritain's use of coal power on a warm September day raises two big issues. \nThe first, is that this jars with an environmental commitment to reduce fossil fuel use. The second, is the huge impact global gas prices have on our domestic energy. \nOver the coming months, those sky-high gas prices are expected to remain volatile. So, as well as forcing National Grid to make some tough choices about where we get our electricity from, it could also have a big knock-on on what we pay.\nThe cap on regulated prices will be raised in October, adding \u00a3139 to the bills of 15 million households. But that could be just the start.\nNow would be a good time for consumers to check what they're paying - and shop around for the best deal - before the winter weather makes this issue more acute. \n\"In balancing the electricity system, we take actions in economical order and not on the basis of generation type,\" a National Grid spokesman said.\n\"Depending on system conditions, some power sources may be better at meeting a balancing requirement than others - so the most cost-effective solution to ensure safe, secure system operation will be sought.\"\nThe Nuclear Industry Association said the decision to fire up another coal power plant highlighted the urgent need to invest in new nuclear plants.\n\"Otherwise, we will continue to burn coal as a fall-back and fall well short of our net zero ambitions,\" said the trade body's chief executive, Tom Greatrex."

They were some of the first winged insects to evolve, some 300 million years ago.\nScientists are increasingly concerned about the decline of some populations of insects.\nOne scientific review of insect numbers in 2019 pointed to 40% of species undergoing \"dramatic rates of decline\" around the world.\nThe study said bees, ants and beetles were disappearing eight times faster than mammals, birds or reptiles, while other species, such as houseflies and cockroaches, were likely to boom.\nFollow Helen  on Twitter."

      "text": "Universal credit will rise for some people under plans announced by the chancellor in his Budget.\nRishi Sunak has reduced the \"taper rate\" - this affects the amount of money lost by working claimants if they earn more money.\nUniversal credit is a single benefit payment for working-age people, which was introduced to replace a range of different benefits for unemployed and low-paid people, and make the system simpler. \nIt's claimed by more than 5.8 million people in England, Scotland and Wales, both in and out of work - 40% of universal credit claimants are workers.\nClaimants received an extra \u00a320 per week during the pandemic, but this ended at the beginning of this month.\nMost universal credit claimants lose some of their benefits if they earn more money.\nThe rate at which they lose the benefits is known as the taper rate.\nAt the moment the taper rate is 63%, which means that if you earn an extra pound you lose 63p in benefits.\nWorkers with responsibility for children or disabilities that limit their ability to work are allowed to earn a certain amount before they start losing their universal credit, which is called a work allowance. \nThe work allowance means such people can earn up to \u00a3515 a month without losing benefits. Claimants who receive help with housing costs have a lower work allowance. \nThe chancellor has announced that in the coming weeks the taper rate will be reduced to 55p, which would mean that workers would take home 8p more of an extra pound earned.\nAlso, the work allowances for eligible claimants will go up by \u00a3500 a year.\nFor some workers that will make up for the loss of the \u00a320 a week uplift to universal credit.\nEmployees claiming universal credit who earn enough to pay National Insurance (\u00a39,564 a year) will also see the amount of tax they have to pay increase next April. That will affect somebody working more than about 20 hours a week on the minimum wage.\nTake as an example somebody without children, working 10 hours a week on the National Living Wage - which is going up to \u00a39.50 an hour in April.\nThey would earn \u00a395 a week, which means - at the current 63% taper rate - they lose \u00a359.85 of their universal credit. If the taper rate were cut to 55% they would get to take home an extra \u00a37.60 a week.\nHowever, most universal credit claimants are not working, so they would not receive any extra money.\nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) says that 1.4 million households still claim working tax credit and have not moved to universal credit, so they also would not benefit.\nThe cut to universal credit was opposed by many charities, opposition parties, and also some Conservative MPs.\nWriting on Twitter, Resolution chief executive Torsten Bell said that removing the boost would mean \"4.4 million households, with 5.1m adults and 3.5m children, will see their incomes fall by \u00a31,000 overnight. \nThe charity Citizens Advice warned that a third of people on universal credit would end up in debt when the extra payment is removed.\nIt said the average shortfall would be between \u00a351 and \u00a355 a month.\nThe government has defended its decision, saying the \u00a320 uplift was always meant to be temporary and that people getting back into work is the best way to tackle poverty.\nIt is complicated to work out exactly how much universal credit you might receive. Some people, such as those with \u00a316,000 or more in savings, are not eligible.\nOthers may find what they receive depends on their circumstances, including any income their family has, as well as housing and childcare costs.\nIt usually takes five weeks from the date of claiming to receiving a first payment, although an advance loan may be possible.\nAn application for universal credit may put a stop to any tax credits you receive, even if it proves to be unsuccessful.\nYou may be able to claim a reduction in council tax when on universal credit, and get help with childcare costs. There is also support to pay the rent, which works in different ways across the UK. \nIn time, there may also be assistance in paying the mortgage, although there are some strict criteria involved.\nThe main benefit for anyone losing their job after a period in work is new-style jobseeker's allowance (JSA).\nThis is worth \u00a359.20 a week, if you are under 25, or \u00a374.70 a week if you are 25 or over.\nYou can get this for up to six months and it will be paid into your bank, building society, or credit union account every two weeks. Unlike universal credit, your partner's or spouse's income will not affect your claim.\nYou may be able to claim new-style JSA as well as universal credit.\nUniversal credit may not be appropriate or available for everyone. Claiming it can affect other benefits, and it is vital to get some advice - available for free - before applying.\nPlaces offering guidance on this and other benefits questions include:\nHow will you be affected by this?

      "text": "More than seven million confirmed cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the UK since the pandemic began, official figures show.\nIt comes as another 41,192 positive tests were reported on Monday, along with 45 Covid-related deaths.\nBut the real number of people infected during the pandemic is likely to be much higher, partly due to the lack of testing in the early stages.\nCovid-19 has been named on the death certificate of 156,119 people.\nThe most recent figures show that there are 7,606 Covid-19 patients in hospital, with 1,034 on ventilators.\nMany cases during the pandemic have not shown up in the official daily count because testing only became available in summer 2020, with only people in hospital being tested before then.\nEven as testing became widespread, cases will have been missed as some people did not develop symptoms or had such a mild illness they did not realise they were infected.\nModelling by the University of Cambridge suggests 17 million people in England have been infected since the pandemic began - about 30% of the population.\nThe milestone of seven million confirmed cases came as the vaccine minister said a vaccine booster programme was \"ready to go\".\nNadhim Zahawi told MPs that third jabs were the \"most important piece of the jigsaw\" remaining to help end the pandemic.\nHe said the NHS was primed to roll out boosters - but the government was awaiting scientific advice for the scheme to be signed off.\nThe government had \"ambitious\" plans to give Covid and flu vaccines at the same time, he said.\nMr Zahawi said a hold-up with one of the UK's largest suppliers of seasonal flu vaccines would \"not delay the overall flu vaccination programme at all\".\nSeqirus has said there could be up to a fortnight's delay in jab deliveries to some GP surgeries in England and Wales due to a shortage of HGV drivers.\nBut Mr Zahawi told the House of Commons Seqirus had \"a border issue with their Spanish factory\". \nHe said: \"They are meeting with the Spanish regulator to see what is the issue. They are being very careful and estimating a one or two weeks delay. \n\"It will not delay the overall flu vaccination programme at all, their German and Belgian supply chain has been flowing normally and they are one supplier.\"\nMr Zahawi also refused to be drawn on whether all 12 to 15-year-olds would be offered a Covid jab.\nHe said he would not \"pre-empt\" the recommendations by the UK's chief medical officers expected in the coming days.\nIn response to questioning from Labour's Jonathan Ashworth, Mr Zahawi said the NHS was prepared to administer a vaccine within five working days of any recommendation.\nIt comes as pupils across the UK have returned to school, with many in England and Wales resuming classes on Monday.\nMany Covid measures have now been lifted in schools, including the requirement for face masks and isolation bubbles.\nIn Northern Ireland, more than half of pupils at one school could not attend because of close contact with someone who tested positive.\nMeanwhile, Monday was the busiest morning on the London Underground since March 2020, Transport for London said.\nTube passengers were up 20% and bus passengers up by 40% from the previous week, accounting for the bank holiday, but numbers were still less than half of pre-pandemic numbers on the Underground."

      "tags": "Television,New York City,Acting,Film,United States",
      "text": "Tributes have been paid to US actor Michael K Williams, best known for starring in HBO drama series The Wire, following his death at the age of 54.\nThe Wire co-star Clarke Peters told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"He was a generous actor. It wasn't me, me, me. It was us, us, us.\"\nFilm-maker Spike Lee described Williams on Instagram as \"his brother\" and said he \"was shook\" at the news.\nThe Wire creator David Simon said he was \"a fine man and a rare talent\".\nAlongside a picture of Williams, Simon wrote that he was \"too gutted right now to say all that ought to be said\", adding: \"On our journey together he always deserved the best words. And today those words won't come.\"\nThe star was found dead in his New York apartment on Monday. US media quoted law enforcement sources as saying he died from a suspected drug overdose, but that has not been confirmed.\nWilliams, who was nominated for three Emmys, had openly discussed his struggles with drugs over the years. \nIn The Wire, he played Omar Little, a gay, streetwise robber of drug gangs.\nHe was also known for playing gangster Albert \"Chalky\" White in the Prohibition period TV series Boardwalk Empire. Other TV credits included Lovecraft Country, The Night Of, Bessie and When They See Us.\nPeters, who played Lester Freamon in The Wire, said he \"didn't know whether to be sad or angry\" about the death of his co-star.\n\"I'm sad that Michael is no longer with us because there was a very promising personality that could have done so much more. I'm angry because I feel he's let us down by going back when he could have reached out,\" he told the Today programme.\n\"Once a person is on that path, maybe it is very difficult for them to get off. So we, as a society, have to pull our socks up so we can help people like this.\"\nSpike Lee said: \"Whew lawd, dis is a tough day -1st we lose the great French actor Jean Paul Belmondo and now my brother Michael K Williams.\n\"Our greats are leaving us left and right. God bless,\" he added alongside a photograph of himself with Williams at a basketball game.\nOther tributes from the world of entertainment came from the likes of his The Wire co-star Wendell Pierce.\n\"The depth of my love for this brother, can only be matched by the depth of my pain learning of his loss,\" Pierce tweeted. \n\"A immensely talented man with the ability to give voice to the human condition portraying the lives of those whose humanity is seldom elevated until he sings their truth,\" Pierce added.\nIdris Elba, who played Stringer Bell in The Wire, simply posted a black square with the initials MKW.\nSonja Sohn, who played Detective Kima Greggs, posted \"Always & Forever\" with a broken heart.\nSinger Mariah Carey shared a picture of herself with Williams, describing him as \"a beautiful soul, a beautiful person\". She added: \"I'll miss you always. Thank you for blessing us with your talent.\"\nOscar-nominated actress Taraji P Henson posted on Instagram: \"Rest well my friend. Jesus, you will be deeply missed.\"\n\"If he was in a scene he was the best thing about it. Period,\" wrote actor Edward Norton, who worked with Williams on the 2019 film Motherless Brooklyn. \nOscar winner Viola Davis simply wrote: \"No! So sad. Man do I wish this were a different ending. Rest well. Praying for your loved ones.\"\nFellow actress Kerry Washington posted on Twitter: \"So heartbroken. Thank you for the beauty and joy you brought to the world. Sending love and prayers to your friends, family and everyone who adored you me included. We adore you Sir.\"\nShe also retweeted a video of Pierce with Williams as the former praised the latter's acting ability on the red carpet.\n\"This is heartbreaking to learn. We have lost an enormous talent in Michael K Williams,\" tweeted Star Trek actor George Takei. \nDirector James Gunn described Williams as one of the \"most gentle souls I've ever met\".\nIn a statement, the HBO TV network, which aired 60 episodes of The Wire between 2002 and 2008, said: \"We are devastated to learn of the passing of Michael Kenneth Williams, a member of the HBO family for more than 20 years.\n\"While the world is aware of his immense talents as an artist, we knew Michael as a dear friend who was beloved by all who had the privilege to work with him. We send our deepest condolences to his family for this immeasurable loss.\"\nMichael K Williams' complex portrayal of Omar Little, a gay, shotgun-toting robber of drug dealers, helped cement The Wire's game-changing depiction of life in the projects of Baltimore.\nOmar represented the duality of a black experience never before given such honest screen time. Nowhere was that better represented than his exchanges with Wendell Pierce's detective Bunk, a black schoolfriend who reminded him of the different paths life afforded them.\nInterviewed together years before Williams' death, Pierce said his co-star's performance gave voice and flesh to characters \"that most people would have never given the same humanity to\u2026 opening a window to a world of men that we pass by or don't know about\".\nPierce described the scenes they shared as the \"greatest of my career\", performed by a man who contributed two of the \"most iconic characters in the history of American television\" in Omar Little and Chalky White, and no doubt could have given many more.\nBorn in 1966, Williams had a turbulent upbringing in Brooklyn, New York. Despite trying to avoid confrontation, he later said he \"had a way of always finding myself in trouble - like, big trouble, you know what I'm saying?\"\nHe began his career as a dancer and performed with Madonna and George Michael before moving into acting with companies including the prestigious National Black Theatre Company.\nHe got the distinctive scar on his forehead and right cheek after being slashed by a razor on his 25th birthday - but that inadvertently led to his first acting job after Tupac Shakur saw a photo of him and decided he looked \"thugged out enough\" to play his brother in the 1996 film Bullet.\nIn a BBC interview in 2018, Williams explained why The Wire was such a success. \"I think it has just stayed with people because it's still relevant now, because of the climate of what's going on in the United States. I think it's actually a little sad,\" he said.\n\"It was the first show I saw that was created as what I call 'edutainment'. It dived so honestly into what was wrong in our society, from the police department to our lawmakers to our school system, and the media. It represented what was happening in our community.\"\nBut in 2011, he told The Hollywood Reporter he was \"overwhelmed\" by the success of season one and went \"into an emotional tailspin\" during season two.\n\"I wasted a lot of money, I started drinking and drugging again, and, at the end of season two, I was forced to move back to my projects and slept on a mattress on the floor.\"\nSpeaking about his drug use while filming The Wire, he told news website NJ.com in 2012: \"I was playing with fire.\n\"It was just a matter of time before I got caught and my business ended up on the cover of a tabloid or I went to jail - or worse.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nadhim Zahawi,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government has denied newspaper reports that it is planning an October lockdown in England.\nThe i newspaper said plans had been drawn up to extend the school half-term holiday, if the number of hospitalisations continue at the current level.\nThe i said a full lockdown was unlikely - but the government could introduce some rules as part of a \"firebreak\".\nHowever the Department for Education said the report was \"not true\".\n\"It is not true that the government is planning a lockdown or firebreak around the October half term,\" it said in a tweet.\nThe prime minister's spokesman also denied the report. He said plans had been kept for a range of scenarios - \"but these kind of measures would only be reintroduced as a last resort to prevent unsustainable pressure on our NHS\".\n\"I think we've been clear throughout that we will take action, and indeed we have done when necessary to protect our NHS,\" he said.\nBut the spokesman pointed out that when rules were brought in the past, the UK did not yet have the protection from vaccines. \nOn Tuesday the UK recorded another 37,489 coronavirus cases, with 209 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. \nFour in five people in the UK aged 16 and over are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19, the latest figures show. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said it was \"a phenomenal achievement\".\nIf the NHS was at risk of collapse the return of restrictions is possible. Contingency plans are, of course, in place. \nBut the key question is - what is the likelihood of this? Very few of those scientists advising government think it's a likely scenario. \nAnd - as one scientist put it to me - \"if we were going to suggest anything it wouldn't be closing schools\".\nThat's not to say there isn't real concern about winter. \nCovid, plus the return of normal winter viruses made worse by lack of immunity from social distancing and lockdown last year, means the coming months are likely to be very difficult for the NHS. \nCare could be rationed and performance deteriorate as happens quite often in winter.\nBut it is important to remember currently fewer than 7% of beds are occupied by Covid patients - and the numbers are not rising rapidly.\nEarlier, the government's vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said he hoped booster jabs would avoid the need for any new lockdown rules.\n\"Look, vaccines have given us the ability to reduce infections, to save 100,000 lives,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\n\"I'm not going to be arrogant and say to you this is a done deal, it's all over, it's fine, this virus is no longer in pandemic stage. \n\"But I hope through the booster programme we can transition the virus from pandemic to endemic status and deal with it year in, year out... but not have to close down our economy or take the severe measures we had to sadly take in December of last year.\"\nThe first booster vaccines for the most vulnerable are expected this month.\nThe latest advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation - which advises the government on vaccines -  suggests more than 30 million people should receive a booster dose of Covid vaccine.\nThat number includes all over-50s and anyone over 16 who qualifies for a flu jab.\nSeparately to the booster jabs, about 400,000 to 500,000 people in the UK who are severely immuno-suppressed will also be eligible for a third dose of vaccine. This is different to a booster jab, and they may also get a booster at a later date.\nMr Zahawi also emphasised that the flu vaccine was important. \n\"I worry about flu,\" he said. \"We've got a big flu programme that has begun and will continue throughout the winter months as well as, I hope, our Covid booster programme which will begin shortly this month.\"\nThe number of people in hospital with coronavirus has been slowly climbing in recent weeks - although it is still far below the peak in January this year.\nSo far, nearly 80% of adults in the UK are fully vaccinated, while almost 89% have had a first dose.

      "tags": "Plastic,Swansea University,Plastic pollution,Recycling,Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Discarded face masks could be melted down and recycled to help tackle plastic pollution.\nIt is estimated 129 billion single-use face masks are used monthly around the world, with 55 million a day in the UK.\nThe Welsh government has set a target on creating no waste in Wales by 2050 and a recycling expert wants the NHS to set an example by recycling PPE.\nOne Welsh firm is now working to turn hospital waste into new masks with 65% recycled materials.\nOld PPE like face masks, which people in the UK go through about 19 billion every year, is currently incinerated - producing climate-warming carbon emissions - or sent to landfills.\nMat Rapson, managing director of Cardiff-based Thermal Compaction Group - or TCG, said was a \"huge problem\".\n\"We use 55 million masks a day in the UK and globally the figure is 129 billion masks, a lot of which is being discarded into landfills,\" he said.\nTCG is already working with seven hospital trusts across the UK, which are using thermal heating devices to melt down PPE.\nThe firm heats single-use masks, gowns and curtains to 300C, sterilising all pathogens, and is recycling 300,000 defective masks each month, which would have otherwise been incinerated or sent to landfill.\nIt turns them into 1m-long blocks that are 99.6% polypropylene - made up of about 10,000 masks - which can be used to make products such as plastic chairs, buckets and toolboxes. \n\"If a mask goes into landfill, or worse beaches or rivers, it takes 450 years to decompose,\" Mr Rapson said.\n\"It's ridiculous. We're just discarding these single-use disposable items, but they're not single-use, they can be recovered and remade multiple times.\n\"The ideal is that all hospital PPE waste gets recovered and made back into masks for hospitals.\"\nLinda Ball, chief executive of Upcycled Plastics, said the firm was making masks using plastic waste recovered from the sea.\nShe said the manufacturing process resulted in a 36% reduction in carbon emissions, and she believed the NHS, the UK's largest user of disposable PPE, could cut its impact significantly by switching to recycled PPE.\nShe said: \"The biggest problem that we have in the medical industry is single-use plastic.\n\"If we keep buying stuff from China and bringing it over here, the amount of carbon usage is insane.\"\nShe said recycling masks, however, was a challenge as the ear hoops, the filter and the nose piece are often made from different types of plastic.\nDr Rob Elias, director of the Biocomposites Centre at Bangor University, said all PPE should be made in a way that it can be easily recycled, with one type of material making it \"a heck of a lot easier to recycle in the future.\"\nHe said polypropylene in a mask can be recycled \"five to six times\" before it breaks down, but the challenge is \"these recycling processes tend to be quite small at the moment, so they lack the scale\".\n\"When you scale up the production process, you get massive energy savings.\"\nBut Dr Elias said it was a \"great example\" of the circular economy, where single-use products like disposable masks are put back into the economy for reuse instead of being thrown away. \nThat is one of the key goals of the Welsh government's Beyond Recycling strategy, which aims to have no waste produced in Wales by 2050.\nProf Gary Walpole, director of the Circular Economy Innovation Community Project at Swansea University, said recycling was something we should be doing an \"awful lot more of\" and public sector bodies such as the NHS could set an example by recycling PPE.\n\"The basic premise of circular economy is to keep all products within the circular loop as long as possible,\" he said.\n\"There's a lot of energy that goes into creating products like plastic, so the longer you can keep that plastic in use, by reusing it, the less energy use, the less raw material use, and therefore the less carbon you emit.\"\nBut Prof Walpole said getting the private sector to adopt this approach on a wider scale was difficult. \nHe said one possible way forward would be to have the Welsh government mandate large organisations, such as the NHS and local authorities, into making the change.\n\"The public services buy a lot of goods and services, so it's a good place to start a different way of thinking,\" he said. \n\"This particular company is taking plastic products from the NHS where there are high volumes so they are able to leverage economies of scale, prove the concept, and then offer it out into the private sector.\"\nIt was also one solution to an increase in litter during the pandemic, including face masks and disposable gloves, according to Keep Wales Tidy.\nThe campaign group said there has been a \"significant and widespread increase in personal protective equipment being littered all over the country\", posing a danger to wildlife and public health. \nMr Rapson said: \"Plastic's not the problem, it's the infrastructure and we have one of the solutions here in Wales.\n\"Plastic is not disposable, it's not single use, we can actually embrace plastic and use it multiple times.\"\nThe Welsh government said: \"We are aware of the TCG Sterimelt proposals and welcome innovation from industry to tackle the challenges of single-use plastics in healthcare settings as we move towards a circular economy by 2050.\""

      "title": "Triple lock pension pledge suspended for one year",
      "text": "The government has confirmed a one-year suspension of the \"triple lock\" formula for annual state pension increases.\nThe move follows government concern that a big post-pandemic rise in average earnings would have meant pensions increasing by 8%.\nWork and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said the average earnings component would be disregarded in the 2022-23 financial year.\nInstead, the rise will be the consumer inflation rate or 2.5%.\n\"Tomorrow, I will introduce a Social Security Uprating and Benefits Bill for 2022-23 only,\" she told the Commons.\n\"It will ensure the basic and new state pensions increase by 2.5% or in line with inflation, which is expected to be the higher figure this year, and as happened last year, it will again set aside the earnings element for 2022-23 before being restored for the remainder of this Parliament.\" \nMs Coffey said the figures had been \"skewed and distorted\" by the average earnings rise, which she described as a \"statistical anomaly\".\nShe said the change meant that pensions would still rise, but less quickly. The triple lock would return the following year, she added. \nUnder the triple lock, pensions increase by inflation, the increase in earnings between May and July or 2.5%, whichever is the greater.\nThe Work and Pensions secretary said she was \"anticipating an unusual change in earnings\" due to the pandemic. \nShe added that earnings between May and July were expected to rise by more than 8%, so a one-year adjustment was needed. \nLast month, the Bank of England said it was expecting inflation to peak at 4%.\nThe Conservatives promised in their 2019 election manifesto to maintain the triple lock formula.\nMs Coffey's announcement came just hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson breached another manifesto commitment by increasing National Insurance to fund health and social care.\nAge UK charity director Caroline Abrahams said: \"If suspending the triple lock for a single year helps get a government deal on social care over the line, then I believe it's a price worth paying, but only if it really is just a one-off measure and not a sneaky way for ministers to ditch the triple lock altogether.\"\nMs Abrahams said that with more than two million pensioners currently living in poverty, there was \"a strong case\" for keeping the triple lock untouched.\nShe added that it was \"imperative that the triple lock reverts to normal next year, to help all those pensioners on low and modest incomes who desperately need it\".\nThe one-year break in the usual calculations for increases in the state pension was widely expected. \nThere is, after all, near-universal agreement that the average annual earnings rise (one leg of the so-called triple lock) will be an anomaly caused by the economic effect of Covid. \nCharities representing the elderly will hold the government to its commitment that this is just a temporary arrangement.\nTheir fear is that the government might be tempted to do the same again - potentially reducing rises in a state pension which is already low when compared with elsewhere in the Western world.\nOthers will consider this as a missed opportunity to reform the universal triple lock system, even though its existence is a Conservative manifesto promise for the rest of this Parliament.

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon is to set out the Scottish government's plans for the year to come at Holyrood.\nThe first minister will announce her \"programme for government\" of upcoming legislation in a speech to MSPs.\nThis is likely to include new bills supporting the key themes of the SNP's power-sharing deal with the Greens.\nThat agreement includes pledges to reform the Gender Recognition Act, set up a National Care Service, and to hold a new referendum on independence.\nOpposition parties will also have a chance to set out their proposals for the year to come, with two days of debate scheduled at Holyrood.\nWith Holyrood back in session after its summer recess, the first minister will set out her legislative plans for the year ahead.\nIt will detail how she plans to deliver on the pledges made in May's Holyrood election campaign, and in the co-operation agreement signed between the SNP and the Greens over the summer.\nMs Sturgeon has previously highlighted the economic and social recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, tackling climate change and holding a fresh referendum on independence as the major challenges of the coming term.\nAnd she said on Tuesday that a \"new vision for health and social care services\" would be a central theme, including enhanced childcare provision.\nShe added: \"As we rebuild our society, we will ensure the sacrifices we have all made will find purpose in the fairer, more just, prosperous, and equal Scotland that we create in response.\"\nThe policy programme agreed by the SNP and Greens as part of their power-sharing deal offers a range of insights into the legislation likely to be announced by Ms Sturgeon on Tuesday.\nIt commits the government to bringing forward legislation to reform the Gender Recognition Act to make it easier for trans people to change their legally-recognised gender \"in the first year of this parliamentary session\".\nMinisters have already carried out a series of consultations on what has become a fiercely-debated topic, which means a bill could be tabled in short order.\nThe government has also already published a one-page draft bill seeking to pave the way for a new independence referendum, another \"key strand\" of the power-sharing arrangement.\nThis may also be put forward for debate at Holyrood inside the next year, with Ms Sturgeon hoping to hold a referendum in the first half of the five-year parliamentary term.\nThe SNP had already pledged to draw up legislation to establish a National Care Service within the first year of term, and have also promised to replace the Scottish Qualifications Authority with a new agency overseeing the schools curriculum.\nThe SNP-Green deal also commits the parties to a range of other measures, including:\nHowever, it is not known if these will be included in the legislative timetable for the year to come, or if some measures will be rolled out later in the term.\nThe power-sharing partners have also pledged to introduce a national system of rent controls, but legislation may be some way off as they have only committed to implementing this by the end of 2025.\nThey have said a Housing Bill will be brought forward in the second year of the parliamentary term, while a Natural Environment Bill aimed at protecting biodiversity and nature will follow in the third year of term.\nA Circular Economy Bill will be introduced \"later in this parliamentary session\", while a Land Reform Bill focused on land ownership will be tabled in 2023 - alongside legislation to replace the Common Agricultural Policy system of farm subsidies.\nThe key theme will be Covid recovery with new investment planned to help the NHS deal with the backlog and work to expand affordable childcare before and after school to help working parents.\nEfforts to cut carbon emissions towards net zero by 2045 are also likely to feature prominently and not just because Greens are now in government and COP26 is drawing near.\nMSPs will also be listening carefully to hear what steps the power-sharing government intends to take towards its aim of holding an independence referendum when the pandemic eases and preferably before the end of 2023.\nI suspect it may be too early for the government to introduce a referendum bill at Holyrood - legislation that may ultimately be challenged in the courts.\nHowever, with an SNP/Green majority at Holyrood for indyref2 and an SNP conference scheduled for this weekend: doing nothing is probably not an option.\nThe Scottish government paused work on independence at the start of the pandemic. I doubt that position will hold for much longer and certainly not for the full year covered by today's programme.\nOpposition parties will have a chance to set out their own proposals following Ms Sturgeon's statement, and in a two-day debate which will follow.\nThe Scottish Conservatives have called for the economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic to be the key focus in the year ahead.\nLeader Douglas Ross said: \"Risking Scotland's economic recovery in pursuit of political goals could have disastrous consequences, now more than ever.\n\"Nicola Sturgeon must avoid at all costs the uncertainty and damage that could stem from shunning the oil and gas industry, punishing car drivers or worst of all, seeking to break up the country in the middle of a crisis.\"\nScottish Labour called for the Scottish government to commit to a \"just transition\" from the oil and gas industry to a net-zero economy, with MSP Monica Lennon saying its record on this had been \"woeful\" to date.\nShe added: \"It is essential that we transition to a net-zero carbon economy as quickly as possible - but it is every bit as important that we don't leave any people or communities behind in the process.\"  "
