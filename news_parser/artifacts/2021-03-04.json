      "text": "Three terror attacks have been prevented in the UK since the coronavirus pandemic began, according to security services.\nArrests for terrorism-related activity fell by 34% in 2020, the lowest level in nine years, Home Office data showed.\nBut the number of terror plots stopped has risen to 28 since March 2017, counter terror police said.\nThe foreign secretary said young people had been recruited to terror groups in \"worrying\" numbers during lockdown.\nDominic Raab told the House of Commons there had been a recent rise in the volume of terror-related content online.\n\"We can see a worrying rise in the proportion of children and teenagers that are now being arrested for terrorism offences,\" he added.\nThe UK's senior national coordinator for Counter Terrorism Policing warned that these organisations \"have not stopped planning attacks or radicalising vulnerable people online\".\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon said officers had made 185 arrests across more than 800 live investigations during the pandemic - \"stopping three possible terror attacks in the process\".\nHe said as lockdown eases, \"there will be greater opportunity for terrorists to operate\".\n\"We want the public to join the police, security staff and retail workers in a collective community effort to minimise the chance of attack,\" he added.\nIn February, the UK's terrorism threat level was downgraded from \"severe\" to \"substantial\", which means an attack is still likely.\nMr Haydon also warned of a \"worrying trend\" of children under the age of 18 being arrested for terrorism-related activities.\nThis age group was the only one that saw an increase - rising from 11 to 17 in total, Home Office data showed.\n\"That is a total of 10% of all arrests, which has risen from just 4% in the previous 12 months,\" said Mr Haydon.\nPolice have launched a website and helpline to offer advice and support for families to prevent young people becoming involved in terrorism, he said."

      "text": "Great British Bake Off presenter Noel Fielding and Ryan Giggs' brother Rhodri are among the latest people to accept \"substantial damages\" over phone-hacking by tabloid journalists.\nNews Group Newspapers (NGN) apologised for \"distress\" caused by the illegal interception of voicemails.\nNGN's paper, News of the World, was closed down in 2011 after years of phone-hacking came to light.\nHundreds of celebrities and members of the public have since won compensation.\nMr Fielding's solicitor, Alex Cochrane, told a court hearing in London on Thursday that the Mighty Boosh and Never Mind The Buzzcocks star had identified a number of articles published between 2006 and 2010 which he claimed contained his private information and were \"suspicious\".\n\"During this time, Mr Fielding used his voicemail extensively and he would regularly receive and leave voicemail messages for his family and close friends,\" Mr Cochrane told the court.\n\"It was alleged that the publication of the articles generated distrust which impacted his relationships and caused him considerable distress.\"\nOther victims who settled their claims at the hearing are:\nSolicitor Callum Galbraith, whose firm Hamlins represented everyone at Thursday's hearing apart from Mr Bisson, said: \"Getting as full an understanding of NGN's unlawful acts is critical to many of our clients, but equally many want a full and proper apology acknowledging the considerable distress and lasting damage caused. These public apologies achieve that.\"\nNGN's barrister, Ben Silverstone, said the defendant offered its \"sincere apologies\" to the claimants \"for the distress caused to [them] by the invasion of [their] privacy by individuals working for or on behalf of the News of the World.\n\"Such activity should never have taken place,\" he added. \nNews of the World, which was owned by Rupert Murdoch, obtained stories by listening in to the private voicemail messages of celebrities and even the murdered teenager Milly Dowler.\nThose who have already settled their cases for undisclosed sums include singer Sir Elton John and actress Elizabeth Hurley.\nCombined with legal costs, the bill for NGN - which is also the publisher of the Sun newspaper - has run into hundreds of millions of pounds.\nThe publisher has never admitted liability in relation to alleged phone-hacking at the Sun.\nThere are about 50 phone-hacking claims against NGN remaining in the latest round of litigation, with a trial for some lead cases set to go ahead in November.\nIn the past few years, several trial dates have been set only for claims to be settled at the last minute.\nLawyers representing alleged phone-hacking victims say that, aside from the cases already in the system, many more could yet be brought before the courts."

      "text": "The amount the government has to spend on state pensions will fall by \u00a31.5bn by 2022, partly because of over-65s dying of Covid, forecasts suggest.\nThe government will also receive an extra \u00a30.9bn from inheritance tax, partly due to Covid-related deaths.\nThe figures have been published by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the government's fiscal watchdog.\nIt said it had \"revised up our assumption for excess deaths this year and next relative to November\".\nMore than 144,000 deaths involving Covid-19 have occurred in the UK since the start of the pandemic, figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show.\nThe majority of coronavirus deaths have been among people aged over 65, many of whom will have been receiving the state pension.\nThe OBR estimates spending on the state pension will fall by \u00a3600m in 2020-21 and \u00a3900m in 2021-22 compared with forecasts made before the pandemic.\nThe watchdog said the forecast for lower state pension spending was partly because of the weaker outlook for average earnings growth, which lowers the effect of the yearly triple lock uprating. \nBut it added that excess deaths due to the pandemic have also reduced the number of people receiving pensions.\n\"With virus-related deaths rising sharply again in recent months, we have revised up the number of excess pensioner-age deaths in 2020-21 from 90,000 in our November forecast to around 100,000 in this one,\" the OBR said in its Economic And Fiscal Outlook, which is published alongside the Budget.\nIt has increased its forecast because: \"Higher virus-related deaths in the current wave of the virus have outweighed the effect of lockdown reducing deaths from other causes, particularly from influenza and other respiratory diseases\".\nMeanwhile the Treasury predicted that inheritance tax receipts will increase from \u00a35.1bn in 2019-20 to \u00a36bn in 2021-22, before falling to \u00a35.8bn the following year.\nThe rise in inheritance tax receipts is partly due to the freeze of inheritance tax thresholds until April 2026 announced in the Budget and the growth in the value of estates, but higher Covid-19 deaths will also contribute, the OBR said."

      "tags": "Department for Work & Pensions,Personal finance,Pensions",
      "text": "About 200,000 women could be in line for payouts averaging \u00a313,500 to top-up the underpayment of their state pension for up to two decades.\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) revealed details of the underpayments on Wednesday.\nThe errors focus on automatic cash increases for certain married women, widows and over-80s dating back to 1992 with \"enhanced\" pensions.\nThe DWP estimated the bill for tackling the shortfalls to be about \u00a32.7bn.\nThe underpayment relates to the \"old\" state pension system - affecting those who reached pension age before 6 April 2016 - which had special provisions for married women.\nUnder these old rules, married women who had a poor pension in their own right could claim a 60% basic state pension based on their husband's record of contributions.\nHowever, some of these pensions were not automatically increased when they should have been.\n\"The action we are taking now will correct the historical underpayments that have been made by successive governments, and anyone impacted will be contacted by us to ensure they receive all that they are owed,\" a spokesman for the DWP told the BBC.\nA review will now take place to assess hundreds of thousands of cases, which could take many months to complete. It will include cases where the underpaid retiree has since passed away. \nSome pensioners have already made successful claims for repayments, including Lynda Hallaway, who lives near Hull.\nAfter Mrs Hallaway, 74, and her husband John, 73, filled out claim forms, she received a call from the DWP. She was asked whether she was sitting down, before being told she was entitled to a payment of \u00a39,000.\nThey spent the money on their children and grandchildren, and on a holiday, but she says she imagines others, possibly in much greater need than her, will still not have received their payments.\n\"A lot could have been done with the money a few years ago. So I felt it was a great shame that they could not have that money,\" she said.\nThe issue was highlighted last year after former pensions minister, Steve Webb, tabled a freedom of information inquiry that revealed a large number of women were being paid state pensions below the expected rate.\n\"The scale of these underpayments is truly shocking. Whilst it is good that the government is now planning to address this issue, the plan to do so over five years is simply not fast enough,\" Mr Webb said.   \n\"It is also quite shocking that DWP plans to stop paying interest on these underpayments. If the government is going to fix these problems it needs to do so swiftly and fairly.\"\nThe DWP set up a special unit employing more than 100 civil servants to investigate the issue, and on Wednesday disclosed the full scale of the problem.\nThe scale of the underpayments came to light in the details of a report by fiscal watchdog the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) report which was published alongside the Budget.\nThe Department of Work and Pensions first became aware of issues with underpayments in 2020 and took immediate action to investigate the extent of the problem, pensions minister Guy Opperman told the House of Commons in a written statement on Thursday.\n\"This is an issue that dates back many years across successive Governments,\" he added.\nFrom August 2020 to January 2021 the DWP analysed millions of state pension records which helped identify cases requiring further investigation.\nThe DWP began a correction exercise on 11 January to examine each of the cases identified.\nThe cases fall into the following four groups:\n\u2022 People who are married or in a civil partnership who reached state pension age before 6 April 2016 and may be entitled to a Category BL uplift based on their partner's National Insurance contributions.\n\u2022 People whose spouse became entitled to a state pension following a change in the law in 2008. Some people should have had their basic state pension automatically reviewed and uplifted. Underpayments occurred in cases where this did not happen.\n\u2022 People who have been widowed and their state pension was not uplifted to include amounts they are entitled to inherit from their late husband, wife or civil partner.\n\u2022 People who have not been paid Category D state pension uplift as they should have been from age 80.\n\"Rectifying these cases is a priority for the department and we will do it as quickly as possible,\" said Mr Opperman."

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has promised to release a report into whether she breached the ministerial code on the same day that she receives it. \nIrish lawyer James Hamilton is examining whether Ms Sturgeon lied to the Scottish Parliament over the Alex Salmond saga. \nHe is expected to have finalised his report within the next three weeks. \nThe first minister has repeatedly refused to say whether she will quit if Mr Hamilton finds against her. \nBut the code states that any government minister who is found to have knowingly misled parliament will be expected to resign.\nAt First Minister's Questions, Ms Sturgeon was asked by new Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar whether she would give a \"cast-iron guarantee\" that Mr Hamilton's report into whether she lied to parliament would be released by the government \"without delay or obstruction on the day it is handed over.\"\nThe first minister gave the one-word reply: \"Yes\". \nMr Sarwar said he welcomed the first minister's answer, and pledged to hold her to that commitment.\nHe added: \"We need to remove party and personality from this.\n\"A minister - any minister - who is found in breach of the Ministerial Code should resign.\" \nIn her foreword to the ministerial code, Ms Sturgeon describes it as  \"guidelines for living up to the seven principles of public life: selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership.\"\nShe goes on to say: \"All Scottish ministers, including myself, are bound by its terms.\n\"I will lead by example in following the letter and spirit of this code, and I expect that ministers and civil servants will do likewise.\"\nMr Salmond has accused Ms Sturgeon of committing multiple breaches of the code - all of which she denies. \nThere have been claims that Ms Sturgeon misled parliament over when she first knew of the allegations against her predecessor, and that the name of a woman who made a complaint against Mr Salmond was disclosed to his former chief of staff.\nThere have also been accusations that Ms Sturgeon wasted more than \u00a3500,000 of public money by continuing a doomed legal fight with Mr Salmond over a judicial review into its handling of the complaints against him.\nThe government's legal counsel warned that it was likely to lose the case several weeks before it conceded defeat. \nThe legal advice was only released on Tuesday evening after opposition parties threatened to hold a vote of no confidence in Deputy First Minister John Swinney.\nSome additional documents were published by the government on Thursday after opposition parties questioned why they were missing from the original batch - with Mr Swinney suggesting more could be released on Friday.\nMr Swinney said the new documents showed that there had not been an attempt to delay the judicial review so that it would overtaken by criminal proceedings against Mr Salmond, as the former first minister has claimed. \n\"I have instructed officials to consider whether further documents should be released, subject to essential statutory checks and notifications, and to do so as a matter of urgency,\" he said. \nBut Mr Salmond later said the documents confirmed that postponing the judicial review was \"under active consideration\" by the Scottish government in September 2018.\nHe added: \"John Swinney must now be the only person in Scotland who believes that the piecemeal release of these extraordinary legal documents have done anything other than demolish the government's pretence that they were not warned months in advance that they were on course to lose the judicial review.\"\nMr Salmond was cleared of all of the allegations against him after a trial at the High Court in March of last year.\nConservative leader Douglas Ross said the \"limited\" release fell \"far short\" of the demands of parliament, which has voted on two previous occasions for the legal advice ahead of the judicial review case to be published in full.\nMr Ross said there were still no documents from November 2018 - two months before the government admitted it had acted unlawfully - and he called on it to \"end the secrecy and release all the legal advice\".\nThe investigation by Mr Hamilton is separate to the inquiry by a committee of MSPs into the government's unlawful handling of sexual harassment complaints against Mr Salmond. \nMs Sturgeon gave evidence to the committee in a marathon eight-hour session on Wednesday, with Mr Salmond appearing last Friday.\nThe Scottish Conservatives have already called on Ms Sturgeon to resign, despite neither of the inquiries having published their conclusions yet, and have threatened to hold a no confidence vote in the first minister. \nThere were angry exchanges over the affair at First Minister's Questions, with Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson claiming: \"There is no argument if Nicola Sturgeon broke the ministerial code - the argument is only about how badly she broke it.\"\nMs Sturgeon responded by saying she would wait for the inquiries to do their job, adding: \"I've not prejudged them - Ruth Davidson clearly has.\"\nMr Sarwar said the row between Ms Sturgeon and Ms Davidson showed \"the worst of Scottish politics\".

      "tags": "Keir Starmer,Regeneration,Budget 2021,Labour Party",
      "text": "Labour's leader has accused ministers of favouring Conservative areas for funding under a \u00a31bn scheme to boost struggling towns in England.\nSir Keir Starmer said regeneration money for 45 towns announced at the Budget \"looks fishy\" because the large majority are represented by Tory MPs.\nHe called for criteria for the allocations, made under the Towns Fund, to be published. \nBut Boris Johnson said the funding process was \"completely impartial\".\nThe prime minister added that it was \"just a basic electoral fact\" that more towns now have a Conservative MP after the December 2019 general election.\nOn Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced \u00a31bn for 45 towns under the Towns Fund scheme, which aims to help struggling areas. \nThey are among a total of 101 towns that are scheduled to share funding from the scheme, following a selection process that ended in September 2019. \nThe towns received varying amounts under the scheme, with a number receiving at or close to the \u00a325m maximum normally allowed. \nSpeaking on Thursday, Sir Keir said 40 out of the 45 towns had a Tory MP, adding: \"Lots of people would scratch their head and say, 'what is going on here?'\" \nHe said the funding announcement \"feels like pork-barrel politics\" - a term used to describe when politicians get funding for their area in return for voters' support.\n\"This should be going where it's really needed, and the government needs to publish the criteria for this,\" he told reporters.  \n\"If you end up with a list of 45 areas where the funding's going in, and by co-incidence 40 of them are where there's a Conservative MP, I think most people are saying 'what's going on here, this looks fishy.'\"\nAnalysis by Peter Barnes, the BBC's head of political research \nThere are 45 towns named but as some cover multiple constituencies, I've counted 56 constituencies that benefit.\nForty-seven are Conservative constituencies - including 14 gained from Labour at the 2019 election plus quite a few more recent Conservative gains, while nine are Labour constituencies.\nFifty-three of the constituencies voted \"leave\" at the EU referendum. Three voted \"remain\".\nIn a way that's not very surprising - Labour seats and \"remain\" areas are concentrated in cities - but it's still pretty striking.\nMr Johnson defended the process used to allocate funding to towns, on a visit to Teesside to promote the government's freeports scheme, also aimed at boosting neglected areas.\n\"One of the functions of the election clearly is that there are a lot of Conservative-represented towns. I think it's just a basic electoral fact,\" he said.\n\"I've asked about this, and I'm told that the criteria are entirely objective and they look at all sorts of data, poverty, employment and so on.\n\"We want to unite and level up across the whole country, we want to do it in a completely impartial way, so that's what we'll continue to do.\"\nHe added that if some areas \"feel that they've missed out\", the government will look at their case too.\nJake Berry, who represents Rossendale and Darwen in Lancashire, and chairs the Northern Research Group of Tory MPs, said Labour had \"let down\" voters in its former so-called 'Red Wall' seats. \n\"I doubt telling those same voters that the Conservatives are now fighting and delivering for them is going to win them back,\" he added. \nThe government has previously come under fire from MPs and the UK's spending watchdog over how the 101 towns were selected for the scheme.\nMinisters picked the towns from a pool of 541 places, which had been ranked by officials based on local need and growth potential.\nThey chose all 40 towns classed by officials as \"high-priority,\" then selected a further 60 places from the low and medium priority categories.\nBut the Commons Public Accounts Committee said it was \"not convinced by the rationales for selecting some towns and not others\".\nIn a report, it added that justifications offered by ministers for picking some areas over others were \"vague and based on sweeping assumptions\". \nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the selection process was \"comprehensive, robust and fair\".\n\"Proposals are assessed by officials - not ministers - in the order they are submitted and offers are based solely on the strength of the proposals assessed by officials at the department,\" they added.\nNorth East: Middlesbrough; Thornaby-On-Tees - \u00a346m\nNorth West: Preston; Workington; Bolton; Cheadle; Carlisle; Leyland; Southport; Rochdale - \u00a3211m\nYorkshire and the Humber: Wakefield; Whitby; Scarborough; Grimsby; Castleford; Goldthorpe; Scunthorpe; Morley; Stocksbridge - \u00a3199m\nEast Midlands: Newark; Clay Cross; Skegness; Mablethorpe; Boston; Lincoln; Northampton; Staveley; Mansfield - \u00a3175m\nWest Midlands: Wolverhampton; Kidsgrove; Rowley Regis; Smethwick; West Bromwich; Burton-upon-Trent; Nuneaton - \u00a3155m\nEast of England: Lowestoft; Colchester; Stevenage; Great Yarmouth; Ipswich; Milton Keynes - \u00a3148m\nSouth East: Crawley; Margate - \u00a343m\nSouth West: Swindon; Bournemouth - \u00a341m"

A government scheme that offers security will put a lot of young people at ease. \n\"The pandemic has definitely made me reconsider going to university. If it wasn't for the pandemic I'd be aiming to get some kind of part-time job and my education would be less effective. Although uni has been my main goal for sometime, the scheme has made me think about other options.\"\nPlaid Cymru Member of the Senedd Helen Mary Jones, who sits on the committee, said: \"In the past, we've seen what amounts to a lost generation - if you look back to the 1980s, we had young people who were out of work for two years. Those people are coming up to retirement age now and their lives are still affected by that economic shock all those years ago. \n\"So we want to make sure that that doesn't happen to this generation of young people, and we want the government to invest in ensuring that they get over this economic hump.\" \nShe told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers: \"It's very much about working with employers in the private sector, enabling them to bring young people on board, which perhaps they couldn't afford to do on their own and supporting them to do that.\"\nDr Sioned Pearce from the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research and Data (WISERD) at Cardiff University said young people have been hard hit and the Welsh government needed to get out of the \"employability narrative\" that is about getting a young person into work without thought about factors such as the nature of the work and the pay.\nShe said: \"In the UK as a whole, young people were two-and-a-half times more likely to be working in a sector that was shut down before the lockdown and in Wales that was three times more likely.\n\"So that's a really concerning picture, particularly when you take into account the long-term scarring effects of youth unemployment, even for short periods, not just on future earnings but on mental health, physical health relationships, and so on.\"\nShe said the situation has \"exacerbated issues of precarity\" for young people - with under-25s more likely to work with zero hour contracts, having to work part-time, or on low incomes.\n\"There is also the issue of deprivation in Wales which is longstanding. Wales receives a higher amount of European structural funding because of its high levels of deprivation - young people living in rural or valleys levels of Wales may find it particularly difficult, especially then with the coming withdrawal of EU funding post-Brexit.\"\nShe said Wales could look to examples in places such as Scotland and Sweden and \"challenge that work-first imperative and keeping the principle of no-one left behind in mind\". \nA Welsh Government spokeswoman said: \"We don't want anyone to be left behind. \n\"Our Covid commitment will create opportunities to retrain and upskill in new and high-growth areas and ensure support is on hand for anyone needing it, including helping young people to enter the labour market for the first time.\n\"We have set out a clear and ethical vision for the future that supports everyone in Wales.\"\nHave you found it hard to find work in the pandemic?

That means the point you start paying stamp duty will be \u00a3125,001:\nYou can use the government's Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) calculator to find out how much you will pay.\nThe stamp duty holiday definitely stimulated the housing market. \nUK house prices rose 8% in the year to July, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). \nThat followed a record increase of 13.2% in June, the biggest jump since November 2004. \nEstate agents reported a surge of interest in March as buyers and sellers rushed to complete property deals before the scheme was initially due to end. \nDemand continued when the holiday was extended until June and then again until September. \nHowever, there are many other reasons why house prices have been surging. \n\"The final closure of the stamp duty scheme at the end of September may have no impact at all,\" says Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agents Fine and Country. \n\"Other factors are so much more important, namely the race for space, low supply, accidental savings and low interest rates.\"\nFirst-time buyers do not have to pay any stamp duty on property purchases up to \u00a3300,000. \nHigh Street lenders are also offering mortgages to borrowers with a deposit of just 5%, under a government guarantee scheme which launched in April 2021. \nThe policy is designed to help more first-time buyers secure a home.\nThe new scheme is available to anyone buying a home costing up to \u00a3600,000, unless it is a buy-to-let property, a second home or, in some cases, a new-build.\nThe government's annual take from stamp duty is about \u00a312bn, according to latest HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) figures.\nThat's roughly equivalent to 2% of the tax the Treasury collects.\nThere were also similar tax cuts for house buyers in Scotland and Wales. \nIn July 2020, the starting point for land and buildings transaction tax (LBTT) in Scotland was increased to \u00a3250,000, but the concession stopped on 1 April, when the England and Northern Ireland holiday was originally due to end. \nIn Scotland, the current rates of Land and Buildings Transaction Tax are: \nScottish landlords pay an extra 4% Land and Buildings Transaction Tax on top of standard rates.\nThe Low-cost Initiative for First Time Buyers (LIFT) helps people buy their first property either on the open market, or from a council or housing association. \nIn July 2020, the Welsh government also increased the threshold for its land transaction tax (LTT) for people buying their main home to \u00a3250,000. It later extended the holiday until 30 June, with rates reverting back to normal from 1 July. \nThe current rates of Land Transaction Tax are: \nWelsh landlords pay an extra 4% Land Transaction Tax on top of standard rates.\nThe Welsh government runs various schemes to help people to buy a home.

      "tags": "Medical research,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,University of Oxford,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts.\nThe UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that \"adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine\".\nData from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now.\nThe risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. \nBased on the current data, the following is advised:\nThe MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIt found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April.\nThe MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate.\nAnd the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. \nIts head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was \"firming up\", more evidence would be needed. \nThe benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more \"finely balanced\".\nThe MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nPlatelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding.\nAmong these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT).\nCVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. \nAs a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke.  \nThe clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. \nThe MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice:\nCovid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA.\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clotting should be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect.\nAfter a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link.\nNevertheless, Denmark has stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - and Germany, Spain, Italy and Ireland have suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. \nFrance is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, while Australia says people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead.\nIt is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness.\nOnce injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus.\nExperts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. \nThe government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is \"plenty of evidence\" the vaccines appear to be effective against the Kent variant which is dominant in the UK.\nThere is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. \nHowever a study of around 2,000 people suggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease."

      "text": "Three earthquakes, including one of the strongest ever to hit the region, struck off the coast of New Zealand on Friday, triggering tsunami warnings that have now been stood down.\nThousands were evacuated from some coastal areas of the North Island after the third, 8.1-magnitude quake struck.\nThere were reports of traffic gridlock as people tried to reach higher ground.\nThe national tsunami warning was lifted at 15:43 (02:43 GMT), some 13 hours after the first quake.\nSome wave surges hit parts of the coast but, by Friday afternoon, authorities said the largest waves had passed. Residents were told they could return home but were warned to stay off beaches.\nThe South Pacific archipelagos of New Caledonia and Vanuatu have been warned to prepare for dangerous waves.\nTheir coasts could see wave surges as high as 3m (10ft), while parts of South America - including Peru, Ecuador and Chile - were warned they could see 1m waves reaching their coasts.\nThe Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said \"tsunami waves have been observed\", but as yet no damage had been reported.\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern posted on Instagram: \"Hope everyone is ok out there.\"\nThe three earthquakes, all above 7.0 magnitude, came during the early hours of Friday.\nThe last, at 8.1, struck at around 08:30 near the uninhabited Kermadec Islands, 1,000 km (621 miles) north-east of New Zealand.\nWhile earlier tsunami warnings had been called off, the third quake prompted the National Emergency Management Agency to send out a new alert and tsunami sirens sounded in some areas.\nThe agency told people near the coast in several areas to move immediately to high ground or get inland as far as possible.\nIt said \"strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges\" with tsunami activity continuing for several hours.\nLocal media reported gridlock in towns such as Whangarei and Whakatane as people tried to flee their homes, schools and workplaces.\nIn nearby Ohope town, resident Leslie Peake was quoted by the New Zealand Herald as saying the traffic was \"bumper to bumper\" with \"huge queues of people evacuating\".\nNew Zealand's civil defence department advised people to walk or cycle to avoid getting caught in traffic\nMeanwhile local media posted footage of waves rolling into Tokomaru Bay.\nJust last week, New Zealand marked the 10th anniversary of the 6.3 magnitude earthquake that destroyed parts of Christchurch in the south Island, killing 185 people.\nTsunami warnings were also issued for Hawaii and American Samoa, but later stood down.\nPatrick Ti'a Reid, 37, was among those in American Samoa, situated some 3,300 km (2,000 miles) north-east of New Zealand, who had been told to evacuate to higher ground in an emergency bulletin.\n\"Alarms went off in our executive office building and we immediately took for higher ground,\" Mr Ti'a Reid, who works for the government in the US territory, told the BBC.\nHe said the tsunami of 2009, which was triggered by an 8.1-magnitude earthquake, was \"very much vivid in many Samoans' minds\".\nAre you in the region?

      "tags": "Medical research,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "New Covid vaccines to fight variants like the one from Brazil can be fast-tracked through the approval system, says the UK's regulator the MHRA. \nCurrent vaccines may not work as well against some variants and scientists are working on updating them now. \nBut manufacturers will not need to seek brand new approval or do lengthy clinical studies. \nHowever they will need proof that the shots trigger protective antibodies in the blood.\nThe aim is to shorten the process, where possible, so that vaccine approval could happen in weeks and months, not years.  \nA similar fast-track method is already used for annual flu vaccines which regularly need updating to keep up with a virus that is constantly changing by mutating. \nThe MHRA has issued guidance, along with authorities in Australia, Canada, Singapore and Switzerland, on what checks and measures would be necessary. \nThe coalition of regulators - the ACCESS Consortium - insist no corners will be cut, with safety paramount. \nData from existing coronavirus vaccine trials and ongoing studies on real world use in the millions of people currently getting immunised could be used to support any decision by regulators. \nExisting Covid vaccines already in use - such as the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech one - were developed at incredible speed. The process took around 10 months, instead of a decade in normal times.\nMaking small and relatively simple tweaks to these vaccines to make them a better match for new variants should happen even more quickly.\nCurrent vaccines were designed around earlier versions of coronavirus, but scientists believe they should still offer some protection against the new variants being seen now.  \nIn the UK, public health officials are investigating six cases of the Covid variant first identified in Brazil and are using testing to see if it has spread to more people.\nSurge testing for the South African variant of Covid-19 began on 1 February.\nThe UK government has already announced a deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop vaccines against future variants, with a pre-order of 50 million doses.\nMHRA chief executive Dr June Raine said: \"We don't have evidence at this moment that any of the vaccines in deployment are significantly lacking in effectiveness.\n\"They're effective against Kent and we believe South Africa.\n\"We know that there has been some data from South Africa, we believe effectiveness here is maintained, and we're working hard on the Brazil variant.\n\"As of today there's no imperative that we fast-track a new variant-effective vaccine - but we are prepared.\"\nMHRA Chief Scientific Officer Dr Christian Schneider said: \"Our priority is to get effective vaccines to the public in as short a time as possible, without compromising on safety. Should any modifications to authorised Covid-19 vaccines be necessary, this regulatory approach should help to do just that.\"\nHe said the public could be confident that no vaccine would be approved unless the expected high standards of safety, quality and effectiveness were met.

      "text": "A marked decline in infections between January and February may have slowed, according to scientists tracking coronavirus in England.\nInfections fell by two-thirds over lockdown, but one in 200 people still have the virus.\nLower virus levels are needed to get the best out of the vaccination programme, Imperial College's React study says.\nSchools are reopening on Monday in England in the first easing of rules.\nBased on swab tests of a random sample of 165,000 people between 4 and 23 February, the study findings estimate that 0.5% of people in England had the virus - down from 1.57% in January.\nThe figures show \"substantial falls\" in household infections in all age groups and in most regions since early January, while lockdown restrictions have been in place.\nIt comes as official figures continue to show sharp falls in confirmed cases, hospital admissions and deaths linked to Covid-19 going back several weeks.\nBut the study found some evidence of smaller falls in infections in Yorkshire and the north-east, and apparent rises in London, the south-east and the Midlands - although this was based on only a few days' worth of data in February.\nAlthough the researchers say it's too early to detect the effect of the vaccination programme on rates of infection in the study, they stress the need to keep infections low while Covid vaccines are being rolled out.\nProf Steven Riley, from Imperial College London, said this was so people \"don't get infected before they get the vaccine\".\nMore than 20 million people across the UK have now received a first dose, with a target to invite all over-50s by mid-April and people in their 40s and 30s after that.\nTo reach the mid-April target, another 12 million people still have to be vaccinated.\nThe researchers say their findings highlight the need for people to continue to follow social-distancing guidelines while the remainder of the population receive their jabs.\nThe React study also found some workers were more likely to be infected than others. They included healthcare workers, care home workers and those working in education, nursery or childcare. \nPublic transport workers had the highest risk, being more than twice as likely as other workers to be infected.\nThose working at home were least likely to have the virus.\nAmong ethnic groups, the highest levels of infection in January and February were found in Bangladeshi people. There were also high infection rates among black, Indian and Pakistani people."

      "text": "As the country starts to emerge from lockdown, the impact it has had on the economy is becoming clearer.\nThe damage is enormous, but not as bad as feared last year, partly because the vaccines have been so effective.\nThe government has had to spend many billions of pounds to fight coronavirus and protect the economy. The lockdown has reduced the amount of money the government raises in taxes.\nThis has meant the government has had to borrow huge sums of money. \nIn the first year of the pandemic, from April 2020 to 2021, it borrowed \u00a3299bn, the highest figure since records began in 1946.\nThe government is expected to borrow less in the current year, April 2021 to 2022, though the figure could still be more than \u00a3200bn.\nOver \u00a3100bn is being spent on support for jobs, such as the furlough scheme, where the government steps in to pay most of workers' wages.\nThe NHS and other public services have been given extra money to pay for the costs of fighting the pandemic.\nHowever, the pandemic has reduced the amount the government raises in tax. \nUnemployed or furloughed workers pay less income tax, businesses pay less tax if their profits are lower, and shoppers pay less VAT if they buy fewer things.\nWith more money going out and less coming in, the government has only one option - to borrow.\nThe pandemic will still mean more government spending and less tax coming in for years to come. \nAll of this means more borrowing.  \nNo-one knew how the pandemic would affect the economy so all predictions were full of uncertainty.\nIn recent months, however, the government has been borrowing less than expected as the economy starts to reopen. It has borrowed \u00a353bn this year, \u00a314bn less than forecast in March. \nAlso far fewer people will lose their jobs in the pandemic than had been feared.\nThe government cannot keep borrowing at this level forever, so it must find a way to cut spending or increase taxes. \nBefore it was elected in 2019, the government promised not to raise the rates of the three biggest taxes - income tax, National Insurance or value added tax. \nHowever, in March the chancellor announced measures which will increase most people's tax bills next year. \nThe amount you can earn without paying tax - known as the personal allowance - will stay the same from 2022 to 2026, instead of the usual small increases.\nThe amount people can earn before paying 40% instead of 20% will also be frozen. \nBusinesses will also pay more tax, as the rate of tax on their profits - corporation tax - will rise from 19% to 25% in 2023. \nSpending in some areas, such as schools and the NHS, has been protected - and it would be difficult to reduce health spending after a pandemic. \nState pensions, another big spending item, are protected by the so-called triple lock, which guarantees they rise with workers' earnings, prices, or 2.5% every year - whichever is highest. \nThe Conservatives promised to keep this, but earnings are rising very fast as they bounce back after the pandemic, which could make it a very expensive pledge to honour next year.\nLast year, the chancellor announced some measures to reduce public spending, such as a controversial decision to freeze pay for many public sector workers.\nHe also cut the amount the UK spends on overseas aid, despite an election pledge to keep it at 0.7% of national income.\nUntil recently, the government has been able to borrow easily at very low interest rates, which has made its debt more affordable.\nAt the moment it pays just 0.77% interest to borrow for 10 years. \nIt's still low but interest rates have been rising recently - and the higher they go, the harder it will be to support the UK's debt burden.\nAnd in any case, interest payments will weigh on future generations until the debt is paid off, meaning there is less money available for public services, or tax cuts."

      "text": "Amazon has opened a till-less grocery store in London - its first \"just walk out\" shop outside the US.\nVisitors to Amazon Fresh scan a smartphone app when entering and are automatically billed as they leave.\nThe store stocks hundreds of own-brand items as well as third-party products, and also serves as a place to collect and return goods bought online.\nCampaigners have raised privacy concerns but one retail expert said the opening marked a \"watershed moment\".\n\"Having a physical presence will enable Amazon to address some of its weaknesses, like the mounting cost of deliveries and returns,\" said Natalie Berg, an analyst with NBK Retail.\nBut she said she did not believe it would pose a threat to the major chains in the near term.\n\"Supermarkets have had a few years now to prepare and test their own checkout-free shopping concepts.\"\nAmazon's approach, however, promises a more \"frictionless\" experience than other retailers.\nVisitors only have to place an item in a bag or otherwise carry it out to be charged by the store, which is located at the street entrance of a shopping centre in the borough of Ealing.\nBy contrast, retailers including Marks and Spencer, Tesco and Sainsbury's require consumers to scan items into a smartphone or other device.\nThe US firm is so confident of its tech that it says shoppers are not under any obligation to check all the items were accounted for.\n\"When you're finished, you're free to walk out,\" said Matt Birch, director of Amazon Fresh Stores and an ex-Sainsbury's executive.\nThe technology involved was pioneered at the firm's similar Amazon Go stores in the States, which opened to the public in 2018.\nHowever, recent advancements mean the system can now cope with customers selecting from different bouquets of flowers, magazines and greetings cards - it could not distinguish accurately enough between one choice and another before.\nIt involves the use of hundreds of cameras and depth-sensors, and software developed using deep-learning artificial-intelligence techniques.\nHowever, it does not involve facial recognition. \nInstead, users must identify themselves on arrival by scanning a barcode displayed within their account on the standard Amazon Shopping app.\nOne civil liberties group has raised concerns.\n\"[It] offers a dystopian, total-surveillance shopping experience,\" said Silkie Carlo, from Big Brother Watch.\n\"Amazon's intense tracking of shoppers will create larger personal data footprints than any other retailer. Customers deserve to know how and by whom these records and analytics could be used.\"\nThe company has said it will only associate information collected in-store with a customer's Amazon account for up to 30 days, and has further details about how it uses the data on its privacy site.\nAmazon said it had sourced many of its own-brand groceries - including milk and eggs - from UK suppliers itself.\nIn addition, it has launched an \"Our Selection\" sub-brand for \"premium\" products including desserts.\nOther items come from Morrisons and Booths, supermarkets with whom its has pre-existing ties.\nThe store also contains a booth where orders can be delivered from its online store. \nAnd customers can return goods by scanning a code without having to repackage or relabel the item.\n\"Hand the product over and we'll do the rest for you,\" said Mr Birch, adding he plans further stores on some of London other high streets as well as its city centre.\nThe Ealing store's customer area covers about 2,500 sq foot (232 sq m) in total, which is much smaller than a typical supermarket.\nAmazon also operates seven Whole Foods Market supermarkets in the UK.\nAnd there have been persistent rumours that it might try to expand further in the sector by buying one of the larger chains.\nHowever, the company is also offering to sell its Just Walk Out technology as a service that can be installed in other companies' stores.\nAnd ultimately it might decide there is more money to be made pitching this to the established supermarkets than challenging them head-on with bigger stores of its own.\nAmazon has barely made a dent in the overall UK grocery market, but it's clearly got big ambitions for food. \nIt's been ramping up its online service, with free same-day deliveries for Prime members, putting pressure on rivals.  \nThe traditional supermarkets have been improving their technology over the past few years and the pandemic has accelerated the changes.  \nSainsbury's, for instance, has had a huge take-up in its SmartShop system where shoppers can pick up a handset and scan items as they go. \nAmazon technology removes checkouts and friction altogether. \nMoving into bricks and mortar is another milestone for Amazon. \nIts new range of own-branded products is also eye-catching. \nWhen it comes to convenience stores, being able to grab and go could prove very popular. But location is key. \nAnd most of the best convenience-store sites in densely populated, urban districts have already been taken. \nThis launch won't pose a big, immediate, threat to the big established grocers but they know only too well that Amazon has the potential to be a hugely disruptive force and has already forced them to up their game.

      "tags": "US Capitol stormed,Facebook,Donald Trump,Reddit,QAnon,GameStop",
      "text": "Reddit boss Steve Huffman has told BBC News he supported the aims of controversial sub-Reddit WallStreetBets.\nA long-time fan of the group, he said he had been slow in spotting its effect on GameStop's huge share-price spike in January. \n\"I was actually a little late to the party, because I didn't realise that Reddit had leaked into the real world again\", he said.\nGameStop's share price ended up reaching nearly $500 (\u00a3350) before falling. \nWallStreetBets had been hyping up the computer-game retailer's shares. \nThe idea was if enough Reddit users bought GameStop shares, they could drive up the price, hurting hedge funds who had bet against the company. \nSome claimed the group had collectively manipulated the market. \nBut Reddit decided to leave it up.\n\"We were... trying to keep WallStreetBets online,\" Mr Huffman said. \nWhen the media talks about the big social-media platforms - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram - Reddit is often ignored. \nBut as hedge funds learned during the GameStop share-price spike - ignore it at your peril.\nReddit likes to think of itself as different. \nAt its heart, it certainly feels more alternative.\nIts system of upvoting content mean ideas either fly or die. \nIt's not called the front page of the internet for nothing. \nMr Huffman has also had to deal with another big story this year  - conspiracy theories peddled by Donald Trump about electoral fraud. \n\"What do you do when the president doesn't live up to the ideals, like the principles of our country?\" Mr Huffman said. \nAn influential sub-Reddit called TheDonald was instrumental in hyping up Mr Trump across the internet. \nReddit banned it last year. \nMr Huffman told BBC News it was the most difficult moderation decision he had had to make.\nHuffman is one of handful of men in Silicon Valley - along with Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg - that make huge decisions on what we can and can't see on the internet.  \nThe following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\nWhen did you first come across WallStreetBets?\nSo I've known about WallStreetBets for years. \nWallStreetBets is, in fact, one of my guilty pleasures on Reddit. \nHow much was the group about having a laugh?\nA lot of it, as I think it's the cornerstone to a lot of friendship and human experience. \nAt the end of the day, this community is fun and it's funny. \nAnd obviously, there's some cohesion there, talking about the trades. \nWhen did you start realising WallStreetBets was having an impact on GameStop's share price?\nSo I think I was actually a little late to this, because I've been on WallStreetBets for a while. \nAnd they've been talking about GameStop for a while. \nAnd so on WallStreetBets, there's often a couple of stocks or companies or positions that have their attention. \nAnd so over the years, it's been Tesla. \nIt's been Virgin Galactic. \nIt's been Blackberry.\nIt's been different things. \nAnd so, in my mind, I'm just browsing Reddit and OK, yeah, GameStop's got their infatuation right now. \nSo I was actually a little late to the party, because I didn't realise that Reddit had leaked into the real world again. \nAnd so it was, I think, really at the the take off of the mania when I was like: \"OK, this is a bigger one.\"\nThen there was that crazy period where the GameStop share price went from $20 to $400. What was going through your mind at that point?\nYou know, I love reading business stories.\nI love reading books about investors and their successes and failures. \nSo it's just a topic I'm interested in. \nI just thought it was a fascinating story.\nAnd it's such a smart thing to do.\nAnd I, personally, have found it a fair thing to do. \nSo you were always supportive, like ideologically, of what the group was doing?\nYes, because I think if you've got one transaction where one group has taken an extreme position and then another group can see that opportunity that maybe they've overextended themselves. \nObviously, there's a lot of risk there. \nBut I think everybody goes in that situation aware of that risk. \nThe shares at one point got almost up to $500 a share. At that point, was there any pressure on you to maybe lock down WallStreetBets?\nWe faced that question, like that literal question: \"Should you do something?\"\nBut our motivation, or what we were trying to do in that situation, was actually the opposite - to keep WallStreetBets online.\nSo you decided: \"This needs to stay up\"?\nThe question of should it go down or not was a very fast conversation.\nAnd we were, you know, confident that that community was well moderated and well within our content policy. \nAre you proud of what WallStreetBets managed to achieve?\nI am always, I think, proud when people do amazing things. \nAnd so I think maybe pride isn't even the right word. \nI think I'm happy or encouraged when humans come together to do something incredible. \nDo you think that it was a David-and-Goliath story?\nOh, absolutely, because, you know, institutional investors have so much.\nThere's so many more resources in terms of knowledge, relationships, the ability to execute large trades.\nNo individual could have done this. \nAlthough hedge funds wage war on each other all the time, we never see it. \nAnd so to see a group of individuals kind of band together against some really well resourced institutions, I think that's an intriguing story from any angle.\nSome people lost a lot of money. Do you feel any responsibility? \nI think any trade, not just risky ones like WallStreetBets, has risk. \nBut it also has opportunity. \nI think there are two things that are really important. \nOne is that individuals have that opportunity. \nI don't think we as a society should be so paternal to say that, well: \"This group is smart enough to make these decisions - but this group, you know, we should keep them out,\" because you're not just protecting them from risk, you're eliminating their participation in the gains. \nDid the Capitol Hill riots make you reappraise the inherent goodness of the free internet?\nI'd be lying if I say that thought hadn't crossed my mind.\nBut we've seen, I think, on Reddit, the power of people to do, I think, the right thing generally.\nOne of the ways we look at Reddit, one of our duties, is to make sure the volume of any particular viewpoint is in proportion to the number of people who actually have it. \nAnd so that is to say we don't want a small number of loud people to have control beyond their numbers. \nAnd I think on Reddit we've gotten pretty good at that. \nI suppose you're wrestling with two things here. You don't want to get involved in censoring or overly censoring people?\nWe feel, I think, there's an enormous responsibility for getting that balance right. \nAnd, you know, we are learning, \nI think, along with everybody else, we do our very best because it's not just the right thing to do for our business - it's the right thing to do for our users. \nAnd I think it's the right thing to do generally.\nAnd, for example, the QAnon conspiracy theory, we saw that on Reddit and banned it three years ago, long before it metastasized online and in the real world. \nDo you think you should have done more on TheDonald? That's one of the criticisms of Reddit that comes up a few times. \nLook, TheDonald was a series of hard decisions. \nAnd there's never a hard decision that I don't, upon reflection, wish we had made faster. \nBut I think there's a matter of reality here - the principle of free speech was designed specifically to protect political speech. \nAnd so we went through a crisis not just at Reddit but in the United States and, I think, around the world of what do you do when the president doesn't live up to the ideals, like the principles of our country. \nThat's a real conflict. \nAnd so I think there's no way around that conflict.\nIs that the most difficult decision that you've had to make?\nI think it might be, yes, because the other ones were more matters of getting the words right. \nOther policy changes we've made over the years around, you know, violence or harassment or bullying or involuntary sexualisation, we always knew what our gut told us - what the right thing was. \nAnd so those were sometimes complicated because we had to figure out how to get there and how to kind of balance all of our values. \nBut we always knew where we wanted to go. \nI think with political speech, and in this particular moment, it was particularly challenging given the context of, like, the United States and the president of the United States being almost in conflict with each other.\nFake news, conspiracy theories, how do you stay on top of it? \nMisinformation is another word for propaganda. \nAnd propaganda is as old as politics. \nThis is not a new problem. \nAnd so, we've faced this problem in different forms over pretty much our entire existence. \nAnd so the solution, that we've seen, ultimately lies within people. \nIt lies within a free press. \nIt lies within access to information.\nIt lies within people being allowed to have good judgements and societal pressure to to be truthful, to behave well, all of these things. \nFinally, there are some pretty niche sub-Reddits. What are the oddest ones you've come across?\nOh, my goodness. \nBreadStapledToTrees is probably the weirdest one that I'm comfortable saying in an interview. \nAnd it's as the name implies.\nIt's literally pictures of bread stapled to trees. \nThere's another, I think, favourite around the office, CatStandingUp, which is just pictures of cats standing up. \nBut that one is very strictly moderated. \nSo every comment within every post in that community has to be the single word \"Cat\". \nWatch The News Explained - GameStop: to the Moon and Back on iPlayer"

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,NI Health,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There are too many complexities and uncertainties for the executive to publish the specific data it will use to take decisions over lockdown restrictions, Robin Swann has said.\nThe health minister also said he understood frustration after indicative dates were not included in the lockdown exit plan.\nSome businesses have criticised the lack of detail in the blueprint.\nBut Mr Swann insisted it was too soon to follow a calendar-led approach.\nThe executive will regularly assess the restrictions in place, with the next review scheduled for 16 March.\nThe factors for easing the lockdown include:\nOn Wednesday, four more coronavirus-related deaths were recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, binging its death toll to 2,063.\nA further 226 cases have been diagnosed. \nThere are 307 people with Covid-19 being treated in hospital, 31 of whom are in intensive care.\nThe health minister insisted it would be wrong to publish an indicative timetable for reopening, saying it was not yet the time for definitive dates. \n\"But some of those demanding a calendar-led approach now would be the first to shout if we gave them dates and then had to alter them because of the progression of the pandemic,\" he told a news conference on Wednesday,\n\"I would love to be able to announce a simple mathematical formula on how the data will determine all our decisions.\"\nBut Mr Swann warned that there was too much uncertainty, adding that he would not offer people \"false assurance\".\n\"I would rather maintain a steady pace than charge for the exit door and fall over,\" he said.\nNorthern Ireland was on a \"clear path to better times\", he said as he outlined the latest vaccination figures which show 545,019 people have now received their first jab.\nSome 37,862 people have received both doses. \nNorthern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer described the vaccine rollout as the breakthrough many had hoped for.\n\"It will permanently change the impact of the virus and increasingly lessen our dependence on some of the measures we have in place,\" said Dr Michael McBride.\n\"But no vaccine is 100% effective and will not protect everyone from this virus.\"\nThe Department of Health published a breakdown on Wednesday of first doses:\nThe department said many clinically extremely vulnerable people will be in the 65-plus age group, so are being covered in that section of the vaccination programme.\nUnlike English and Scottish plans, Northern Ireland's document does not have indicative dates. \nEarlier on Wednesday, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill also defended the plan.\n\"What we need now is a cautious and sustainable approach to allow businesses and the community and our families to get back together as quickly as possibly, but to do so in a way that's actually lasting that doesn't lead us back in this endless cycle of lockdowns,\" Ms O'Neill told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"There was a collective agreement at the executive yesterday that this pathway gives us the best chance to come out of the lockdown without having to go back into one.\"\nBut DUP MLA Paul Givan questioned the lack of indicative dates for easing restrictions.\n\"We need to know what the parameters are,\" he told a meeting of Stormont's Economy Committee on Wednesday.\nHis colleague Christopher Stalford said businesses needed greater clarity.\nSinn F\u00e9in MLA John O'Dowd said creating \"false dawns\", which cost businesses money and could also cost lives, was not the answer.\nThere are nine pathways set out by the executive:\nThe document then sets out the five-step sequencing of the executive plans to gradually lift restrictions on each of those sectors.\nRead the full pathway-to-recovery plan here.\nDUP First Minister Arlene Foster accepted on Tuesday the plan was \"not perfect\" but said she wanted to prevent any future lockdowns. \nThe lack of dates for reopening has been criticised by many business owners.\nColin Neill from Hospitality Ulster told Stormont's Executive Office committee he was disappointed the body's members were not consulted before the executive's plan was published.\nMr Neill said consultation could have meant industry representatives would have \"bought into\" the strategy, instead of being critical of the plan after its publication.\nHe also told the committee he has \"huge concerns\" about the structure of the high street task force, established by the executive to assist town centre businesses.\nMr Neill said its 30 person board will make decision making difficult.\nHe told MLAs \"the clock is ticking for our high streets\". \nSam Conley, a gym owner from Limavady, said: \"We don't want to get back to work too early, but we have been very patient and we feel very let down by this.\n\"Give us something to work with and then at least we can see some blue sky in this.\"\nJoe Dougan, promoter for SHINE Belfast who oversees major festivals like Belsonic and the Custom House Square gigs, said he welcomed the roadmap.\nBut he added: \"Just seeing what happening across the water in England, there has been a lot of positivity about the larger music festivals there that take place later in the summer. \n\"I think that we're holding out a lot of hope that we'll be able to stage some sort of outdoor entertainment this summer.\" \nWhat questions do you have about the Northern Ireland Executive's lockdown exit plan?\nWe'll answer them live during Thursday's Coronavirus Catch-up and this weekend on the BBC News NI

Three voted \"remain\".\nIn a way that's not very surprising - Labour seats and \"remain\" areas are concentrated in cities - but it's still pretty striking.\nThe plans that the Norfolk seaside town of Great Yarmouth has for its \u00a320m include job creation, supporting new homes and \"to tap into and grow a thriving arts and cultural scene\". \nChairman of the town deal board, Henry Cator, said the \"ambition [was] to realise a vibrant and inclusive coastal economy\".\nMeanwhile, Lincolnshire has five towns, as well as Lincoln, in the list to receive funding.\nJo Walker, assistant director for growth at City of Lincoln Council, said the \u00a319m it was due to receive would \"help make a significant difference in the city as we come out of lockdown and begin our recovery from the pandemic\".\nBut Mr Reynolds, the Labour MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, used the example of Greater Manchester and called decisions for where funds would go \"inexplicable\".\nHe said: \"A government serious about levelling up would look at things like council funding. It would look at the funding of the health service to address health inequalities in post-industrial areas.\n\"Instead what we seem to get are these pots from the chancellor dependent on giving money to backbench Conservative MPs, and I find that so frustrating and a misuse of public money.\"\nChallenged on the allocations at a Downing Street news briefing, Mr Sunak said that \"if you looked at all the things\" the government was doing it was \"benefitting people in every corner of the country\".\nNorth East: Middlesbrough; Thornaby-On-Tees - \u00a346m\nNorth West: Preston; Workington; Bolton; Cheadle; Carlisle; Leyland; Southport; Rochdale - \u00a3211m\nYorkshire and the Humber: Wakefield; Whitby; Scarborough; Grimsby; Castleford; Goldthorpe; Scunthorpe; Morley; Stocksbridge - \u00a3199m\nEast Midlands: Newark; Clay Cross; Skegness; Mablethorpe; Boston; Lincoln; Northampton; Staveley; Mansfield - \u00a3175m\nWest Midlands: Wolverhampton; Kidsgrove; Rowley Regis; Smethwick; West Bromwich; Burton-upon-Trent; Nuneaton - \u00a3155m\nEast of England: Lowestoft; Colchester; Stevenage; Great Yarmouth; Ipswich; Milton Keynes - \u00a3148m\nSouth East: Crawley; Margate - \u00a343m\nSouth West: Swindon; Bournemouth - \u00a341m"

      "tags": "Airbus Group,Scotch whisky,Scotch Whisky Association,UK-US relations,Trade",
      "text": "The US has agreed to suspend tariffs on UK goods including single malt whiskies that were imposed in retaliation over subsidies to the aircraft maker Airbus. \nTariffs will also be lifted on UK cheese, cashmere and machinery.\nThe duties will be suspended for four months while the two sides seek a long-term settlement.\nOn 1 January, the UK dropped its own tariffs on some US goods, put in place over a related dispute about US subsidies to Boeing.\nIt is the latest twist in a decades-old trade row that has seen the EU and the US target billions of dollars worth of each other's exports with taxes.\nThe UK is part of the dispute as a former EU member. Airbus makes wings and other parts in the UK, but assembles its commercial aircraft in the EU.\nIt has hit Scotch whisky producers particularly hard as the US is a key export market. Distilleries have reported \u00a3500m of losses since 2019 due to the tariffs. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the trade truce, due to come into force on Monday, would boost British business.\n\"From Scotch whisky distillers to Stilton-makers, the US decision to suspend tariffs on some UK exports today will benefit businesses right across the UK,\" he tweeted.\n\"Fantastic news as we strengthen the UK-US trading relationship and work to build back better from the pandemic.\"\nSimon Cotton, boss of Speyside-based textiles firm Johnston's of Elgin, says he's \"absolutely delighted\" the tariffs have been suspended. \nThe company, which employs 850 people, has been taking a \"25% hit\" on every knitwear product it exports to the US - \"a significant cost\" at a time when Covid and Brexit also pose challenges.\nIn Speyside many other businesses have felt the impact of the US tariffs, including whisky distilleries and shortbread makers. \n\"This has been a particularly difficult tax for the businesses here, so it's a huge relief for the region,\" says Mr Cotton. \"We're hoping this paves the way for a permanent removal of these tariffs.\"\nKaren Betts, head of the Scotch Whisky Association, called the suspension \"fabulous news\".\n\"The tariff on single malt Scotch whisky exports to the US has been doing real damage to Scotch whisky in the 16 months it has been in place, with exports to the US falling by 35%,\" she said.\n\"So today, everyone in our industry - from small companies to large - is breathing a sigh of relief.\"\nFor more than a decade, the EU and US accused each other of propping up their home aviation markets with tax breaks, research grants and other aid.\nBut tensions flared in 2019, when former US president Donald Trump retaliated by putting tariffs on $7.5bn (\u00a35.4bn) of EU goods, including UK products such as whisky.\nLast November, the EU hit back by targeting $4bn of American goods with duties as punishment for US subsidies for Boeing.\nSince it left the EU, the UK has been lobbying Washington to drop the duties on its goods as it seeks a wide-ranging trade deal with the US. Talks with Washington abruptly broke off in January but resumed after Joe Biden became US president. \nMr Biden's top trade nominee, Katherine Tai, has said she will make it a priority to resolve the row with the EU and Britain - although for now US tariffs continue to apply to EU goods.\nIn a joint statement on Thursday, the UK and the US said that the suspension would \"ease the burden on industry and take a bold, joint step towards resolving the longest-running disputes at the World Trade Organization\".\nThe two countries added that it would also allow time to focus on negotiating \"a balanced settlement to the disputes, and begin seriously addressing the challenges posed by new entrants to the civil aviation market from non-market economies, such as China\".\nAirbus welcomed the removal of \"lose-lose tariffs\" and urged the UK and US governments to reach a long-term settlement. \nMore than \u00a3500m-worth of whisky sales have been lost since October 2019, when the 25% tariff was introduced on single malt Scotch. Smaller distillers were hit hardest.\nThe US is the biggest single-nation export market by value. President Trump's US Trade Representative reckoned it was a good source of political leverage in the 17-year trade dispute over aircraft manufacturing.\nScottish cashmere sweaters were also targeted. In the political calculation of trade disputes, the US did not include Irish whiskey or Italian cashmere, giving them the opportunity to exploit the rift and grow market share.\nIt was not until last autumn that the European Union and the UK won the right, at the World Trade Organisation, to hit back over Boeing subsidies by US governments. That levelled the field on which to negotiate a resolution. \nDonald Trump used trade tariffs as a bludgeon intended to protect American jobs, and although Joe Biden is not noted as an enthusiast for globalisation and free trade, this suspension of tariffs signals his administration is in the business of negotiated deals between partners.\nIt acknowledges the trans-Atlantic partners should perhaps focus more on manufacturing competition from China. But there is work to be done: the EU, UK and US have not only the Boeing/Airbus dispute to resolve, but another one over steel and aluminium, which explains the 25% tariff currently on imported American whiskey.\nFor Liz Truss and the UK government's attempts to secure post-Brexit trade deals, this is a significant step forward. It seems the Biden administration is not prioritising the European Union ahead of Britain. However, a UK-US free trade deal is a long way from here."

The suspect moved to Sweden in 2018, local media said.\nAccording to the local police chief, he was previously known to law enforcement agencies but was only suspected of \"petty crimes\", AFP news agency reports.\nPrime Minister Stefan Lofven said the \"horrific violence\" was a reminder of \"how frail our safe existence is\".\n\"We face these despicable actions with the combined force of the community,\" he posted on Facebook. \nPolice say investigations are ongoing into whether there is a terror motive linked with the attack. This is at odds with prosecutors, who earlier said terrorism had been ruled out.\nOfficers raided an apartment in Vetlanda, believed to be the man's home. They took away evidence and spoke to neighbours.\nExtra police officers have been put on patrol in the area.\nFive different crime scenes, a few hundred metres apart, were identified, local police chief Jonas Lindell said.\nOne eyewitness, florist Asa Karlqvist, told local newspaper Vetlanda-Posten: \"We heard a scream from the street. Then we saw a man enter the store, shouting that he had been stabbed. \n\"Blood was pouring from his shoulder, so we got towels and applied pressure on the wound.\"\nThe suspect was shot and arrested within minutes of the first emergency call.\nLocal resident Olivia Strandberg told SVT she had seen from her window the suspect being taken away.\n\"I had just gotten to my apartment when my best friend wrote me and said, 'Don't go out!'\" she said.

      "text": "Street artist Banksy has confirmed he was behind the artwork that appeared on the wall of Reading Prison on Monday.\nThe picture shows a prisoner - possibly resembling famous inmate Oscar Wilde - escaping on a rope made of bedsheets tied to a typewriter.\nIt comes as campaigners continue to lobby for the former jail to be turned into an arts hub rather than being sold for housing.\nThe guerilla artist confirmed the work through a video on his website.\nThe clip - entitled Create Escape - shows the piece being created under the cover of darkness, set to archive commentary from American painter Bob Ross. \nThe Ministry of Justice said it was \"aware that Banksy has confirmed he is responsible for the graffiti\".\n\"We are considering next steps and will provide an update in due course,\" it added.\nReading Borough Council said Banksy's involvement suggested he was backing the campaign to save the prison.\nIt said: \"We are thrilled that Banksy appears to have thrown his support behind the council's desire to transform the vacant Reading Gaol into a beacon of arts, heritage and culture with this piece of artwork he has aptly called Create Escape. \n\"The council is pushing the Ministry of Justice, who own the site, to make suitable arrangements to protect the image.\"\nMatt Rodda, the Labour MP for Reading East, said there was a \"growing sense of excitement\" in the town since the artwork had been confirmed as real.\nThe Save Reading Gaol campaign tweeted: \"We're thrilled to hear it is, after all, a Banksy! \n\"Thanks to the elusive artist & their team. We are incredibly grateful. Your support & gift to the town will be appreciated for many years to come!\"\nToby Davies, the artistic director for Rabble Theatre in Reading, described it as \"fantastic\".\nHe said: \"It adds real kudos to the whole campaign to have someone who knows a thing or two about culture take a risk and come and do this on a Ministry of Justice building.\n\"It is phenomenal, it really displays how much it means to people.\n\"Whenever I speak to people, not just those in the culture world but those who walk past it every single day, they get very emotional about it.\"\nHe added: \"Reading has never had the opportunity to have a go at an international culture centre that brings people together.\n\"It should be a bubbling centre of UK culture but it isn't and that's because we've never been given a chance.\n\"If there was ever a chance then this is it and it won't come again.\"\nMr Davies said having created the piece during lockdown would have been a \"significant personal risk\" for Banksy.\n\"It speaks volumes. He could have gone to wider issues around the world, there are plenty of them, but he has come to Reading to highlight this.\"\nThe jail famously housed Wilde between 1895 and 1897 and was immortalised by his poem Ballad of Reading Gaol during his stay, which reflected on the brutality of the Victorian penal system.\nHe was convicted after his affair with Lord Alfred Douglas was exposed.\nThe prison has been derelict since 2013 and was put up for sale by the government in 2019.\nHowever, a deal to sell the Grade II-listed building to developers fell through last year and Reading council said it hoped to revive its bid to turn it into an arts complex.\nHollywood actors Sir Kenneth Branagh, Natalie Dormer and Dame Judi Dench are among the stars who have lent their support to the campaign.\nBanksy expert and vice-chancellor of Arts University Bournemouth, Prof Paul Gough, said the artwork could possibly be about the future use of the building or commentary on what is happening with news media and Facebook.\u00a0\nHe said: \"It's probably one of Banksy's less well-known features is that he has in the past donated quite a lot of work to what he thinks are charitable causes.\u00a0\n\"So to give a piece of work to an organisation or at least in the interest of art has happened before - he's painted pictures on the side of youth clubs or in organisations he wants to be seen lending a hand.\u00a0\n\"So there is a charitable arm to Banksy, which doesn't get written about or get celebrated very often.\"\nHe added: \"I think it's terrific for art, public discourse, and draws attention to a brick wall - a lovely brick wall - that normally people would walk straight past, so it helps you see your public realm in different ways.\" "

The government is hoping to avoid class closures when schools reopen after the summer holidays. \nThe EU authorised the use of the Pfizer vaccine in children aged 12-15 at the end of May. \nGermany said it would give it to those aged 12-17 with pre-existing conditions while a number of other EU countries said they would vaccinate children before the start of the next academic year.\nIn June 2020, all 27 member states joined a scheme giving the EU central responsibility for buying vaccines.\nHowever, the EU was slower than the UK to negotiate a contract with AstraZeneca and there were supply problems.\nIts deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna also saw early problems with production and distribution.\nIn February, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the EU's vaccine difficulties, saying: \"We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time.\" \nIn January 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all age groups, but a number of EU countries initially refused to recommend its use for people over 65.\nFrance and Germany eventually revised their stance and approved the vaccine for 65-74 year olds at the beginning of March.\nThey were again among 13 European countries who paused the AstraZeneca rollout again later in March, following reports that a small number of people developed blood clots after receiving the jab. \nOn 7 April, the EMA said there was a \"possible link\" between the vaccine and the clots, although it is still recommended the jab for all age groups. \nSeveral EU countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands now say only people over 55 or 60 should get the jab, while others like Denmark have suspended its use altogether. \nThe headlines surrounding AstraZeneca led to a drop in confidence in the jab. In March, the polling company YouGov suggested that only a third of Germans and 23% of French respondents considered it safe.\nThe EU took AstraZeneca to court to force it to deliver more doses of vaccine. The company blamed production problems but said it had \"fully complied\" with its contract.\nThe EU lost its legal battle. It had wanted AstraZeneca to deliver 120 million doses by the end of June but a court ruled that the company must instead provide 80 million doses by the end of September. \nThe EU said the UK has had an unfair advantage in contracts it signed with vaccine manufacturers, some of whom have plants in the EU.\nEU leaders considered a ban on exports of vaccines to the UK but decided not to introduce one.\nInstead, they called for more transparency from the UK and other countries on the number of doses they export.\nThe EU says that by 1 June 2021, it had exported 245 million doses to 46 different countries. \nUnder the terms of the EU scheme, member states are not supposed to strike deals with any vaccine manufacturer with whom the EU already has an agreement, but they can make separate deals with vaccine makers which have not signed agreements with the EU.\nHungary has been using Russia's Sputnik vaccine for months and and Slovakia has also bought doses of it.\nGermany said in April it would begin talks to secure supplies of the Russian vaccine and Austria said it would buy one million doses, but only once the EU's medicines agency approves the jab for use in the EU. \nThe Czech Republic and Poland have entered talks with both Russia and China.\nThe UK approved the Pfizer vaccine in November 2020, nearly three weeks before EU regulators. \nThe government claimed that being outside the EU allowed it to be more nimble in this area. \nHowever, the UK's approval of the vaccine would have been permitted anyway under EU law - a point made by the head of the UK medicines regulator.\nThe UK could have joined the EU vaccine scheme last year while it was still in a transition phase with the EU, but it chose not to. \nIf it had, the UK might not have been able to do as many deals with vaccine companies."

      "text": "Amazon has opened a till-less grocery store in London - its first \"just walk out\" shop outside the US.\nVisitors to Amazon Fresh scan a smartphone app when entering and are automatically billed as they leave.\nThe store stocks hundreds of own-brand items as well as third-party products, and also serves as a place to collect and return goods bought online.\nCampaigners have raised privacy concerns but one retail expert said the opening marked a \"watershed moment\".\n\"Having a physical presence will enable Amazon to address some of its weaknesses, like the mounting cost of deliveries and returns,\" said Natalie Berg, an analyst with NBK Retail.\nBut she said she did not believe it would pose a threat to the major chains in the near term.\n\"Supermarkets have had a few years now to prepare and test their own checkout-free shopping concepts.\"\nAmazon's approach, however, promises a more \"frictionless\" experience than other retailers.\nVisitors only have to place an item in a bag or otherwise carry it out to be charged by the store, which is located at the street entrance of a shopping centre in the borough of Ealing.\nBy contrast, retailers including Marks and Spencer, Tesco and Sainsbury's require consumers to scan items into a smartphone or other device.\nThe US firm is so confident of its tech that it says shoppers are not under any obligation to check all the items were accounted for.\n\"When you're finished, you're free to walk out,\" said Matt Birch, director of Amazon Fresh Stores and an ex-Sainsbury's executive.\nThe technology involved was pioneered at the firm's similar Amazon Go stores in the States, which opened to the public in 2018.\nHowever, recent advancements mean the system can now cope with customers selecting from different bouquets of flowers, magazines and greetings cards - it could not distinguish accurately enough between one choice and another before.\nIt involves the use of hundreds of cameras and depth-sensors, and software developed using deep-learning artificial-intelligence techniques.\nHowever, it does not involve facial recognition. \nInstead, users must identify themselves on arrival by scanning a barcode displayed within their account on the standard Amazon Shopping app.\nOne civil liberties group has raised concerns.\n\"[It] offers a dystopian, total-surveillance shopping experience,\" said Silkie Carlo, from Big Brother Watch.\n\"Amazon's intense tracking of shoppers will create larger personal data footprints than any other retailer. Customers deserve to know how and by whom these records and analytics could be used.\"\nThe company has said it will only associate information collected in-store with a customer's Amazon account for up to 30 days, and has further details about how it uses the data on its privacy site.\nAmazon said it had sourced many of its own-brand groceries - including milk and eggs - from UK suppliers itself.\nIn addition, it has launched an \"Our Selection\" sub-brand for \"premium\" products including desserts.\nOther items come from Morrisons and Booths, supermarkets with whom its has pre-existing ties.\nThe store also contains a booth where orders can be delivered from its online store. \nAnd customers can return goods by scanning a code without having to repackage or relabel the item.\n\"Hand the product over and we'll do the rest for you,\" said Mr Birch, adding he plans further stores on some of London other high streets as well as its city centre.\nThe Ealing store's customer area covers about 2,500 sq foot (232 sq m) in total, which is much smaller than a typical supermarket.\nAmazon also operates seven Whole Foods Market supermarkets in the UK.\nAnd there have been persistent rumours that it might try to expand further in the sector by buying one of the larger chains.\nHowever, the company is also offering to sell its Just Walk Out technology as a service that can be installed in other companies' stores.\nAnd ultimately it might decide there is more money to be made pitching this to the established supermarkets than challenging them head-on with bigger stores of its own.\nAmazon has barely made a dent in the overall UK grocery market, but it's clearly got big ambitions for food. \nIt's been ramping up its online service, with free same-day deliveries for Prime members, putting pressure on rivals.  \nThe traditional supermarkets have been improving their technology over the past few years and the pandemic has accelerated the changes.  \nSainsbury's, for instance, has had a huge take-up in its SmartShop system where shoppers can pick up a handset and scan items as they go. \nAmazon technology removes checkouts and friction altogether. \nMoving into bricks and mortar is another milestone for Amazon. \nIts new range of own-branded products is also eye-catching. \nWhen it comes to convenience stores, being able to grab and go could prove very popular. But location is key. \nAnd most of the best convenience-store sites in densely populated, urban districts have already been taken. \nThis launch won't pose a big, immediate, threat to the big established grocers but they know only too well that Amazon has the potential to be a hugely disruptive force and has already forced them to up their game.

      "text": "The practical and economic consequences of Brexit will become real when the transition period ends at 23:00 GMT on Thursday.\nBut because of special arrangements for Northern Ireland, it will have a different experience from the rest of the UK.\nPeople born in Northern Ireland have the right to Irish as well as British citizenship.\nThose who exercise that right will retain their EU citizenship, something not available to people elsewhere in the UK who may have only British citizenship. \nThe consequences of this range from the mundane to the profound.\nPeople travelling on Irish passports will be able to use EU/EEA lanes and e-gates at airports.\nThose with British passports will not.\nMore fundamentally people with Irish passports keep their right to freedom of movement within the EU.\nThat means they can live, work and study in an EU country without a visa and with no time limit.\nThese rights extend to their spouses and dependent children.\nThe EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier explained this during a speech in Belfast in 2020.\n\"Whilst Northern Ireland will no longer be part of the EU, people born and raised here that choose to be Irish citizens will still be EU citizens,\" he said.\n\"This means they can continue to move and reside freely within the EU.\"\nThe UK will no longer be participating in Erasmus, the EU student exchange scheme.\nInstead, the UK government is setting up its own scheme, known as Turing.\nHowever, students at Northern Ireland's universities will still be able to take part in Erasmus due to funding and administrative assistance from the Irish government.\nIreland's Higher Education Minister Simon Harris said: \"The government of Ireland made a very solemn commitment to Northern Ireland that, even after Brexit, we would make sure that there were still ways for us to co-operate and collaborate in relation to higher education.\"\nFunding will be available to all full-time students attending third level institutions in Northern Ireland.\nIt will not be limited to those with an Irish passport, so British passport holders will also qualify.\nBusinesses across the UK will still be able to sell their goods to the EU without tariffs being imposed.\nThis is due to the trade deal reached between the EU and UK on Christmas Eve.\nBut businesses in GB will face a range of new non-tariff trade barriers such as paperwork, certifications and checks on goods as they enter the EU.\nNorthern Ireland will not face these non-tariff barriers as it will effectively remain within the EU's single market for goods.\nThis is a consequence of the NI Protocol, a special deal to prevent the re-emergence of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nAs an example, a lorry load of Northern Ireland meat products could board a ferry at Dublin port and disembark at a French port with no new paperwork or checks.\nHowever, if a similar load was travelling from Scotland to France it would need to be accompanied by new export health certificates and the authorities would need advance notice of its arrival.\nIt would have to go to a border control post where the load may be physically examined.\nThere is a significant flipside to this: new trade barriers within the UK.\nThat lorry load of Scottish meat could be driven to Cardiff or London without any new checks or controls.\nBut when entering Northern Ireland it is as if it is entering the EU.\nSo it will need to undergo all the same bureaucracy and checking as when it was entering a French port."

      "text": "The UK's Competition and Markets Authority has launched an investigation into whether Apple's terms for app developers are anti-competitive.\nIt follows a series of complaints, including a high-profile one from Epic Games, the developer of Fortnite.\nSome developers are unhappy that they are forced to distribute apps to iPhones and iPads via the App Store, and the commission Apple takes.\nApple said its terms were \"fair and equal\".\nThe investigation will consider whether Apple has a dominant position in the distribution of apps on its devices and look at whether it imposes unfair terms on developers.\nAndrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA said: \"Millions of us use apps every day to check the weather, play a game or order a takeaway. So complaints that Apple is using its market position to set terms which are unfair or may restrict competition and choice - potentially causing customers to lose out when buying and using apps - warrant careful scrutiny.\"\nIn response, Apple said: \"We believe in thriving and competitive markets where any great idea can flourish. The App Store has been an engine of success for app developers, in part because of the rigorous standards we have in place - applied fairly and equally to all developers - to protect customers from malware and to prevent rampant data collection without their consent. \n\"We look forward to working with the UK Competition and Markets Authority to explain how our guidelines for privacy, security and content have made the App Store a trusted marketplace for both consumers and developers.\" \nEpic Games has launched a legal action against Apple and Google in the US, after both removed Fortnite from their smartphone app stores.\nThe row centred on the up to 30% cut both the tech giants take when people buy an app, subscription or in-app item on the Apple App Store or the Google Play store, as well as the difficulty in launching a mobile app without submitting to both companies' app store rules.\nIn August Epic bypassed the Apple and Google stores to let Fortnite players buy virtual currency at a lower price, directly from it, resulting in an immediate ban from both stores.\nThe row has attracted the attention of both regulators and politicians.\nArizona's state House of Representatives passed a law this week which prohibits Apple and Google, and any other app store exceeding one million downloads, from demanding developers based in the state exclusively use its app stores.\nThe law also covers users living in the state, but it is not yet clear how it will affect companies headquartered in other states but conducting sales in Arizona. It will now be handed to the state Senate for approval.\nIn Europe, Apple is facing two investigations into whether it has broken competition rules, one of which relates to its app store policies."

      "tags": "Rishi Sunak,Economic growth,UK economy,Budget 2021,UK national debt",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned that a spending spree to support workers and spur investment will be followed by tax rises as the economy recovers.\nThe UK's rapid Covid-19 vaccine rollout is expected to help the economy get back to its pre-pandemic size six months sooner than previously expected.\nOfficial forecasts expect growth to hit 4% this year, while an extension of the furlough scheme will limit job losses.\nMr Sunak said future tax hikes were needed to stop \"irresponsible\" debt.\nThe government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said the UK had been at the \"vanguard\" of the discovery of new and effective vaccines.\nIt said this will foster a \"swifter and more sustained\" economic recovery, with the pace of growth expected to strengthen to 7.3% in 2022.\nThis would be the highest growth rate since official records began in 1949 and help the economy to return to its pre-pandemic size in the middle of next year.\nMr Sunak unveiled plans to spend tens of billions of pounds more over the next two years to support the economic recovery, including tax breaks designed to encourage business investment. \nHowever, the chancellor said tax rises were also needed to help repair the public finances.\nMr Sunak announced that corporation tax will rise from 19% to 25% for large companies in 2023, while day-to-day spending by government departments will be cut by a further \u00a34bn a year.\nMr Sunak said it would be \"irresponsible to allow our future borrowing and debt to rise unchecked\".\nChris Sanger, head of tax policy at EY, described the Budget as \"three years of support, followed by three years (and more) of pain\".\nMr Sanger added: \"Time [is] the Chancellor's friend in his aim of replenishing the Government's coffers.\" \nThe government's target to have all adults vaccinated this summer is expected to pave the way for the lifting of public health restrictions.\nThe OBR noted that British households had built up a savings war chest of around \u00a3180bn in the past year.\nIt expects a quarter of this to be spent as lockdowns end, saying there could be a \"degree of euphoria\", especially among better-off households who \"treat themselves\" when the economy opens up.\nThe main thrust of this Budget is significant extra immediate crisis support, both in terms of the furlough scheme and self employed support, and a radical \"super-deduction\" policy to encourage business investment right now.. That is \u00a360bn extra in one year and it comes from borrowed money. That leaves borrowing in the coming financial year significantly higher than expected. A much larger proportion of the exceptional world war-style borrowing over the past year will stay in place in the coming year.\nThe happy result of this is that unemployment, though rising, peaks at a much lower level than previous expectations, just over 6%, rather than, say, 10%. This is a consequence of both the vaccine rollout and the support package, leading to a reopening of the economy over summer.\nThe jabs and then the jobs. But then the payback, with a massive rise in \u00a316bn corporation tax and the \u00a38bn changes to thresholds for the last two years of the Parliament. The Conservative manifesto commitments on not increasing VAT, income tax or national insurance are binding here. \nSo Rishi Sunak is left with the first rise in corporation tax since Dennis Healey's 1974 Budget. It turns a careful strategy of using corporation tax as a lever for foreign investment on its head. For many in the vanguard of the Conservative Brexit movement, very low levels of this tax were one of the building blocks of \"Singapore-on-Thames\". Singapore is staying in South East Asia.\nThe timing of this tax rise at the end of a Parliament is not the normal order of things. But the Covid pandemic is far from normal. \nHowever, the watchdog warned that economic uncertainty remained \"considerable\", and would depend on controlling variants of the virus.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the chancellor was \"betting on a recovery fuelled by a consumer spending blitz\".\nHe added: \"The chancellor may think that this is time for a victory lap, but I'm afraid this Budget won't feel so good for the millions of key workers who are having their pay frozen, for the businesses swamped by debt, and the families paying more in council tax.\"\nUnemployment is expected to peak at a lower rate of 6.5%, keeping it well below levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis.\nHowever, this means half a million more people are expected to be out of work by the end of this year.\nGovernment borrowing is expected to rise to a peacetime high of \u00a3354.6bn this year to help pay for economic support measures.\nThe size of the UK's debt pile is also expected to remain larger than the economy until at least the middle of the decade.\nMr Sunak said: \"It's going to take this country - and the whole world - a long time to recover from this extraordinary economic situation. But we will recover.\"\nFrom April, he will also freeze the amount of money employees earn before paying income tax at \u00a312,570 until the middle of the decade.\nThe OBR estimates an extra 1.3 million people will start to pay income tax by 2026 as a result of the freeze.\nThe level at which employees start paying the higher, 40% rate of tax will also be frozen at \u00a350,270 from April, dragging an extra million people into the band within five years."

      "text": "Labour's leader has accused ministers of favouring Conservative areas for funding under a \u00a31bn scheme to boost struggling towns in England.\nSir Keir Starmer said regeneration money for 45 towns announced at the Budget \"looks fishy\" because the large majority are represented by Tory MPs.\nHe called for criteria for the allocations, made under the Towns Fund, to be published. \nBut Boris Johnson said the funding process was \"completely impartial\".\nThe prime minister added that it was \"just a basic electoral fact\" that more towns now have a Conservative MP after the December 2019 general election.\nOn Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced \u00a31bn for 45 towns under the Towns Fund scheme, which aims to help struggling areas. \nThey are among a total of 101 towns that are scheduled to share funding from the scheme, following a selection process that ended in September 2019. \nThe towns received varying amounts under the scheme, with a number receiving at or close to the \u00a325m maximum normally allowed. \nSpeaking on Thursday, Sir Keir said 40 out of the 45 towns had a Tory MP, adding: \"Lots of people would scratch their head and say, 'what is going on here?'\" \nHe said the funding announcement \"feels like pork-barrel politics\" - a term used to describe when politicians get funding for their area in return for voters' support.\n\"This should be going where it's really needed, and the government needs to publish the criteria for this,\" he told reporters.  \n\"If you end up with a list of 45 areas where the funding's going in, and by co-incidence 40 of them are where there's a Conservative MP, I think most people are saying 'what's going on here, this looks fishy.'\"\nAnalysis by Peter Barnes, the BBC's head of political research \nThere are 45 towns named but as some cover multiple constituencies, I've counted 56 constituencies that benefit.\nForty-seven are Conservative constituencies - including 14 gained from Labour at the 2019 election plus quite a few more recent Conservative gains, while nine are Labour constituencies.\nFifty-three of the constituencies voted \"leave\" at the EU referendum. Three voted \"remain\".\nIn a way that's not very surprising - Labour seats and \"remain\" areas are concentrated in cities - but it's still pretty striking.\nMr Johnson defended the process used to allocate funding to towns, on a visit to Teesside to promote the government's freeports scheme, also aimed at boosting neglected areas.\n\"One of the functions of the election clearly is that there are a lot of Conservative-represented towns. I think it's just a basic electoral fact,\" he said.\n\"I've asked about this, and I'm told that the criteria are entirely objective and they look at all sorts of data, poverty, employment and so on.\n\"We want to unite and level up across the whole country, we want to do it in a completely impartial way, so that's what we'll continue to do.\"\nHe added that if some areas \"feel that they've missed out\", the government will look at their case too.\nJake Berry, who represents Rossendale and Darwen in Lancashire, and chairs the Northern Research Group of Tory MPs, said Labour had \"let down\" voters in its former so-called 'Red Wall' seats. \n\"I doubt telling those same voters that the Conservatives are now fighting and delivering for them is going to win them back,\" he added. \nThe government has previously come under fire from MPs and the UK's spending watchdog over how the 101 towns were selected for the scheme.\nMinisters picked the towns from a pool of 541 places, which had been ranked by officials based on local need and growth potential.\nThey chose all 40 towns classed by officials as \"high-priority,\" then selected a further 60 places from the low and medium priority categories.\nBut the Commons Public Accounts Committee said it was \"not convinced by the rationales for selecting some towns and not others\".\nIn a report, it added that justifications offered by ministers for picking some areas over others were \"vague and based on sweeping assumptions\". \nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the selection process was \"comprehensive, robust and fair\".\n\"Proposals are assessed by officials - not ministers - in the order they are submitted and offers are based solely on the strength of the proposals assessed by officials at the department,\" they added.\nNorth East: Middlesbrough; Thornaby-On-Tees - \u00a346m\nNorth West: Preston; Workington; Bolton; Cheadle; Carlisle; Leyland; Southport; Rochdale - \u00a3211m\nYorkshire and the Humber: Wakefield; Whitby; Scarborough; Grimsby; Castleford; Goldthorpe; Scunthorpe; Morley; Stocksbridge - \u00a3199m\nEast Midlands: Newark; Clay Cross; Skegness; Mablethorpe; Boston; Lincoln; Northampton; Staveley; Mansfield - \u00a3175m\nWest Midlands: Wolverhampton; Kidsgrove; Rowley Regis; Smethwick; West Bromwich; Burton-upon-Trent; Nuneaton - \u00a3155m\nEast of England: Lowestoft; Colchester; Stevenage; Great Yarmouth; Ipswich; Milton Keynes - \u00a3148m\nSouth East: Crawley; Margate - \u00a343m\nSouth West: Swindon; Bournemouth - \u00a341m"

      "title": "Brexit: What's the Northern Ireland Protocol?",
      "tags": "NI Brexit,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Brexit,Trade",
      "text": "A Brexit deal, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, is at the centre of a dispute between the UK and the European Union (EU).\nSince it came into force at the start of 2021 the protocol has disrupted trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK has suggested it could suspend parts of the arrangement by triggering part of the protocol known as Article 16.\nThe protocol allows lorries to deliver goods without having paperwork and goods checked when they cross the border from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland.\nThis arrangement was easy to maintain before Brexit. When both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were part of the EU, they automatically followed the same EU trade rules, which meant no checks were required.\nHowever, a new arrangement was needed after Northern Ireland (along with the rest of the UK) left the EU. The EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods, such as milk and eggs, arrive from non-EU countries. Similar rules exist in other areas, such as medicine licensing. \nTo try to get round the problem the UK and the EU negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is now part of international law.\nRather than checks taking place along the Irish border, it was agreed any inspections and document checks would take place between Northern Ireland and  Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) instead.\nThis was allowed after it was agreed that Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU rules on product standards (part of the EU's single market rules). \nChecks on GB goods take place at Northern Ireland ports to make sure they comply with EU laws. However, this has led to criticism that a new trade border has effectively been created in the Irish Sea. \nUnionists are strongly opposed to the checks because they don't want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK.\nAlso, not all checks under the protocol have been fully implemented yet. For example, supermarkets had reduced paperwork required under a temporary \"grace period\". However, the UK decided to extend these periods - something the EU said was a breach of international law. \nDespite signing up to the agreement in 2019, the UK government now says the protocol represented a huge compromise by the UK and has accused the EU of applying it too rigidly.\nThe UK is calling for changes, which include:\nArticle 16 is a set of three paragraphs in the protocol that allows either side to suspend any part of the agreement that causes \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\".\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss - now the UK's lead Brexit negotiator - said she would trigger Article 16 if the UK failed to secure changes.\n\"I want a negotiated solution but if we have to use legitimate provisions, including Article 16, I am willing to do that,\" she wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.\nIf the UK went down this route, it could prompt the EU to respond with measures that would impose tariffs (or import taxes) on aspects of trade between the two sides.\nThe EU has warned that any such move would \"lead to instability and unpredictability\".\nThe EU has set out proposals, but says a renegotiation of the text of the Protocol is out of the question:\nIn return, the EU wants extra safeguards to prevent products from Great Britain crossing into the Republic of Ireland.\nThe border is a sensitive issue because of the history of Northern Ireland and the agreements made to bring peace, which included the removal of visible signs of the border.\nThe fear is that if any infrastructure were to be installed, such as cameras or border posts, it could become a target and lead to political instability.\nDuring negotiations, all sides agreed that protecting the 1998 Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority."

      "tags": "HM Treasury,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Budget 2021,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled more support for workers and businesses struggling with lockdown in his first Budget since the pandemic was declared.\nThe furlough scheme will be extended to September - along with higher universal credit payments.\nBut taxes on large company profits will rise in 2023 and a million more people will start paying income tax.\nIt will take the UK's tax burden to its highest level since the 1960s, said the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Budget measures to salvage the UK's Covid-ravaged economy were \"nowhere near ambitious enough\".\nIn his Budget speech, Mr Sunak said unemployment will be lower - and growth higher - than previously thought as the UK emerges from lockdown later this year, citing forecasts from the OBR watchdog.\nBut he warned that repairing the long-term economic damage \"will take time\", with the economy in five years' time predicted to be 3% smaller than it would have been without the pandemic.\nDespite the \u00a3280bn of support already committed to protecting the economy, the harm done by coronavirus had been \"acute\", he told MPs.\n\"Our economy has shrunk by 10% - the largest fall in over 300 years. Our borrowing is the highest it has been outside of wartime.\n\"It's going to take this country - and the whole world - a long time to recover from this extraordinary economic situation. But we will recover.\"\nThe headline rate of corporation tax will go up from 19% to 25% from 2023, although smaller firms will be exempt.\nAnd the freeze on income tax thresholds is expected to bring 1.3 million more people into paying income tax - and a million more into paying at the higher rate.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Budget is set to raise an extra \u00a329bn by 2025-26, which was \"big by recent standards\".\nAnd it added that the UK's tax \"burden\" is set to rise to its \"highest sustained level\" ever.\nIFS director Paul Johnson said: \"Mr Sunak made much of his desire to be honest and to level with the British people.\n\"The fact that he felt constrained to raise taxes by hitting companies and through freezing allowances, rather than through more explicit rises in people's taxes, suggests there are limits to how far he wants to level with us, as he attempts to raise the overall tax burden to its highest sustained level in history.\"\nThere has been a lot of give, and there will be a lot of take.\nBusiness will, in time, pay billions more. More than a million people will have to start paying income tax, and a million extra will pay at a higher level.\nThe deeply strange circumstances of the pandemic have turned the party with a theoretical love of low taxes into a government that will crank them up significantly in practice.\n\"Honest Rishi Sunak\", as he hopes to be represented, has chosen his determination to start dealing with the cost of Covid over the Tories' traditional backing for low taxes.\nBoxed in by election promises, he has chosen two huge future money raisers.\nDespite those hikes, and the hundreds of billions spent on Covid, public spending overall is still set to contract.\nThe chancellor extended the furlough scheme to September, paying up to 80% of people's wages - and announced further grants for self-employed people, with the scheme widened to include 600,000 who were not previously entitled, including many newly self-employed people.\nHe also extended the \u00a320-a-week top-up to universal credit for six months.\nOther Budget measures include:\nAll alcohol duties will be frozen, which Mr Sunak said would help pubs and restaurants recover, and there will be no increase in fuel duty. But duty on cigarettes will go up by 2%, plus inflation.\nThe reduced 5% VAT for the hospitality and tourism sector will be extended for six months to 30 September, and will not return to the full standard rate of 20% until April next year.\nMr Sunak also announced that 750 civil service jobs at the Treasury will be transferred to Darlington, in the north-east of England, and there will be more than \u00a31bn shared out among 45 struggling towns in England.\nAt a post-Budget Downing Street press conference, Mr Sunak vowed to protect people and businesses \"well beyond the end of lockdown\", and to build a \"fairer and more just\" country in the memory of those who have lost their lives to coronavirus.\nIt comes as the latest government figures on Wednesday showed a further 315 people had died with coronavirus in the UK within 28 days of a coronavirus diagnosis, and there were another 6,385 confirmed cases.\nMr Sunak hit back at critics who say the business tax hike will choke off recovery, saying it will \"still be the lowest out of the G7 economies,\" including the US, France and Germany.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Budget did nothing to \"fix the NHS and social care\", reduce inequality or create more affordable homes.\n\"The scale of what the chancellor announced today is nowhere near ambitious enough,\" he told MPs, and he claimed Mr Sunak was \"itching to get back to his free-market principles and to pull away support as quickly as he can\".\nThe SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said furlough should be in kept place \"as long as businesses and devolved governments need it\".\n\"This Budget is carefully laying the ground for more Tory austerity, a decade more of Conservative cuts,\" he told MPs.\nLiberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine warned that the universal credit top-up will end at the same time as furlough, meaning people could lose their jobs and not receive the extra help they will need.\nPlaid Cymru said it was a \"Budget of half measures and quick fixes\", and not making the universal credit uplift permanent would \"lead to 26,000 families in Wales not being able to afford essentials in six months' time\".\nHow will you be affected by this year's Budget?

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,NHS Wales,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A large rise in Covid vaccine supplies means more jabs should be delivered than ever before from next week, Wales' chief pharmacist has said.\nAndrew Evans has revealed that more than 30,000 doses a day could be administered across the country.\nFigures suggest one million people are likely to have had at least a first vaccine dose within the coming days.\nA total of 942,017 people in Wales have been given a first jab, while 124,781 have now been given the full course.\nThe four UK nations are aiming to vaccinate all adults by the end of July.\nRamping up of deliveries to Wales follows a slowdown during the past fortnight, largely caused by an planned reduction in the Oxford-AstraZeneca supply.\nMr Evans, the Welsh government's chief pharmaceutical officer, said supply increases would allow Wales to \"continue to lead\" other UK nations on vaccine roll out, with teams focused on \"keeping it that way\".\nThe acceleration, he said, could also lead to more vaccination centres being opened and, along with GP surgeries, an increasing number of pharmacies being used.\nIf the momentum continues, Mr Evans said he was confident the milestone of offering a first jab to priority groups five to nine could be met by mid-April.\nHe suggested about 20,000 first doses and 10,000 second doses could be offered each day from next week.\n\"There's capacity within our programme to go as fast as supplies allow,\" he said. \n\"It's been low for the last couple of weeks but it's significantly higher this week - between 150,000 to 160,000 doses - next week we could be back up to in excess of 200,000 - a capacity we know the NHS vaccination programme here has.\n\"We've already been building the vaccination infrastructure with at least 500 locations used at any one time and the increasing availability of the AstraZeneca means more flexibility and allow us to use it in more places.\"\nAlmost 4% of the population in Wales has been given a second vaccine dose - higher than any other UK nation - and Mr Evans suggested the NHS here could continue to \"lead the pack\".\nOn the issue of whether booster vaccines will be needed, he said there were plans being made for \"various scenarios\".\n\"We don't yet know how long the duration of protection the two doses will give. If booster doses are needed later in the year or next year then we will have a plan to deliver those,\" he said.\nSpeaking later to BBC Radio Wales, he added that \"very very few people\" were refusing the vaccine. \n\"Our uptake rate is in excess of 90% for the older groups, in excess of 85% has we come down through those cohorts. There is very little vaccine hesitancy,\" he said.\nResponding to the increase in pace of delivering jabs, Tracy Meredith, head of mass vaccination at Cardiff and Vale Health board, said \"get ready for the boom\".\nThe health board has plans to open an even bigger mass vaccination centre, although the location is not yet known.\n\"We're looking at an addition, looking at something bigger, big in scale, a big space. That's a good position to be in,\" she added. \nThere's a quiet efficiency about the process at the mass vaccination centre in Splott, Cardiff.\nAs people arrive, with their all-important appointment cards in hand - they are guided immediately to a booth, where one of about 20 vaccinators is waiting.\nThe centre has capacity to inoculate 20 people every 10 minutes, compared to four people every 15 minutes in the early days. Which means, subject to supply, 1,320 people can get a Covid jab here every day.\nStudent nurses are part of the effort, having been trained to give the vaccine.\nBeth Reed-Gibbs said she was \"absolutely loving\" being part of the team that offers hope of a way out of the pandemic.\n\"People getting the vaccine are mainly excited, some were a bit anxious for the first dose but now they know there's nothing to worry about.\"\nBarbera Phythian, another student nurse vaccinator, shares that excitement: \"Some people I've given the vaccine to have been shielding for a year.\n\"So they are anxious about seeing people for the first time. But it's honestly a relief for them and they are really grateful to us, which is an amazing feeling.\"\nThis week, ahead of schedule, the centre has also been giving a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine to health and care workers.\nThey include Kim Nash, an essential worker for Cardiff's children's services, who has had her appointment sooner than she was expecting. \n\"I was originally booked in for April, so it's great that so many people are coming through... it means extra security for me and my family.\"\nAlthough ministers have insisted the vaccination effort is not a \"race between nations\" but rather a \"race against the virus\" Mr Evans said the relative speed of roll out here was \"a great thing\" for public protection.\n\"If we're leading the pack we're leading the race against the virus. If we're ahead against everyone else we must be ahead against the virus - that will mean more people protected and that's a great thing for people here,\" he added.\nHe also welcomed research this week that suggested just a first dose of either of the Covid vaccines available in the UK offers significant protection against serious illness, especially in older people. \nNurse Carys Williams, who ensures the flow of people through the vaccination centres remains smooth, knows more than most how crucial this effort is, having been a nurse in intensive care during the first Covid wave.\n\"Before being a supervisor here I was a nurse at critical care at UHW in Cardiff. I did that for 32 years, but unfortunately after the first wave I felt that I needed to change,\" she said.\n\"It was heart-breaking to be honest, it really was. I felt that I just needed to get away after that long and I didn't feel I could give anymore.\n\"I feel every jab I give I think we're making a contribution to lessening the pressure on the NHS and getting us to some kind of normality hopefully, pretty soon.\""

The gap in their schedule also allowed BTS to record their second album of the year, which they billed as a \"letter of hope\" to fans.\nThe record contained Dynamite - their first single to be recorded entirely in English, which topped the US charts in August, after breaking one-day streaming records in the US.\nDynamite also earned BTS a Grammy nomination in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category, alongside stars like Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift.\nFrances Moore, chief executive of IFPI, said: \"BTS are a global phenomenon. They have had another outstanding year... and [are] continually finding creative and engaging ways to share their story with the world.\n\"They truly show the power that music has to bring joy and happiness to people the world over.\n\"We would like to congratulate RM, Jin, Suga, J-hope, Jimin, V and Jung Kook and we are excited to see what they have in store next.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Spending reviews,Public sector,Employment,Pay",
      "text": "Some 1.3 million public sector workers will see a pay freeze next year, but low-paid and NHS staff will get raises \nChancellor Rishi Sunak said he could not justify across the board rises when many people in the private sector had seen cuts in pay and hours. \nHowever, he said 2.1 million public sector workers earning below the median wage of \u00a324,000 were \"guaranteed a pay rise of at least \u00a3250\".\nMore than a million NHS workers will also get a raise, he said. \nMeanwhile, the minimum wage - which has been rebranded as the National Living Wage - will increase by 2.2% - or 19p - to \u00a38.91 an hour, with the rate extended to those aged 23 and over. \nThe pay freeze, which was trailed in unconfirmed news reports last week, has sparked anger from unions which say it will affect key workers who have played a vital role during the pandemic. \nDelivering his Spending Review, the chancellor said the \"majority\" of the UK's public sector workers will see their pay increase in 2021.\nBut he added that pay rises for the rest - about 1.3 million out of a total of 5.5 million public sector workers - will be paused \"to protect jobs\". \nHowever, that figure only covers 1.3 million people working for the central government. The total rise could be much higher if local government and devolved pay agreements are frozen.\nHe highlighted a disparity between public sector and private sector wages, adding he \"cannot justify a significant, across-the-board\" pay increase for all public sector workers in the circumstances.\n\"Instead, we are targeting our resources at those who need it most,\" he said. \nJohn Apter, chairman of the Police Federation union, called the pay freeze a \"kick in the teeth\" for police officers.\n\"Rewarding those who have played a vital role in the fight against the virus with a pay freeze is nothing short of a disgrace,\" he said.\n\"A handful of officers will get the additional \u00a3250 for the lowest paid workers, but only those who are already on an appallingly low starting salary for the dangerous job they do.\"\nDame Donna Kinnair, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said nursing staff would oppose plans to freeze the pay of equally skilled professionals. \n\"Those working in social care and the community deserve a pay boost as much as their NHS colleagues.\"\nDr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the chancellor had delivered a \"body blow\" to staff in schools and colleges.\n\"Education workers are key workers who have kept the country going during the pandemic but pay cuts are their only reward from this government.\"\nTeacher Esme says she is not surprised the government is freezing pay for many workers.\n\"Clearly money will need to be clawed back from the damage to the economy, however the concern is how long for?\" \nShe says it will have \"quite an impact\" on her as someone fairly new to the profession, after what has been an \"incredibly challenging year in education\". \n\"After getting barely any support, the proposal to freeze pay is another confirmation that the government has very little appreciation or respect for the profession, or those working within it.\"\nAt the end of last year, the Low Pay Commission - which advises the government on the National Living Wage wage - had said the rate would rise by 6% in April 2021. \nBut the commission has revised this down amid fears it would cost struggling businesses too much and damage jobs. \nMr Sunak said the plans would mean the average full-time worker on the rate will see their annual income rise by around \u00a3345 next year. \n\"Compared to 2016 when the policy was first introduced, that's a pay rise of over \u00a34,000,\" he added.  \nHe added that around two million people would benefit from the widened eligibility for the National Living Wage. \nBryan Sanderson, chair of the low pay commission, said: \"Recommending minimum wage rates in the midst of an economic crisis coupled with a pandemic is a formidable task.\n\"We have opted for a prudent increase which consolidates the considerable progress of recent years and provides a base from which we can move towards the government's target over the next few years.\""

Do you have any questions for our experts?\nMr Sunak's tax threshold freeze means about 1.3 million people will start paying income tax for the first time - and about 10% of adults will be dragged into the 40% top rate.\nMr Sunak told the BBC the freeze was a \"progressive\" move which would ensure the people that earned the most paid the most adding \"it is a fair way to do what we need to do\".\nHe said: \"People's current take home pay won't be affected by this policy but it does mean the incremental benefits they would have experienced had the thresholds continued to rise with inflation won't be there.\"\nDuring his Budget, Mr Sunak announced that a weekly \u00a320 increase in universal credit - introduced last year to help those hit financially by the coronavirus pandemic - would end in September.\nTwo left-leaning think tanks, The Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Resolution Foundation, said the move would bring the incomes of benefit recipients down to levels not seen since the early 1990s.\nUniversal credit and income tax - as well as strains on government departments - are all going to cause issues for the government.\nBut social care is a real Achilles Heel. It's no good saying it's a problem all governments have failed to deal with. We have had a Conservative government for a long time now. \nMost can agree, behind the scenes in government, it is time for a change.\nSome in Westminster are also asking if raising corporation tax in 2023 points to an election that year. \nOne cabinet minister told me on Wednesday \"no comment\" when I asked if the 25% corporation tax would ever come into force.\nThey are going to have to raise an awful lot of money somehow, but it's hard to see where the economy will be in 2023, let alone in a few months' time.\nLabour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds warned that \"low-income families could be seeing a very difficult time in the future\".\nShe also expressed concern that the government would be \"planning to switch off its increase in social security right at the time when we anticipate a peak in unemployment\".\n\"That is not a sensible approach to take,\" she added.\nMr Sunak says the total package of measures to support the economy - including those previously announced - amounted to \u00a3407bn.\nBut he warned that this unprecedented spending could not continue.\nHis other big money raising move was to increase the tax on company profits from 19% to 25%, although it will not kick in until 2023 and smaller firms will be exempted.\nConfederation of British Industry director-general Tony Danker said the rise in corporation tax would \"cause a sharp intake of breath for many businesses and sends a worrying signal to those planning to invest in the UK\".\nThe government's own watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said the overall tax burden on the UK would hit 35% of national income by 2025-26, the highest level since the 1960s.\nMr Sunak told the BBC it was \"important we get our borrowing under control\" - and the UK would still have the lowest corporation tax rate in the G7 group of industrialised economies.\nHis has also faced criticism for failing to mention social care - an area where an existing funding crisis has been made more acute by the pandemic.\nIn 2019, Boris Johnson said he had ready a plan to fix social care but asked why it was not included in the Budget, Mr Sunak said the government was trying to find a \"cross-party solution\".\nHe said it was important to \"build consensus\" on the long-term future of social care but added that \"right now our focus is the pandemic\". \nLabour said ministers had not contacted them concerning any such plan.

      "text": "Former Coronation Street star Ryan Thomas has announced he is quitting acting, after having \"really lost the bug for it\".\nThomas starred as Jason Grimshaw in the Weatherfield-based soap from 2000 to 2016, before popping up in the Australian soap Neighbours.\nMore recently he was crowned as 2018's Celebrity Big Brother winner.\nSpeaking to the Mancs On The Mic podcast, Ryan admitted he had become tired of being rejected for roles.\n\"It's so hard for me,\" he said. \"I started off acting, I started off in that game and I really lost the bug for it.\n\"I feel the reason for losing the bug is rejection and going to auditions and not getting them.\"\nSpeaking to his brothers and podcast hosts, Adam Thomas - the former Waterloo Road and Emmerdale actor - and Love Island personality Scott Thomas, he added that receiving \"negative comments\" from trolls online had also influenced his decision.\n\"I've never had that before because social media wasn't around,\" he continued. \"I never got it in Corrie because I never had social media when I was in Corrie. If I did, it was at the end but I was so established there that people saw me as fixtures and fittings, so I never really got that sort of negative criticism.\n\"It happens in all aspects but I just found it really, really hard to deal with at first. I always think, 'Oh, it'll [the desire to act] come back at some point and maybe it will, and it's still something that I have in my locker if I want to explore it again. Right now I'm really happy with the direction I'm going.\"\nThomas first appeared in Coronation Street aged 16, with is character's storylines revolving around his love life, grieving for his father Tony and being attacked by his enemy Callum Logan. Jason Grimshaw became a suspect in the latter's murder, and ultimately left for Thailand.\nIn 2018, Thomas appeared as Rafael Humphreys in Neighbours' Hit & Run special.\nLater that year, Thomas's Celebrity Big Brother housemate Roxanne Pallett publicly apologised to him, saying she had \"overreacted\" when he \"punched\" her on the show. She said: \"I was sensitive and emotional and mistook what was playful - I apologise for it, I shouldn't have questioned his motivation.\" \nLast year, the three brothers confronted the issue of their absent father in an ITV documentary.\nThomas recently revealed on social media he is now doing food deliveries for Adam's restaurant, near Stockport.\nThe 36-year-old went on to say that making regular trips home to Manchester to also see his daughter Scarlett - whose mother is his ex-girlfriend and former Corrie colleague Tina O'Brien - had \"put a strain\" on his relationship with his fianc\u00e9e and former TOWIE star Lucy Mecklenburgh.\nThomas and Mecklenburgh live in Essex with their baby son Roman.\n\"There is that trying to find a mix of making both work, and working out where you're going to end,\" he said.\n\"I think eventually I'd like to be in Manchester with both my kids, but at the moment it's having that help at hand in London, it's just easier, but I think eventually I would love to be back where I started, with all my brothers and all our kids.\n\"I think that's what'll happen eventually but we're just taking it a day at a time. I think that's what you've got to do with this family life.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "tags": "Cash,Money,Personal finance,Budget 2021",
      "text": "The limit on a single payment using contactless card technology will rise to \u00a3100 later this year, the Treasury has confirmed.\nThe pandemic has accelerated a move away from cash, with shoppers often being encouraged to use contactless in many stores for public health reasons.\nIt has been less than a year since the limit was raised from \u00a330 to \u00a345.\nRegulators say businesses could still decide themselves whether to accept the higher limit.\nFears have also been raised regarding fraud risks involved in the use of cards.\nThe use of contactless technology by consumers has risen sharply in recent years, with more services adopting the technology and most shops offering it as an option.\nTo protect workers and consumers during the Covid outbreak, an increase to the current limit of \u00a345 was rushed through by the regulator in April last year.\nThe latest figures show that the proportion of contactless payments had fallen slightly compared with pre-pandemic levels, because lockdown measures hit the use of pubs, restaurants and public transport. They accounted for 41% of card transactions.\nHowever, there was a 16% increase in the total value of contactless payments in the UK in October, compared with the same month a year earlier, according to the latest data from UK Finance, which represents banks.\nThe amount spent on contactless hit a monthly record in August, boosted by the Eat Out to Help Out scheme and fewer coronavirus-related restrictions. A total of \u00a38.4bn was spent on credit and debit cards using contactless during that month.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"As we begin to open the UK economy and people return to the High Street, the contactless limit increase will make it easier than ever before for people to pay for their shopping, providing a welcome boost to retail that will protect jobs and drive growth.\"\nHowever, there have been worries raised about contactless limits being raised further.\nIan Johnson, managing director, Europe, at payment business Marqeta, said: \"The problem with increasing limits on physical contactless cards is if they are stolen or cloned, it will now be even easier for a fraudster to spend large sums of the victim's money in one go. \n\"Physical cards provide very little security and a fraudster could continue to use their contactless function until they are cancelled.\""

      "text": "Meghan Markle made her name as an actress, campaigner and blogger before marrying Prince Harry in May 2018 and becoming the Duchess of Sussex. \nBefore meeting Prince Harry, she had been best known for playing lawyer Rachel Zane in US TV drama Suits. \nWhen she became a member of the Royal Family, she gave up her acting career - and immersed herself in the life of a working royal, using the platform to highlight the charities and causes close to her heart. \nShe became a mother in May 2019 but within a year she and Prince Harry had stepped away as working members of the Royal Family and started a new life in North America.\nShe and Prince Harry had their second child, Lilibet \"Lili\" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, in June 2021.\nBorn Rachel Meghan Markle on 4 August 1981, she grew up in a prosperous part of Los Angeles.\nHer mother's home is in an area known as the \"Black Beverly Hills\".\nMeghan went to a private primary school in Hollywood and started campaigning for gender equality at an early age.\nAt 11, she wrote a letter to the then US first lady, Hillary Clinton, lamenting a washing-up liquid's TV ad strapline: \"Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans.\"\nWithin a month, manufacturers Procter and Gamble had changed the word \"women\" to \"people\".\n\"It was at that moment that I realised the magnitude of my actions,\" she later said. \"I had created my small level of impact by standing up for equality.\"\nAt 15, she was volunteering in soup kitchens as her studies continued at a girls' Roman Catholic college, and she graduated from Northwestern University School of Communication, near Chicago, in 2003.\nA stint working as an intern at the US embassy in Argentina made her think her path might lead her into politics, but she changed course when her acting career began to take off. \nBetween auditions, she has told of making money by doing calligraphy for wedding invitations, using skills developed in handwriting classes at school.\nHer father was a cinematographer on the hit 1980s show Married... With Children, and her first television appearance in the US was in an episode of the medical drama General Hospital in 2002, before moving on to roles in CSI, Without a Trace and Castle.\nThere were leading roles in TV movies such as When Sparks Fly and Dater's Handbook, and bit parts in Hollywood films including Get Him to the Greek, Remember Me and Horrible Bosses, and she was a \"briefcase girl\" on the US version of game show Deal or No Deal.\nShe also appeared in the sci-fi series Fringe, playing FBI special agent Amy Jessup, but her most famous role was in Suits.\nMeghan was in the show from its launch in 2011, but was written out in the finale of the seventh series. Fittingly, perhaps, she left after her character got married. \nIn real life, Meghan's union with Prince Harry wasn't her first marriage. In September 2011, she wed film producer Trevor Engelson, but the pair divorced two years later.\nIn September, it was reported that her ex-husband was producing a new TV show based on a man's custody battle with his ex-wife who marries into the Royal Family.\nIn 2014, she began writing about topics such as food, beauty, fashion and travel, as well as her own story, on her lifestyle website The Tig. \nMeghan said setting up the website was an attempt to \"reframe the beauty content to include think pieces about self-empowerment\" and feature dynamic, inspirational women.\nIn one post, she explained: \"I've never wanted to be a lady who lunches - I've always wanted to be a woman who works.\"\nThe site also carried candid blogs she wrote on every birthday. On turning 33 in 2014, she wrote: \"My 20s were brutal - a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as cool/as hip/as smart/as 'whatever' as everyone else.\"\nShe also grew a large social network profile, with 1.9 million followers on Instagram and more than 350,000 on Twitter. \nBut she shut The Tig in April 2017, and deleted her social accounts January 2018.\nHer media career has gone hand-in-hand with support for causes that are important to her. \nShe tackled the issue of the stigma around menstrual health in an article for Time magazine in March 2017 and was a global ambassador for World Vision Canada, which campaigns for better education, food and healthcare for children around the world.\nAs part of her role, the actress travelled to Rwanda for the charity's Clean Water Campaign. \nMeghan's commitment to gender equality has seen her work with the United Nations, and she received a standing ovation from an audience including UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon for a stirring speech on International Women's Day 2015.\nCommenting on how she combined acting with campaigning, she said: \"While my life shifts from refugee camps to red carpets, I choose them both because these worlds can, in fact, co-exist. And for me, they must.\"\nMeghan, whose father is white and mother is African-American, has also spoken about coming to terms with her racial identity. \nIn an article for Elle magazine, she wrote: \"While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. \n\"To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.\"\nIn late 2016, Prince Harry confirmed he was in relationship with Meghan - while issuing a statement accusing journalists of harassing her.\nThe pair had met on a blind date, organised by a mutual friend. After just two dates, they went on holiday together to Botswana.\nIn September 2017 Meghan told Vanity Fair magazine they were \"two people who are really happy and in love\".\nAnd in an interview that November, when their engagement was announced, Prince Harry admitted he had never heard of Meghan before his friend introduced them, and was \"beautifully surprised\". \nMeghan and Prince Harry got married at St George's Chapel, Windsor, on 19 May 2018.\nMeghan and Prince Harry embarked on their first royal tour together in October 2018 - visiting Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga over 16 days.\nThe trip coincided with the couple announcing they were expecting their first baby.\nThe duke and duchess followed in the footsteps of Prince Harry's parents - Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales - whose first royal tour was to Australia and New Zealand.\nIn September 2019, the couple undertook a 10-day tour of Africa, a continent that has always been particularly dear to Prince Harry's heart, leading to some speculation early in their marriage that they might at some stage choose to live there.\nMeghan met Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Sophia Williams-De Bruyn, as well as other key figures in South Africa's anti-apartheid movement.\nShe also made a speech to business people in Johannesburg in which she said such entrepreneurs had the power to change a world that seems \"aggressive, confrontational and dangerous\".\nBut by the end of the tour, the couple's talk about fighting injustice was being reported alongside news that they were beginning legal action against the Mail on Sunday for publishing a private letter sent by the Duchess of Sussex to her father.\nWhen Meghan gave birth to her son Archie Harrison - on 6 May 2019 - the reaction from the New York Times reflected the mass interest in the event around the world as it wrote: \"He is the first multiracial baby in the British monarchy's recent history, an instant star in a country where multiracial children make up the fastest-growing ethnic category.\"\nBut the royal couple had already decided to do things a little differently, underlining their determination not to follow the traditions of other recent royal births.\nIn advance, they chose not to reveal where the baby would be born and said there would be no running commentary of what was happening, instantly stopping the spectacle of the press pack joining the ranks of \"royal superfans\" camped outside a hospital for several days waiting for the first glimpse of the new royal.\nAnd the birth wasn't initially announced in the traditional royal way of  being posted on a placard outside Buckingham Palace. Instead, Prince Harry popped out of their home to tell the world (although the placard then followed).\nThe very private christening that followed just added to some media frustration that they could not, in their minds, fully report on one of the year's happiest stories. Held at Windsor Castle, the ceremony was not witnessed by any press photographers or TV cameras and the list of guests and godparents was not made public.\nBBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond surmised: \"It all points to a very different royal event, part of the continuing desire by the duke and duchess to raise their son Archie out of the spotlight.\"\nAmid ongoing spats with the media, increasingly through lawyers, it would soon become clear that both Meghan and her husband were becoming increasingly disenchanted with the expectations that came with their royal role.\nThe announcement in June 2019 that they were breaking away from the Royal Foundation charity - which had seen them work closely with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - led to frenzied speculation about Prince Harry and Meghan's relationship with Prince William and Catherine. \nThen there was the revelation that their home, Frogmore Cottage, had been renovated with \u00a32.4m of taxpayer-funded costs. It was later announced that Prince Harry had paid back the cost.\nMeghan's comments during the couple's African tour that she had not felt supported as she struggled with motherhood and her new role did not go down well with senior royals, according to sources at the time.\nAt the end of 2019, the couple took an extended Christmas break from royal duties, taking Archie to the Canadian province of British Columbia.\nIt gave them time to mull over their next move and, within days of the start of a new decade, they dropped the bombshell announcement that they planned to step back as senior royals and become financially independent.\nAmid the further detail that the couple planned to split their time between the UK and North America, Buckingham Palace expressed its disappointment as palace sources revealed that that no other royal - including the Queen or Prince William - was consulted before the statement was issued.\nTalks then ensued between Prince Harry and the Queen to iron out the details before it was confirmed that their couple's final duties as working members of the Royal Family would be in March 2020.\nThe very final engagement saw them attend the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey. The Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William were all there although one of the abiding memories of Meghan's royal exit - by now widely renamed \"Megxit\" - was getting a hug from singer Craig David.\nIn February 2021, before a formal review of the situation had begun, Buckingham Palace confirmed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would not be returning as working members of the Royal Family.\nIt meant Prince Harry and Meghan would return their honorary military appointments and royal patronages, which will be redistributed to working members of the Royal Family.\nThe couple will still attend some royal events in the future but these will not be classed as official duties.\nAfter time was spent in Canada, the couple settled at a new home in California.\nIt has allowed them to spend much more time with Meghan's mother Doria Ragland, who lives in the state.\nBut they are never completely out of the spotlight. There was a media fascination in tracking the couple's whereabouts in the early days of the coronavirus lockdown. In April 2020, they sued and eventually won an apology from a US news agency after drones were allegedly used to take pictures of their son, Archie, at their home.\nThe same month, the couple announced that they were ending all co-operation with four tabloid newspaper groups in the UK, blaming \"distorted, false or invasive\" stories. \nBut they do remain keen to seek publicity for the causes or issues they are interested in.\nAs a duchess, Meghan took on portfolio of charitable work and patronages, which included the National Theatre and charity Smart Works. She also launched a charity cookbook in September 2018 to help those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire.\nAfter moving back to the US, she jointly wrote a newspaper article calling for the end of \"structural racism\" and the couple also urged US citizens to vote in the presidential election, saying that they should \"reject hate\".\nIn November 2020, Meghan wrote an article revealing her \"almost unbearable grief\" at enduring a miscarriage in July of that year.\nAs for their future career plans, a big clue came when they reached a deal with streaming giant Netflix to make a range of programmes, some of which they may appear in.\nMeghan and Prince Harry featured in a succession of headlines in February 2021.\nAt the High Court in London, Meghan won her claim for misuse of private information against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father.  A further hearing will decide the \"next steps\" in her legal action which covers claims of copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act.\nDays later Meghan and Prince Harry announced they were expecting their second child.\nThen came the news the couple had decided to talk about their decision to step away from the monarchy, in a TV interview with Oprah Winfrey.\nAnd there was a statement from Buckingham Palace that it would investigate claims the Duchess of Sussex bullied royal staff in 2018.\nHer spokesman said the duchess was \"saddened\" by the \"latest attack on her character\" - and the following day a clip from her Winfrey interview was issued by CBS in which Meghan said Buckingham Palace could not expect her and Prince Harry to be silent if it was \"perpetuating falsehoods about us\".\nIn June, Meghan had her first daughter, Lilibet \"Lili\" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, and she and Prince Harry said Lili \"is more than we could have ever imagined\".\nThe couple named their second child Lilibet after the Royal Family's nickname for the Queen, the baby's great-grandmother. And her middle name, Diana, was chosen to honour her \"beloved late grandmother\", the Princess of Wales, they said."

      "text": "The government is being urged to give GCSE and A-level students more information about this year's exams as soon as possible. \nHead teachers say it would help pupils deal with the disruption caused by the recent Omicron surge.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh governments have confirmed that face coverings will remain compulsory in high schools. \nAll UK schools must offer face-to-face teaching to every age group, and provide effective online learning for pupils who are absent or isolating.\nThe specific Covid measures in place vary across the nations. \nAll school staff and secondary school pupils are asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week (three in Wales).\nIn England, secondary school pupils no longer need to wear masks in the classroom, and won't be required to wear them in communal areas from 27 January.\nA teachers union has urged the government to give GCSE and A-level students information about this year's exams ahead of the planned update on 7 February. Pupils will be offered a choice of topics in some subjects, but don't yet have the final details. \nIn Wales, some schools have reintroduced year-group bubbles, and have staggered start and finish times. Face coverings will remain compulsory in classrooms and communal areas until the end of the February half term, when schools will be expected to revert to their normal timetable. Rules will be reviewed on 10 February. \nIn Northern Ireland, schools reopened with the same measures as last term. New guidance says all primary and post-primary pupils in a class where there are multiple Covid cases should take an LFT. The overall guidance to schools will be reviewed in mid-February.\nIn Scotland, social distancing remains in place, pupils are separated into groups where possible. Pupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the 1m (3ft) social distancing rule still applies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the guidance for schools was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nThe latest data for England shows that 415,000 pupils (5.1%) were absent for Covid-related reasons on 20 Jan, up from 3.9% on 6 January.\nOver the same period, 4.5% of teachers and leaders were off because of Covid, although a quarter of schools had absence rates above 15%.\nIn addition, 4.7% of teaching assistants and other staff were off for Covid-related reasons. \nThe latest data in Northern Ireland shows that on 24 January, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covid - the highest rates since the new term began.\nIn Scotland on 21 January, 30,238 students (4.4%) were missing from school due to Covid-related reasons. \nMany schools have told the BBC they can't find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. A number of supply teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.\nEngland's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says the government is considering options to deal with staff shortages. \nHe previously urged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response.\nMr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes in the event of teacher shortages. \nBut teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children.\nYes - as long as they don't have any of the main Covid symptoms, under-18s don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. \nSimilarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. \nHowever, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advised to take LFTs for at least seven days. \nAll primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland should take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. \nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the second jab typically given 12 weeks after the first.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has also recommended that booster doses should be offered to children aged:\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has also been approved for five to 11-year-olds who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from Covid. \nThe JCVI also recommends that primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, but it's not yet clear when they might get the doses.\nChildren who aren't considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after testing positive for Covid before being vaccinated.\nVentilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid. \nIn England, the government is making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. \nLabour says this isn't enough, but the Department for Education says the units are only required in areas where doors and windows cannot be opened effectively.\nSome 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors had already been promised for England's schools to help identify areas with poor ventilation, but teaching unions complained this won't solve the problem. \nThe Scottish government gave \u00a3100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.\nThe Welsh government has a \u00a36m programme to increase air circulation and purity which will provide 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines."

      "text": "The SpaceX company has managed to land one of its Starship prototypes at the end of a high-altitude test flight.\nSerial Number 10 (SN10) touched down in Boca Chica, Texas - in contrast to its predecessors SN8 and SN9, which crashed into the ground.\nBut that wasn't the end of the story. The next-generation space vehicle put down heavily on its extended legs.\nA fire then developed around its base and eight minutes later SN10 blew itself apart on the landing pad.\nNonetheless, SpaceX will be hugely encouraged by the test. The prototype successfully executed its in-flight manoeuvres and managed to make a reasonably soft landing. These milestones will give the company confidence as it moves forward with the ambitious concept. \nSpaceX envisages Starships replacing its existing Falcon rockets.\nThese vehicles carry out regular missions - both crewed and uncrewed - for the US space agency (Nasa), the American military, and other commercial concerns.\nBut CEO Elon Musk says the new 50m-tall Starship will do it all, bigger and better - orbiting satellites and carrying passengers, both around the Earth and to off-world destinations such as the Moon and Mars.\nIndeed, he's promised a lunar excursion in 2023 to the Japanese online fashion retail billionaire Yusaku Maezawa.\nMr Maezawa will travel in a Starship with eight other individuals, and opened applications this week to anyone who might be interested in joining his \"dearMoon\" venture.\nWednesday's high-altitude test proceeded much like the previous prototype flights.\nThe uncrewed SN10 left its launch mount at the Boca Chica R&D facility, and rose vertically on the thrust of three methane-burning Raptor engines. \nThese power units shut down in sequence as the target height of roughly 10km (6.2 miles) was approached, with the vehicle then leaning over into the horizontal for the drop to the ground.\nThis belly-flop descent, controlled by large flaps at either end of the vehicle, is intended to simulate how future, operational Starships will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere from orbit, presenting a large surface area to the direction of travel to scrub off speed.\nThe vehicle is supposed to transition back to a tail-down configuration just before reaching the surface.\nSN8 and SN9 couldn't manage it. Both vehicles failed to adopt the correct orientation and reduction in speed.\nSN10, however, got it right, slowing rapidly and putting down on a concrete pad. A major contribution to the success was undoubtedly the decision this time to re-light all three Raptors ahead of landing, ensuring at least two engines were available to provide the necessary braking thrust.\n\"Third time's a charm,\" said John Insprucker, the SpaceX webcast commentator.\nBut all was not perfect. SN10 was leaning. Its stubby legs deployed at touchdown appeared to have collapsed. And as water hoses tried to extinguish a fire at the base of the vehicle, it suddenly leapt upwards and exploded.\nSpaceX already has other prototypes in various stages of assembly at Boca Chica, up to SN19 currently.\nThe Starship will eventually launch atop a booster called Super Heavy. This too is in build at Boca Chica.\nIt will feature perhaps 28 Raptors, producing more than 70 meganewtons (16 million lbs) of thrust - about double that of the mighty Apollo Saturn 5 rocket, which sent men to the Moon.\nWhen combined, both parts of the new SpaceX system - Starship and Super Heavy - will stand about 120m tall on the launch pad.\nThe two elements are being designed to be fully reusable, making propulsive returns at the end of each mission.\nSpaceX hopes Starship can be involved in Nasa's return to the Moon this decade. Starship is currently in competition with a number of other aerospace companies to provide a landing system to take astronauts down to the lunar surface."

      "text": "Public spending cuts in Rishi Sunak's Budget mean the chancellor \"isn't really levelling with people\", the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank has warned.\nThe Treasury said the cuts, worth \u00a34bn, were \"a purely mechanical change\", but Paul Johnson of the IFS said they were set to cause more pain.\nAt the same time, big tax rises were \"screeching U-turns\", Mr Johnson said.\n\"Santa Sunak\" was now looking more like \"Scrooge Sunak\", he added.\nMeanwhile, \"pressure will mount\" on Mr Sunak not to cut universal credit by \u00a320 a week after September, Mr Johnson said.\nHe said that going for such a \"cliff-edge reduction\" was \"remarkable\".\nIn his post-Budget analysis, Mr Johnson highlighted freezes in income tax allowances and rises in corporation tax.\nThe corporation tax rise to 25% would take the UK \"well up the international league table\" for revenues, he said, but it was \"50-50 at best\" whether it would actually happen without additional concessions.\n\"This was, of course, a tale of two Budgets,\" said Mr Johnson in response to Mr Sunak's economic plans.\n\"By the end of the forecast period, we are looking at a fiscal tightening of over \u00a330bn relative to previous plans. \n\"Take account of the cuts to planned spending announced in the autumn and Santa Sunak, purveyor of billions today, looks more like Scrooge Sunak, cutting spending and raising taxes to the tune of nearly \u00a350bn relative to his pre-pandemic plans of March 2020.\"\nAre you receiving universal credit?  Share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist. You can also get in touch in the following ways:\nThe income tax allowance freezes were set to raise about \u00a39bn, while the corporation tax changes could see revenues rise by more than \u00a317bn by 2025, Mr Johnson said.\nHe was sceptical that the plans to cut a further \u00a34bn from public spending could be delivered, saying they would cause \"additional pain\" if they went ahead.\n\"Now these are not firm plans, but they are the basis for the future public finance estimates. They are a very shaky basis,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\"This isn't just a mechanical change and presenting it as such means the chancellor isn't really levelling with people about the choices the government is making to repair the public finances.\"\nThe 24 hours after a Budget can be a perilous time for a chancellor. They can be undone even on the back of relatively small tax rises, let alone the biggest ones in more than a quarter of a century.\nThe \"post-match\" analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies can condemn a Budget in the history books. The chancellor has a massive challenge and a tumultuous uncertain backdrop, but he has the benefit of a solid majority, unlike his recent predecessors.\nSo it is with some relief that Number 11 will have seen the analysis of the respected institute and others such as the Resolution Foundation. They point to plenty of gaps. The plans imply further cuts to unprotected public spending. That includes social care spending within local authorities, for example. There is some doubt that the hike in corporation tax will really yield \u00a317bn a year. Difficulties here, or in the post-pandemic recovery in general, will lead to further spending squeezes and tax rises.\nHowever, it is not really possible to assert that unequivocally. The chancellor has not constrained himself to meet borrowing targets as part of a set of rules. He outlined some principles around borrowing only to invest. But if he were facing pressure to increase taxes further in the year before an election, for example, it is equally plausible that higher-than-expected borrowing would take the strain. \nThe world is too uncertain to be wearing fiscal straitjackets. And every time it has been required, on more than a dozen occasions, the chancellor has extended spending on rescue support schemes. That has set up an expectation about, for instance, the new expiry of the \u00a320 uplift to Universal Credit in October (now extended by six months). As Paul Johnson of the IFS puts it: \"He has given us a sense of where he wants to go [on fixing the public finances], but he still has a lot of work to do and his spending plans in particular don't look deliverable, at least not without considerable pain.\"\nThat argument will be settled in the run-up to a Spending Review. If anything, the medium-term pressures on public services will be higher, reflecting issues such as big NHS waiting lists. For now, the Budget has achieved its two strategic aims: borrowing more now to extend immediate crisis support, then post-dating a huge cheque, paid for mainly by big business, to cover part of the bill. Most of the other parts in these plans can move and, if necessary, dramatically so.\nMr Johnson also criticised Mr Sunak's universal credit changes.\n\"It is, by the way, remarkable that while the chancellor felt the need for a gradual phase out of furlough, business rates support, stamp duty reductions and VAT reductions, he is still set on a cliff-edge reduction in [universal credit] such that incomes of some of the poorest families will fall by over \u00a380 between one month and the next. \n\"Whatever the case for cutting generosity into the longer term, if you're going to do so, the case for doing it gradually rather than all at once looks unanswerable.\"\nIn a BBC interview, the chancellor rejected suggestions that he should have tapered the ending of the \u00a320-a-week universal credit increase in order to minimise its effect on families.\n\"We have extended it generously and in full, but it's important to remember that it's one of many things that we're doing to support people,\" Mr Sunak said.\nThese included increases in the National Living Wage and offering help with council tax payments, he added.\nEarlier, the government came under fire from campaigners for doing too little in the Budget to address inequality. \nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Resolution Foundation said the cut in universal credit would bring the incomes of benefit recipients down to levels not seen since the early 1990s.\nIt would also pull half a million people into poverty, just as unemployment was expected to peak.\nMr Sunak's decision to spend even larger sums to support the economic recovery now and put off raising taxes until later was broadly welcomed in the Resolution Foundation's analysis of the Budget.\nBut it noted that while GDP is set to grow this year by 4%, that might not feed through to better living standards, with wages by the middle of the decade set to remain \u00a31,200 a year - or 4.3% - below where they would have been without the coronavirus pandemic.\nAusterity would drag on for some, it added, with day-to-day spending on government departments such as transport and local government set to fall in real terms next year and remain almost a quarter lower than a decade ago.\nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an anti-poverty charity, said the universal credit changes meant single recipients of it would see their incomes cut by \u00a320 a week, just as the furlough scheme is ended and unemployment was expected to rise to its peak, the foundation said.\nIt predicted that would pull half a million people into poverty, including 200,000 children, adding that the Budget was silent on helping 700,000 households who have fallen behind on rent because of the pandemic and are now at risk of eviction.  \nResponding to the Resolution Foundation's analysis, Mr Sunak told the BBC that it had hailed his decision to freeze income tax thresholds as a \"progressive measure\" and \"a fair way to do what we need to do\"."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,Brandon Lewis,Brexit",
      "text": "The EU says a UK move to unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks will be a breach of international law.\nNorthern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods so products arriving from GB undergo EU import procedures.\nThe grace periods mean procedures and checks are not yet fully applied.\nThe first of these periods will expire at the end of March, but the UK has said it will be extended until October.\nEuropean Commission Vice President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the move amounted to \"a violation of the relevant substantive provisions\" of the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland, known as the NI Protocol.\nHe said the EU would respond in accordance with the \"legal means\" established by the protocol and the wider Brexit deal.\nFollowing a call on Wednesday evening between Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d and Lord Frost, the Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for EU relations, a UK government spokesperson said \"official-level notification\" of the move was made to the commission earlier this week.\nThe spokesperson said Lord Frost underlined the extension was needed for \"operational reasons\" and such measures were \"well precedented in other international trade arrangements, and that they were entirely consistent with our intention to discharge our obligations under the Protocol in good faith\".\nIrish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the UK government's move clearly undermined its commitment to the implementation of the protocol and described the unilateral decision as \"deeply unhelpful\".\nHe said he had made his regret over the decision clear to Lord Frost and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis.\nThe grace period affects supermarkets and other retailers, which face having to provide export health certificates for all shipments of animal products.\n\"For supermarkets and their suppliers, as part of the operational plan the UK committed to at the UK-EU Joint Committee on 24 February, the current Scheme for Temporary Agri-food Movements to Northern Ireland will continue until 1 October,\" said a government statement.\n\"Certification requirements will then be introduced in phases alongside the roll out of the Digital Assistance Scheme.\"\nIt is understood the government is describing this to the EU as an \"operational easement\", rather than a formal extension of the grace period.\nIt is using the example of how the Irish government temporarily relaxed safety and security declarations on products arriving from GB in January.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. \nIt does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods.\nThat has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\nUnionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it has damaged internal trade from GB to NI and poses a risk to the future of the UK union.\nBut anti-Brexit parties in NI say that it must be implemented in full, and that issues should be worked out through joint UK-EU processes.\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster welcomed the move and said the EU had refused to deal with an issue that \"would have caused a huge amount of problems for us at our ports\".\nThe DUP leader added that it showed the UK government \"can go further, so we need to see permanent solutions\". \nHowever, her deputy first minister, Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill, described the government's decision as \"another unilateral attempt to override what has been agreed\". \n\"What everyone should be focused on is achieving agreement to find solutions to the issues that are outstanding, but it's very clear the protocol must be made to work.\"\nSimon Hoare, the chairman of Westminster's NI Affairs Select Committee, tweeted that the case for extending the grace periods was \"compelling\" but that the unilateral move struck him as an \"approach most likely to have negative/unhelpful consequences\". \nThe Labour Party's shadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh said the Prime Minister should \"show some responsibility and find the lasting solutions with the EU that are the only way to give businesses the certainty they are crying out for\". \nIn Northern Ireland, reaction has been mixed, with Alliance Party MP Stephen Farry welcoming the extension of grace periods but warning of \"long-term detrimental consequences for Northern Ireland\" over the government's unilateral action. \nUlster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken, meanwhile, described the protocol as \"unsalvageable\" and criticised the EU and Irish government for reacting in a \"dramatic, over-the-top manner to what are minimal changes\".\n\"Simon Coveney and his EU counterparts are showing gravity-defying levels of arrogance and hypocrisy, given their past actions,\" he added. \nThe government said further guidance will be provided later this week on a grace period for parcel movements from GB to NI.\nIt is due to to end on 1 April, meaning all parcels would need customs declarations.\nGuidance will also be set out in regard to the issue of soil attached to the movement of plants, seeds, bulbs, vegetables and agricultural machinery.\nUnder the terms of the Brexit deal, soil from Great Britain is not permitted to enter Northern Ireland as it conflicts with EU plant regulations."

      "text": "Germany's vaccine commission has approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab in people aged over 65.\nThe country previously approved it for under-65s only, citing insufficient data on its effects on older people.\nThat led to public scepticism about its effectiveness, with some Germans spurning it and leaving many doses unused.\nBut German Chancellor Angela Merkel said recent studies had now provided enough data to approve it for all ages.\nAnnouncing the commission's decision on Thursday, Health Minister Jens Spahn said the move was \"good news for older people who are waiting for an injection\".\n\"The new data also shows that the vaccine is even more effective when the first and second jabs are administered 12 weeks apart,\" the minister said, adding that the law would be updated to incorporate the new recommendations.\nMrs Merkel said on Wednesday that Germany would follow the UK example of stretching the interval between vaccine doses in order to offer as many people as possible an initial shot.\nVarious studies have shown the AstraZeneca vaccine is highly effective among the elderly.\nBelgium says it will also approve the vaccine for older people, following France earlier this week.\nAbout 5% of Germans have so far received a first vaccine shot.\nThe EU's medical regulator approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all age groups in January.\nBut the rollout was met by some public scepticism after regulators in countries including France, Belgium and Italy recommended that it should not be used for people over 65. Like Germany, they citied insufficient data on its efficacy for older people.\nIn January French President Emmanuel Macron said the jab was \"quasi-ineffective\" for older age groups - a suggestion strongly refuted by the UK government and British medical regulators.\nThe debate came amid an acrimonious dispute between AstraZeneca and the EU over vaccine supplies to member states.\nSince then, stocks of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab have gone unused in several European countries, slowing vaccination efforts.\nMeanwhile the UK - which approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab for all age groups - has offered a first dose of a vaccine to 20.7 million people, almost a third of its population.\nLast week Carsten Watzl, head of the German Society for Immunology, urged his country to change its mind on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIn an interview with the BBC, he predicted regulators would have to reverse their decision to not recommend the jab for older people and suggested Mrs Merkel should take the vaccine live on TV to prove it is safe.\nSeparately, Mrs Merkel said she had agreed to a phased easing of restrictions with leaders of Germany's federal states but added that there was the option of an \"emergency brake\" if case numbers got out of control.\n\"We are at the threshold of a new phase of the pandemic that we can go into not carelessly but still with justified hope,\" Mrs Merkel said.\nFrom Monday up to five people from two households will be allowed to meet, with children under 14 exempt. \nSome shops will reopen provided that regional case numbers are below 50 per 100,00 people. If cases rise over 50 per 100,000 then customers will have to book slots to visit shops. If cases rise to over 100 per 100,000 over three days in a row then restrictions will be reimposed.\nThe UK has been using the vaccine made by AstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, in its mass immunisation programme since December.\nUK health officials say it provides \"high levels of protection\" for all ages. \nNo one who received the vaccine in trials was admitted to hospital or became seriously ill with Covid-19.\nThe vaccine is given via two injections to the arm, the second between four and 12 weeks after the first."

      "tags": "United Nations,Environment,Food waste",
      "text": "More than 900 million tonnes of food is thrown away every year, according to a global report.\nThe UN Environment Programme's Food Waste Index revealed that 17% of the food available to consumers - in shops, households and restaurants - goes directly into the bin.\nSome 60% of that waste is in the home. \nThe lockdown appears to have had a surprising impact - at least in the UK - by reducing domestic food waste.\nSustainability charity Wrap, the UN's partner organisation on this report, says people have been planning their shopping and their meals more carefully. \nAnd in an effort to build on that, well-known chefs have been enlisted to inspire less wasteful kitchen habits. \nThe report has highlighted a global problem that is \"much bigger than previously estimated,\" Richard Swannell from Wrap told BBC News. \n\"The 923 million tonnes of food being wasted each year would fill 23 million 40-tonne trucks. Bumper-to-bumper, enough to circle the Earth seven times.\"\nIt is an issue previously considered to be a problem almost exclusive to richer countries - with consumers simply buying more than they could eat - but this research found \"substantial\" food waste \"everywhere it looked\". \nThere are gaps in the findings that could reveal how the scale of the problem varies in low- and high-income countries. The report, for example, could not distinguish between \"involuntary\" and \"voluntary\" waste. \n\"We haven't looked deeper [at this issue] but in low-income countries, the cold chain is not fully assured because of lack of access to energy,\" Martina Otto from Unep told BBC News. \nThe data to distinguish between the waste of edible food and inedible parts - like bones and shells - was only available for high-income countries. Lower-income countries, Ms Otto pointed out, were likely to be wasting much less edible food. \nBut the end result, she said, was that the world was \"just throwing away all the resources used to make that food\". \nAhead of major global climate and biodiversity summits later this year, Unep executive director Inger Andersen is pushing for countries to commit to combatting waste - halving it by 2030. \n\"If we want to get serious about tackling climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste, businesses, governments and citizens around the world have to do their part to reduce food waste,\" she said.\nRichard Swannell pointed out: \"Wasted food is responsible for 8-10% of greenhouse gas emissions, so if food waste was a country, it would be the third-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases on the planet.\"\nIn the UK, the average household could save \u00a3700 per year, according to Wrap research, by buying only the food they ate. \nWhere food waste is voluntary, the Covid-19 lockdown appears to have had the surprising effect of revealing precisely how it can be remedied. \nAccording to research by Wrap, planning, careful storage and batch-cooking during the lockdown reduced people's reported levels of food waste by 22% compared with 2019.\n\"Being confined to our homes has resulted in an increase in behaviours such as batch cooking and meal planning,\" the charity said. \"But the latest insights suggest that food waste levels are likely to rise again as we emerge from lockdown.\"\nIn an effort to avoid that, well-known cooks and chefs have lent their names and social media profiles to the campaign against kitchen waste. \nBritish TV cook Nadiya Hussain is working with Wrap and offering tips and leftovers recipes via Instagram. And Italian restaurateur Massimo Bottura, chef patron of Modena eatery Osteria Francescana, which has three Michelin stars, has been appointed Unep goodwill ambassador \"in the fight against food waste and loss\". \nThroughout the lockdown in Italy, his family produced an online cooking show called\u00a0Kitchen Quarantine, encouraging people to \"see the invisible potential\" in every ingredient.\nWhile millions of tonnes of food was thrown away, an estimated 690 million people were affected by hunger in 2019. That number is expected to rise sharply in the wake of the pandemic.\nMs Andersen pointed out that tackling waste \"would cut greenhouse gas emissions, slow the destruction of nature through land conversion and pollution, enhance the availability of food and thus reduce hunger and save money at a time of global recession\".\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"

      "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not return as working members of the Royal Family, Buckingham Palace has said.  \nThe Queen confirmed the couple would not \"continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service\".\nA statement from the palace added Prince Harry and Meghan \"remain much loved members of the family\".\nThe couple said \"service is universal\" and offered to continue supporting the organisations they have represented.\nThe duke and duchess said last January they would step back as \"senior\" royals and work to become financially independent. \nThe couple, who now live in California, formally stepped down in March, with a plan to review the arrangements after 12 months.\nThe confirmation means Prince Harry and Meghan will return their honorary military appointments and royal patronages, which will be redistributed to working members of the Royal Family. \nUnder the arrangement agreed last year, the couple gave up using the HRH titles. But Harry retains the title of prince, having been born one.\nTheir departure follows conversations between Harry and members of the Royal Family.\nA statement from Buckingham Palace said: \"The Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of the Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service. \n\"While all are saddened by their decision, the Duke and Duchess remain much loved members of the family.\"\nA spokesman for Harry and Meghan said: \"As evidenced by their work over the past year, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex remain committed to their duty and service to the UK and around the world, and have offered their continued support to the organisations they have represented regardless of official role.\"\nThey added: \"We can all live a life of service. Service is universal.\"\nThis could have been a formality - the end of the review period was coming up, it's very clear what the Sussexes' direction of travel is and equally clear that the patronages and appointments can't really be held on to from California. Thanks for your service, goodbye.\nBut instead the duelling statements - and their bizarre timing, with the Duke of Edinburgh in hospital - look as if there is a fair amount of bitterness remaining.\nThe statement from the palace lays down the Queen's philosophy; as far as she is concerned the couple have left the life of public service. That's why the honorary commands and patronages have to go. You can't do half in-half out.\nNot so fast, the couple shoot back. They remain, they say, \"committed to duty and service\" - and \"service\", far from being a matter of titles and roles, \"is universal\". There is more than a flash of anger in their words.\nLike all good family arguments it blows up at a sticky moment - Harry's grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh is in hospital.  So why now? One source says the story was all over the place already and would have been in the papers by the weekend. The suggestion: that one party is stampeding the other.\nAs to the meat of the announcement, the loss of the Captain Generalcy of the Royal Marines will sting. Harry's military life has defined him. \"Don't cock it up,\" Prince Philip told his grandson on the day he passed on the honorary command of the Marines. To yield it up now must be a heavy blow.\nSeveral of the duke and duchess's former patronages have thanked the couple for their support following the announcement.\nThe Queen's Commonwealth Trust - which was founded in 2018, with Harry and Meghan appointed president and vice-president respectively - said it was \"very lucky\" to have had their \"keen support and encouragement\" in its formative years. \n\"We are glad that they remain in our circle of supporters,\" the trust said in a statement. \nThe Association of Commonwealth Universities said Meghan had been \"a passionate advocate for our mission to build a better world through higher education\" since she took over the role of patron from the Queen in January 2019.  \nAnd the National Theatre, another of Meghan's patronages, said the duchess had \"championed\" its work with communities and young people across the UK to make theatre accessible to all. \nMeanwhile, the Rugby Football League thanked Harry \"for his time, care and commitment\" in supporting the organisation at all levels - from the children's game to the England teams. \nThe Rugby Football Union also thanked the duke for his work as patron and vice patron, adding that it had \"greatly valued his contribution to promoting and supporting the game\". \nHowever, the Invictus Games Foundation, which runs an international sporting event for injured servicemen and women, said Harry would remain a patron for the organisation.\nThe duke remained \"fully committed\" to the games, which he founded, it said in a statement. \n\"His military service and experience, combined with his genuine compassion and understanding for those who serve their countries, has raised awareness of wounded, injured and sick service personnel and the role they continue to play in society,\" the statement added. \nHarry will also continue to work with veterans' charity Walking With The Wounded as its expedition patron. \nSmart Works, a charity which helps women with clothes and coaching to get into work, and animal welfare charity Mayhew also said Meghan would remain a private patron. \nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex's military, Commonwealth and charitable association roles will be handed back to the Queen.\nFor Harry, those are:\nAnd for Meghan:\nBroadcaster and Royal Marines veteran JJ Chalmers, who is a friend of Prince Harry, said the duke's family remained \"his number one priority\" and suggested a desire to have \"an element of control\" was behind his decision to step back as a senior royal. \n\"So much of his life, particularly the way that it faces into the media, is out of his control... and any individual wants to try and take control of that,\" he told the BBC. \n\"I will continue to have the utmost respect for the service that he has given so far and I'm hopeful and optimistic that he will continue to serve in a greater purpose,\" he added. \nThe announcement comes days after the couple revealed they are expecting their second child.\nThey are due to talk about their decision to step away from the monarchy in a TV interview with Oprah Winfrey next month.\nSince stepping back from royal duties, they have also signed deals with streaming giants Netflix and Spotify.\nThe duchess recently won a High Court privacy battle against the Mail on Sunday over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father.\nEarlier this month, Harry also successfully sued the publisher of the Mail on Sunday for libel, over false claims he \"turned his back\" on the Royal Marines after stepping down as a senior royal.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "tags": "HM Treasury,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Budget 2021,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has rejected claims his plans to claw back the cost of coronavirus support will hit the poorest hardest.\nMr Sunak extended furlough until September in Wednesday's Budget and set out measures to protect business as the UK emerges from lockdown.\nBut he also announced major changes to tax - including a freeze on personal allowances.\nThat means a million more people will start paying income tax.\nBut Mr Sunak insisted no-one's take-home pay would be lowered and the threshold freeze would hit those on higher incomes more.\nThe chancellor also plans to cut about \u00a34bn from the budgets of government departments - leading to opposition warnings about a fresh round of spending cuts.\nThe Treasury says the cut is due to a forecast of lower inflation but the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank said the reduction \"would still cause pain\".\nIFS director Paul Johnson said: \"This isn't just a mechanical change and presenting it as such means the chancellor isn't really levelling with people about the choices the government is making to repair the public finances.\"  \nSpending on the NHS, schools and defence is protected, which means the \u00a34bn cut will \"fall entirely\" on local government and other areas, Mr Johnson said.\n\"Take account of the cuts to planned spending announced in the Autumn and Santa Sunak, purveyor of billions today looks more like Scrooge Sunak cutting spending and raising taxes to the tune of nearly \u00a350bn relative to his pre-pandemic plans of March 2020,\" he added.\nHow will you be affected by this year's Budget?  Do you have any questions for our experts?\nMr Sunak's tax threshold freeze means about 1.3 million people will start paying income tax for the first time - and about 10% of adults will be dragged into the 40% top rate.\nMr Sunak told the BBC the freeze was a \"progressive\" move which would ensure the people that earned the most paid the most adding \"it is a fair way to do what we need to do\".\nHe said: \"People's current take home pay won't be affected by this policy but it does mean the incremental benefits they would have experienced had the thresholds continued to rise with inflation won't be there.\"\nDuring his Budget, Mr Sunak announced that a weekly \u00a320 increase in universal credit - introduced last year to help those hit financially by the coronavirus pandemic - would end in September.\nTwo left-leaning think tanks, The Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Resolution Foundation, said the move would bring the incomes of benefit recipients down to levels not seen since the early 1990s.\nUniversal credit and income tax - as well as strains on government departments - are all going to cause issues for the government.\nBut social care is a real Achilles Heel. It's no good saying it's a problem all governments have failed to deal with. We have had a Conservative government for a long time now. \nMost can agree, behind the scenes in government, it is time for a change.\nSome in Westminster are also asking if raising corporation tax in 2023 points to an election that year. \nOne cabinet minister told me on Wednesday \"no comment\" when I asked if the 25% corporation tax would ever come into force.\nThey are going to have to raise an awful lot of money somehow, but it's hard to see where the economy will be in 2023, let alone in a few months' time.\nLabour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds warned that \"low-income families could be seeing a very difficult time in the future\".\nShe also expressed concern that the government would be \"planning to switch off its increase in social security right at the time when we anticipate a peak in unemployment\".\n\"That is not a sensible approach to take,\" she added.\nMr Sunak says the total package of measures to support the economy - including those previously announced - amounted to \u00a3407bn.\nBut he warned that this unprecedented spending could not continue.\nHis other big money raising move was to increase the tax on company profits from 19% to 25%, although it will not kick in until 2023 and smaller firms will be exempted.\nConfederation of British Industry director-general Tony Danker said the rise in corporation tax would \"cause a sharp intake of breath for many businesses and sends a worrying signal to those planning to invest in the UK\".\nThe government's own watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said the overall tax burden on the UK would hit 35% of national income by 2025-26, the highest level since the 1960s.\nMr Sunak told the BBC it was \"important we get our borrowing under control\" - and the UK would still have the lowest corporation tax rate in the G7 group of industrialised economies.\nHis has also faced criticism for failing to mention social care - an area where an existing funding crisis has been made more acute by the pandemic.\nIn 2019, Boris Johnson said he had ready a plan to fix social care but asked why it was not included in the Budget, Mr Sunak said the government was trying to find a \"cross-party solution\".\nHe said it was important to \"build consensus\" on the long-term future of social care but added that \"right now our focus is the pandemic\". \nLabour said ministers had not contacted them concerning any such plan.

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has insisted she had no reason to want to \"get\" Alex Salmond as she dismissed claims of a plot against him as \"absurd\".\nThe first minister was speaking at the inquiry into her government's unlawful handling of harassment complaints against her predecessor. \nShe apologised to the two women who had made the complaints, saying they were let down by a \"very serious error\". \nBut she rejected much of Mr Salmond's version of events. \nAnd she insisted her government had nothing to hide, despite accusations of a cover-up from opposition parties.\nMr Salmond has previously claimed several people within the SNP and Scottish government - including Ms Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell, the party's chief executive - were involved in a \"deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort\" to damage his reputation, even to the extent of attempting to have him imprisoned. \nIn her eight hours of evidence to the committee, Ms Sturgeon said she had \"thought often\" about the impact of the past three years on Mr Salmond, but said he had shown no sign of thinking of others.\nShe said she had watched Mr Salmond give evidence to the inquiry committee last Friday and had found  herself \"searching for any sign at all that he recognised how difficult this had been for others too\".\nThe first minister added: \"First of all, for women who believed his behaviour towards them was inappropriate.\n\"But also for those of us who have campaigned alongside him, worked with him, cared for him, and consider him a friend - who now stand unfairly accused of plotting against him.\"\nMs Sturgeon acknowledged that Mr Salmond had been cleared of all of the sexual assault allegations against him by a High Court jury. \nBut she added: \"I know just from what he told me that his behaviour was not always appropriate.\n\"And yet across six hours of testimony, there was not a single word of regret, reflection or even a simple acknowledgement of that.\n\"I can only hope that in private, the reality might be different.\"\nThe first minister said the female complainers had come forward \"of their own free will\", and that while some offered support to each other, this was not evidence of a conspiracy. \nShe went on to tell the cross-party committee of MSPs that Mr Salmond had been one of the \"closest people to me in my entire life\".\nShe added: \"I would never have wanted to 'get' Alex Salmond - I would never, ever have wanted any of this to happen. I had no motive, intention or desire to 'get' Alex Salmond.\"\nThe inquiry is examining the Scottish government's botched handling of sexual harassment complaints made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants. \nMr Salmond used his evidence session last week to accuse his former protege of repeatedly misleading parliament, and said he had \"no doubt\" she had breached the ministerial code - which she denies.\nA separate inquiry headed by Irish lawyer James Hamilton is specifically looking at whether this was the case.\nMs Sturgeon is facing calls to quit from Scottish Conservatives after new documents released on Tuesday evening raised further questions about her involvement in the saga and appeared to back Mr Salmond's evidence. \nThey included government emails showing it continued a doomed legal fight with Mr Salmond despite its lawyers advising it was likely to lose. \nIt ended up paying Mr Salmond's legal fees of more than \u00a3500,000, on top of its own costs, after the investigation was found to have been unlawful and \"tainted with bias\" ahead of a judicial review.\nMs Sturgeon insisted that her meetings with lawyers had initially left her satisfied that the government was not \"in some way prolonging a judicial review that was dead in the water\".\nShe admitted that advice received shortly before it did finally admit defeat had been \"dreadful\" and \"catastrophic\", but said the government had taken a \"legally sound\" approach by then deciding to concede the case.\nLabour's Jackie Ballie said the legal advice had only been handed over at the \"11th hour\" after two votes in parliament and the threat of a no confidence vote in the deputy first minister, and complained that some documents had not been provided. \nThe committee has regularly complained that its work was being obstructed by the government, with SNP MSP Linda Fabiani, who chairs the inquiry, saying that she shared Ms Baillie's frustration. \nMs Sturgeon insisted she had always acted \"properly and appropriately\" and there was \"no intention\" by the government to withhold information from the committee.\nMs Sturgeon was questioned at length about claims the name of a complainer was passed to Mr Salmond while the meeting between a meeting between the two first ministers was being set up.\nMr Salmond said the name had been revealed to his former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein, and two other former SNP employees - Kevin Pringle and Duncan Hamilton - have written to the committee to support his account.\nHowever Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry that she had been given assurances that \"it did not happen in the way that has been described\".\nShe said she believed that Mr Salmond was already aware of the identities of the two complainers, and that Mr Hamilton and Mr Pringle were not present at the meeting in question.\nShe said she was prevented from going into more detail due to legal constraints, but added: \"I understand evidence has been given to this committee that denies that allegation, and I believe there has been an offer of confidential evidence as well.\"\nAs Ms Sturgeon was speaking, Mr Salmond's spokesman released a statement saying he had lodged a formal complaint with Scotland's top civil servant, Leslie Evans, about \"the conduct of the official who is alleged to have breached civil service rules by disclosing the name of a complainant.\"\nThe view in Nicola Sturgeon's team tonight is there was no knock-out blow - no truly dreadful moment for the first minister. They seem pretty happy with her performance in eight long hours of questions. \nThere are still outstanding questions; the most significant of which is whether Ms Sturgeon broke the ministerial code. \nThe committee will provide an answer - but perhaps more significant is the view of James Hamilton, the Irish lawyer heading a separate inquiry into the issue. The view in Bute House is that his report will be hard to ignore. \nThe political debate over this is likely to continue in the coming days too. Ms Sturgeon's political opponents still believe her account is muddled and inconsistent. \nThen there's Alex Salmond. He's sent documents to the committee today to support his evidence last week. Might we hear more from him in the coming days?\nThe first minister had originally told parliament she first became aware of the specific allegations against Mr Salmond when she met him in her Glasgow home on 2 April 2018.\nBut she subsequently claimed to have \"forgotten\" about an earlier meeting with his former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, in her Scottish Parliament office on 29 March when she says she was told \"in general terms\" that a \"harassment-type issue had arisen.\"\nSome committee members expressed scepticism that Ms Sturgeon could genuinely forget about such a meeting.\nMs Sturgeon said she had not taken an official record of her two meetings with Mr Salmond in her home because she thought this could \"potentially compromise the confidentiality\" of the complaints process.\nShe said if a meeting with Mr Salmond appeared in a diary then questions could be asked about it, and that there would be more risk to the complaints process if she told people within government that she was aware it was ongoing.\nAnd she said she did not agree with Mr Salmond's assertion that there had been a \"shared understanding\" ahead of the meeting as to what was to be discussed - which would suggest she knew in advance about the allegations against him.\nMs Sturgeon also denied claims that she had told Mr Salmond she would be willing to intervene in the case if necessary\nBut she said Mr Salmond had been a \"long-standing friend and colleague\", and she had therefore tried to let him down gently when he made the request  - and accepted that she may not have been frank enough.\nThe first minister added: \"I did not intend to intervene, and I did not intervene, and while I know it is more complex than this, I think in terms of his anger towards me I think that is the root of it with Mr Salmond.\"\nThe first minister also insisted that the complaints procedure was not put in place to target Mr Salmond, as some of his supporters have claimed. \nShe told the committee that she was not aware of any allegations or concerns about sexually inappropriate behaviour on the part of Mr Salmond until a media enquiry from Sky News was made in November 2017. \nMs Sturgeon also insisted that details of the allegations against Mr Salmond that were leaked to the Daily Record newspaper - which broke the story in August 2018 - had not come from her or from anyone acting on her authority or instruction.\nMs Sturgeon finished her evidence by admitting that mistakes had been made - but dismissed suggestions from Mr Salmond that this was because Scotland's leadership and institutions had failed.\nShe added: \"Actually what comes out of it is the message that no matter how powerful you are or were, no matter your status or connections, if you are accused of serious offences they will be investigated and you will have the chance to defend yourself in court. That is how these things should work.\n\"The idea that because somebody doesn't like what has happened over the last couple of years we allow this attack to be made on the fundamentals of our democracy I find deeply distressing and deeply unfair.\"\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross claimed that the abiding memory of the evidence session would be Ms Sturgeon repeatedly saying \"I can't recall\". \nHe added: \"She dodged and evaded almost every difficult question. The first minister vividly remembers the details she believes exonerate her, then forgets entirely anything that damages her.\"\nScottish Labour MSP Jackie Baillie, who sits on the committee, said \"serious questions remain\" about the first minister's conduct. \nShe added: \"Quite frankly we are not much further forward in understanding her role in this catastrophic failure of the Scottish government.\n\"Most galling of all was the first minister's complete failure to understand the obstruction that this Committee has faced and continues to face. \n\"The first minister promised the committee that it would receive all the information that it needed - this now sounds like a bad joke.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Italy,European Union,AstraZeneca,Australia",
      "text": "The Italian government has blocked the export of an Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine shipment to Australia.\nThe decision affects 250,000 doses of the vaccine produced at an AstraZeneca facility in Italy.\nItaly is the first EU country to use the bloc's new regulations allowing exports to be stopped if the company providing the vaccines has failed to meet its obligations to the EU.\nAustralia said losing \"one shipment\" would not badly affect its rollout.\nBut it has asked the European Commission, which reportedly backs Italy's move, to review the decision.\nAstraZeneca is on track to provide only 40% of the agreed supply to member states in the first three months of the year. It has cited production problems for the shortfall.\nIn January, then Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte described delays in vaccine supplies by both AstraZeneca and Pfizer as \"unacceptable\" and accused the companies of violating their contracts.\nThe EU has been widely criticised for the slow pace of its vaccination programme. \nUnder the EU vaccine scheme, which was established in June last year, the bloc has negotiated the purchase of vaccines on behalf of member states.\nThere has been no official comment on the Italian move by the EU or AstraZeneca.\nAustralia began its vaccination programme last week using the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. It was due to start inoculations with the AstraZeneca jab on Friday.\nThe Italian government approached the European Commission last week to say that it was its intention to block the shipment.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the foreign ministry explained the move, saying it had received the request for authorisation on 24 February.\nIt said that previous requests had been given the green light as they included limited numbers of samples for scientific research, but the latest one - being much larger, for more than 250,000 doses - was rejected.\nIt explained the move by saying that Australia was not on a list of \"vulnerable\" countries, that there was a permanent shortage of vaccines in the EU and Italy, and that the number of doses was high compared with the amount given to Italy and to the EU as a whole.        \n\"Australia has raised the issue with the European Commission through multiple channels, and in particular we have asked the European Commission to review this decision,\" Health Minister Greg Hunt said.\nAustralia said it had already received a shipment of 300,000 doses and planned to begin local production next month.\n\"Domestic production starts with 1 million [doses] per week of deliveries from late March and is on track,\" Mr Hunt said.\n\"This [Italy] shipment was not factored into our distribution plan for coming weeks.\"\nIn the acrimonious vaccine war, this is a muscular move by one of the European Union's heavyweights. \nIt is the first such ban under a new EU scheme in which manufacturers must request authorisation for export from the country in which the vaccine is produced. \nItaly's new Prime Minister Mario Draghi, an influential figure in Europe as the former president of the European Central Bank, argued in a videoconference with EU leaders that the rules should be applied rigorously, furious at reductions by AstraZeneca of up to 70% in the doses it was contracted to provide. \nMr Draghi has prioritised ramping up the vaccination programme. He is clearly determined to show that his country - and the EU - will use all means necessary to do so.\nThe EU signed a deal with AstraZeneca in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more, but earlier this year the UK-Swedish company reported production delays at plants in the Netherlands and Belgium.\nInstead of receiving 100 million doses by the end of March, the EU is now expected to get just 40 million.\nThe EU accused the company of reneging on its deal, with EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides saying that UK factories making the vaccine should make up the shortfall.\nMs Kyriakides also rejected AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot's characterisation of the contract as one of \"best effort\" rather than an obligation to meet a deadline for delivery of vaccines.\nAs a result of the row, the EU announced export controls which began on 30 January, known as the \"transparency and authorisation mechanism\"."

      "tags": "Budget 2021,Trade",
      "text": "Plans to create eight new freeports in England include tax breaks for employers, the government has said.\nWhere will they be?\nFreeports are usually located around shipping ports, or airports. \nGoods that arrive into freeports from abroad are exempt from tax charges, called tariffs, that are normally paid to the government.\nThese taxes are only paid if the goods leave the freeport and are moved elsewhere in the UK. Otherwise, they are sent overseas without the charges being paid.\nThe UK had seven freeports between 1984 and 2012. Locations included Liverpool, Southampton and the Port of Tilbury.\nThe locations of England's eight new freeports were announced at the March 2021 Budget:\nIt is hoped freeports - which can be up to 45km (27 miles) across - will help regenerate deprived areas. \nIn England, companies inside the sites will be offered temporary tax breaks. These include reductions to the tax companies pay on their existing property, and when they buy new buildings.\nIn the Queen's Speech, on 11 May, the government confirmed that freeport employers will be able to pay less national insurance for all new workers, from April 2022.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to announce their own freeport policies. \nEighteen areas in England bid to become a freeport.\nOne of the most important considerations, according to the government, was how a freeport could bring economic opportunities to poorer regions and \"level up\" the country.\nMinisters say other factors - such as the impact of Covid-19 on local areas and ensuring freeports are \"spread fairly\" across England - were also taken into account.\nSupporters say freeports can help increase manufacturing, and encourage jobs and investment in areas that would otherwise struggle to attract them. \nBut opponents say they don't boost employment overall, and moving economic activity from one place to another comes at a cost to the taxpayer.\nLabour says firms inside freeports will not be able to take full advantage of post-Brexit trade deals and tariffs will have to be paid.\nThe Labour-led Welsh government says it has reservations about freeports, although it has not ruled out introducing them.\nThe SNP Scottish government - which has previously been critical of freeports - now plans to introduce its own scheme for Scotland, dubbed \"green ports\". \nExact details have not been set out, but bidders will be asked to promote \"sustainable\" growth, and pay the real living wage. \nThere are currently about 80 freeports dotted around the EU.\nNow that the UK has left the EU, some Brexit supporters say the UK can adopt a more generous freeport policy. For example, they say the government could give businesses more financial help.\nJonathan Branton, a partner at law firm DWF, says the UK does have more flexibility now it doesn't have to follow EU rules. \nHe also points out tax breaks offered to freeport firms would no longer require prior agreement from the European Commission.\nHowever, he adds that the Brexit trade deal - agreed by the UK and the EU - still requires subsidies to be justified, otherwise they could be challenged in UK courts.  \nIn more extreme circumstances, the EU could respond to UK subsidies by introducing tariffs on some UK goods deemed to be damaging EU trade or investment.\nAnd the UK will still be subject to World Trade Organization rules - which say you can't introduce subsidies linked just to export performance.\nThere are also questions over Northern Ireland, which still has to follow EU subsidy rules under the UK's withdrawal deal. \nTreasury Minister Steve Barclay has admitted the freeport model used in Great Britain will need to be \"adapted\" for Northern Ireland. \nNorthern Ireland's devolved government says it is working with the Treasury to find out how much of the model it will be able to follow.

      "text": "The government can expect a \"backlash\" if it goes ahead with a proposed 1% pay rise for NHS staff in England next year, a nursing union has warned.\nThe health department has made the recommendation in a submission to the independent panel that advises on NHS salaries. \nThe Royal College of Nursing called the suggested rise \"pitiful\" and said nurses should be getting 12.5% more.\nNHS staff have been excluded from a pay freeze for most public sector workers.\nThe NHS Pay Review Body is due to recommend salary levels for health service staff before early May, before ministers then make a final decision. \nIn its submission, the health department said awarding NHS staff a \"headline\" pay increase of more than 1% \"would require re-prioritisation\".\nHealth department officials said the Covid pandemic had placed a \"huge strain\" on NHS finances, whilst the economic outlook \"remains uncertain\".\nThey added that this increase was still above the CPI rate of inflation, whilst some staff would see a higher rise under a previously agreed three-year deal. \nSome 1.3 million public sector workers will see a pay freeze next year, while those earning less than \u00a324,000 guaranteed a pay rise of at least \u00a3250.\nSpeaking on BBC's Question Time, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said he was sure the pay round \"has been discussed and established at the right level\". \n\"No one is doubting that the NHS hasn't been absolutely first class in this pandemic. What I am suggesting is that the whole economy has been under pressure,\" he added. \nBut Labour said a 1% increase for NHS staff was \"the ultimate kick in teeth to our NHS heroes who have done so much to keep us safe over the past year\".\nThe party's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said staff \"deserve a fair pay rise,\" adding the proposal was \"an absolute insult\".\nNHS pay in England has been out of the news since 2018 when a three year deal was agreed and welcomed by unions.\nBut the issue is firmly back on the agenda with a new deal needed for the upcoming financial year. \nThis is just the start of the process. \nThe government has made its submission to the NHS Pay Review Body. But the fact that ministers think a 1% pay rise is reasonable has angered health unions. \nThey see it as scant reward for the huge efforts of staff during the pandemic. \nGovernment sources say that inflation is so low that 1% still represents a real terms increase and that public finances are constrained. \nThis is shaping up to be a tense few months with pay added to the many difficult issues facing the NHS.  \nRCN Chief Executive Dame Donna Kinnair said the government was \"dangerously out of touch with nursing staff, NHS workers and the public\".\n\"Nursing staff would feel they are being punished and made to pay for the cost of the pandemic. It is a political decision to underfund and undervalue nursing staff.\n\"With the time remaining before the Pay Review Body recommendation, the government can expect a backlash from a million NHS workers. Taxpayers are supportive of a significant and fair pay rise for NHS workers - this year of all years.\" \nOne nurse, Carmel O'Boyle, said she was \"disgusted\".\n\"We just want something that reflects the work that we do. We want a fair wage and I don't think the government understands at all what the nursing workforce does,\" she said.\n\"I understand it is a very difficult year for the whole world... but this is a political decision,\" she added. \nThe British Medical Association (BMA) said the recommendation was \"a kick in the teeth\".\nIts chair of council, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, accused the government of a \"total dereliction\" of its \"moral duty and obligation to a workforce that is keeping the NHS on its feet and patients alive\".\nHe said: \"Throughout the pandemic, doctors have cared for more critically ill patients than was ever thought possible and worked round the clock despite suffering from extreme stress and exhaustion. \n\"The government should demonstrate that it recognises the contribution of a workforce that has literally kept this country alive for the past 10 months.\"\nA government spokesperson said they would \"consider carefully\" the recommendations made by the NHS Pay Review Body when it reports in the spring.\nThe government \"will continue to provide pay rises for NHS workers\", despite the wider freeze on pay in the rest of the public sector, the spokesperson said. \nThey added multi-year pay deals had delivered a pay rise of over 12% for newly qualified nurses, and will increase junior doctors' pay scales by 8.2%.\nIf you are an NHS worker, what are your views about your pay?

      "tags": "South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scientists have identified 16 cases of another new variant of coronavirus in the UK. \nPublic Health England has designated it as a 'variant under investigation' (VUI), meaning it is on their watch list, but not one they are immediately concerned about. \nIt has a mutation in common with the South Africa and Brazil variants. \nThat change, E484K, may help the virus evade some immunity from vaccination or prior infection, experts believe.\nThe cases were first identified on 15 February by the UK's variant surveillance system. \nExperts suspect it originated in the UK.\nAll 16 individuals who tested positive, and their contacts, have been traced and advised to isolate.\nPHE said the cases were geographically spread across the UK. And it confirmed that surge or mass testing would not be necessary - this is only done for variants of concern (VOC), such as the Brazil one. \nThe UK now has 8 variants on its watch list - 4 VUIs and 4 VOCs.\nMost recently, officials had been trying to track down a person in England known to have been infected with the Brazil VOC. \nThe search was narrowed to 379 households in the south of England, and the case was traced to Croydon. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock has said incidents like this are rare and only occur in around 0.1% of tests. \nIt's not unexpected that variants are appearing or that the virus will continue to change. All viruses mutate as they make new copies of themselves to spread and thrive.\nBut some changes may affect how well current vaccines work. \nScientists are looking at tweaking coronavirus vaccines to keep pace with the new, emerging variants to ensure that they continue to offer high protection against the disease as the virus mutates.  \nThe UK's drug regulator the MHRA has said new vaccines can be fast-tracked through the approval system without \"lengthy\" clinical studies.

      "text": "Germany's vaccine commission has approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab in people aged over 65.\nThe country previously approved it for under-65s only, citing insufficient data on its effects on older people.\nThat led to public scepticism about its effectiveness, with some Germans spurning it and leaving many doses unused.\nBut German Chancellor Angela Merkel said recent studies had now provided enough data to approve it for all ages.\nAnnouncing the commission's decision on Thursday, Health Minister Jens Spahn said the move was \"good news for older people who are waiting for an injection\".\n\"The new data also shows that the vaccine is even more effective when the first and second jabs are administered 12 weeks apart,\" the minister said, adding that the law would be updated to incorporate the new recommendations.\nMrs Merkel said on Wednesday that Germany would follow the UK example of stretching the interval between vaccine doses in order to offer as many people as possible an initial shot.\nVarious studies have shown the AstraZeneca vaccine is highly effective among the elderly.\nBelgium says it will also approve the vaccine for older people, following France earlier this week.\nAbout 5% of Germans have so far received a first vaccine shot.\nThe EU's medical regulator approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all age groups in January.\nBut the rollout was met by some public scepticism after regulators in countries including France, Belgium and Italy recommended that it should not be used for people over 65. Like Germany, they citied insufficient data on its efficacy for older people.\nIn January French President Emmanuel Macron said the jab was \"quasi-ineffective\" for older age groups - a suggestion strongly refuted by the UK government and British medical regulators.\nThe debate came amid an acrimonious dispute between AstraZeneca and the EU over vaccine supplies to member states.\nSince then, stocks of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab have gone unused in several European countries, slowing vaccination efforts.\nMeanwhile the UK - which approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab for all age groups - has offered a first dose of a vaccine to 20.7 million people, almost a third of its population.\nLast week Carsten Watzl, head of the German Society for Immunology, urged his country to change its mind on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIn an interview with the BBC, he predicted regulators would have to reverse their decision to not recommend the jab for older people and suggested Mrs Merkel should take the vaccine live on TV to prove it is safe.\nSeparately, Mrs Merkel said she had agreed to a phased easing of restrictions with leaders of Germany's federal states but added that there was the option of an \"emergency brake\" if case numbers got out of control.\n\"We are at the threshold of a new phase of the pandemic that we can go into not carelessly but still with justified hope,\" Mrs Merkel said.\nFrom Monday up to five people from two households will be allowed to meet, with children under 14 exempt. \nSome shops will reopen provided that regional case numbers are below 50 per 100,00 people. If cases rise over 50 per 100,000 then customers will have to book slots to visit shops. If cases rise to over 100 per 100,000 over three days in a row then restrictions will be reimposed.\nThe UK has been using the vaccine made by AstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, in its mass immunisation programme since December.\nUK health officials say it provides \"high levels of protection\" for all ages. \nNo one who received the vaccine in trials was admitted to hospital or became seriously ill with Covid-19.\nThe vaccine is given via two injections to the arm, the second between four and 12 weeks after the first."

      "tags": "Scottish government,Alex Salmond inquiry,Alex Salmond case,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish Parliament,SNP (Scottish National Party)",
      "text": "For 10 years Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon showed how to be a successful political duo. They campaigned hard, won elections and brought to the fore a shared dream of Scottish independence. That irresistible combo is gone, having given way to personal silences and a public war of words. As MSPs continue investigating the Scottish government's mishandling of complaints against Mr Salmond, we look at their story.\nAs the clock ticked past midday, I waited in the first minister's walnut panelled office for Nicola Sturgeon to give her first interview on the scandal.\nIt was Friday 24 August 2018 - the day the Daily Record splashed on allegations of sexual misconduct made against her predecessor, Alex Salmond.\nThe first minister was said to be so upset that her advisers worried she might cry on camera.\nWhen it came to it, Nicola Sturgeon kept her composure but there was clear emotion in the interview that followed. Her voice wavered slightly when she told me how \"incredibly difficult\" the situation was.\nAt about the time she was speaking to me, Alex Salmond was telling journalists gathered around a Linlithgow pub table that while he was \"no saint\" he had not harassed anyone.\nThe Scottish government had investigated complaints about him from two civil servants, under a new procedure signed off by Nicola Sturgeon. That was not news to the first minister because Alex Salmond had told her privately about the investigation several months before.\nWhat then could have brought Scotland's leader close to tears?\nThis was, of course, a watershed moment when a private burden finally had to be shouldered in public. And, according to one source close to Nicola Sturgeon what was also significant was confirmation from the civil service that it had sufficient confidence in its investigation to refer the complaints to the police. That is said to have shattered the first minister's confidence in the denials Alex Salmond had given her.\nHaving controversially met or spoken to him five times during the investigation - in which she insists she played no part - she broke off contact with him in July.\nNicola Sturgeon's long standing alliance with her predecessor was in the process of breaking down and the day of the Daily Record scoop was probably when it became irretrievable. Alex Salmond was effectively at war with the government he once led and therefore with the woman who replaced him - his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Nicola Sturgeon.\nThere was a lot to cry about. \nThe Salmond/Sturgeon association spans three decades - she had backed him for the party leadership in 1990 and he encouraged her to stand for Westminster two years later, when she was just 21.\n\"He believed in me long before I believed in myself,\" she once said.\nAlex Salmond was a mentor, ally and friend. You could trace his influence in her early speaking style and in the way she sometimes scoffed at rivals during debate.\nHe appointed her to the SNP front bench when they were both elected to Holyrood in 1999. However, a little over a year into the new parliament Alex Salmond gave up the leadership, passing the reins to John Swinney. When he resigned in 2004 Nicola Sturgeon made her move for the top party job.\nThe then 34-year-old entered the contest, but when it looked like she would lose to rival Roseanna Cunningham Alex Salmond came to the rescue. His decision to make a leadership comeback saved her from defeat. Instead, she became a winner, running as his deputy on what they styled as a joint ticket.\nThis was the beginning of the powerful political partnership that has dominated Scottish politics and made a big impact on the UK political scene in the early part of this century. They led the SNP into government for the first time in 2007, to an overall majority at Holyrood in 2011 and within touching distance of independence in 2014.\nThey worked well together. Not least because Alex Salmond tended to let Nicola Sturgeon and other trusted ministers do their jobs without interference. As his deputy, her skills and personality seemed to complement his. Where he revelled in the spotlight, she was more naturally reserved. While he enjoyed painting the big picture, she was content to fill in the detail.\nThey offered each other advice and challenge in private, and presented a united front in public - a discipline upon which the SNP's success was built.\nThat's not to say there were no disagreements. When the NHS faced a budget squeeze after the financial crash, Nicola Sturgeon took a stand. According to one Alex Salmond ally, she \"pushed very hard\" to protect cash spending and won the first minister's support. Had she failed, another source said, she was prepared to resign.\nNicola Sturgeon's confidence grew further during the independence campaign. From 2012, she took charge of referendum preparations as the Scottish government's so called \"Yes\" minister. It was during this period that she started coming into her own, establishing an approach that was distinct from his.\nContrast, for example, the responses they gave to protests by independence supporters against the BBC. Alex Salmond defended those involved, arguing they must be allowed to express a view. Nicola Sturgeon advised that they spend their time campaigning for a \"Yes\" vote rather than against the BBC.\nWhere he could be strident, she was more pragmatic is how one source close to Alex Salmond put it.\nWhile their relationship remained strong throughout the referendum there were points of tension.\nNicola Sturgeon was frustrated not to be involved in Alex Salmond's preparation for his first debate with the pro-Union leader Alistair Darling. The head-to-head, hosted by STV, saw Alex Salmond struggle with currency questions.\nWhen he set off for China in November 2013 without leaving detailed comments on the latest draft of the independence White Paper, her team questioned his commitment. The first minister's feedback would eventually filter through from the People's Republic.\nNone of this caused a serious rift between them - that would come later, once Alex Salmond had left office.\nOn 18 September 2014 the independence vote was lost by 55% to 45% and within two months of that date Alex Salmond was gone as party leader and first minister.\nAs Nicola Sturgeon prepared to take over, she acknowledged Alex Salmond had left \"big boots to fill\".\nHowever, she also asserted her political independence. \"I will wear my own shoes\" she said \"and they will have higher heels\".\nShe promised a more female friendly-leadership that would give priority to key issues of gender equality and seek to advance the interests of women. That's a pledge that may have weighed heavily as she thought of her response to the #MeToo movement a few years later.\nThe key point about this transfer of power is that it fundamentally changed this political couple's relationship. She was no longer the understudy, she was now the principal performer.\nThe new first minister travelled the country, addressing large audiences in what became known as her \"rock star tour\" and under her leadership the SNP won spectacularly at the 2015 Westminster election. \nBy contrast, Alex Salmond's political power was on the wane. He could have pursued a career in business, academia or on the lecture circuit but he could not resist the pull of politics.\nAs part of the 2015 landslide, he returned to Westminster, as MP for Gordon, in search of a new role. The party appointed him international affairs spokesman with a certain licence to stir things up. Friends said it was difficult for him to adjust. According to one MP, he did not take kindly to no longer driving the bus.\nWhen Alex Salmond publicly suggested a referendum might not be the only route to independence, the new driver asserted her authority. Nicola Sturgeon made clear that winning a referendum was now the established way to leave the UK.\nWithin a few months of replacing him, Nicola Sturgeon dropped Alex Salmond's policy of a blanket 3p cut to corporation tax in the event of independence. He was not consulted. He was, however, brought into the loop for some decisions, such as the ill-fated call for indyref2 in early 2017.\nThey were still in touch but nothing like as much as when they were partners in power. With one at Westminster and the other at Holyrood, they saw each other less and were gradually drifting apart.\nThe relationship deteriorated more seriously after the 2017 general election which saw Alex Salmond defeated for the first time in 30 years of parliamentary service.\nWhen Nicola Sturgeon phoned to offer her commiserations, she found Alex Salmond unavailable. It was, apparently, two or three weeks before they spoke.\nAlex Salmond was dealing with the death of his father around that time as well as the loss of his parliamentary seat. But there was something else.\nA friend of his said he was \"not very impressed\" with the SNP's election campaign, considering it insubstantial and lacking in energy and purpose. The party lost 21 of its 56 seats in this first election after the Brexit referendum and the Scottish Conservatives won 13 - enough to sustain Theresa May in office with help from the DUP.\nIf that was one source of tension in Alex Salmond's relationship with his successor, others soon emerged as he began a new career outside politics. Appearing in his own show at the Edinburgh Fringe, Alex Salmond was accused of sexism when he explained the absence of any high profile female guests with the double entendre that he \"couldn't make them come\".\nNicola Sturgeon said he was \"not sexist\" just as she had done two years earlier when Alex Salmond told Conservative minister, Anna Soubry in the Commons to \"behave yourself woman\". The first minister's defence of her predecessor was more qualified this time. She said he was not always as funny as he thought and that perhaps his joke belonged in the era of Benny Hill.\nIt was apparent to some in the SNP that she was wearying of him. As one MP put it, he was \"seen as a nuisance\" by the leadership during 2017.\nThe lowest point came in November of that year, when it was announced that Alex Salmond was to host his own show on the Kremlin-backed TV station, RT. Nicola Sturgeon has since spoken of her \"incredulity\" at this decision. It would increase the distance between them. As one Nicola Sturgeon ally put it - \"the first minister cannot take advice from a presenter on Russian state TV\".\nThe week before Alex Salmond's TV show was announced, SNP MSP Mark McDonald was forced to resign as a Holyrood minister over inappropriate behaviour. \nThe Scottish government's wider response to the #MeToo movement, following this departure, would set these political titans on a collision course. There was speculation that if Mr McDonald stood down, Alex Salmond might want to fight the Aberdeen Donside by-election.\nAccording to friends of Alex Salmond that was wrong - he had no interest in making another Holyrood comeback and Nicola Sturgeon's team did not take it seriously either. Even if they found him annoying, they did not appear to regard him as a political threat. They would not however have been unaware that Alex Salmond had helped nurture new talent at Westminster, including the QC turned MP, Joanna Cherry, whom some see as a future leader.\nWhat appeared to be of concern to team Sturgeon in November 2017 was an enquiry from Sky News about allegations of sexually inappropriate behaviour by Alex Salmond at Edinburgh Airport. He denied wrongdoing and nothing was broadcast at the time, but according to a later account from Nicola Sturgeon, it raised suspicions about her predecessor's conduct.\nOn the first minister's instruction, the Scottish government was revising its procedures for dealing with complaints of bullying and harassment against ministers, following Mr McDonald's resignation. Nicola Sturgeon specifically told the civil service that the new policy could apply to former ministers and she put that in writing after the Sky News enquiry.\nThis note was sent after her private secretary met a potential complainer against Alex Salmond from within the civil service. The Scottish government insists the first minister did not know about that.\nSupporters of Alex Salmond suspected the new policy was designed with him in mind, however, the Scottish government rejects that claim. What is clear is that Nicola Sturgeon chose an approach that would not exempt her predecessor.\nHad she decided otherwise, there might never have been a scandal. Alternatively, one might have blown up in the media anyway and she might have faced criticism for protecting an old friend.\nComplaints of sexual harassment against Alex Salmond from two female civil servants were lodged and a seven month investigation by the Scottish government followed. Those findings were shelved when the 66-year-old successfully challenged the complaints handling process in court. It decided the investigation was \"tainted by apparent bias\" and he was awarded more than \u00a3500,000 in legal costs.\nBut the former first minister faced a much bigger legal battle ahead.\nIn January 2019, Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond was arrested and charged with a string of sexual offences against women he had worked with at the Scottish government or the SNP, during his term as first minister.\nWhen he looked at the names on the charge sheet - according to a Salmond ally - \"that was when it hit him\" that this could be a conspiracy.\nOne of those who testified against him in court has since told the BBC that it is \"utterly absurd\" to suggest nine women would perjure themselves as part of a political plot. Their evidence did not persuade a jury to convict and on 23 March last year - hours before the UK went into coronavirus lockdown - he was acquitted of the 13 sexual assault charges he faced.\nAlex Salmond is now trying to expose what he believes was a conspiracy, accusing Nicola Sturgeon of multiple rule breaches including misleading the Scottish Parliament. She denies his claims.\nTheir toxic feud has destroyed their relationship and caused deep divisions within the SNP. It also threatens damage to the first minister's reputation and to the independence dream she still shares with Alex Salmond. While she seems confident of weathering the storm, her credibility has hardly been enhanced by the revisions she's made to her story along the way. \nFor example, having told Holyrood she learned about the investigation into Alex Salmond directly from him, she now acknowledges that \"allegations of a sexual nature\" were mentioned at a meeting she had days earlier and claims to have forgotten. \nExactly what did she know and when, what meetings were held and why, where does party business end and government business begin? These are the questions being picked over by a committee of MSPs at Holyrood.\nThe inescapable point is that Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon cannot both be telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth as they are obliged to do under oath before the committee.\nWhat started three years ago with complaints about the former first minister's behaviour has led to intense scrutiny of Nicola Sturgeon's conduct in handling those complaints. If Alex Salmond can prove his allegations, a clamour for her resignation will follow - ironically at a time when her party and its goal of independence are polling strongly.\nIf his claims are not proven, he is unlikely to give up the fight. Some of his supporters have called for him to be readmitted to the SNP. Others hope that he will stand in this May's Holyrood election for one of the newly formed independence parties.\nWhile those who know him well think that unlikely, they note he has not publicly ruled it out. As one MP put it \"you just never know what Alex is going to do next\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nUpdated Covid vaccines to fight variants like the one from Brazil can be fast-tracked through the approval system, says the UK's regulator. The MHRA says it will check for proof the shots trigger protective antibodies in the blood but aims to avoid the need for lengthy trials, allowing for approval within months, rather than years. A similar fast-track method is already used for annual flu vaccines. \nA marked decline in coronavirus infections between January and February may have slowed, according to scientists tracking coronavirus in England. Infections have fallen by two-thirds during lockdown, but one in 200 people still have the virus, the regular Imperial College React study suggests.\nAnti-poverty campaigners are criticising a Budget decision to limit to six months the extension of a \u00a320 uplift to universal credit, introduced last April in response to the pandemic. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation says single recipients will see their incomes cut, just as the furlough scheme ends and unemployment is expected to peak. Meanwhile, the Resolution Foundation think tank - which focuses on living standards - predicts inequality will rise.\nAll secondary school pupils could be required to wear face coverings in Scotland's classrooms and corridors when the phased return to school begins on 15 March. Currently only S4 to S6 pupils are asked to wear masks in classrooms but a Scottish government advisory group says this should be extended to pupils in S1 to S3. Updated government guidance is due next week.\nFor so many of us, it's been too long since a simple hug with a loved-one has been a possibility. Jenn Nimmo-Smith describes how it felt to embrace her mum for the first time in almost a year, after the rules on visits to care homes were relaxed in Scotland.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nHere are the new rules relating to the furlough scheme.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Sutton Coldfield,Birmingham,Pregnancy",
      "text": "On 3 March 2016, Natalie Queiroz shared a picture on social media of her rapidly growing baby bump. She was eight months pregnant and looking forward to the birth of her daughter and life with partner Babur \"Bobby\" Raja. Twenty-four hours later she was being flown by air ambulance to hospital. She had been stabbed more than 20 times, and paramedics feared for the lives of both her and her unborn child.\nAhead of the fifth anniversary of the attack, I met Natalie at the scene - Trinity Hill in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham. \nHer hands were shaking and she described being back as \"really, really tough\", adding: \"To think this could have been the final place I would have been [alive].\" Revisiting the scene has become part of how she has dealt with the trauma. \nNatalie, 45, remembers most of what happened vividly.  It was raining, she had her coat pulled up and was holding an umbrella as she walked towards the town centre. Her mind was on shopping.\n\"I just remember these footsteps running behind me,\" she said. She feared she was about to be mugged, but felt she was safe because she was such a short distance from the shops, and, as it was 15:00, there were plenty of people about. That's when her attacker jumped her from behind and began stabbing her.\nShe desperately held on to her bump to try to protect her baby, but described the attack as \"incessant\". Two men intervened and tried to drag the attacker off her, incurring injuries themselves.\nNatalie didn't know who the knifeman was. Raja, her partner, had disguised his appearance and had a hood covering his face. She told me that she caught a glimpse and thought it was him, but then disregarded the idea. \nAs the others fought with Raja, Natalie tried to escape. Despite bleeding heavily she managed to get to her feet and stagger away. \"I was looking at the town centre\u2026 and I remember thinking 'I've just got to get there, because if I can get there, I can get help'.\"\nHer wounds were too severe and she collapsed next to a wall and passed out. \"The two guys who'd been holding the attacker said they thought that I'd gone - they thought that that was it, that I had died.\"  \nRaja managed to fight off the other men and came at Natalie again just as she regained consciousness. \"I put my head down and he pulled up in front of me, and he crouched down and he began the attack again.\"\nNatalie doesn't remember much of what happened next. A third rescuer, Callum Gibson, had run up Trinity Hill and joined the other men, John Mitchell and Anthony Smith, in finally stopping Raja's attack. West Midlands Police officers arrived to help, and closed nearby roads to allow an air ambulance to land.\nNatalie had suffered eleven chest wounds, her right lung had collapsed and she had also been stabbed in the liver and uterus.  \nParamedics stabilised her as she was taken to hospital. Natalie had regained consciousness again, but there seemed to be little hope for her child. \"To be honest, we all thought she'd passed away,\" she said.\nNatalie underwent lifesaving surgery and was put into an induced coma. It was only when she came round that she was given the news her daughter had survived and had been safely delivered by Caesarean section. \"To get that news, that she was alive, was almost incomprehensible.\"\nIn June 2016, Raja pleaded guilty at Birmingham Crown Court to attempted murder and was jailed for 18 years. During the hearing, at which Natalie was present, the court heard he attacked her after being forced to choose between his conservative Muslim mother's faith and the \"love of his life\". This, it was said, had \"tipped him over the edge\". \nA court order remains in place meaning that Natalie's daughter cannot be named. On Thursday, the family has been celebrating her fifth birthday. It will be impossible to keep the full details of the story from the little girl forever. As she grows up, Natalie is gradually explaining to her what happened, but she doesn't know everything yet.\n\"She's a funny little girl with a big heart... she knows that mummy got hurt the day she was born, she knows it was very serious, and that mummy went in a helicopter... she knows that because of what happened she had to be born that day.\" \nNatalie is amazingly upbeat despite what happened. She still suffers physically because of some of her wounds, but jokes that her breast implants saved her life. She has also visited Raja in prison despite being warned against it.\nShe said it was a cathartic experience. \"I needed to face him and I needed to look him in the eye.\" However he still wouldn't fully acknowledge what happened. He has also sent her letters in which he said he was \"proud\" of the way she had dealt with the attack. She sees this as an attempt at controlling behaviour.  \nI asked her whether she ever thought she would be able to achieve closure.\n\"Anyone who's been through a major trauma will say you never get over it, you learn to live with it and it becomes part of your life. I've dealt with it by all my fundraising and talking to young people about the reality of knife crime\u2026 to me that's the best way of coming to terms with everything.\" \nNatalie's positivity is clear in the work she's undertaken since the attack. She has already raised tens of thousands of pounds for Midlands Air Ambulance and is to walk the 140 miles between its three bases in four days as soon as it is possible. \nShe also has something else to look forward to. Last year she got engaged to Simon Lyttle, a fellow fundraiser, and once lockdown is over they will be married. \nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "There could be \"opportunities\" to open some of the economy earlier in Wales compared with England, the first minister has said.\nMark Drakeford said he would not want to deny firms the chance to resume trading while he waits \"for somebody else to be in the position we have already arrived at\".\nHe said coronavirus rates in Wales are \"significantly lower\" than in England.\nUnder Welsh plans hairdressers and some shops may reopen on 15 March.\nThat is earlier than England, which does not plan to open hairdressers and non-essential shops until 12 April.\nHowever the Welsh government has been criticised for not laying out a more detailed plan for exiting lockdown.\nSpeaking at the Welsh Affairs Select Committee at Westminster, Mr Drakeford said lifting lockdown restrictions would be \"broadly aligned\" across the whole of the UK and all governments would look to reopen parts of society \"as conditions allow\". \nHe said Wales may be able to \"restore some economic activity earlier than the prime minister's roadmap currently suggests\".\n\"I wouldn't want to deny businesses in Wales the chance to get back trading because we were waiting for somebody else to be in the position we had already arrived at.\"\nMr Drakeford, who was speaking to the committee from self-isolation after coming into contact with someone with Covid-19, also told the committee that his relationship with the prime minister was \"remote\".\nHe said he had only met the prime minister \"once myself\".\nHe said: \"The remoteness isn't just in that way, I'm afraid we rarely have a meeting of minds.\" \nHe told the committee that there were some areas where the UK government engagement with Welsh ministers had been \"good\", and there were some places where it \"falls far short of what would be properly expected\". \nMr Drakeford said his \"anxiety\" about the lack of regular engagement between the Prime Minister and other parts of the United Kingdom it was that, without that architecture, \"the security of the United Kingdom becomes more difficult\".\nIn response, Preseli Pembrokeshire MP Stephen Crabb said Welsh Secretary Simon Hart had described an \"opening of doors\" within UK government to the devolved nations during the pandemic but that this was \"not reciprocated.\" \nMr Drakeford said he \"wouldn't accept that characterisation\".\n\"When the UK government is discussing matters in which there are devolved responsibilities at stake, then to greater or lesser extents we get invited to participate in those meetings.\" \nAndrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, said the first minister should urgently provide a roadmap for reopening businesses, instead of a \"drip, drip of information\" in committees.\n\"Thousands of livelihoods are on the line so if we can act to save Welsh jobs then Labour ministers should do so,\" he said."

Sir Alex resigned in response.\nIn his report, Sir Alex found Ms Patel's \"approach on occasions has amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals.\"\n\"To that extent her behaviour has been in breach of the ministerial code, even if unintentionally,\" he concluded. \nThe FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, has launched legal action to try to get Mr Johnson's decision overturned at the High Court.\nMs Patel apologised for her alleged behaviour, saying \"any upset I have caused was completely unintentional\". \nMr Johnson said he did not think Ms Patel was a bully, and had \"full confidence\" in her.\nIn a statement issued via the FDA civil servants' union on Thursday, Sir Philip said he was \"pleased\" the government had settled his unfair dismissal claim.\n\"I now look forward to the next stages of my career,\" he added. \nOn its official website, the government said it \"regrets the circumstances surrounding Sir Philip's resignation\".\n\"The government and Sir Philip are now pleased that a settlement has been reached to these proceedings,\" a spokesperson added. \nMr Thomas-Symonds said Ms Patel still had \"very serious questions to answer about her conduct\", and Mr Johnson had \"shown terrible judgement\". \n\"It can't be right that his adviser on ministerial standards resigned when he found that the home secretary bullied colleagues, while the home secretary herself remained in post,\" he added."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,Brandon Lewis,Brexit",
      "text": "The EU says a UK move to unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks will be a breach of international law.\nNorthern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods so products arriving from GB undergo EU import procedures.\nThe grace periods mean procedures and checks are not yet fully applied.\nThe first of these periods will expire at the end of March, but the UK has said it will be extended until October.\nEuropean Commission Vice President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the move amounted to \"a violation of the relevant substantive provisions\" of the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland, known as the NI Protocol.\nHe said the EU would respond in accordance with the \"legal means\" established by the protocol and the wider Brexit deal.\nFollowing a call on Wednesday evening between Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d and Lord Frost, the Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for EU relations, a UK government spokesperson said \"official-level notification\" of the move was made to the commission earlier this week.\nThe spokesperson said Lord Frost underlined the extension was needed for \"operational reasons\" and such measures were \"well precedented in other international trade arrangements, and that they were entirely consistent with our intention to discharge our obligations under the Protocol in good faith\".\nIrish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the UK government's move clearly undermined its commitment to the implementation of the protocol and described the unilateral decision as \"deeply unhelpful\".\nHe said he had made his regret over the decision clear to Lord Frost and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis.\nThe grace period affects supermarkets and other retailers, which face having to provide export health certificates for all shipments of animal products.\n\"For supermarkets and their suppliers, as part of the operational plan the UK committed to at the UK-EU Joint Committee on 24 February, the current Scheme for Temporary Agri-food Movements to Northern Ireland will continue until 1 October,\" said a government statement.\n\"Certification requirements will then be introduced in phases alongside the roll out of the Digital Assistance Scheme.\"\nIt is understood the government is describing this to the EU as an \"operational easement\", rather than a formal extension of the grace period.\nIt is using the example of how the Irish government temporarily relaxed safety and security declarations on products arriving from GB in January.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. \nIt does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods.\nThat has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\nUnionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it has damaged internal trade from GB to NI and poses a risk to the future of the UK union.\nBut anti-Brexit parties in NI say that it must be implemented in full, and that issues should be worked out through joint UK-EU processes.\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster welcomed the move and said the EU had refused to deal with an issue that \"would have caused a huge amount of problems for us at our ports\".\nThe DUP leader added that it showed the UK government \"can go further, so we need to see permanent solutions\". \nHowever, her deputy first minister, Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill, described the government's decision as \"another unilateral attempt to override what has been agreed\". \n\"What everyone should be focused on is achieving agreement to find solutions to the issues that are outstanding, but it's very clear the protocol must be made to work.\"\nSimon Hoare, the chairman of Westminster's NI Affairs Select Committee, tweeted that the case for extending the grace periods was \"compelling\" but that the unilateral move struck him as an \"approach most likely to have negative/unhelpful consequences\". \nThe Labour Party's shadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh said the Prime Minister should \"show some responsibility and find the lasting solutions with the EU that are the only way to give businesses the certainty they are crying out for\". \nIn Northern Ireland, reaction has been mixed, with Alliance Party MP Stephen Farry welcoming the extension of grace periods but warning of \"long-term detrimental consequences for Northern Ireland\" over the government's unilateral action. \nUlster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken, meanwhile, described the protocol as \"unsalvageable\" and criticised the EU and Irish government for reacting in a \"dramatic, over-the-top manner to what are minimal changes\".\n\"Simon Coveney and his EU counterparts are showing gravity-defying levels of arrogance and hypocrisy, given their past actions,\" he added. \nThe government said further guidance will be provided later this week on a grace period for parcel movements from GB to NI.\nIt is due to to end on 1 April, meaning all parcels would need customs declarations.\nGuidance will also be set out in regard to the issue of soil attached to the movement of plants, seeds, bulbs, vegetables and agricultural machinery.\nUnder the terms of the Brexit deal, soil from Great Britain is not permitted to enter Northern Ireland as it conflicts with EU plant regulations."

      "text": "The US has agreed to suspend tariffs on UK goods including single malt whiskies that were imposed in retaliation over subsidies to the aircraft maker Airbus. \nTariffs will also be lifted on UK cheese, cashmere and machinery.\nThe duties will be suspended for four months while the two sides seek a long-term settlement.\nOn 1 January, the UK dropped its own tariffs on some US goods, put in place over a related dispute about US subsidies to Boeing.\nIt is the latest twist in a decades-old trade row that has seen the EU and the US target billions of dollars worth of each other's exports with taxes.\nThe UK is part of the dispute as a former EU member. Airbus makes wings and other parts in the UK, but assembles its commercial aircraft in the EU.\nIt has hit Scotch whisky producers particularly hard as the US is a key export market. Distilleries have reported \u00a3500m of losses since 2019 due to the tariffs. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the trade truce, due to come into force on Monday, would boost British business.\n\"From Scotch whisky distillers to Stilton-makers, the US decision to suspend tariffs on some UK exports today will benefit businesses right across the UK,\" he tweeted.\n\"Fantastic news as we strengthen the UK-US trading relationship and work to build back better from the pandemic.\"\nSimon Cotton, boss of Speyside-based textiles firm Johnston's of Elgin, says he's \"absolutely delighted\" the tariffs have been suspended. \nThe company, which employs 850 people, has been taking a \"25% hit\" on every knitwear product it exports to the US - \"a significant cost\" at a time when Covid and Brexit also pose challenges.\nIn Speyside many other businesses have felt the impact of the US tariffs, including whisky distilleries and shortbread makers. \n\"This has been a particularly difficult tax for the businesses here, so it's a huge relief for the region,\" says Mr Cotton. \"We're hoping this paves the way for a permanent removal of these tariffs.\"\nKaren Betts, head of the Scotch Whisky Association, called the suspension \"fabulous news\".\n\"The tariff on single malt Scotch whisky exports to the US has been doing real damage to Scotch whisky in the 16 months it has been in place, with exports to the US falling by 35%,\" she said.\n\"So today, everyone in our industry - from small companies to large - is breathing a sigh of relief.\"\nFor more than a decade, the EU and US accused each other of propping up their home aviation markets with tax breaks, research grants and other aid.\nBut tensions flared in 2019, when former US president Donald Trump retaliated by putting tariffs on $7.5bn (\u00a35.4bn) of EU goods, including UK products such as whisky.\nLast November, the EU hit back by targeting $4bn of American goods with duties as punishment for US subsidies for Boeing.\nSince it left the EU, the UK has been lobbying Washington to drop the duties on its goods as it seeks a wide-ranging trade deal with the US. Talks with Washington abruptly broke off in January but resumed after Joe Biden became US president. \nMr Biden's top trade nominee, Katherine Tai, has said she will make it a priority to resolve the row with the EU and Britain - although for now US tariffs continue to apply to EU goods.\nIn a joint statement on Thursday, the UK and the US said that the suspension would \"ease the burden on industry and take a bold, joint step towards resolving the longest-running disputes at the World Trade Organization\".\nThe two countries added that it would also allow time to focus on negotiating \"a balanced settlement to the disputes, and begin seriously addressing the challenges posed by new entrants to the civil aviation market from non-market economies, such as China\".\nAirbus welcomed the removal of \"lose-lose tariffs\" and urged the UK and US governments to reach a long-term settlement. \nMore than \u00a3500m-worth of whisky sales have been lost since October 2019, when the 25% tariff was introduced on single malt Scotch. Smaller distillers were hit hardest.\nThe US is the biggest single-nation export market by value. President Trump's US Trade Representative reckoned it was a good source of political leverage in the 17-year trade dispute over aircraft manufacturing.\nScottish cashmere sweaters were also targeted. In the political calculation of trade disputes, the US did not include Irish whiskey or Italian cashmere, giving them the opportunity to exploit the rift and grow market share.\nIt was not until last autumn that the European Union and the UK won the right, at the World Trade Organisation, to hit back over Boeing subsidies by US governments. That levelled the field on which to negotiate a resolution. \nDonald Trump used trade tariffs as a bludgeon intended to protect American jobs, and although Joe Biden is not noted as an enthusiast for globalisation and free trade, this suspension of tariffs signals his administration is in the business of negotiated deals between partners.\nIt acknowledges the trans-Atlantic partners should perhaps focus more on manufacturing competition from China. But there is work to be done: the EU, UK and US have not only the Boeing/Airbus dispute to resolve, but another one over steel and aluminium, which explains the 25% tariff currently on imported American whiskey.\nFor Liz Truss and the UK government's attempts to secure post-Brexit trade deals, this is a significant step forward. It seems the Biden administration is not prioritising the European Union ahead of Britain. However, a UK-US free trade deal is a long way from here."

      "text": "A tax cut for Scottish house buyers will end as planned on 1 April, despite an extension in the Westminster budget.\nThe starting point for land and buildings transaction tax (LBTT) was increased during the first lockdown.\nFinance Secretary Kate Forbes said the move had \"achieved\" its goal of supporting the recovery of the residential property market.\nThe stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland will continue for another three months.\nLast year, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the tax break on house sales in England and Northern Ireland of up to \u00a3500,000 as part of his summer statement of measures to respond to the coronavirus crisis.\nBecause housing and residential taxes are devolved to Holyrood, this meant there were calls for Ms Forbes to mirror the stamp duty cut in its Scottish equivalent, LBTT.\nAt the time, Ms Forbes said she had listened to calls and the threshold where the tax kicks in was raised from \u00a3145,000 to \u00a3250,000 - although this did not apply to second homes.\nShe announced levels would return to normal at the end of the financial year when she set out the Scottish budget in January., saying support would continue for first time buyers.\nOn Wednesday, the chancellor said the tax break in England and Northern Ireland would continue until the end of June. After that, the nil rate band will be set at \u00a3250,000 - double its standard level - until the end of September.\nMr Sunak told MPs the extra move was \"to smooth the transition back to normal - and we will only return to the usual level of \u00a3125,000 from October 1\".\nMs Forbes told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland she intended to \"stick to the original plan\" and end the relief by April.\nShe said: \"It was intended to support the recovery of the residential property market this financial year. \n\"That has been achieved - the nil rate band was already lower in Scotland and yet we've seen record high levels of transactions and house purchases, so it has achieved its purpose. \n\"But ultimately, when it comes to tax policy, I have choices and the number one ask from business was to extend the 100% relief for non-domestic rates - that's what I've done alongside freezing council tax to help households in need.\"\nOn the Westminster budget, Ms Forbes said \"storm clouds of austerity\" were on the horizon and that despite a number of positive measures including the extension of the furlough scheme, Mr Sunak was \"delaying a lot of the pain until next year\".\nMr Sunak told the programme that there was an increase of \u00a3400bn to \u00a3500bn by end of this Parliament in his public spending plans.\nHe said: \"The damage coronavirus has done to our economy and public finances has been extraordinary and it's going to take time for us to fully recover from this. \n\"It's not going to be dealt with overnight and that's why we've set out a clear plan that begins to fix the problem and protect the things we care about, like public services and supporting small businesses and crucially supporting our recovery in the short term.\""

      "tags": "NI Brexit,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Simon Coveney,European Union,Brexit",
      "text": "DUP leader Arlene Foster has accused the Irish government of \"ignoring\" unionist concerns over the NI Protocol.\nIt comes after Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the EU could not trust the UK in post-Brexit talks.\nOn Wednesday, Number 10 said it would unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks, a move the EU said was a breach of international law.\nBut Sinn F\u00e9in Vice-President Michelle O'Neill said it was the British government \"acting in bad faith\".\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the problems were technical and could be solved.\nThe grace periods mean procedures and checks are not yet fully applied.\nNorthern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods so products arriving from GB undergo EU import procedures.\nThe first of these periods will expire at the end of March, but the UK has said it will be extended until October.\nEarlier, Mr Coveney said progress was being made on the protocol and the timing of the UK's move could not be worse. \nBut Mrs Foster, Northern Ireland's first minister, told a news conference that the British government had a commitment to protect the UK's internal market.\n\"It was clear last week that the European Commission was not listening to what was going on in Northern Ireland, there was a need to act,\" she added.\n\"I have to say Simon Coveney should reflect on his comments, he's not listening to the unionist people of Northern Ireland, he's ignoring them, hoping we'll go away - well we'll not go away.\"\nShe said the British government had indicated a \"step-change\" in its approach to dealing with the protocol, but that the DUP would continue to press for an alternative to be drawn up.\nBut Ms O'Neill, Stormont's Deputy First Minister and Mrs Foster's power-sharing partner, said the British government had shown it was \"not true to their word when it comes to negotiations\".\n\"In this case I believe they're on the wrong side of public opinion and international law,\" she added.\n\"The action was completely unnecessary, what the British government has done is another solo run.\"\nShe said she believed negotiations on resolving protocol issues should continue through the UK-EU joint committee, which is scheduled to meet again before the end of March.\nHowever, speaking during a visit to Middlesbrough, the prime minister said: \"We're taking some temporary technical measures to ensure there are no barriers in the Irish Sea, to make sure things flow freely from GB to NI and that's what you'd expect.\n\"I'm sure that with a bit of goodwill and common sense all these technical problems are eminently solvable.\"\nLater, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said it was about \"doing the right thing for consumers and businesses\" in NI.\n\"Sadly the EU hasn't been able to work on a timeframe that works for the supply lines of, for example supermarkets, so we had to make a decision to ensure that we could see a continued flow of products and that supermarkets' supply lines could continue to flow,\" he said.\n\"If we'd have left it any longer we'd have had a risk for businesses and livelihoods of people in just a few weeks time.\nThe European Parliament has declined to set a date for its vote on the EU-UK trade deal in protest at what the EU sees as the UK's unilateral changes.\nEU parliament group chiefs had been expected to set a date this month for its vote at a meeting on Thursday.\nMr Coveney's party leader Leo Varadkar, who is Ireland's t\u00e1naiste (deputy prime minister), said the UK's actions were neither the way a friend, nor \"a respectable, honourable country\", should behave.\nDUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the EU's recent move to trigger Article 16 showed \"very clearly that it remains within their remit to take unilateral action to protect the EU's single market\".\n\"Under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the UK Government has the same power - to act unilaterally to protect the integrity of the UK internal market and trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\nThe EU reversed its Article 16 move within hours of taking the action, following condemnation from Belfast, London and Dublin.\nEuropean Commission Vice President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d later described the move as a mistake which had been made in the \"intensity of the moment\" of trying to secure Covid-19 vaccines. \nThe move by the UK government to unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks put Ireland in an uncomfortable position.\nMr Coveney said Ireland was lobbying at the EU level to obtain easements on trade between GB and Northern Ireland.\nOther Irish MEPs have written to the European Commission calling for an extension.\nBut there will be other member states who will be reluctant to offer any concessions if the UK is going to ride rough-shod over the process.\nSo what could be the end game?\nThe two sides will continue negotiating. The EU says it is looking at legal avenues open to it under both the withdrawal agreement and the wider UK-EU agreement.\nHowever, the UK may question what practical steps the EU will really take if grace periods are extended.\nThe UK statement on Wednesday indicated the extra time gained by an extension of the grace period could be used to develop systems to ease trade between GB and NI in the long term.\nThe UK was also at pains to say it is not walking away from the protocol, it is simply finding ways to implement it.\nOn Wednesday, Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the UK's move to extend grace periods amounted to \"a violation of the relevant substantive provisions\" of the NI Protocol.\nHe said the EU would respond in accordance with the \"legal means\" established by the protocol and the wider Brexit deal.\nFollowing a call on Wednesday evening between Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d and Lord Frost, the Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for EU relations, a UK government spokesperson said \"official-level notification\" of the move was made to the commission earlier this week.\nLord Frost had underlined the extension was needed for \"operational reasons\" and that they were entirely consistent with our intention to discharge our obligations under the Protocol in good faith\", said a government spokesman.\nFurther guidance will be provided later this week on a grace period for parcel movements from Britain to Northern Ireland.\nThat is due to to end on 1 April, meaning all parcels would need customs declarations.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. \nIt does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods.\nThat has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\nUnionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it has damaged internal trade from GB to NI and poses a risk to the future of the UK union.\nBut anti-Brexit parties in NI say that it must be implemented in full, and that issues should be worked out through joint UK-EU processes."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,NHS Wales,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A large rise in Covid vaccine supplies means more jabs should be delivered than ever before from next week, Wales' chief pharmacist has said.\nAndrew Evans has revealed that more than 30,000 doses a day could be administered across the country.\nFigures suggest one million people are likely to have had at least a first vaccine dose within the coming days.\nA total of 942,017 people in Wales have been given a first jab, while 124,781 have now been given the full course.\nThe four UK nations are aiming to vaccinate all adults by the end of July.\nRamping up of deliveries to Wales follows a slowdown during the past fortnight, largely caused by an planned reduction in the Oxford-AstraZeneca supply.\nMr Evans, the Welsh government's chief pharmaceutical officer, said supply increases would allow Wales to \"continue to lead\" other UK nations on vaccine roll out, with teams focused on \"keeping it that way\".\nThe acceleration, he said, could also lead to more vaccination centres being opened and, along with GP surgeries, an increasing number of pharmacies being used.\nIf the momentum continues, Mr Evans said he was confident the milestone of offering a first jab to priority groups five to nine could be met by mid-April.\nHe suggested about 20,000 first doses and 10,000 second doses could be offered each day from next week.\n\"There's capacity within our programme to go as fast as supplies allow,\" he said. \n\"It's been low for the last couple of weeks but it's significantly higher this week - between 150,000 to 160,000 doses - next week we could be back up to in excess of 200,000 - a capacity we know the NHS vaccination programme here has.\n\"We've already been building the vaccination infrastructure with at least 500 locations used at any one time and the increasing availability of the AstraZeneca means more flexibility and allow us to use it in more places.\"\nAlmost 4% of the population in Wales has been given a second vaccine dose - higher than any other UK nation - and Mr Evans suggested the NHS here could continue to \"lead the pack\".\nOn the issue of whether booster vaccines will be needed, he said there were plans being made for \"various scenarios\".\n\"We don't yet know how long the duration of protection the two doses will give. If booster doses are needed later in the year or next year then we will have a plan to deliver those,\" he said.\nSpeaking later to BBC Radio Wales, he added that \"very very few people\" were refusing the vaccine. \n\"Our uptake rate is in excess of 90% for the older groups, in excess of 85% has we come down through those cohorts. There is very little vaccine hesitancy,\" he said.\nResponding to the increase in pace of delivering jabs, Tracy Meredith, head of mass vaccination at Cardiff and Vale Health board, said \"get ready for the boom\".\nThe health board has plans to open an even bigger mass vaccination centre, although the location is not yet known.\n\"We're looking at an addition, looking at something bigger, big in scale, a big space. That's a good position to be in,\" she added. \nThere's a quiet efficiency about the process at the mass vaccination centre in Splott, Cardiff.\nAs people arrive, with their all-important appointment cards in hand - they are guided immediately to a booth, where one of about 20 vaccinators is waiting.\nThe centre has capacity to inoculate 20 people every 10 minutes, compared to four people every 15 minutes in the early days. Which means, subject to supply, 1,320 people can get a Covid jab here every day.\nStudent nurses are part of the effort, having been trained to give the vaccine.\nBeth Reed-Gibbs said she was \"absolutely loving\" being part of the team that offers hope of a way out of the pandemic.\n\"People getting the vaccine are mainly excited, some were a bit anxious for the first dose but now they know there's nothing to worry about.\"\nBarbera Phythian, another student nurse vaccinator, shares that excitement: \"Some people I've given the vaccine to have been shielding for a year.\n\"So they are anxious about seeing people for the first time. But it's honestly a relief for them and they are really grateful to us, which is an amazing feeling.\"\nThis week, ahead of schedule, the centre has also been giving a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine to health and care workers.\nThey include Kim Nash, an essential worker for Cardiff's children's services, who has had her appointment sooner than she was expecting. \n\"I was originally booked in for April, so it's great that so many people are coming through... it means extra security for me and my family.\"\nAlthough ministers have insisted the vaccination effort is not a \"race between nations\" but rather a \"race against the virus\" Mr Evans said the relative speed of roll out here was \"a great thing\" for public protection.\n\"If we're leading the pack we're leading the race against the virus. If we're ahead against everyone else we must be ahead against the virus - that will mean more people protected and that's a great thing for people here,\" he added.\nHe also welcomed research this week that suggested just a first dose of either of the Covid vaccines available in the UK offers significant protection against serious illness, especially in older people. \nNurse Carys Williams, who ensures the flow of people through the vaccination centres remains smooth, knows more than most how crucial this effort is, having been a nurse in intensive care during the first Covid wave.\n\"Before being a supervisor here I was a nurse at critical care at UHW in Cardiff. I did that for 32 years, but unfortunately after the first wave I felt that I needed to change,\" she said.\n\"It was heart-breaking to be honest, it really was. I felt that I just needed to get away after that long and I didn't feel I could give anymore.\n\"I feel every jab I give I think we're making a contribution to lessening the pressure on the NHS and getting us to some kind of normality hopefully, pretty soon.\""

      "tags": "Money,Tax,Personal finance,Housing market,Personal debt,UK taxes,Rishi Sunak,Budget 2021",
      "text": "With lives and livelihoods still at risk, Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget is focused on short-term support for people's jobs and finances.\nBut there are signs of what will happen next and how this will affect the money in your pocket.\nAlthough it was announced in advance, like many other key measures, the extension of furlough is significant for millions of people.\nThe scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages for the hours they cannot work in the pandemic -\u00a0has been extended until September.\nYoung and lower-paid people have been among the most likely to have been furloughed during the pandemic.\nWhile this is designed to protect their jobs from redundancy, many will have found that their income has been a fifth less than they had anticipated over the course of 18 months.\nThe National Living Wage will rise to \u00a38.91 from April, from \u00a38.72. That is a 2.2% rise and will be for people aged 23 and over.\nMoney promised for the vaccine rollout does not directly affect the amount of money that goes into the pockets of individuals.\nBut the extra \u00a31.65bn to help vaccinate every adult by the end of July should mean people can get back to work and the economy can start to recover. \nQuicker jabs mean more jobs protected, which means that incomes can recover or be maintained.\nFurlough supports employed people. The equivalent for the self-employed comes in the form of grants through the Coronavirus Self-Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS).\nFrom next month, claims can be made for a fourth grant worth 80% of three months' average trading profits, up to \u00a37,500 in total.\nThis will then be followed by a fifth grant later in the year, covering May to September.\nHowever, the amount paid will depend on the amount of turnover lost. People whose turnover has fallen by less than 30% will receive a grant that is equivalent to 30% of average trading profits.\nWhile many self-employed people remain ineligible - the source of considerable debate - those who can show they were trading in 2019-20 from their tax returns will now be eligible for the first time. They can receive the fourth and fifth grants.\nAnother source of speculation for months has been the future for a \u00a320-a-week top-up to universal credit.\nThis has been described as a financial lifeline during the pandemic for many of those who have lost jobs or whose finances were already stretched.\nThe chancellor said this would continue for another six months, but would then be withdrawn. \nThose on working tax credits will receive a one-off \u00a3500 payment.\nThe government pledged in its manifesto not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT.\nAlthough income tax is not rising, the tax bill that people may face in future years could go up.\nAt present, people start paying 20% income tax when they earn \u00a312,500 a year. The starting point for paying the higher 40% rate is \u00a350,000.\nThese thresholds will go up to \u00a312,570 and \u00a350,270 in April, but will then be frozen for five years.\nWith these thresholds maintained at the same level until April 2026, many people receiving a pay rise may find themselves in a new tax bracket and having to pay more. \nThe government's official forecaster said this would mean 1.3 million more people paying income tax and one million more paying the higher rate of tax.\nThat will raise a significant amount of money for the Treasury, estimated to be an extra \u00a38bn a year by 2025-26, compared to what would have been the case if thresholds rose in line with the cost of living. \nScotland has some tax-raising powers of its own.\nThe chancellor confirmed that a government guarantee means first-time buyers should get a wider choice of mortgages that require a deposit of just 5% of the loan.\nThis will be available when buying properties worth up to \u00a3600,000.\nHowever, some potential homeowners may still find it hard to get a mortgage if they do not have a regular income, while getting into negative equity if house prices fall is a threat.\nThe new products will be available from next month.\nHowever, while there is support for homeownership, there are no specific policies to help those behind on their rents.\nThis tax break for homebuyers in England and Northern Ireland - as well as similar relief in Scotland and Wales - was due to finish at the end of March. This created a rush, as well as difficulties for some buyers to complete in time.\nThe chancellor has now said that the current stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland - which means no stamp duty is paid on the first \u00a3500,000 of a property purchase - will be extended until 30 June.\nThis relief will be reduced to the first \u00a3250,000 of a purchase until the end of September, before returning to its pre-pandemic level of \u00a3125,000 from the start of October.\nIn total, 46% of sales would be exempt from stamp duty as a result of this policy, according to property portal Zoopla.\nMinisters in Wales have extended its stamp duty break until the end of June.\nAll duties on alcohol will stay as they are, for a second year in a row. These had been earmarked to rise.\nThere has been a freeze on fuel duty for a decade and this will continue for at least another year.\nAbout 60% of the price you pay for fuel is tax - a mixture of fuel duty and VAT.\nThere will be a new savings product designed to raise money for environmental projects.\nThis \"green bond\" will be issued by the government-backed National Savings and Investments (NS&I), which has been criticised by savers and MPs for its customer service performance during the pandemic.\nIt will be issued in the summer, but there are no details yet on the interest rate that will be paid to savers.\nWhat is your reaction to this year's Budget?

      "text": "New Covid vaccines to fight variants like the one from Brazil can be fast-tracked through the approval system, says the UK's regulator the MHRA. \nCurrent vaccines may not work as well against some variants and scientists are working on updating them now. \nBut manufacturers will not need to seek brand new approval or do lengthy clinical studies. \nHowever they will need proof that the shots trigger protective antibodies in the blood.\nThe aim is to shorten the process, where possible, so that vaccine approval could happen in weeks and months, not years.  \nA similar fast-track method is already used for annual flu vaccines which regularly need updating to keep up with a virus that is constantly changing by mutating. \nThe MHRA has issued guidance, along with authorities in Australia, Canada, Singapore and Switzerland, on what checks and measures would be necessary. \nThe coalition of regulators - the ACCESS Consortium - insist no corners will be cut, with safety paramount. \nData from existing coronavirus vaccine trials and ongoing studies on real world use in the millions of people currently getting immunised could be used to support any decision by regulators. \nExisting Covid vaccines already in use - such as the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech one - were developed at incredible speed. The process took around 10 months, instead of a decade in normal times.\nMaking small and relatively simple tweaks to these vaccines to make them a better match for new variants should happen even more quickly.\nCurrent vaccines were designed around earlier versions of coronavirus, but scientists believe they should still offer some protection against the new variants being seen now.  \nIn the UK, public health officials are investigating six cases of the Covid variant first identified in Brazil and are using testing to see if it has spread to more people.\nSurge testing for the South African variant of Covid-19 began on 1 February.\nThe UK government has already announced a deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop vaccines against future variants, with a pre-order of 50 million doses.\nMHRA chief executive Dr June Raine said: \"We don't have evidence at this moment that any of the vaccines in deployment are significantly lacking in effectiveness.\n\"They're effective against Kent and we believe South Africa.\n\"We know that there has been some data from South Africa, we believe effectiveness here is maintained, and we're working hard on the Brazil variant.\n\"As of today there's no imperative that we fast-track a new variant-effective vaccine - but we are prepared.\"\nMHRA Chief Scientific Officer Dr Christian Schneider said: \"Our priority is to get effective vaccines to the public in as short a time as possible, without compromising on safety. Should any modifications to authorised Covid-19 vaccines be necessary, this regulatory approach should help to do just that.\"\nHe said the public could be confident that no vaccine would be approved unless the expected high standards of safety, quality and effectiveness were met.

      "text": "The Duke of Sussex has drawn parallels between the treatment of his mother and wife, in teaser clips of a much-anticipated Oprah Winfrey TV special.\nIn two 30-second clips released by CBS, Harry says he feared history was \"repeating itself\" before he and Meghan decided to step back as senior royals.\nWinfrey is seen asking Meghan if there had been a \"breaking point\" and if she was \"silent or silenced\", but the duchess does not speak in either clip.\nThe US interview airs on 7 March.\nIt is unclear when the programme, Oprah With Meghan And Harry: A CBS Primetime Special, will be shown in the UK.\nIn the full programme Meghan will talk about marriage, motherhood, life as a royal and how she is handling \"intense public pressure\", CBS said.\nPrince Harry has previously said he stepped back from royal duties in order to protect himself and his family from the \"toxic\" environment created in the UK by the press.\nHarry's late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, relinquished the Her Royal Highness title at the time of her divorce from the Prince of Wales in August 1996. \nShe died the following year after a car crash in Paris. The driver had been drinking and the car was being followed by paparazzi on motorbikes when the accident happened.\nIn the clips from the upcoming TV special, an image of a young Prince Harry with Diana is shown as the duke says: \"I can't begin to imagine what it must have been like for her going through this process by herself all those years ago, because it has been unbelievably tough for the two of us - but at least we had each other.\"\nHarry also tells Winfrey: \"My biggest concern was history repeating itself.\n\"For me, I'm just really relieved and happy to be sitting here, talking to you with my wife by my side.\"\nWinfrey is a personal friend of Meghan and attended the couple's wedding in 2018.\nIn the full interview, Meghan and Harry talk about their move to the United States last year and their future plans, according to CBS.\nSpeaking to chat show host James Corden last week, the duke insisted the couple were \"stepping back rather than stepping down\" as senior royals. \nHe said the situation was \"destroying my mental health\" and he \"did what any husband [or] father would do\".\nThese first insights into the much-anticipated Oprah interview are designed to draw us in with their tight editing and dramatic music. \nThey are a flavour of what's to come.\nIn the minute of footage, Meghan doesn't say a word. We'll have to wait for her answers.\nBut the questions that Oprah puts to her hint strongly at upset and frustration. The language is of being silenced and of surviving something.\nThe talk from Harry is of protecting his wife and being able to escape from the pressure and strain they felt.\nIn Oprah, the couple chose a friend to interview them whose style isn't aggressive.\nShe is an expert at getting interviewees to open up and she will have encouraged them to reveal what went wrong behind the palace walls.\nIt is that which will worry the Royal Family and palace officials.\nHow critical have Harry and Meghan been? We will find out when the full interview is broadcast next weekend.\nLast month, it was announced that the duke and duchess would not be returning as working members of the Royal Family.\nThe couple said at the time that \"service is universal\" and offered to continue supporting the organisations they represented.\nPrince Harry and Meghan's honorary military appointments and royal patronages will be redistributed to working members of the Royal Family.\nThe announcement came just days after the couple revealed that they are expecting their second child.\nIt is not known whether Prince Harry and Meghan informed the royal household about their plans to be interviewed. \nBuckingham Palace has declined to comment."

      "tags": "Google,Advertising",
      "text": "Google has promised not to develop any new way of tracking individual users for adverts once it phases out its current method. \nThe tech giant is one of the world's largest advertising sellers and also owns the world's most popular web browser, Chrome. \nBut it is following other browser providers by eliminating third-party tracking cookies. \nThat move is already being looked at by the UK's competition authority. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority said in January that Google's plan to remove the cookies - which would effectively share less information with advertisers - could have a \"significant impact\" on the advertising market and news websites. \nOne group of marketers opposed to the idea claims that Google will gain an advantage by eliminating such cookies, because it has other ways of obtaining personal information from users.\nCookies temporarily store small amounts of information about what a user is doing on a website and are an important part of the modern internet. \nFor example, they can \"remember\" things, such as what is in an online shopping basket or whether a user is logged in. \nBut a third-party tracking cookie can be used to \"follow\" a user from site to site, so a website can \"know\" that you were shopping around for a type of product - like clothes or shoes - and advertise those things to you elsewhere.  \nThose are the type that Google is phasing out, following the lead of some major competitor web browsers, including Mozilla Firefox and Apple's Safari, which already block them by default. \nSome critics had been concerned that Google's plan to stop these cookies would prevent its rivals from building useful catalogues of ad targeting information - but that Google itself might still be able to do so. \nThe company appeared to tackle that idea directly in its new announcement. \n\"Today, we're making explicit that once third-party cookies are phased out, we will not build [alternative] identifiers to track individuals as they browse across the web, nor will we use them in our products,\" the company said in a blog post. \nIt said the knock-on effect was that other providers could end up offering \"a level of user identity for ad tracking across the web that we will not\" (although Firefox and Safari already block the offending cookies by default). \n\"We don't believe these solutions will meet rising consumer expectations for privacy, nor will they stand up to rapidly evolving regulatory restrictions, and therefore aren't a sustainable long-term investment,\" Google said. \nBut that portrayal has been challenged by industry group Marketers for an Open Web, who argue Google will have an unfair advantage.\nDirector James Rosewell said Google hasn't promised to stop personalised marketing, or gathering of data, inside its own products - which would involve changing its product terms and conditions.\nRegulators still need to ensure competition, through legislation, he said, or \"advertisers will have little choice as to where they spend their money\". \nAnd there are fewer privacy advantages for the average user, he argued.\n\"You have one large trillion-dollar company that effectively, through an unfair contract... tracks you more of the time, the only difference is you're going to be logged in, and part of their walled garden.\" \n\"How does that make people more private, or more secure, versus something that doesn't have directly identifiable information -  their name, their email address - it just uses a random string of characters?\" \nThe shift away from cookies has been prompted by years of tightening regulation and increased consumer awareness. \nBut stopping the use of tracking cookies does not prevent all personalised tracking, as the industry has come up with creative solutions to generate personalised data. \nSo-called \"fingerprinting\", for example, tries to use a huge range of details about your device - the type of phone or computer, browser version, language, IP address, or even what fonts you have installed - to identify the machine. \nThe advertiser might not know the person's name, but it can still \"follow\" that unique fingerprint around the web. \nGoogle, which will continue to sell ads, argues that it and other companies need to come up with a solution that \"delivers results\" for advertisers. \nIt now says that people should not have to be tracked invasively in order to \"get the benefits\" of targeted advertising.  \nOne way of doing so, Google said in its blog post, was to \"hide individuals within large crowds of people with common interests\", so that an individual person's browsing history would be difficult to figure out.

      "text": "Singer Ian Brown has pulled out of a festival appearance over his refusal to play events that \"accept vaccination proof as condition of entry\".\nThe former Stone Roses frontman had been due to headline the Neighbourhood Weekender in Warrington in September.\nBut on Wednesday he told fans the set \"will not happen\".\nOrganisers declined to tell the BBC whether audiences would be expected to have the vaccine, but said they would follow government advice.\n\"No decisions will be taken by government until 21 June at the earliest,\" it said in a statement.\nBrown has been vocal in his criticism of the Covid vaccine, using his Twitter account to protest the idea of a \"vaccine passport\" and railing against the use of masks to prevent the spread of the virus.\nBrown has been replaced on the Neighbourhood Weekender line-up by fellow Mancunian indie icons James.\nOfficials from the festival tweeted on Thursday to say they would \"comply with conditions\" set out by the government through the local authority when the gates open.\n\"We are working hard with other festival organisers and look forward to a safe return to open-air events this summer.\"\nThe three-day event, which takes place in the town where Brown was born, will also feature Gerry Cinnamon and Catfish And The Bottlemen.\nIt was originally due to take place in May, but has been postponed until September.\nMany large festivals due to take place earlier this summer, such as Glastonbury and Download, have been forced to cancel again due to the pandemic. \nOthers like the Isle of Wight Festival have been pushed back to give them a better chance of going ahead, after the government announced its plan to slowly ease coronavirus restrictions.\nThis week, Reading and Leeds organiser Melvin Benn told The Telegraph that ticket holders for the late August bank holiday event who have not received a Covid-19 vaccine are likely to be required to take a coronavirus test at home prior to leaving for the events, and will need to show a health passport to gain entry once they arrive.\nMPs were told last month that festivals have the potential to be \"as safe as Sainsbury's\", despite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic - at a House of Commons Culture Select Committee examining the live music sector.\nMore than 20 million people in the UK have had their first dose of a vaccine - over a third of the adult population.\nEarlier this week, Public Health England data showed that a single shot of either the Oxford-AstraZeneca or the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab reduces the chance of needing hospital treatment by more than 80%.\nIt was based on people aged over 80 who were the first to receive the jab. Government scientists praised the result, but stressed that two doses were needed for the best protection.\nLast September, Brown, 58, released a new track questioning the motives behind the national lockdown, and indeed a vaccine. \nLittle Seed Big Tree included lyrics about a \"false vaccine\" and a \"plan to chip us all, to have complete control\" - a conspiracy theory that has repeatedly been debunked.\nThe track arrived just weeks after he caused a stir on social media, by tweeting: \"No lockdown, no tests, no tracks, no masks, no vax.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "There were almost 2,000 excess deaths in Northern Ireland from the start of the pandemic until the end of 2020.\nExcess deaths indicate the number of deaths above what would normally be expected.\nAccording to the NI Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra), the number of excess deaths from 1 March to 31 December 2020 was 1,958. \nThe agency recorded a very similar number of Covid deaths in the same period - 1,903.\nThis increase in mortality represents a 15.4% hike above expected deaths.\nMen represented a higher number (1,045) than women (913).\nThe Nisra bulletin highlights that the vast majority of excess deaths (74.9%) are among those aged 75 and over. \nDeaths recorded as being due to Covid-19 reflect where the virus was described as \"suspected\" or \"probable\" anywhere on the death certificate, including alongside other health conditions. \nNumbers started to climb from June onwards.  \nCompared to previous years the number of excess deaths of people who died at home is much higher. \nIn fact it is nearly 12 times the number of Covid-19 related deaths at home (119) and accounts for 71.3 % of excess deaths during the 10 months. \nAccording to Nisra excess deaths in care homes peaked in April with 297 deaths, which was 119.9% higher than the average number of deaths in the previous five years (24). \nThe analysis in this report compares deaths between March and December 2020 with the average of the previous five years. \nIt is recognised that there could be deaths that occurred in this period, but that have not yet been registered. This is most likely in the more recent months.  \nLocations most affected by excess deaths include Belfast (310) which accounts for 15.8%, then Antrim and Newtownabbey followed by Fermanagh and Omagh. \nDerry City and Strabane had the fewest excess deaths as a proportion of historic deaths.\nOn the cause of death among excess numbers from 1 March to 31 May, Covid-19 accounts for 79.0% of cases. \nThere were 75 deaths due to malignant neoplasm (tumours) while dementia/Alzheimer's disease accounted for 62 deaths."

      "text": "The Duchess of Sussex has said Buckingham Palace could not expect her and Prince Harry to be silent if it was \"perpetuating falsehoods about us\". \nIn a clip of Oprah Winfrey's interview with the couple, Meghan had been asked how she felt about the palace hearing her \"speak your truth today\".\nMeghan also said: \"If that comes with risk of losing things, I mean... there is a lot that has been lost already.\"\nBuckingham Palace is investigating claims the duchess bullied royal staff.\nThe allegations of bullying levelled at Meghan were published after the interview with Oprah was recorded.\nThe interview with Oprah, which will air in the US on Sunday and in the UK on Monday, is expected to detail Harry and Meghan's short period as working royals together before they stepped down for a life in the US.\nIn the 30-second teaser clip released by CBS, Oprah asks the duchess: \"How do you feel about the palace hearing you speak your truth today?\"\nMeghan replies: \"I don't know how they could expect that, after all of this time, we would still just be silent if there is an active role that The Firm is playing in perpetuating falsehoods about us.\"\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex quit their roles as senior working royals in March 2020, and now live in California. \nA report in the Times newspaper on Wednesday claimed the duchess faced a complaint made in October 2018, while the duke and duchess were living at Kensington Palace after their marriage in May of that year.\nA leaked email sent from a staff member, which was published by the newspaper, alleges that Meghan drove two personal assistants out of the household. The report claims she undermined the confidence of a third member of staff.\nIn a statement later, Buckingham Palace - which is responsible for the hiring of royal staff - said it was \"clearly very concerned about allegations in the Times\" and its HR team would look into the circumstances outlined in the article. \n\"The Royal Household has had a Dignity at Work policy in place for a number of years and does not and will not tolerate bullying or harassment in the workplace.\"\nIf anyone thought Prince Harry and Meghan were going to restrict their criticism to the British media, a sector they have made clear they loathe, they should think again. \"The Firm\" - aka the Royal Family and its staff - is clearly in their sights.\nThis isn't directly about the allegations of bullying levelled at Meghan, and also to a lesser degree Harry. They were published after the interview was recorded. But the couple see the allegations as an example of how some people in the palace brief against them.\nWe'll have to wait for the interview to find out exactly what \"falsehoods\" the couple believe have been put out by the palace. The bullying allegations - which are vigorously denied by the couple - are being investigated.  \nBut it's clear that the gloves have come off, and that the ties of family have not restrained the couple as they seek to put their side of the story.\nPast and present royal employees are to be invited to speak in confidence about their experiences of working for Meghan as part of the investigation.\nThe bullying allegations are denied by Meghan and Prince Harry.\nA statement issued by Meghan's spokesman in response to the newspaper's story said: \"The duchess is saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself and is deeply committed to supporting those who have experienced pain and trauma.\n\"She is determined to continue her work building compassion around the world and will keep striving to set an example for doing what is right and doing what is good.\"\nAuthor Anna Pasternak - who wrote a book on Princess Diana - said she thought \"the whole issue stems to when Meghan first entered the Royal Family\".\n\"I think she was na\u00efve, she didn't really understand the monarchy or 'The Firm' as she rightly puts it, and the constricts of royal power. She was naive to think that she could modernise the monarchy, that she could have her voice and could do things her way,\" she told Radio 5 Live.\nBut Rachel C. Boyle, head of interdisciplinary studies at Leeds Beckett University, said the Oprah interview was \"absolutely the right thing to do at this point\".\n\"I feel like Meghan has not been given the opportunity to defend herself or to respond to any of the claims that have previously been made about her in the media, in a space that allows her to express herself.\"\nMeghan and Prince Harry's TV interview with Oprah will be aired on CBS in the US on the evening of Sunday 7 March.\nIn the UK, the interview will be screened on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Monday 8 March.\nCBS has said Meghan will be interviewed about \"stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood\" and \"how she is handling life under intense public pressure\".\nShe will then be joined by Prince Harry, and the couple will speak about their move to the US last year and their future plans.\nIn an earlier clip released by CBS, the Duke of Sussex drew parallels between the treatment of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Meghan.\nJust hours before the interview is aired in the US, a special programme to celebrate Commonwealth Day will be broadcast on BBC One at 17:00 on Sunday 7 March.\nIt comes as Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of Edinburgh has undergone a successful procedure for a pre-existing heart condition and will be remaining in hospital for a number of days."

      "tags": "Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon,SNP (Scottish National Party)",
      "text": "Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been cleared of breaking rules during an investigation into her predecessor, Alex Salmond, but she's been criticised in a separate report by MSPs.\nAn independent report found that Ms Sturgeon did not breach the ministerial code during the Scottish government's botched handling of sexual harassment complaints against Mr Salmond. \nHowever, a separate inquiry by MSPs has described the government's actions as \"deeply flawed\", and questioned some of Ms Sturgeon's evidence. \nThe pair dominated Scottish politics for more than a decade. They led the campaign for Scotland to become independent from the UK. \nAlex Salmond was Scotland's first minister and Scottish National Party leader before Ms Sturgeon, who had been his deputy. She took over after the 2014 independence referendum, which saw Scotland back remaining in the UK by 55% to 45%. \nThe row began when allegations of sexual harassment - strongly denied - were made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants in 2018.\nThe complaints were made after Ms Sturgeon asked for new government policies on sexual harassment to be put in place in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Mr Salmond believed the policy was aimed at him.  \nThe Scottish government eventually admitted it had acted unlawfully. It had to pay Mr Salmond's legal fees of more than \u00a3500,000.\nMr Salmond has accused officials close to Ms Sturgeon - including her husband Peter Murrell, the SNP's chief executive - of plotting against him. They all deny these claims.\nThen, in January 2019, Mr Salmond was arrested and charged with multiple counts of sexual assault, including attempted rape.\nMr Salmond was cleared of all 13 charges - which were alleged to have happened while he was first minister - after a trial last March. \nThe nine women who made the allegations included an SNP politician, a party worker and several current and former Scottish government civil servants and officials. \nIn court, Mr Salmond said the claims made about his alleged conduct were \"deliberate fabrications for a political purpose\", or \"exaggerations\".\nAfter being acquitted, he said there was \"certain information\" he had been unable to talk about during the trial, but which would \"see the light of day\" in the future. \nHe has since claimed there was a \"deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort\" from some in the Scottish government and leading SNP figures to damage him and even have him sent to prison.\nMs Sturgeon has accused him of peddling false conspiracy theories and suggested her predecessor is angry because she \"did not collude with him\" to make the sexual harassment allegations \"go away\". \nFollowing the trial, two separate inquiries began. One was by a committee of MSPs and the other by James Hamilton, Ireland's former director of public prosecutions.\nMr Hamilton's inquiry looked at whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code - which sets out how ministers should behave. It examined whether she had interfered with the civil service investigation into the allegations against Mr Salmond, or misled parliament about what she knew and when.\nThis report cleared Ms Sturgeon of breaching the ministerial code, but said it was up to parliament to decide whether she had misled them.\nSeparately, the committee of MSPs examined the Scottish government's handling of the initial complaints against Mr Salmond. \nIts report said the Scottish government's actions had been \"seriously flawed\". \nMSPs on the committee voted by five to four that Ms Sturgeon misled their inquiry during her marathon evidence session earlier this month. \nThe committee also said the female civil servants who had made the complaints against Mr Salmond had been badly let down by the government.\nThe row has divided the SNP ahead of the Scottish Parliament election on 6 May, with some prominent MPs and many grassroots activists openly backing Mr Salmond. \nSome opinion polls have suggested that the fallout could threaten the SNP's hopes of winning an overall majority in the election - although it remains on course to once again finish as the largest party.\nPanorama on Salmond v Sturgeon is available on BBC iplayer."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nScientists have identified 16 cases of another new variant of coronavirus in the UK. Public Health England said this strain was on their watch list, but not one they were immediately concerned about. It has a mutation in common with the South Africa and Brazil variants which experts believe may help the virus evade some immunity from vaccination or prior infection. All viruses mutate and tweaked vaccines to fight new variants can be fast-tracked through the approval system. Here's what we know about the new strain so far.\nIt's the day after the Budget and many families and businesses are counting the costs of the coronavirus pandemic to their pocket. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has rejected claims his plans to claw back the cost of coronavirus support will hit the poorest hardest. He insisted no-one's take-home pay would be lowered by the plan he set out. But one campaign group said \"Santa Sunak\" was now looking more like \"Scrooge Sunak\". Here are a few ways the Budget could affect you.\nCoronavirus case rates in England are continuing to fall among all age groups, Public Health England says. The highest rate is among 30 to 39-year-olds, at 121.1 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 28 February. That's down from 178.3 cases last week. We've got data for the other age groups here. You can use our look-up tool to find out how many cases there are in your area. Meanwhile the World Health Organization said it was concerned about a \"resurgence\" of cases in Europe. It's comes as Germany did a U-turn over giving the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab to people aged over 65.\nEx-Stone Roses frontman Ian Brown has pulled out of headlining a festival because he's refusing to play events that \"accept vaccination proof as condition of entry\". Neighbourhood Weekender confirmed on Wednesday its event had been moved from May to September because of the pandemic. Festival organisers said they would \"comply with conditions\" set out by the government through the local authority. Brown has been vocal in his criticism of Covid vaccines during the pandemic. It comes as The Isle of Wight festival has been pushed back another three months, while Download and Glastonbury were cancelled for 2021.\nHere to sing us out is Lloyd Balatongan, an NHS medic who recorded a song encouraging people to have their Covid-19 jab. The Royal Derby Hospital theatre practitioner composed the song with his family band The Soulm8s. The catchy track, which features his wife Jackielou on vocals and his son Liam on drums, includes the lyric: \"Working together to protect the nation, everybody's waiting for their vaccination.\" They're not the only ones singing about vaccines, check out Dolly Parton's reworking of her hit song Jolene.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nAnd if you're feeling concerned about the new variant you can read aboutwhat scientists are doing to tackle it.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

The report claims she undermined the confidence of a third member of staff.\nIn a statement, Buckingham Palace - which is responsible for the hiring of royal staff - said: \"We are clearly very concerned about allegations in the Times following claims made by former staff of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\"Accordingly, our HR team will look into the circumstances outlined in the article.

It makes flesh the rumours and allegations that swirled around the duchess when a number of staff left some months after the 2018 wedding.\nThe duchess' people have pushed back. The people named in the leaked email knew nothing about the complaint, they say, and it never turned into a formal issue.\nBut now it has; the inquiry announced tonight is a clear indication that Buckingham Palace is treating the matter seriously.\nWhatever the truth, it ratchets up the tension - and publicity - around the interview to come in just a few days' time.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex quit their roles as senior working royals in March 2020, and now live in California. \nHarry has previously said the decision to step back was in order to protect himself and his family from the press.\nLast month, it was announced the couple would not return as working members of the Royal Family.\nIt comes ahead of Meghan and Prince Harry's TV interview with Oprah Winfrey, which will be aired on CBS in the US on the evening of Sunday 7 March.\nIn the UK, the interview will be screened on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Monday 8 March.\nCBS has said Meghan will be interviewed about \"stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood\" and \"how she is handling life under intense public pressure\".\nShe will then be joined by Prince Harry, and the couple will speak about their move to the US last year and their future plans."

I am truly sorry for the embarrassment I have caused the wonderful team across the business and our clients, and for the offence it has clearly caused,\" he said.\n\"I have always hired people based on their potential, talent and ability, and done my best to equip them with the skills to succeed. \n\"It's a wrench to step down as chair but I feel I have no alternative. The time is right to go.\"\nThe LinkedIn post, which was uploaded on Friday, provoked an angry reaction from anti-racism campaigners and was also strongly criticised by others in the communications industry.\nThe chief executive officer of Beattie Communications, Laurna Woods, said Mr Beattie and the entire team had been devastated by the consequences of the LinkedIn post.\n\"There can be no excuses for the language he used or provocation exercised and he acknowledges that his actions, however well intentioned, were not only reckless, but out of touch,\" she said.\n\"I'm personally saddened that he has chosen to resign as I have worked closely with him for 25 years and I can testify that he does not have a prejudiced bone in his body.\n\"But he was determined to draw a line in the sand so that the agency can look to the future.\""

      "tags": "United States,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "President Joe Biden has criticised the lifting of mask requirements in the states of Texas and Mississippi, calling it \"Neanderthal thinking\".\n\"I think it's a big mistake,\" he said.\nMasks, social distancing and other measures were still important, despite the role vaccines were playing in containing the pandemic, he said.\nTexas and Mississippi will also allow all businesses to open at full capacity. Other states have announced a relaxation of some rules.\nThe US has recorded 28.7 million infections and 519,000 deaths related to Covid-19 since the pandemic began. \nSome 78 million vaccine doses have been administered but Mr Biden said this was not a reason to end public health measures.\n\"The last thing we need is Neanderthal thinking that in the meantime everything's fine, take off your mask, forget it,\" Mr Biden said. \"It still matters.\"\nSenior health officials in his administration have warned about the continued spread of the virus - and highly contagious variants of it - hampering the progress of the country's vaccination programme.\n\"Now is not the time to release all restrictions,\" Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said.\n\"The next month or two is really pivotal in terms of how this pandemic goes.\"\nMississippi Governor Tate Reeves, a Republican, reacted to Mr Biden's comments with a terse tweet.\n\"Mississippians don't need handlers,\" Mr Reeves wrote in the tweet. \"As numbers drop, they can assess their choices and listen to experts. I guess I just think we should trust Americans, not insult them.\"\nA spokesperson for Texas Governor Greg Abbott said he was \"clear in telling Texans that Covid hasn't ended\".\nBut the spokesperson told Politico that \"Texas now has the tools and knowledge to combat Covid while also allowing Texans and small businesses to make their own decisions\".\n\"It is clear from the recoveries, the vaccinations, the reduced hospitalisations, and the safe practices that Texans are using, that state mandates are no longer needed. We must now do more to restore livelihoods and normalcy for Texans.\"\nIndividual states are in charge of public health policy in the US. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, most introduced restrictions on businesses and travel.\nAbout 35 states required face coverings to be worn in public places, although enforcement of these mask mandates has been patchy.\nThe governor of Texas on Tuesday issued an executive order, effective from 10 March, that rescinds most coronavirus measures.\nMississippi ended its mask mandate on Wednesday.\nMichigan is to ease capacity limits on restaurants, and on public and residential gatherings.\nSouth Carolina has removed limits on large gatherings, while capacity limits on restaurants in Massachusetts were removed.\nSome cities have also acted. Chicago has reopened public schools and San Francisco announced the easing of rules on museums, cinemas, gyms and indoor dining."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,Alliance Party (Northern Ireland),UUP (Ulster Unionist Party),European Union,Brexit,Stephen Farry",
      "text": "A group which includes representatives of loyalist paramilitaries has written to the prime minister to withdraw its support for the Good Friday Agreement.\nThe Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) said it was temporarily withdrawing its backing because of concerns about the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThe protocol means NI remains in the EU single market for goods, so products from GB undergo EU import procedures.\nUnionists say it damages trade and threatens NI's place in the UK.\nIn the letter, first reported by the Irish News, LCC chairman David Campbell said the group's leadership is \"determined that unionist opposition to the protocol should be peaceful and democratic\".\nHe added that the prime minister should not \"underestimate the strength of feeling on this issue right across the unionist family\".\nMr Campbell said the LCC's support for the Good Friday Agreement would be withdrawn \"until our rights under the Agreement are restored and the protocol amended to ensure unfettered access for goods, services and citizens throughout the United Kingdom\".\nHe told the BBC's Newsnight programme that Boris Johnson has \"reneged on the clear promises he made to the people of NI that there would be unfettered access\".\n\"So we are asking him and holding him to account and through this letter showing him that it is not just rhetoric from our parliamentary spokespersons that he has to be mindful of, but the strong grassroots anger that is palpable throughout the ground in Northern Ireland,\" he added.\nMr Johnson said: \"I haven't seen, I don't know which groups you're talking about but what I can say is we're taking some temporary technical measures to insure that there are no barriers in the Irish Sea or to make sure that things flow freely from GB to NI and that's what you'd expect.\n\"But obviously these are matters for continuing intensive discussions with our friends.\" \nEarlier, responding to the letter, the prime minister's official spokesperson said he was \"fully committed to the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement\". \nThe official said the government was \"determined\" to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, and it was \"simply looking to make some changes that have arisen as part of the protocol\".\nThe LCC represents groups including the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA) - loyalist paramilitary groups responsible for the murders of hundreds of people.\nThe Good Friday Agreement, also known as the Belfast Agreement, was signed in 1998 and marked the effective end of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\nIt established a devolved power-sharing administration, and created new institutions for cross-border cooperation and structures for improved relations between the British and Irish governments.\nIt was approved by referendums in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in 1998 and was subsequently incorporated into British and Irish constitutional law and other areas of legislation.\nThe LCC letter states: \"If you or the EU is not prepared to honour the entirety of the agreement then you will be responsible for the permanent destruction of the agreement.\"\nThe letter was published shortly after the EU said on Wednesday that a UK move to unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks as part of the NI Protocol would be a breach of international law.\nChief Constable Simon Byrne said the PSNI is currently assessing the letter, but he does not foresee any immediate threat of loyalist disorder or violence.\nHe was speaking at a meeting of the Northern Ireland Policing Board in Belfast.\nThe chief constable described it as \"a political move\".\n\"It is best dealt with by politicians\u2026 but as we sit here we do not see any immediate change in emotion or potential for disorder or violence coming from within the loyalist community,\" he added.\nRepresentatives of the LCC recently held talks with officials from the Northern Ireland Office to warn them of growing tensions around the Brexit protocol, but Mr Byrne said the PSNI had not met the LCC nor would they.\nOne person I spoke to last night described the move as a form of passive resistance by loyalist paramilitaries to the protocol. \nI do not see it as a being a step closer to any street protest or violent actions. Indeed the letter states opposition to border arrangements should be peaceful and democratic. \nWhat it captures though is continuing discontent and anger within a section of the community. \nBut in terms of consequences I am not sure withdrawing support for the Good Friday Agreement amounts to much in practical terms. The DUP didn't back the agreement either. \nObviously loyalist prisoners were released on the basis of the agreement. \nIt was, though, not conditional on support for the agreement, but rather an individual not engaging in future violence. \nIn February Northern Ireland's major unionist parties said they were supporting a legal bid to challenge the Protocol.\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) have said they are supporting judicial review proceedings.\nIn response to the letter, Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry said Boris Johnson faced a decision over whether he would \"give more oxygen to the normalisation of treating illegal organisations like any other stakeholder in society\".\nDUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that unionist confidence and support for the Good Friday Agreement \"is diminishing rapidly\".\nHe said: \"People have lost confidence because they believe that no one is listening to the concerns of unionists.\n\"I am not in any way, nor is my party, advocating that there should be the threat of violence or anything like it for any reason, there can be no justification for anyone doing that.\n\"The LCC statement makes clear that their opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol will be peaceful and democratic.\"\nThe LCC was set up in 2015 by Mr Campbell, a former chairman of the Ulster Unionist Party, and Jonathan Powell, chief of staff to former Prime Minister Tony Blair, as a means to help bring an end to loyalist paramilitarism.\nIt is not a proscribed organisation and is said to represent a range of individuals and views from the wider Protestant, unionist and loyalist communities.\nIn late February the DUP leadership held talks with the organisation to discuss opposition to the protocol.\nIt came shortly after Mr Campbell was criticised after saying loyalists would \"fight physically\" to maintain \"freedoms\" within the UK.\nIn January, the LCC also met top civil servants from the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) to express anger at the Irish Sea border arrangements.\nIt is not the first time loyalist groups have withdrawn their support for the Good Friday Agreement.\nIn 2001 the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) - a cover name often used by the UDA when it claimed responsibility for sectarian murders - withdrew its support for the deal.\nIn October 2015 the UDA \"recommitted\" to the principles of the Agreement, along with the UVF and the Red Hand Commando."

      "tags": "Job Retention Scheme,UK economy",
      "text": "Across the UK a lot of people breathed a sigh of relief when Rishi Sunak announced his Budget on Wednesday.\nFurlough was extended. There was more money for businesses scrambling to stay afloat. And for people relying on universal credit, the extra \u00a320 added last year will stay for now.\nBut for people like freelance camerawoman Ester de Roij the chancellor's announcements prompted mixed emotions.\n\"I'm in limbo. I feel I should celebrating but I'm finding it hard to,\" she says. \nThis time last year Ester wasn't eligible for a self-employed income support grant because she had only just started her business.\nShe is now, following the Budget, finally able to claim some support.\nBut she's \"absolutely furious\" that so many others are still falling through the net.\nShe was also relieved to hear from Rishi Sunak that the Universal Credit top-up would stay for another six months.\n\"It's welcome news that it wasn't taken away. Without that \u00a320 I wouldn't be able to cover my rent. It's the difference between a roof over my head and not,\" she says.\nBut it feels like \"the bare minimum\" you could expect, not as much as she would have hoped for, she says, \"quite bittersweet\".\nFor Alan and Becky McEwan on the other hand the Budget news was \"a massive relief\".\nBecky runs a cake company, which is going well, but Alan manages a restaurant in Stirling and has been on furlough for much of last year.\n\"The 80% furlough has been a godsend for us,\" says Alan. \"What the government has done for us, we're really grateful for it.\"\nHe's had to shield while he waited for a cancerous tumour to be removed in January, then picked up Covid while in hospital undergoing treatment.\nAlan loves working in hospitality, and he hopes to be back by the time the restaurant reopens, but it's a huge help knowing that furlough has been extended until September in case he still isn't strong enough, or if the roadmap out of lockdown is delayed.\n\"It takes the worry off doesn't it? It's a massive strain off our shoulders.\"\nOliver Holt in Thornton, Blackpool, hopes what he heard in the Budget will be good news for him. The 20-year-old is about to leave college with a level 3 certificate in mechanics and has been applying for apprenticeships, but so far without luck.\nRishi Sunak announced a boost in funding for employers that take on apprentices, raising the support from \u00a32,000 per young person taken on to \u00a33,000.\n\"It's a great idea,\" Oliver says. \"It should mean you'll see a rise in garages taking on apprentices.\"\n\"I'm super-keen, I'm nearly at the end of my course at college and wondering what might be available and when. \n\"I'm hoping something will come from this. I've applied for so many different ones and every time I've either had an email or they don't get back to me at all.\n\"I'm finding it really difficult at the moment to be honest.\"\nFor Louise King it was a budget of two halves. She owns a hairdressing salon, Wilderness Hair, in Liverpool, that turned to making shampoo when it couldn't open.\n\"We really welcomed the roadmap out of lockdown, the restart grants for \u00a318,000,\" she says. And she agrees spending more on apprentices is a good idea, although it only applies to new apprentices and she already has two.\n\"But what we are really disappointed about is our industry is not getting the VAT cut like the hospitality industry,\" she says. \nHairdressers had lobbied for the same treatment as bars and restaurants.\n\"We are still paying the full 20%. It's quite upsetting that our voice is not being heard,\" Louise says.\n\"If I'm being honest it's a mixed bag of emotions,\" she says \"There's still a rocky road ahead.\"\n\"Business rates was more of a shocker than we'd expected it to be,\" says Tabi Marsh, owner of gift shop and cafe Papilio in Thornbury. \nBefore the Budget the idea of having to pay full business rates again, was making Tabi wonder whether the business would have to close. Then she heard Scotland was extending its business rates holiday for a whole year, and she got her hopes up that the chancellor might do the same for England. \nInstead she's got three more months rate-free, then at the start of July has to start paying them again, although at a much reduced rate.\n\"It's a shame they're not following Scotland's lead,\" she says.\nThe extension of furlough is a help and she's expecting a re-opening grant of around \u00a312,000 to help retrain staff and restock the cafe. But she knows it will take some time for trade to return to normal, meanwhile minimum wage rises and Brexit mean costs have gone up.\nShe's not sure yet whether Rishi Sunak's additional measures will be enough. \n\"It could be worse, but it could also be a lot better.\" \n\"It has bought us the time to get open,\" she says. \"We will be one of the businesses that have to look again in six or nine months to see how quickly trade has rebounded.\""

We're looking at all our options at the moment because the pandemic makes that hard.\"\nThe most recent series of Love Island took place in the winter, concluding in February 2020, when Paige Turley and Finley Tapp were crowned the winners. (They're still together, a year later.)\nThat series took place just before the coronavirus pandemic, and marked the first winter run for a show which had previously only aired during summer months.\nSince the series has been off air, ITV2 has been broadcasting international editions of the series in its place to fill the air time, such as Love Island Australia.\nLaura Whitmore will likely return to hosting duties, after she previously stood in for former presenter Caroline Flack, who died last February.\nIt's unclear how the show would operate if social distancing measures remain in place by this summer.\nHowever, it's likely that Covid-19 restrictions will be significantly reduced by then, in light of the government's four-step plan to ease most lockdown rules by June, and the continued success of the coronavirus vaccine rollout.\nEven if some measures are still in place, other series like Strictly have used daily testing and contestant bubbles as a way to stay on air. \nBut the pandemic has caused significant disruption to TV productions. Both Strictly and Dancing On Ice saw contestants leave after testing positive for Covid-19, while I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here relocated from Australia to Wales.\nLove Island was one of several commissions ITV confirmed on Thursday, as it announced details of its summer programming.\nITV also announced:\nThe channel will also air a previously-announced new drama about the killing of Stephen Lawrence, which will star Steve Coogan as DCI Clive Driscoll.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Mr Trump still refuses to admit losing the election.\nFive people including a police officer died during the riot, which shook the foundations of American democracy. The head of the Capitol police force later resigned.\nMeanwhile, Capitol police have reportedly asked the Pentagon for the National Guard to remain in place around Congress for another two months.\nSome 5,000 National Guards, drafted in after the riots, are due to leave on 12 March. One unnamed defence official told Reuters it was highly likely the Pentagon would grant the Capitol police's extension request.\n\"As of late February, an unidentified group of militia violent extremists discussed plans to take control of the US Capitol and remove Democratic lawmakers on or about 4 March and discussed aspirational plans to persuade thousands to travel to Washington DC to participate,\" a new intelligence bulletin issued by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security says. \nFollowing that assessment, the US Capitol Police referred in a statement to \"a possible plot to breach the Capitol by an identified militia group on Thursday, March 4\".\n\"We have already made significant security upgrades to include establishing a physical structure and increasing manpower to ensure the protection of Congress, the public and our police officers.\n\"Due to the sensitive nature of this information, we cannot provide additional details at this time.\"\nSupporters of an extremist conspiracy theory known as QAnon falsely believe Thursday will mark Mr Trump's return to the White House for a second term.\nThey have latched on to this date because, before the 20th amendment of the US Constitution - adopted in 1933 - moved the swearing-in dates of the president and Congress to January, American leaders took office on 4 March.\nQAnon is a wide-ranging and completely unfounded theory which says that President Trump is waging a secret war against elite Satan-worshipping paedophiles in government, business and the media.\nSecurity services were aware of online QAnon discussions surrounding 4 March, but did not \"have any indication of violence or a specific, credible plot at this time\", an FBI official had told The Washington Post last week.\nBy Shayan Sardarizadeh, BBC Monitoring\nSince the early days of the conspiracy, it's become customary for followers to hang on to specific dates. \n\"Q\", an anonymous figure whom followers believe to be an influential government insider, began by promising specific events on specific dates. This would both keep the followers hopeful about events in the near future, which would validate their beliefs and sacrifices, and also encourage supporters to spread the message further. \nSince 2017, many dates and promised events have come and gone, but supporters have each time shrugged and moved the goal posts. Biden's inauguration on 20 January was the first time some followers snapped, and that was because Mr Trump was no longer in the White House.\nFollowers, particularly influencers of the movement, are very good at rationalising these failed prophecies. \nEach time, an explanation is provided: \"Q\" and Trump need to keep their cards close to their chests, disinformation is necessary to wrong foot the deep state, something did happen on a promised date but it was all done behind the scenes and we will only find out about it later, etc. At the end of the day, most supporters have spent enough time and effort in the conspiracy not to be discouraged because something promised to them failed to materialise.\nRead more from Shayan\nThe US justice department has charged more than 300 people with participation in the 6 January attack. Those arrested include members of the right-wing militia groups the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters.\nDemocrats said the attack amounted to an insurrection and the House voted to impeach Mr Trump for allegedly inciting the mob. The former president - the first in US history to be impeached twice - was later acquitted in the upper chamber, the Senate, with many Republican senators sticking by him.\nIn late February Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman told Congress that the Trump supporters behind the January attack wanted to \"blow up\" the Capitol and kill lawmakers.\nLeon Panetta, a former US Defence Secretary and CIA chief, told the BBC that police would take no chances following January's attack.\n\"We have got to have constant intelligence on domestic terrorists, have to track their possible efforts to again repeat what happened on 6 January and I think that's what you're seeing now, is an abundance of caution to make sure that we are properly prepared to react, if in fact any group attempts any kind of armed attack again on the United States Capitol,\" he said.\nThere are dozens of militias across the US with varying ideologies, but generally they are anti-government. While they do not necessarily advocate violence, they are often armed and some have engaged in violent demonstrations.\nMany say they are acting in self-defence over fears of what they believe to be increasing federal government intrusion, with gun control a particular concern.\nCorrection 8th April 2021: An earlier version of this article stated that the riot saw five people killed. However as some of the deaths were due to natural causes, and Officer Sicknick's cause of death has yet to be determined, this line has been amended."

      "text": "A revelation that two sisters of Spain's King Felipe VI were vaccinated during a trip to Abu Dhabi last month has sparked a political backlash.\nMedia reports revealed Princess Elena, 57, and Princess Cristina, 55, had got the jab whilst visiting their father.\nThe former King, Juan Carlos, left the country in 2020 amid mounting scandals.\nBoth princesses, who do not yet qualify to get a vaccine under Spain's roll-out, defended and explained their decision on Wednesday.\n\"My sister and I went to visit my father and in order to be issued with a medical certificate which will allow us to continue to visit him regularly, we were offered the chance to get vaccinated, which we accepted,\" they said in a statement to El Mundo on Wednesday. \n\"Had it not been for these circumstances, we would have waited for our turn to get vaccinated to come around in Spain,\" they added.\nJuan Carlos has been living in self-exile in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since last August. \nAlthough he denied wrongdoing regarding mounting corruption allegations, his departure heightened debate and scrutiny about the royal family.\nEquality Minister Irene Montero was among the politicians who criticised the princesses after the revelation was first reported by online news website El Confidencial. \n\"The vaccination of the princesses is more news which contributes to discrediting the monarchy. For the public, this constitutes preferential treatment and privileges,\" the minister told the public TVE network. \nLabour Minister Yolanda Diaz described the matter as as \"very unpleasant, very ugly\".\n\"We, the people who exercise some sort of representation, must lead by example,\" she added.\nA royal palace source declined to comment on the reports to Reuters on the basis that the sisters are not formally part of the institution but said the king, Queen Letizia and their daughters would get the vaccination when it was their turn.\nSpain has only administered about 4m vaccines so far, with over-80s and essential workers currently being prioritised. \nA similar scandal rocked the country in January, when some senior figures including the country's top military chief resigned after they were implicated in \"queue-jumping\" allegations of their own.

      "text": "The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has said that legal action is imminent over the UK's move to unilaterally extend grace periods on Irish Sea border checks.\nMaro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told the Financial Times that \"infringement proceedings\" are being prepared.\nHe said: \"We are currently preparing it and it would be really something coming to our table very soon.\"\nThe EU has two legal avenues open to it under the Brexit deals.\nUnder the NI part of the Brexit deal, the Protocol, it can launch infringement proceedings which could lead to a case at the European Court of Justice\nIt took this action at the time when the UK threatened to breach the NI deal through the Internal Market Bill.\nIn that case the legal proceedings were overtaken by political agreement.\nThe EU could also seek arbitration under the terms of the wider EU-UK trade deal.\nEarlier on Thursday, the UK government extended another of the Irish Sea border grace periods, this time for parcels.\nIt came a day after the UK extended grace periods for checks on agri-foods, a move the EU said was illegal.\nNorthern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods so products arriving from GB undergo EU import procedures.\nThe grace periods mean procedures and checks are not yet fully applied.\nThe first of these periods was to expire at the end of March; the UK says they will be extended until October.\nAll parcels entering Northern Ireland would have required customs declarations from 1 April.\nThe logistics industry said it was not ready to deal with that volume of new administration.\nThe government says the grace period for business-to-business deliveries will be extended until 1 October.\nFor all other deliveries, for example businesses to consumers, businesses will be given six months to prepare for new arrangements from the date those arrangements are announced.\nIn a protest against the UK's unilateral changes, the European Parliament has declined to set a date for its vote to ratify the EU-UK Brexit deal. \nEU parliament group chiefs had been expected to set a date this month for its vote at a meeting on Thursday.\nOn Wednesday, Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the UK's move amounted to \"a violation of the relevant substantive provisions\" of the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThe protocol is part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the EU could not trust the UK in post-Brexit talks.\nHe said progress had been made on the protocol and the timing of the UK's moves could not be worse.  \nBut UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the problems were technical and \"eminently solvable\".\nArlene Foster, Northern Ireland's first minister, told a news conference the British government had a commitment to protect the UK's internal market.\nThe DUP leader accused the Irish government of ignoring unionist concerns over the NI Protocol.\nBut her deputy first minister, Sinn F\u00e9in's Vice-President Michelle O'Neill, accused the British government of \"acting in bad faith\" over the protocol.\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the grace period extensions were aimed at helping consumers and businesses in Northern Ireland, suggesting the EU needed to adapt its timeframe to fit the supply chain requirements of supermarkets and businesses.\n\"If we'd have left it any longer we'd have had a risk for businesses and livelihoods of people in just a few weeks time,\" he said during a visit to Northern Ireland on Thursday.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is the part of the Brexit deal aimed at ensuring there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland. \nIt does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods.\nThat has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\nUnionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it has damaged internal trade from GB to NI and poses a risk to the future of the UK union.\nBut anti-Brexit parties in NI say that it must be implemented in full, and that issues should be worked out through joint UK-EU processes."

      "tags": "Myanmar coup ,Myanmar",
      "text": "Crowds gathered in Mandalay on Thursday for the funeral of a 19-year-old woman who was shot dead during Myanmar's anti-coup protests a day earlier.\nKyal Sin, known as Angel, was wearing a T-shirt with the phrase \"Everything will be OK\" when she died.\nTributes have flooded in on social media, with many calling her a hero.\nSince the 1 February coup, Myanmar has been gripped by mass protests demanding an end to military rule and the release of detained elected leaders.\nMore than 54 people have been killed by security forces in the protests so far, according to the UN Human Rights Office, although other reports put the figure much higher. Wednesday was the bloodiest day since the coup, with 38 protesters killed in cities and towns across the country.\nUN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet called on security forces to \"halt their vicious crackdown on peaceful protesters\". \nDozens of countries have now condemned the violence in Myanmar, though this has been largely ignored by the coup leaders.\nAnd Myanmar's ambassador to the UN, who the military said they had fired after he pleaded for help to restore democracy, called for \"the strongest international actions\" against the military. \n\"You see these last 3-4 days how many of our innocent and young lives have been taken away,\" Kyaw Moe Tun told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme in his first interview since he was replaced. \"What we want for the people of Myanmar is protection.\"\nMeanwhile his deputy Tin Maung Naing, who the military appointed in his place, said he had resigned and that Kyaw Moe Tun was still ambassador.\nOn Thursday in Mandalay, people lined the route of Angel's funeral procession. \nMourners sang revolutionary songs and chanted anti-coup slogans, Reuters news agency reports. \nImages of the teenager wearing her \"Everything will be OK\" T-shirt at the protests had gone viral. \nAware of the dangers of taking part in the protests, she had written her blood type details on Facebook and requested that her organs be donated in the event of her death. \nMyat Thu, who was with her at the protest on Wednesday, said she had kicked open a water pipe so protesters could wash tear gas from their eyes. She had also tried to help him as police opened fire. \n\"She told me 'Sit! Bullets will hit you',\" he told Reuters. \"She cared for and protected others.\"\nHe said police hit them with tear gas and then the bullets came. \nMyat Thu said Angel, who had proudly voted in elections for the first time last year, was a \"happy girl\". \n\"She loved her family and her family loved her so much too,\" he said. \"We are not in a war. There is no reason to use live bullets on people.\"\nPeople also paid tribute to Angel on social media. One friend wrote on Facebook: \"My heart feels so my hurt.\"\nAnother said: \"Rest in peace my friend. We will fight this revolution to the end.\"\nMoe Myint, BBC Burmese\nIn a video which showed Kyal Sin's last minutes, she was seen leading a group of young protesters. When tear gas rained down and shooting came from security forces at the other end of the road, all of them looked worried but she shouted: \"Are we united?\", and they chanted \"United, United\". A family friend later said she was a truly inspirational leader. \nKyal Sin is one of several teenagers who gave up their lives on Wednesday. Gen Z, as they are called, believe their future must not be shaped by a military regime. But the same old army again committed atrocities even in urban areas where people film on their mobile phones. \nOne protester told me that he had never seen this kind of inhumane cruelty by police and soldiers who are shooting unarmed protesters with live ammunition, many of them in the head. But he insisted they would not be silenced and the military's barbaric acts made him even more determined. \nAt Kyal Sin's funeral, her aunt also vowed: \"I feel sad but they must fall soon. Our fight must win.\"\nUndeterred by Wednesday's deaths, protesters made their way out on to the streets of Yangon and Mandalay - the country's two biggest cities - as well as those of other cities and towns. \nAccording to news site Myanmar Now, tens of thousands of people were protesting in the town of Myingyan, where a demonstrator had been shot dead the day before.\nReuters news agency says police opened fire and used tear gas to break up protesters in Yangon and the town of Monywa.\nResidents said that five fighter jets had made low passes in formation over Mandalay early on Thursday, in what appeared to be a show of military strength. \nMore than 1,700 people, including members of parliament and protesters, have been detained since the coup, Ms Bachelet said in a statement. Arrests have been escalating with 29 journalists detained in recent days, she said. \nShe warned the figures could be much higher due to the large scale of the protests and difficulty in monitoring developments. \nOn Wednesday, police and soldiers reportedly opened fire with live rounds in several cities and towns with little warning.\nProtesters said they used rubber bullets but also live rounds.\nUN envoy to Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, said one video clip showed police beating an unarmed volunteer medic. \nMyanmar's military seized power after overthrowing the government of including Aung San Suu Kyi and declared a state of emergency.\nJust days later, the civil disobedience movement began to emerge, with many people refusing to return to work. \nThe movement quickly started to gain momentum and it was not long before hundreds of thousands of people began taking part in street protests. \nA violent crackdown began on the largely peaceful protests last weekend. \nThe military has not commented on the deaths.

      "text": "At least 38 people were killed in Myanmar on Wednesday in what the UN described as the \"bloodiest day\" since the coup took place a month ago.\nUN envoy to Myanmar Christine Schraner Burgener said there was shocking footage coming out of the country.\nWitnesses said security forces opened fire with rubber and live bullets.\nMass protests and acts of civil disobedience have been seen across Myanmar since the military seized power on 1 February.\nProtesters have been calling for an end to military rule and the release of the country's elected government leaders - including Aung San Suu Kyi - who were overthrown and detained in the coup.\nThe coup and the violent suppression of protests that followed have led to international condemnation, which Myanmar's military has so far ignored.\nReacting to Wednesday's deaths, the UK called for a United Nations Security Council meeting on Friday, while the US said it was considering further action against Myanmar's military.\nThe latest violence comes a day after Myanmar's neighbours urged the military to exercise restraint.\nMs Schraner Burgener said at least 50 people had now been killed \"and many wounded\" since the coup began.\nShe said one video clip showed police beating an unarmed volunteer medical crew. Another showed a protester being shot and probably killed on the street, she said.\n\"I asked some weapons experts and they could verify to me, it's not clear but it seems that the police weapons like 9mm submachine guns, so live ammunition,\" she said.\nReports from inside Myanmar spoke of security forces opening fire on large crowds in a number of cities, including Yangon, with little warning.\nTwo boys, aged 14 and 17, were among those who were killed, Save the Children said. A 19-year-old woman was also said to be among the dead.\nAt least six people were reportedly shot dead during a protest in Monywa in central Myanmar. At least 30 others were wounded in the unrest, a local journalist told Reuters.\nA volunteer medic told AFP news agency in Myingyan that at least 10 people had been injured there. \"They fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live rounds,\" they said.\n\"They didn't spray us with water cannon, [there was] no warning to disperse, they just fired their guns,\" one protester in the city told Reuters.\nIn Mandalay, a student protester told the BBC that demonstrators were killed near her house. \n\"I think around 10am or 10.30, police and soldiers came to that area and then they started to shoot at civilians. They didn't give any warning to the civilians. \n\"They just came out and they started to shoot. They used rubber bullets but they also used live bullets to kill civilians in a violent way.\"\nThe military has not commented on the reported deaths.\nAs world powers view Myanmar's crisis with growing unease, the country's military said it was ready to withstand sanctions and isolation after its coup, \nMs Schraner Burgener has urged the UN to take \"very strong measures\" against the generals. The UN envoy warned of such punitive action in a conversation with Myanmar's deputy military chief.\nIn response, \"the answer was: 'We have to learn to walk with only few friends',\" Ms Schraner Burgener told reporters in New York.\nNevertheless, more sanctions are being considered by Western countries, including the US.\nWednesday's violence left the US \"appalled\", State Department spokesman Ned Price said. He told reporters: \"We call on all countries to speak with one voice to condemn the brutal violence by the Burmese military against its own people.\"\nHe urged China, historically a close ally of Myanmar, to bring its influence to bear on the country's military.\nThe UN Security Council - an international peacekeeping body - has voiced concern over the situation, but stopped short of condemning the coup because of opposition by Russia and China, who view the matter as an internal affair.\nMeanwhile, Pope Francis called for dialogue to \"prevail over repression\".\nForeign ministers of neighbouring South East Asian nations held a special meeting on Tuesday about the situation in Myanmar. \nBut although they urged restraint, only some of the ministers pressed the military junta to release Ms Suu Kyi.\nMs Suu Kyi, 75, was seen for the first time since her detention earlier this week when she appeared in court via video link. \nThe military says it seized power because of alleged fraud in November's general elections, which saw Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party win a landslide victory.\nBut the military has provided no proof of these allegations - instead, it replaced the Election Commission and promised fresh polls in a year."

They included healthcare workers, care home workers and those working in education, nursery or childcare. \nPublic transport workers had the highest risk, being more than twice as likely as other workers to be infected.\nThose working at home were least likely to have the virus.\nAmong ethnic groups, the highest levels of infection in January and February were found in Bangladeshi people. There were also high infection rates among black, Indian and Pakistani people."
