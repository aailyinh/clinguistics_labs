      "tags": "Television,Film,Racism",
      "text": "British-Asian actress Parminder Nagra has said she was once turned down for a role on a well-known US TV show because they \"already had an Indian person\".\nShe told a podcast she had also heard producers on an unnamed production say \"too many brown people\" would not sell.\nNagra made her name in the 2002 UK film Bend It Like Beckham before appearing in the US medical drama series ER.\nWhile noting how on-screen diversity had improved, she said she hoped it was not just a quota-filling exercise.\n\"We're having the conversations happening more and more and things have moved on,\" she told the Celebrity Catch Up podcast.\n\"My fear is that - which I think was happening a few years ago - it became about, 'Oh well let's get this box ticked',\" continued the actress, who lives in Los Angeles.\n\"I remember asking to go for a job because an actress basically left - it was a well-known TV show here. I remember phoning my agent and I went, 'Do you think maybe you could just suggest me? The character is very non-specific in terms of family and between 35 and 40 [years of age].\n\"And the word that came back was that they've already got an Indian person on the cast.\n\"I went, 'Yeah but I'm completely different to that person'. Is that ever gonna happen when you say that, 'No we've already got a white person on the show'?\n\"I don't think that conversation is happening - so it's just very hard.\"\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly in 2018, Nagra revealed that during the promotion of Bend it Like Beckham, a magazine refused to put her on its cover alongside co-star Keira Knightly because of the colour of her skin.\nShe told the podcast she had experienced lots of \"annoying\", \"tiring\" and \"odd\" moments like that in her career. Yet, she said, she was still optimistic that real lasting change could occur.\n\"I've been in rooms where people have gone, 'Oh that's not going to sell because there's just too many brown people in it', and you go, 'Oh. OK',\" she continued.\n\"Do you keep pounding? There's moments where you get tired and then there's people that do keep doing that and then they break another glass ceiling.\n\"You've got Riz Ahmed and Priyanka Chopra - they've got deals with networks and stuff like that, and so things have moved on.\n\"But, yeah, that was a story for the books and there was lots of little stories like that.\"\nNagra will be seen in her latest role in Sky space drama Intergalactic from Friday.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Sir Keir Starmer has hit back at Conservative criticism of a department store photo op, saying he does not \"turn his nose up\" at John Lewis.\nThe Labour leader's Thursday trip to the wallpaper section of the Manchester branch was meant as a dig at the PM over the No 10 flat redecoration row.\nThe Tories accused him of \"playing politics\" but Sir Keir said he was \"very proud to support John Lewis\".\nSeveral investigations are under way into the Downing Street flat.\nMr Johnson insists he has covered the costs of the upgrade out of his own pocket.\nBut speaking on an election campaign visit to Hull on Friday, Mr Starmer continued to press for details of who initially paid for the redecoration.\n\"The prime minister knows the answer to that question but he won't answer it,\" he said.\n\"He could end all this, we could move on, all these investigations could be closed down in five minutes if the prime minister answered the question.\"\nMr Johnson has said he will co-operate with the investigations, adding: \"I don't think there is anything to see here or worry about.\"\nThe Downing Street flat refurbishment - overseen by Mr Johnson's fiancee Carrie Symonds - is reported to have cost up to \u00a3200,000.\nThe Electoral Commission is investigating its funding, as are the UK's top civil servant and the prime minister's own standards adviser.\nOn Thursday. During a campaign visit to Greater Manchester ahead of next week's local and mayoral elections, Sir Keir popped in to the chain's Trafford Centre store.\nHe made for the furnishing, fabrics and cushions department, on the first floor, and inspected the wooden wallpaper racks.\nSir Keir read the \"wallpaper calculator\" and picked up some of the rolls - patterned and plain - at one point smiling to a photographer.\nMs Symonds has denied reports that she objected to the way the flat had been decorated by her fiance's predecessor, Theresa May - which society magazine Tatler claimed a visitor had once called a \"John Lewis furniture nightmare\".\nOn a trip to a London school, Mr Johnson joked that this was \"the one thing I object to in this whole farrago of nonsense\", adding: \"I love John Lewis.\"\nSir Keir's move appeared to anger Ms Milling, who tweeted one of the pictures, writing: \"When we say Labour are playing political games this is exactly what we mean.\n\"Today the PM visited a school to see how we are levelling-up opportunity, focusing on people's priorities. Keir Starmer is doing exactly what we said he'd do - playing politics.\"\nEarlier, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the \"general public need to know\" about the flat payments.\nPrime ministers get \u00a330,000 towards refurbishing their Downing Street accommodation. \nThe recent work carried out for Mr Johnson and Ms Symonds was by designer Lulu Lyttle - whose company says its aim is to contribute to the \"joyful atmosphere of any interior\".\nMr Johnson has said he paid the costs himself, but he has not specified whether this happened when he first received the bill, or whether he was loaned the money and later repaid it.\nThe Electoral Commission - which oversees political finances - will investigate the Conservative Party's compliance with laws on political donations, having said there are \"reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred\".\nSir Keir said the situation was becoming \"farcical\", adding that \"it would take [Mr Johnson] about one minute\" to give the details of who paid for the works, and when, \"and then he can get back on with the day job\".\nBut Mr Johnson insisted he was \"focusing on the stuff that really matters\", including \"priorities\", such as easing Covid restrictions and improving the economy.\nThe prime minister's flat is actually above 11 Downing Street, rather than No 10, because it offers more space."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you on Friday morning. \nSir Simon Stevens is to step down as head of NHS England in the summer, and will take up a place in the House of Lords. He spent seven years in the job and arguably became much more widely recognised when he joined the podium at some of the coronavirus briefings in Downing Street. Sir Simon had intended to leave the post sooner but agreed to stay on through last winter as the service embarked upon its largest vaccination campaign ever. Thanking him for his \"dedicated service\", Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Sir Simon had \"led the NHS with great distinction\".\nAs India battles with record Covid infections, people in the Indian state of West Bengal are continuing to vote in the final phase of elections. Long queues were seen outside polling booths, raising fears about a further spreading of the virus. It comes as India reported the world's highest single-day figure for new infections, at 379,257 more cases on Thursday. Experts fear West Bengal could be the next epicentre - cases rose by a state record of 17,000 on Wednesday.\nAs England's vaccination programme rolls out to everyone aged 42 and over, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been given his first dose of the jab. He received the Pfizer vaccine, administered by England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam. \"In and out in 8 minutes. Didn't hurt at all,\" Mr Hancock tweeted afterwards. It comes after Prof Van-Tam said it would be \"incredibly safe\" for two fully vaccinated people to meet indoors, even though doing so is against the rules in the UK at the moment. Our health correspondent James Gallagher looks at just how safe - or risky - it would be. Meanwhile, the coronavirus infection rate in England has dropped to its lowest figure since September, according to Test and Trace figures.\nThe US economy is rebounding faster than expected after contracting sharply as the pandemic hit in 2020. The country's economy continued to recover in the first three months of the year as businesses reopened and the government spent heavily on Covid relief for citizens. It grew at an annualised rate of 6.4% in the quarter, up from 4.3% in the final three months of 2020. But it's several years away from fully recovering from the pandemic recession.\nMany in the hospitality industry have been trying out innovative ways to keep going in the pandemic, and one restaurant in Somerset is no exception. It put up plastic dining igloos outside to comply with social distancing rules - and to offer diners a degree of shelter - but has been told to remove them by the council. Martin and Susan Felstead installed three pods in their garden at Greenway Farm in Wembdon, near Bridgwater in July. The couple said the pods were \"safe, lightweight, movable, weather-resistant\" but a solicitor representing several residents said one neighbour claimed the noise from the diners was \"unbearable\".\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nEveryone in England and Scotland is being encouraged to take rapid coronavirus tests regularly - find out where you can get them for free here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "title": "Arlene Foster: Why did the DUP move against its leader?",
      "tags": "DUP (Democratic Unionist Party),Arlene Foster",
      "text": "Rumours about bids to remove Arlene Foster from the helm of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had been swirling for months.\nOn many occasions they'd been easily shrugged off by the first minister. \nBut she could shrug no longer, given many of those previously loyal to her abandoned the Foster ship.\nHowever questions remain about the move's timing and what has caused it.\nFirstly, pressure to remove her has come from the outworkings of Brexit and the Irish Sea border.\nArlene Foster led the party's campaign in favour of Brexit, but struggled once its ramifications for the union came into view.\nFeeling betrayed by Boris Johnson when he signed up to the Brexit deal that would mean different trading arrangements for Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, Mrs Foster faced accusations of poor judgement for trusting the prime minister.\nShe hardened her stance earlier this year after concerns about the protocol's effects on GB-NI trade became clear, and demanded it be scrapped.\nThe party even published a five-point plan it aimed to use in a bid to replace the protocol and said it would no longer engage with north-south bodies on Brexit.\nBut that was not enough to quash internal unhappiness at how the issue was being managed, with some elected representatives concerned it would affect the party's chances in the next assembly election in May 2022.\nIt may also be that some assembly members who were worried about the prospect of retaining their seats have drawn the conclusion that their own political positions trump loyalty to the leadership at this crucial time, just as election strategies are being devised.\nRecent scenes of rioting and violence in loyalist communities against the protocol and criticism of unionist politicians have added to the narrative that the current DUP leadership is not reflecting or understanding the views of those it is supposed to represent.\nIt may be a key issue in all of this, but it's not the only factor.\nParty sources have given strong hints about growing concern that Mrs Foster held a softer stance on some social issues than her predecessors and was willing to move the party in that direction.\nThe DUP's roots are deeply conservative, staunchly opposing abortion and same-sex marriage. \nWestminster legislated to change NI's laws on those issues in 2019 when devolution was suspended - the DUP opposed it at the time, but it did not go down well with many grassroots party members.\nThen last week, a debate on a motion in the Stormont assembly calling for a ban on gay conversion therapy further raised eyebrows when Mrs Foster was one of five DUP assembly members who abstained on it.\nThe majority of the party had voted against the motion, arguing that any legislation to outlaw the practice needed to ensure safeguards for churches.\nAlthough it was a free vote, it openly exposed the gulf between Mrs Foster and most of her assembly team at a time when she was already under pressure. For some party members, it was the final straw.\nThere are also those within the DUP who point to Mrs Foster's difficulties in retaining authority, claiming that she was too weak to discipline some of her MPs and assembly members for breaching Covid-19 guidelines or making comments at odds with party policy.\nTo further understand the timing of the leadership challenge, it's important to know how DUP internal rules work.\nRule 12 states that a leadership election should take place before 30 April every year - normally it is an informal procedure to simply reappoint the office holder as opposed to an actual contest.\nHowever it's understood that this has not happened yet this year, and it's believed those behind the motion challenging Mrs Foster had called on the DUP chairman to invoke the rule and call an election for leader within seven days.\nA fight for the heart and soul of the DUP is on which may chart the party's course for some time to come."

      "text": "The United States has told its citizens to leave India as soon as possible as the country battles a devastating coronavirus wave.\nIndia reported 379,257 new infections on Thursday, the world's highest single-day total.\nThe US embassy warned that \"access to all types of medical care is becoming severely limited\".\nThe Level 4 \"do not travel\" advisory is the highest of its kind issued by the Department of State.\nThe overall death toll in India officially surpassed 200,000 on Wednesday, though experts believe the actual number could be much higher.\nIn the advisory, US citizens were told \"not to travel to India or to leave as soon as it is safe to do so\".\n\"US citizens who wish to depart India should take advantage of available commercial transportation options now,\" it said. \nSome US citizens have reported being denied entry to hospitals due to a lack of space, it added.\nThe warning comes as the White House said the US is redirecting its own order of the supplies needed to make the AstraZeneca, allowing India to make more than 20 million doses for its own use.\nThe US is also sending more than $100m (\u00a376m) in supplies to India, including almost one million instant tests on a first flight.\nThe Indian government has welcomed what it called an \"outpouring of solidarity\" from around the world, with more than 40 countries pledging urgently needed equipment.\nHospitals have been overwhelmed, oxygen is in critically low supply and crematoriums are operating non-stop.\nThursday was the deadliest day so far, with 3,645 people succumbing to the coronavirus. However, the real death toll is thought to be higher. \nDespite this, the state of West Bengal has been voting in the final phase of elections.\nLong queues were seen outside polling booths, raising concerns about further spread of the virus.\nExperts fear West Bengal could be the next epicentre. Cases rose by 17,000 on Wednesday - a state record.\nThe state has already gone through seven phases of voting. West Bengal is one of the few states where Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not have a majority of parliamentary seats.\nMr Modi has been criticised for continuing to hold rallies there even as the virus began overwhelming the country."

      "tags": "Housing,Grenfell Tower fire,Housing market,Grenfell Tower Inquiry",
      "text": "The government's fund to pay for the removal of dangerous cladding is woefully inadequate, oversubscribed and taking too long to make buildings safe, campaigners say.\nMore than three and a half years since the Grenfell Tower fire which killed 72 people, an estimated 700,000 people are still living in high-rise blocks with flammable cladding.  \nThe \u00a31.6bn Building Safety Programme was set up in 2019. Concerns have emerged about the contract that the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government requires applicants to the fund, usually managing agents or building owners, to sign.\nA clause in the contract, seen by the BBC, indicates applicants will be financially liable for any repair work not covered by the fund.\nThe BBC has learnt that some managing agents are refusing to sign the document, further delaying the repair work, and have written to the government asking ministers to clarify the position.\nChristian Hansen, a solicitor at Bindmans LLP specialising in housing law and fire safety claims, said the contract showed that \"there's going to be a significant shortfall between the costs of the [repair] works that are required and the funding provided under the scheme\".\n\"Someone is going to need to pick up the bill and pay the difference. This contract makes clear it's going to be the leaseholders and for many, this could be tens of thousands of pounds, potentially ruinous costs,\" he warned.\nMr Hansen said that leaseholders wanted the focus of government action \"to be on the manufacturers of the defective materials and construction companies who built these buildings\".\n\"At the moment, they are the ones profiting from putting people's lives at risk.\"\nFirst-time buyer Amy Cottenden, who is 28, bought a one-bed flat in Metis Tower in the centre of Sheffield for \u00a385,000 in 2017.\nInspections of the 14-storey building in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy revealed it had the same type of flammable ACM cladding and other safety faults.\nWork to remove the cladding started last month, but Ms Cottenden, who is a frontline NHS health worker, is frustrated at what she describes as a lack of progress.\n\"The pace of work is extremely slow. So far, they've put scaffolding up and removed three panels. They have told us it's going to take between 12 and 24 months just to take the cladding off,\" she said.\n\"It is absolutely terrifying knowing that you are stuck here. With lockdown, they are saying not to go out, but you are in a building where all you want to do is not be in it. You can't leave. You can't sell. My flat isn't worth anything until it is made safe.\"\nWhile the government's Building Safety Fund is paying for the Grenfell-style cladding to be removed, the building has other fire safety faults, including missing fire breaks, that aren't covered by the scheme.\nIt could cost up to \u00a36m to fix. Flat owners fear they may face huge bills of up to \u00a350,000 each.\n\"We can't pay it and we shouldn't have to pay it. It is not our fault. We could all go bankrupt because of this,\" Ms Cottenden said.\nA spokesperson for Rendall & Rittner, the company which manages Metis Tower, said government funding to remove ACM cladding had been approved totalling \u00a36.3m.\nHowever, an application to the same fund to pay for the removal of other types of unsafe cladding was rejected and the company has appealed against that decision.\nThe company added: \"We understand and sympathise with residents and owners about the uncertainty that this situation is causing and will do all we can to assist.\"\nWhat started as a cladding scandal has now become a much wider building safety crisis, exposing decades of regulatory failure.\nSafety inspections have revealed that many buildings have other serious faults, including missing fire breaks, flammable balconies and defective insulation. None of that is covered by the government's Building Safety Fund.\nDr Nigel Glen, the chief executive of ARMA, the trade association for residential leasehold management, said the additional costs that leaseholders were currently facing for non-cladding-related issues remained a huge concern.\n\"In the longer term, the draining of reserve funds will also mean that in the years to come, any major works that were being saved up for, such as a new roof or lift repairs, will have to be funded anew by the leaseholders,\" he added.\nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said that despite the pandemic, significant progress had been made to remove dangerous cladding, but \"building safety remains the responsibility of the building owner and we expect them to ensure any necessary work is carried out safely and effectively\".\n\"All applicants to the Building Safety Fund are told the amount of funding they have been awarded before being asked to sign contracts - this is clearly explained in the guidance,\" the spokesperson added."

      "text": "Welsh party leaders have clashed on the Welsh government's pandemic support for businesses in a BBC election debate.\nLabour's Mark Drakeford said \u00a3200m was waiting to be spent by the next first minister after the election to give firms hit by the pandemic more help.\nBut Plaid Cymru's Adam Price questioned why it could not have been spent before the vote on 6 May.\nConservative Andrew RT Davies said there was unallocated cash in Welsh government coffers.\nAnd Jane Dodds said the Welsh Liberal Democrats would support medium, small and micro-businesses.\nMeanwhile Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party's (ATWAP) Richard Suchorzewski said firms should be given rent relief to encourage them to open up.\nThe five appeared in the BBC Wales Leaders' Debate on Thursday evening, a week before the Welsh Parliament election on 6 May.\nSIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nWelsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford told the debate his government had set aside \u00a3200m \"as a down payment to go on helping businesses straight after the election\".\n\"Whoever is in government, whichever one of us on this platform is first minister after next Thursday, there will be proposals waiting on the desk for them to spend that money to support businesses.\"\nBut Mr Price questioned why Mr Drakeford was waiting until after the election. \n\"Why wait?\" Mr Price said. \"In England and Scotland there have been restart grants of up to \u00a318,000, \u00a319,000, which will be provided to hospitality businesses and others who have had to remain closed\".\n\"It's a very simple reason, it's the rules don't allow it,\" Mr Drakeford said in response.\n\"If I was handing out cheques to businesses in Wales, Adam Price would be the first person calling foul.\"\nMr Price said that was not true, saying he called for a Senedd recall during the campaign and would have supported it.\nMr Davies said this was why he had called \"back in February for a road map out of lockdown.\n\"So those announcement could have been made outside of the election period and that money made available to businesses across Wales.\"\nWALES ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat's happening? On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.  Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Senedd have? MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. \nJane Dodds said her party would support medium, small and micro-businesses, which she described as the \"backbone\" of the country. \n\"We want to freeze business rates, we want to be talking to people about what can replace those,\" she said.\n\"We want to go bigger, we want an economic development [plan] which looks at the whole of Wales, and how we can grow our economy and support small businesses\".\nLast month Plaid Cymru had called for ATWAP's Mr Suchorzewski to be dropped from the proceedings. During the debate his anti-devolution stance came under attack from his political rivals.\nMr Suchorzewski said the NHS in Wales had been \"totally mismanaged\" over the past 22 years. \nHe said that before the pandemic, five of Wales' health boards had been in special measures.  \nMr Suchorzewski said control of the NHS should be returned to the UK government: \"There should be one NHS for all - and it should be put under the guidance of the United Kingdom government.\"\nMark Drakeford was asked about why he couldn't distribute the \u00a3200m set aside for supporting businesses until after the election and he said: \"The rules don't allow it - we're in an election period.\" \nThe time before an election - in this case the period since 25 March - is known as the \"period of sensitivity\" or \"purdah\", when there are restrictions on what ministers and civil servants are allowed to do.\nThe Welsh government's guidance says that during that period, in line with the ministerial code, ministers will not make announcements that \"could be construed as conferring political advantage or electoral advantage\".\nBut the guidance also recognises that, as a result of the pandemic, ministers \"will need to continue making important decisions\" and that \"some of these decisions may inevitably be high profile and potentially sensitive\".\nSo Mr Drakeford may be taking a cautious approach to the rules, especially as he could argue that supporting businesses hit by the pandemic was not a new policy initiative but an extension of an existing policy.\nThat led Mr Drakeford to accuse the Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party of \"writing off everything our people have done over the last extraordinary 12 months\".\n\"As we stand here today, Wales has the lowest rate of coronavirus anywhere in the United Kingdom and our vaccination programme is the most successful of any of the four UK nations,\" he said.\nHe admitted the UK government had done a good job in securing the supply of vaccines, but added: \"Here in Wales, we have used that supply more effectively than anywhere else.\"\nAfter Mr Suchorzewski complained about the printing of letters in English and Welsh language for Covid-19 tests, Mr Price accused him of wanting to get rid of the Welsh language: \"They don't want to abolish our parliament they want to abolish our language as well.\"\nMr Davies said: \"If the rugby team isn't playing well you don't... pull it out of the competition, you change the management structure, you change the coach and you get the team performing.\"\nAt the other side of the constitutional debate, Mr Price said now was the time to start building towards a referendum on Welsh independence.\n\"By taking our future into our own hands, that's the way that we solve our problems, the solutions will never come from Westminster.\"\nAsked how Wales would have fared alone in dealing with Covid, Mr Price accused the UK government of stealing Covid tests from Wales: \"We had tests that were ready to come to Wales, they were stolen by the UK government.\"\n\"Rubbish,\" said Mr Davies, adding Mr Price and ATWAP would cause \"constitutional chaos... slapping on the table the independence referendum, and indeed the abolish referendum that would be required to do away with the Welsh Parliament\".\nResponding to a question about the row over the refurbishment of Boris Johnson's flat, the Welsh Tory Senedd leader said: \"People aren't interested in the wallpaper in Downing Street, but they are interested in how they get an appointment at a GP's surgery\".\nHe told the debate: \"We can have a better education system, we can have a health service that responds to waiting times. We can create an economy that lifts wages across the whole of Wales and makes a difference.\"\nJane Dodds said Wales should have the same level of devolution as Scotland. \nShe said \"we don't need independence\" and instead time should be spent on creating jobs and protecting health. \nShe called on voters to \"imagine\" a better Wales. \nMs Dodds added that the Liberal Democrats wanted to \"put the climate at the heart of everything, and would  \"put recovery first\" and prioritise the economy and mental health. \nReform UK, UKIP and the Greens also took part in a three-way debate.\nFor Reform UK, Jamie Jenkins said his party was against further Covid lockdowns. \nHe claimed the majority of people now have antibodies and the successful rollout of the vaccine means restrictions are no longer necessary. \nFor UKIP, Neil Hamilton said: \"The idea that the Senedd in any way represents ordinary people in Wales is nonsense\".   \nHe said Wales was the poorest part of the UK: \"We're poorer today than 22 years ago. We've had a permanent Labour government and we're going to get a Labour government again after the sixth of May, because Plaid Cymru are already cosying up to Mark Drakeford.\"   \nAmelia Womak from the Green Party says that a vote for green jobs is a vote to \"rebuild a post pandemic Wales fit for the 21st century.\" \nAsked how she would rebuild the economy while guarding the environment, Ms Womak said that \"all of our recovery should have the environment at the heart of it, because it means jobs and opportunities it means training and education, and it means that we're tackling the biggest problems of our time.\" \nA five way debate is unlikely ever to produce an outright winner.\nBut it is very easy to come unstuck in this format - and the leaders avoided any big mistakes.\nTheir supporters will each find things to applaud and this will  have given them some added momentum going into the final week of the campaign.\nFor undecided voters the debate gave a decent flavour of what the parties are about - what does that mean for polling day? We'll find out soon.   "

      "tags": "US politics,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "As President Joe Biden wraps up the first 100 days of his term, many public opinion polls show he has the support of a majority of the American public.\nSupporters have praised his efforts to combat the pandemic with a massive economic relief package and a speedy vaccine rollout.\nOthers say the Democrat has shown little interest in garnering Republican support on his proposals.\nMr Biden's performance report may guide how he governs in the rest of his term.\nThree voters - a Democrat, a Republican and an independent - shared their thoughts with the BBC as the president reached the symbolic 100 day mark.\nA soon-to-be college graduate, Josh, a Democrat, voted for Joe Biden because he wanted an experienced politician in charge who was willing to compromise to get things done.\nHas Biden delivered?\nI'm very impressed. The biggest thing is the vaccine rollout. Here in California, if you want a vaccine, you can go out and get it. I was very satisfied with the speed with which it was done logistically and the messaging from the federal government.\nRight now, the momentum is going his way. Vaccines are getting through and people are getting their stimulus cheques, so I'm seeing a lot of hope. I'm really hoping to see him lead us out of the pandemic.\nWhat was the most consequential action of Biden's first 100 days?\nRecognising the Armenian genocide was big. Coming from a Jewish background, the Holocaust is top of mind and we are able to recognise it through Holocaust Day and museums. But for my Armenian brothers and friends, the atrocities were never recognised by the United States until now. \nWhat hopes or concerns do you have for the rest of his term?\nOne reason I really wanted him in office was because he had experience working across the aisle with Republicans. \nI thought he could pass legislation with bipartisan consensus, but he's not getting Republican votes on the stuff that he's pushing through. From adding a seat to the Supreme Court to getting rid of the filibuster, those are things that need bipartisan agreement and you can't just shove through. \nLesley is a self-employed financial advisor, Canadian immigrant and registered independent who voted for Joe Biden because she hoped he would get Covid under control and work with global allies.\nHas Biden delivered?\nI think he's accomplished a lot. He prioritised trying to get Covid under control and get people vaccinated. They didn't have a whole lot of cooperation from the previous administration so I really do commend him on what he's been able to do in a short time. \nThe other thing is they were able to get additional stimulus money passed to address the people who really had needs.\nWhat was the most consequential action of Biden's first 100 days?\nOn his very first day, he signed a bunch of executive orders. One of them had to do with anti-Asian hate.  One of them was getting back into the Paris climate accord. \nFor four years prior, we had somebody in leadership who really didn't work for the people. I'm just grateful to have someone who can try to steer the ship back in the direction we need to be going.\nWhat hopes or concerns do you have for the rest of his term?\nI hope this administration will take some serious actions on police reform. \"Abolish the police\" does not in itself make sense, but there needs to be police reform. And I really hope it's a bipartisan step forward.\nMy main concern is that there's so much work to be done I don't know how they prioritise what to do first. It's beyond cleaning up after the last administration. I hope all Americans will give Biden a fair chance. \nA fiscal conservative who did not vote for Joe Biden, Jim is glad there's less drama in this White House but fears his concerns of a liberal overreach are coming true.\nHas Biden delivered?\nWhat he's done well is Covid vaccine administration. It has gone fairly smoothly and 200 million doses is in line with his promises.\nThe spending is a big concern. He's pushed through trillions of dollars in Covid relief and infrastructure spending which makes me fearful for the economy. \nIn the short term, there's a lot of money out there, but that's going to change over time. I am concerned about the kind of country we're going to leave behind for my kids and grandkids. It's big government on steroids.\nWhat was the most consequential action of Biden's first 100 days?\nThe consequential thing is the contrast from the previous president. Biden is very lowkey, stays on message, and there is not a lot of drama. Stylistically, he's vastly different from Donald Trump.\nBut the most consequential thing in the first 100 days was probably the signing of the COVID relief bill. It put a lot of money into people's hands who needed it, and overall it rolled out fairly well.\nWhat hopes or concerns do you have for the rest of his term?\nAside from the spending trend we're on, I'm concerned about the border crisis. I never believed the wall was an absolute necessity but, looking at what's going on down there, it seems almost out of control. Immigration is a big issue and I really don't see Biden addressing it.\nI'm hopeful that he will genuinely try to work with Republicans and meet people halfway instead of going all the way to the left."

      "text": "Sinn F\u00e9in has asked two Foyle MLAs to consider their positions following a party restructure in Londonderry, BBC News NI understands. \nMartina Anderson and Karen Mullan were informed last week by party officials, the Irish Examiner first reported. \nPreviously, the party have said they \"accepted recommendations from a review\" and will begin to set up an electoral strategy group in Derry.\nIt follows concerns by Sinn F\u00e9in around recent election results in Foyle.\nBBC News NI approached Ms Anderson and Ms Mullan for comment but received no response. \nIn the 2019 UK General Election, then Sinn F\u00e9in MP Elisha McCallion lost her Foyle seat to SDLP leader Colum Eastwood by more than 17,000 votes.\nMonths earlier, the party lost five seats on Derry City and Strabane District Council, losing its position as the largest party at council level.\nSinn F\u00e9in has said the strategy group will now be established in the Foyle constituency ahead of next year's Assembly elections.\nSpeaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday, Sinn F\u00e9in's Conor Murphy did not confirm whether or not the two MLAs were asked to consider their positions by the party. \nMr Murphy, Northern Ireland's Finance Minister, said the party restructure in Derry is \"an internal matter\". \n\"What it means is that the party, like any sensible party in a specific geographical area where you're having poor election results, which is in contrast to better results right across Ireland, has to recognise that there are issues there.\n\"The party has to examine those internally in terms of the local organisation and see how they can put together solutions to fix those and to get ready for upcoming elections.\n\"That is simply what the party is doing, it is an internal matter and that is simply what is going on in Derry.\"\nIf events of the past 48 hours concerning the DUP had not dominated the news, this story would have generated much more coverage.\nIt marks a massive step by Sinn F\u00e9in to radically overhaul its presence in Derry, following the loss of the Westminster seat to the SDLP two years ago. \nAt the time it was deemed a wake up call for many in the party. Now it's clear they intend to act on it.\nHowever, it will come as a surprise that one of those being asked to think about her future is Martina Anderson - she has been a Sinn F\u00e9in stalwart for decades and was the party's voice in Brussels for years.\nBut party loyalty may not be not enough as Sinn F\u00e9in begins devising its strategies ahead of the next assembly election, in a bid to win back some ground. \nBoth Ms Anderson and Ms Mullan were co-opted into the Stormont Assembly.\nMs Anderson, who stepped down from her MEP role in 2020, replaced Raymond McCartney in March that year.\nPreviously, Ms Anderson served as an MLA for Foyle from 2007 to 2012.\nKaren Mullan replaced Elisha McCallion as a Foyle MLA in June 2017 following Mrs McCallion's election as an MP for Foyle."

      "title": "Biden 100 days: What we all got wrong about him",
      "tags": "US politics,Joe Biden",
      "text": "For the White House press corps who've binged out for four years on the son et lumi\u00e8re of the Trump-show, the last three months have been a challenge. \nAs I remarked, perhaps unwisely, to an audience the other night, the transition from Trump to Joe Biden has been like going from a daily crack pipe to a small bottle of low-alcohol beer once a week.\nThe daily White House briefings now are a snoozefest. There are no fights, no name-calling. \nNo middle-of-the-night Twitter storms, no payments to porn stars, no rollicking MAGA rallies.\nSo does all this mean it's been a boring presidency? Absolutely not. This is a far more interesting presidency - so far - than I think any of us had imagined. I would go as far as to say it's fascinating. \nThe sad thing, from a purely selfish point of view, is that what it isn't is a made-for-TV spectacular, which is what I have feasted on these past four years. \nDonald Trump always had an eye for the visual and outrageous. He knew how to make himself the centre of attention; Biden seems to relish the lack of histrionics, and seems to think it is important for people to focus on what he delivers, rather than what he says. Most strange.\nWe reported that Joe Biden - all 78 years of him - would be a transitional president. He would be there to lower the political temperature; try to heal a divided nation. \nTake the absurd politics out of the response to Covid. Improve vaccine roll-out. Drain the poison from the body politic. But that aside, not do too much. \nHe appointed a largely technocratic cabinet, presumably to perform managerial functions. Maybe make the trains run on time a bit better, but not change all the rolling stock, let alone alter the gauge of the railway. A fitting ambition for Amtrak Joe.\nBut maybe we've got that all wrong. Is it possible that far from being transitional, he's transformational?\nAnd that word is not freighted with a positive or negative connotation - it is merely a statement based on the ambition of what we've seen so far. Voters will soon decide whether it's for better or worse.\nLet's start with the $1.9 trillion (\u00a31.35tn) stimulus package. \nThe headline from the passing of this humungous piece of legislation was that nearly all adult Americans would receive a cheque for $1,400 to help them cope with the hardships brought about by the pandemic. It was cash in hand to a lot of Americans, and won massive approval - from Democratic and Republican voters alike - although not a single Republican lawmaker would back the proposal.\nBut look beyond the headline and lift the lid on this policy a little further. There is a lot to see. Perhaps most significant is the extension of child tax credits. Poorer families could soon be receiving up to $3,000 per child per annum. It is estimated this one measure will lift literally millions of youngsters out of poverty. As things stand, this measure is for 2021 only - but it is clear within the White House that Joe Biden wants to make this permanent. \nIt is a major piece of social policy. It is big potatoes. \nWith the passing of the stimulus package - or the American Rescue Package, as it is more properly called - Biden wanted to correct something he felt that Barack Obama had got wrong when he came to power and inherited the mess of the financial crisis in 2009. Yes, Obama passed a variety of measures - but with hindsight they were seen as too cautious; not ambitious enough.\nOne insight that Biden has borrowed from his time as vice-president to America's first African-American president, is do not let a good crisis go to waste. The urgency of the pandemic has given Biden the excuse he needed to push for a massive plan. And he got it through.\nNow look at what he's planning on rebuilding America's infrastructure. Again, the price tag will be in the trillions. Again, the ambition will be immense - not just the staid repairing of bridges and roads (important and vital though that is); it is about making digital access more equitable - but it goes wider than that. Way wider.\n\"It is not a plan that tinkers around the edges,\" the president told an audience outside Pittsburgh. \"It is a once-in-a-generation investment in America.\"\nFor Republicans it's typical government overreach and smacks more of social engineering than the civic kind usually associated with highway repairs.\nThe wish-list of what Biden hopes to achieve from this infrastructure plan goes on and on. It aspires to create millions of jobs in the short term and strengthen American competitiveness in the long. It hopes to lead to greater racial equality. The focus on new, cleaner energy sources promises to help the nation fight climate change.\nOn the subject of which, look too at the ambitious goals he's set for climate change with the virtual summit he held last week in Washington. These are not the actions of a steady-as-you-go president. A 52% cut in emissions by the end of the decade is BIG. \nWho knows whether he'll achieve it - it's going to require Americans to change the way they drive; the way they heat and cool their homes. The way industry functions. But if the ambition is to show American ambition, it is, umm, ambitious.\nNow obviously there is an element of motherhood and apple pie in this shopping list. And the measure needs to pass through Congress, and that hasn't happened. \nAnd whilst I am in the business of saying \"and\", let me add this\u2026. and there is something slightly ridiculous on the focus of the first 100 days. \nThe first 100 days is a statement of intent, a down payment on what you might do with the rest of your term. But frankly, who cares if you have a sparkling first 100 days if the subsequent 1,360 stink and sink?\nAll that said, the statement of intent is big, and this is what makes boring old Joe Biden so interesting. \nThis is a blog column and not a book, but arguably the dominant idea in American politics for the past 40 years has been the low-taxing, economy-deregulating, budget-balancing, competition-encouraging, union-limiting small government of Ronald Reagan. \nThe same is true of the influence of Thatcherism in the UK - yes, there have been 13 years of Labour government since Maggie's demise, just as here there have been the Clinton and Obama terms since Reagan. But arguably they operated within, and were defined by, the orthodoxy of the monetarist economists who've held such intellectual sway on both sides of the Atlantic: Milton Friedman, the Chicago school, Laffer curves, Sir Alan Walters. \nIf Obama's rescue package didn't go far enough (as Biden believes), surely that was because he was looking at the disruptive and growing power of the conservative Tea Party movement. Both Clinton and Blair saw their paths to victory through the elusive \"third way\": free-market economic liberalism with a big dollop of concern for the least well off.\nAfter the morale-sapping defeats of the 1980s-  both for Labour in the UK and Democrats in the US - the head-scratching was intense on what they needed to do to win. Both Bill Clinton and Tony Blair came to believe firmly that tax-raising and big government pledges would not reverse that trend.\nBut Biden - for better or worse - looks like he is using the pandemic and the woeful state of America's infrastructure to unapologetically say to the American people \"yep, big government is back\". It is territory that Republican opponents - still trying to sort out their post-Trumpian identity - will be keen to fight on.\nJoe Biden's former pollster is even more bullish, arguing the president should be more direct about the need to raise taxes on the wealthiest to pay for this ambition.\nMake no mistake: this is a big break and a mighty gamble. So far, his approval ratings on the ground where he has chosen to fight - handling of coronavirus, the economic stimulus, his plans for infrastructure - have been really positive. \nLess so over the chaos at the southern border; something the president now acknowledges is a crisis. And the perennial issue of gun control is going to lead to a lot of huffing and puffing, but it's hard to see what he will be able to achieve through legislation, given the fine balance of the Senate.\nJoe Biden has been a stickler for sticking to social distancing and mask wearing, marking a big distinction with the freewheeling, coronavirus super-spreading White House of his predecessor. Meetings with the president are kept socially distanced; protocols strictly adhered to. \nBut this time last month an interesting meeting took place in the East Room.\nPresidential historian Jon Meacham brought in a number of his eminent colleagues for a sitdown that Joe Biden was anxious to host. At this stage, only around 60 days into his presidency, Biden was already thinking about his legacy and what he needed to do; what was the limit of presidential power; what lessons could he learn from his predecessors. \nAt one point he turns to - perhaps - the most revered of these presidential scholars, Doris Kearns Goodwin, and says \"I'm no FDR, but\u2026 \"\nPerhaps Joe Biden is eyeing this as his moment to deliver a New Deal \u00e0 la Franklin Delano Roosevelt following the Great Depression, or the war on poverty and fight against racial inequality that was championed in the 1960s by Lyndon B Johnson.\nThe taunt of Donald Trump during the campaign was that Biden may have been in politics for over four decades, but what did he have to show for it. \nIt looks like in power he is trying to give a mighty clear answer to that question - even if it doesn't make for great theatre."

      "title": "Kirsty Maxwell: Balcony fall family call for Scots coroner",
      "tags": "Livingston,Benidorm",
      "text": "The family of a Scottish woman who died after falling from a balcony in Benidorm four years ago are calling for Scotland to adopt a coroners system.\nIn England and Wales, the coroner investigates all unexpected deaths.  \nKirsty Maxwell's parents said if she had been from Liverpool instead of Livingston, they would have received far more help from the authorities.  \nHer father Brian Curry said that instead, they were left to cope almost entirely by themselves.  \nHe told BBC Scotland: \"When Kirsty died, if we'd had the coroners system, we could have had more of an investigation here.\n\"We've been told that an inquest would have been mandatory. But in Scotland we don't have anything.\"\nKirsty was in Benidorm for a hen weekend  when she died on 29 April 2017.  \nAfter their first night on the town, in the early hours of the morning, she and her friends returned to the apartment block where they were staying and went to bed. \nAt about 07:50, Kirsty left the apartment and went to the floor above, where some of her friends were in another flat. \nShe knocked on the wrong door and went into an apartment which was being used by a group of men from Nottingham. \nWithin minutes she had fallen to her death from their 10th floor balcony.\nThe police in Benidorm initially treated the case as a suspected homicide but after an investigation, the Spanish authorities ruled there was not enough evidence to show that a crime had taken place.  \nThey said Kirsty had been disorientated and \"greatly affected by the intake of alcohol\".\nThe men from Nottingham said Kirsty's death had been a tragic accident, denied any involvement and expressed their deepest sympathy to her family.\nKirsty's family have described the Spanish investigation as shambolic. They claim crucial evidence was destroyed and important lines of inquiry ignored.\nThey said that when she died they received sympathetic but limited consular assistance from the Foreign Office in Benidorm. \nWhen they returned home with her body, Police Scotland told them they were unable to get involved.\nMr Curry said Scottish families who lost a loved one abroad have to do everything by themselves.\nHe said: \"The families have got to go and fight the case, the families have got to raise money, the families have got to go abroad, the families have got to find a lawyer, the families have got to go to the courts, so it's left up to the families to do everything on their own.\"\nHad Kirsty been from England or Wales, once her body was returned home, a coroner would have taken responsibility for establishing how she died.  \nAn inquest would have been held and an officer from the local police force would have become involved.\nMr Curry said: \"If we had the coroners system, we could have had the girls who were with Kirsty interviewed, the men interviewed, we could have had a dedicated senior investigating officer, we could have had a \"go-to\" person.\"\nA retired English coroner who lives in Fife is advising the family's legal team.\nDonald Coutts-Wood told the BBC: \"If it's a violent or unnatural death, the coroner must investigate and part of that investigation is an inquest. There would be a lot of witnesses. The girls, the men, and expert witnesses on how she fell and so on.\n\"It's not just in England and Wales. If you look round other countries, they have some form of coronial system. Australia, Canada, New Zealand. America does. Northern Ireland does. \n\"I did many, many inquests. It gave families some sort of ability to move on.\"\nSix weeks after Kirsty died, a new law came into force in Scotland, allowing fatal accident inquiries to be held into the deaths of Scots abroad.  \nIt wasn't retrospective and such FAIs would only take place at the discretion of the Lord Advocate, the head of Scotland's prosecution service. \nThe inquiry would be limited to establishing what lessons could be learned to prevent similar deaths in the future. In four years the new powers have not been used once.  \nMr Curry said: \"We need to find out what happened to Kirsty. We need answers. We just need people to be open and tell us what happened. But we need that help to get those answers.\" \nA Scottish government spokesman said ministers had met a number of families to discuss their experiences and the difficulties they faced following the death of a loved one abroad.\nHe said: \"While it is the role of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office to provide consular support, we will continue to work alongside UK government departments and other key agencies to improve how victims and their families are supported following the death of a relative overseas.\""

      "title": "Electoral Commission to investigate Boris Johnson's Downing Street flat renovations",
      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Electoral Commission ",
      "text": "The Electoral Commission has launched an investigation into funding of works on Boris Johnson's Downing Street flat. \nThe spending watchdog said there were \"reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred\".\nThe PM is under growing pressure to declare how refurbishments were paid for after his ex-adviser said there was a plan for donors to \"secretly pay\".\nMr Johnson told MPs he had covered the revamp \"personally\", but would not say who had paid the initial bill.\nAnd, speaking at the government's Covid press conference, Health Secretary Matt Hancock repeatedly refused to comment on the funding of the refurbishment, urging the media to \"concentrate on the big things that really matter\".\nThe prime minister receives an annual public grant of \u00a330,000 to carry out renovations to his Downing Street flat each year - but newspaper reports suggest the bill for the latest renovations could be as high as \u00a3200,000.\nIn its investigation, the commission - the independent watchdog regulating UK political finance - will assess the Conservative Party's compliance with laws on political donations.\nIt will examine whether any spending on the flat falls within its remit, and if it was published as required. \nThe commission can impose fines if breaches are found, or pass on allegations to the police if it sees fit. \nDuring fraught exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pushed Mr Johnson to explain who had paid the initial invoice for renovations - asking whether it was the taxpayer, the Conservative Party, a private donor or Mr Johnson himself.\nHe accused the government of being \"mired in sleaze, cronyism and scandal\".\nBut Mr Johnson replied: \"The answer is I have covered the costs... I conformed in full with the code of conduct and officials have kept advising me through this whole thing.\"\nThe Treasury has revealed that Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Mr Johnson's neighbour in Downing Street, also redecorated his flat last year, saying the costs were paid \"upfront and entirely at his own expense\".\n\"Baffling\" - that is one cabinet source's verdict on how No 10 is handling the allegations about the renovations of the Downing Street flat. \nMatt Hancock repeatedly wouldn't engage in questions on the matter at Wednesday's press conference.  \nAnd Boris Johnson wouldn't answer the central question in the Commons earlier during a session of Prime Minister's Questions, where he looked more red-faced and furious than I can recall. \nThe question is a simple one. Who paid the bill for the Downing Street flat makeover at the start? \nAnd for as long as the PM won't answer that, the question will be asked again, and again, and again.\nRead more from Laura Kuenssberg here.\nNo 10 has also confirmed the appointment of a new independent adviser on ministers' interests. \nCrossbench peer Lord Geidt will take up the role, unfilled for five months since the resignation of Sir Alex Allan in November 2020. \nSir Alex quit after Mr Johnson rejected his finding that Home Secretary Priti Patel had broken the ministerial code over bullying allegations.\nDowning Street also confirmed Lord Geidt would carry out his own inquiry into the funding of the renovations and \"advise the prime minister on any further registration of interests that may be needed\".\nHowever, the prime minister's spokesman later said Mr Johnson \"remains the ultimate arbiter\" of the ministerial code - setting out rules of conduct - and would decide whether to accept or reject any findings. \nThe prime minister's former senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, claimed last week that Mr Johnson had once planned to have donors \"secretly pay\" for the work on his flat.\nHe described the move as \"unethical, foolish, possibly illegal\" and said the PM \"almost certainly broke the rules on proper disclosure of political donations if conducted in the way he intended\".\nNo 10 has refused to say whether the prime minister initially received a loan to cover the costs, but Downing Street has insisted the prime minister \"acted in accordance with the appropriate codes of conduct and electoral law\".\nRefusing to answer questions on the flat at the Covid press conference, Mr Hancock said: \"It is important that there are questions, and there were endless questions in the House of Commons earlier on some of the issues that you raise, and you will have seen the appointment of Lord Geidt earlier.\n\"But you have also got to concentrate on the big things that really matter\" \nEstablished in 2001, it is an independent body that regulates political finance in the UK, including donations to political parties.  \nParties, campaigners, and other groups are required to report donations and loans over a certain amount - which are then published.  \nThe watchdog monitors whether the rules are being followed and has powers to ensure they are enforced. \nAs well as being able to refer investigations to the police, it can hand out its own sanctions under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.\nIt can issue investigation notices, disclosure orders and can carry out interviews - as well as impose fines of up to \u00a320,000, which can increase if payments are late."

      "text": "Samsung Electronics has announced its strongest first quarter profits since 2018 on the back of strong mobile sales led by its flagship Galaxy S21 line.  \nThe Korean giant's net profits rose 46.3% compared to the same quarter in 2020 to 7.1tn won ($6.4bn; \u00a34.6bn).\nSales of television and home appliances saw strong growth, buoyed by continued stay-at-home demand.\nHowever, the company's profits were dented by disappointing results for its chips business.   \n\"Solid sales of smartphones and consumer electronics outweighed lower earnings from semiconductors and displays,\" the company said in an earnings report.\nIts main competitor for premium phones Apple also posted bumper results on Tuesday, with iPhone sales in China helping to double the company's profits since the start of the pandemic.   \nBoth companies have done well during the pandemic, as many customers chose to upgrade their phones, laptops and other devices to work from home. \nSamsung is tipping a slightly lacklustre second quarter followed by stronger results in the second half, as the economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic gathers pace and more consumers look to upgrade to 5G mobile services. \nDespite high demand due to a global shortage, Samsung's chips business was hit by the cost of ramping up production domestically and a storm-related stoppage at its Texas factory in February. \nHowever, the factory has resumed full production and the world's largest chipmaker is expecting stronger results for its semiconductor business in the second quarter.\nThe electronics giant warned that this could be offset by a decline in flagship smartphone sales and continuing supply issues with some components.\nThe figures came a day after the family of Samsung's late chairman Lee Kun-hee announced plans to pay more than 12trn won ($10.78bn) in inheritance taxes on his estate.\nThe tax issue has been closely watched, as it could impact the Lee family's stake in Samsung.\nHowever, the announcement provided little clarity about whether or not the Lee family would sell any shares to pay the tax."

      "text": "Three Welsh hospices have warned they face having to cut services unless they receive a large increase in funding from their local health board.\nIt costs about \u00a314m a year to meet the running costs of St David's Hospice in Llandudno, Nightingale House Hospice in Wrexham and St Kentigern in St Asaph. \nThey provide end-of-life and respite care to about 600 patients a year.\nBetsi Cadwaladr health board said it had provided above-inflation increases to the hospices for the past two years.\nThe hospices have argued only 16% of their income is provided by the health board but similar organisations in south Wales and England receive about 30% from their respective health boards.\nElla Baxendale from Anglesey, whose mother Bev Parsons died at St David's Hospice in 2018 after being diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour, is one of those backing the call.\n\"The fact that it was round-the-clock care by experts, not just professionals, was a massive help,\" she said.\n\"Even the tiniest adjustment of pain relief - they were able to do them at the drop of a hat. Whereas, at home, it was a much more complicated process to change anything medication-wise.\n\"But they looked after us as a family as well. There was always a gentle pat on the shoulder.\n\"We got my mum back. I could go back to being just her daughter. My dad - he bore the brunt of most of the caring. \n\"He got to go back to being her husband and they could actually enjoy the time they had left and that's just something you can't put a price on really.\"\nTrystan Pritchard, chief executive of St David's Hospice in Llandudno, which also provides services in Bangor and Holyhead, said there was \"an over-dependence\" on fundraising to keep the three hospices running.\n\"There is no doubt the Welsh government and health board have said on many occasions that hospice services are essential to their end-of-life care strategies,\" said Mr Pritchard, who was speaking on behalf of all three hospices.\n\"If we can't improve the situation, if the NHS doesn't play its part, then we have no choice but to look at how we deliver services and that might mean having to reduce them.\n\"It's a real threat.\n\"We would do everything in our power not to reduce services, of course, because we have such a bond with our communities.  \n\"But this level of funding has gone on too long and the model is becoming unsustainable in the way that the NHS is contributing towards it.\"\nHe said the contribution of the health board to an end-of-life care bed \"equates to how much you might pay for a budget hotel\".\nChris Stockport, executive director of primary and community care at Betsi Cadwaladr health board, said: \"We recognise the financial challenge facing the hospices in north Wales, in particular during the pandemic, and we are working to support them as much as possible.\n\"However, the services that we provide directly to the public also require significant additional funding, such as funds to support efforts to reduce the backlog of patients waiting for treatment due to Covid-19.\n\"We have provided an above-inflation increase to the hospices over the last two years and we are committed to working with them to continue to increase our contribution in the future that does not compromise our core NHS services.\""

      "text": "Footage has emerged of the head of the US National Rifle Association (NRA) repeatedly shooting an elephant in Botswana, sparking outrage. \nFirst published by the New Yorker and The Trace on Tuesday, the 2013 video shows Wayne LaPierre firing at the animal from point-blank range.\nAfter Mr LaPierre struggles to kill it, another hunter takes the fatal shot. \nIt has led to an outcry from animal rights groups and questions about Mr LaPierre's bungled efforts.\nAt the time it was not illegal to hunt elephants in Botswana, though it has since been restricted. In November last year the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Endangered Species listed the species of elephant killed as endangered. \nIngrid Newkirk, president of animal rights group Peta condemned the footage and called for Congress to cut ties with the NRA. \n\"Behind the NRA's macho posturing are scared little men who pay tens of thousands of dollars for someone else to track elephants so that they can shoot them ineptly at close range,\" she said in a statement. \nBut the NRA has defended the footage. Spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said it was \"fully permitted and conducted in accordance with all rules and regulations\" and said such hunts benefit \"the local community and habitat\".\nFilmed by the NRA-sponsored television series Under Wild Skies in 2013 and not released until now, the video shows Mr LaPierre and his wife on a hunt in Botswana. \nThe NRA head is seen shooting the elephant from range, wounding it. Realising he has not killed the animal, the guides take him in close and show him exactly where to shoot to kill it. \nBut Mr LaPierre repeatedly fails to finish off the elephant. He grows frustrated, asking the guides, \"Where are you telling me to shoot?\"\nAfter his third shot, Tony Makris - an adviser to Mr LaPierre and the host of Under Wild Skies - lifts his rifle and kills the animal. He then turns to congratulate the NRA head. \nLater in the footage, Mr LaPierre's wife Susan kills another elephant herself, cutting off its tail and holding it in the air saying \"Victory\".\nBotswana has more than 130,000 elephants, the world's largest population. Officials banned the right to hunt elephants in 2014 but this was then revoked in May 2019, and last year the government auctioned off hunting permits.\nThis is the latest scandal to engulf Mr LaPierre and the NRA. The gun rights group filed for bankruptcy in January after allegations of financial mismanagement, months after New York's Attorney General announced a lawsuit aimed at dissolving the group.\nMr LaPierre meanwhile has been repeatedly criticised for his response to US mass shootings. After the 2018 shooting at Florida's Stoneman Douglas High School he gave a speech blaming families, mental health systems, the FBI, the mainstream media and European socialists for the attack. \n\"To stop a bad guy with a gun it takes a good guy with a gun,\" he said.

      "tags": "Companies,Facebook,Apple",
      "text": "A surge in iPhone sales, especially in China, has led to a doubling of profits at Apple since the start of the pandemic.\nThe results reflected \"optimism\" about the days ahead, Apple's boss said.\nRival tech firm Facebook also reported bumper revenues and profits.\nBut the social media giant warned Apple's latest software release could undermine its prospects later in the year.\nApple has seen sales of its phones, apps and other devices rise throughout the pandemic, as consumers spent more time working, shopping and seeking entertainment online.\nCustomers continued to upgrade to Apple's new 5G phones which were rolled out last year, and also bought Mac computers and iPads to tackle working and studying from home, the firm said.\nFitness and music apps also saw a lockdown boost.\nSales to China nearly doubled, leading to overall revenues for the first three months of this year of $89.6bn (\u00a364.2bn), more than 50% up compared to a year earlier.\nProfit was $23.6bn, up from $11.3bn for the same period last year.\n\"This quarter reflects both the enduring ways our products have helped our users meet this moment in their own lives, as well as the optimism consumers seem to feel about better days ahead for all of us,\" said chief executive Tim Cook.\nPaolo Pescatore, analyst with PP Foresight, said it was \"another blowout quarter\" for Apple. \n\"The iPhone remains a core product and gateway to the Apple universe,\" he added, providing Apple with \"a key launchpad\" to sell further services.\nSophie Lund-Yates, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said customers had proved willing to \"splurge on big-ticket items thanks to a global shift to working from home, and the fact people have found comfort in treating themselves\".\n\"The sheer scale of Apple's sales is testament to the grip that shiny embossed piece of fruit has on global consumers,\" she added.\nFacebook, which relies on sales of advertising rather than consumer electronics, also saw bumper revenues and profits in the first three months of the year.\nThe time spent by consumers at home, and the spending power that shifted online, translated into revenues of $26.17bn, outpacing analysts predictions. Profit was also higher than expected at $9.5bn.\nFacebook said in coming months it expected revenue to be stable or grow moderately, and admitted a new feature released this week by Apple - an option for users to prevent apps from collecting user data - could \"significantly\" hurt its business.\nIt's not just Apple and Facebook who have posted astonishing profits this week. Google and Microsoft announced eye-watering quarterly figures yesterday too. \nThat may not be surprising to many. Global lockdowns have made people work and play more online. What's less clear though was whether this was a pandemic bounce? Or have people permanently changed their behaviour? These figures certainly suggest the latter. \nApple's figures across multiple sectors, across the world, are exceptional. In places like China, which has mostly been lockdown-free in recent months, sales were up dramatically. Facebook's figures too, show that advertisers are feeling bullish about online spending. \nAlmost all of Facebook's revenue is from ads, so when Facebook is doing well, that usually suggests we're buying more things on the internet. Amazon's quarterly figures are out tomorrow, and they too are expected to have had a bumper quarter. Big Tech's pandemic bounce is increasingly looking like a trend. \nThe two companies are locked in a stand-off after Apple announced the latest version of its iOS operating system this week. \nA new feature will prompt device users to decide whether they are happy for their data to be collected by apps. Many are likely to say no.\nBut user data is a large reason why Facebook's ad-based business model is so profitable. It allows advertising to be targeted and monitored for efficacy.\nFacebook saw a rise in monthly active users, however, which were up by 10% at 2.85 billion.\nOn Tuesday Google's parent company Alphabet reported a record profit in the three months to March as its advertising revenue swelled by a third. \nThe firm credited \"elevated consumer activity online\" for its results as populations around the world spent more time indoors at home to avoid the spread of coronavirus."

      "text": "The FBI has carried out searches at the home and office of Rudy Giuliani, who was Donald Trump's personal lawyer.\nThe raid is part of a probe into Mr Giuliani's dealings with Ukraine. His lawyer says he denies breaking the law.\nBefore the 2020 presidential election Mr Giuliani led an effort to find incriminating information about Democratic candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine.\nMr Biden won the election and he and his son have denied any wrongdoing.\nMr Trump was impeached in 2019 over allegations he sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election.\nSearches took place on Wednesday at the former New York City mayor's Upper East Side apartment, as well as his Park Avenue office.\nSeveral electronic devices belonging to the 76-year-old were seized, according to the New York Times.\nThe warrants included an allegation that Giuliani failed to register as a foreign agent. The Foreign Agents Registration Act requires people to notify the State Department if they are acting as a foreign agent on behalf of another nation.\nMr Giuliani's lawyer, Robert Costello, called the searches \"legal thuggery\".\n\"This is totally unnecessary,\" Mr Costello told Fox News, adding that the search was conducted to \"make him look like he's some sort of criminal\".\nHe added that the raids stem from an \"alleged incident of failure to register as a foreign agent\".\nMr Giuliani has previously called the investigation \"pure political persecution\".\nMr Giuliani played a central role in the effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate Mr Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm. He was also instrumental in the ousting of the former US ambassador to Ukraine, witnesses at Mr Trump's impeachment trial testified.\nHunter Biden is facing an unrelated criminal tax probe from the US Justice Department.\nWednesday's search warrant does not imply criminality on the part of Mr Giuliani, but it signals a ramping up of the case into the former mayor.\nInvestigators have released few details so far about the case and it remains unknown whether the Republican will eventually face any charges.\nThe search warrant was signed by a federal judge. Warrants against lawyers such as Mr Giuliani require the authorisation of senior Justice Department officials, the Associated Press reports.\nMr Giuliani began representing the former president in April 2018 when Mr Trump was being investigated for his involvement with Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\nAfter Mr Trump's election loss in November, Mr Giuliani toured the country speaking to Republican state legislators in an effort to get state lawmakers to overturn the result in favour of Mr Trump."

Ms McBride returned the dogs to the police two days after the theft, after Lady Gaga had offered a $500,000 (\u00a3359,000) reward for their return. \n\"Detectives were able to establish McBride had a relationship [with] Harold White,\" a Los Angeles police press release said. \nAll four men charged were \"documented gang members\", the release said, without giving details. \nPolice said they did not think the attackers were aware Mr Fischer worked for Lady Gaga - whose real name is Stefani Germanotta - when they attacked him.\nBut evidence suggested they knew \"the great value of the breed of dogs\", which was \"the motivation for the robbery\".\nMr Fischer was walking the three dogs in a residential area of Hollywood at night when the attackers pulled up in a car.\nHe was shot in the chest with a semi-automatic handgun and two of the dogs were taken. Another of Lady Gaga's bulldogs, Asia, was unharmed in the incident. \nMr Fischer later described Asia as his \"guardian angel\" who gave him the determination to survive. \n\"My panicked screams calmed as I looked at her, even though it registered that the blood pooling around her tiny body was my own,\" he wrote in an Instagram post in March.\n\"I cradled Asia as best I could, thanked her for all the incredible adventures we'd been on together, apologised that I couldn't defend her brothers, and then resolved that I would still try to save them\u2026 and myself.\""

      "tags": "Archaeology,Poland",
      "text": "A team of Polish scientists say they have discovered the only known example of an embalmed pregnant Egyptian mummy.\nThe discovery was made by researchers at the Warsaw Mummy Project and revealed in the Journal of Archaeological Science on Thursday.\nThe project, started in 2015, uses technology to examine artefacts housed at the National Museum in Warsaw. \nThe mummy was previously thought to be a male priest but scans reveal it was a woman in the later stages of pregnancy. \nExperts from the project believe the remains are most likely of a high-status woman, aged between 20 and 30, who died during the 1st Century BC.  \n\"Presented here is the only known example of a mummified pregnant woman and the first radiological images of such a foetus,\" they wrote in the journal article announcing the find. \nUsing the foetus head circumference, they estimate it was between 26 and 30 weeks when the mother died for unknown reasons.\n\"This is our most important and most significant finding so far, a total surprise,\" team member Wojciech Ejsmond of the Polish Academy of Sciences told the Associated Press. \nFour bundles, thought to be wrapped and embalmed organs, were found within the mummy's abdominal cavity but scientists say the foetus had not been removed from the uterus. \nThe scientists said it was unclear why it had not been extracted and embalmed separately, but speculated spiritual beliefs about the afterlife or physical difficulties with removal may have contributed.\nResearchers from the mummy project have dubbed the woman as the Mysterious Lady of the National Museum in Warsaw because of conflicting accounts around her origins. \nThey say the mummified remains were first donated to the University of Warsaw in 1826. The donor alleged the mummy was found in royal tombs in Thebes, but researchers say it was common in the 19th century to falsely ascribe antiquities to famous places to increase their value.\nInscriptions on the elaborate coffin and sarcophagus had led 20th Century experts to believe the mummy inside was that of a male priest named Hor-Djehuti. \nBut now scientists, having identified it as female with scanning technology, believe the mummy was at some point placed in the wrong coffin by antiquity dealers during the 19th Century, when looting and re-wrapping of remains were not uncommon. \nThey describe the condition of the mummy as \"well-preserved\" but say damage to the neck wrappings suggest it was at some point targeted for valuables.\nThe experts say at least 15 items, including a \"rich set\" of mummy-shaped amulets, were found in tact within the wrappings. \nOne of the researchers on the project, Dr Marzena O\u017carek-Szilke, told the Polish state news agency that her husband had first spotted what appeared to be \"a little foot\" on one of the scans.\nShe told the outlet that the team hope next to study small amounts of tissue to establish the woman's cause of death.

      "tags": "US economy,Infrastructure,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden has called for trillions in spending aimed at re-igniting America's economic growth by upgrading its crumbling infrastructure and tackling climate change.\nThe $2.3tn (\u00a31.7tn) proposal would direct billions to initiatives such as charging stations for electric vehicles and eliminating lead water pipes.\nThe spending would be partially offset by raising taxes on businesses.\nThose plans have already roused fierce opposition.\nRepublicans have called the rises \"a recipe for stagnation and decline\", while powerful business lobby groups including the Business Roundtable and Chamber of Commerce said they supported investments but would oppose tax increases.\nThe pushback is a sign of the tough fight ahead for the plan, which needs approval from Congress.\nJoe Biden could have gone in a number of different policy directions after narrowly getting his covid pandemic aid package through Congress. That he opted to push for an infrastructure bill, rather than upping the pressure for gun control, voting rights, immigration, the environment or healthcare reform, suggests he's looking for a popular, non-controversial legislative second act.\nOf course, like that coronavirus package, the Biden administration is likely to use a massive piece of legislation to quietly advance some of those other policy priorities. The proposal contains hundreds of millions of dollars in green energy spending, expanded care for the elderly and disabled and job training, for instance.\nAlso like the coronavirus aid bill, even non-controversial infrastructure provisions that have high public support will be swamped in partisan acrimony. In particular, Republicans are going to vehemently object to the tax increases for corporations and businesses contained in the proposed legislation.\nChances are, Democrats will again have to go it alone when it comes to passing Biden's legislative agenda.\nThe challenge, then, will be keeping the Democratic coalition together at a time when a wide number of constituencies, many of whom held their tongue during the Covid negotiations, line up to ensure their priorities are funded.\nThe White House has promoted its proposal as the most ambitious public spending in decades, saying the investments are necessary to keep the US economy growing and competitive with other countries, especially China.\n\"This is not a plan that tinkers around the edges,\" Mr Biden said in a speech in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Wednesday. \"It's a once in a generation investment in America.\"\nIt calls for investing more than $600bn in infrastructure, including modernising roads, replacing rail cars and buses and repairing crumbling bridges.\nBillions more would be devoted to initiatives like improving veterans hospitals, upgrading affordable housing, expanding high-speed broadband, and providing incentives for manufacturing and technology research.\nIt calls for money to be directed to rural communities and communities of colour, including establishing a national climate-focused laboratory affiliated with an historically black university. \nThe spending, which would have to be approved by Congress, would roll out over eight years. \nThe White House said tax increases would offset the cost over 15 years. \nMr Biden called for raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, a move that would partially undo cuts the US passed in 2017. He also proposed raising the minimum rate charged for overseas profits.\nIn his speech, in an acknowledgment such plans are likely to face, he said he was also \"open to other ideas\" when it came to paying for the spending.\n\"Failing to make these investments adds to our debt and effectively puts our children at a disadvantage relative to our competitors,\" he said. \"The divisions of the moment shouldn't stop us from doing the right thing for the future.\" \nMr Biden's proposal - which closely resembles promises he made during last year's election campaign - comes just weeks after Democrats muscled through $1.9tn more in aid to address the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic, approving that package without Republican support.\nIt's not clear yet how much of Mr Biden's latest plan will make it through Congress - or how much of another spending package focused on areas such as childcare and education that he plans to unveil in coming weeks.\nPaul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said the speedy advance of the pandemic package was unusual. \n\"Normally the negotiations drag on for months and what eventually gets passed, if anything gets passed at all, bears only a passing resemblance to what the administration originally asked for,\" he said. \"We suspect these negotiations will revert to the mean.\"\nEli Allen is director of the Center for Sustainable Careers at Civic Works, a non-profit organisation that offers programmes such as job training focused on careers in sustainable energy in Baltimore, Maryland, a majority black city near Washington, DC.\nHe said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" that something resembling Mr Biden's ambitions would eventually pass and  was particularly heartened by Mr Biden's emphasis on creating \"quality jobs\" in terms of pay and benefits - which he said could help set a standard across the industry.\n\"The focus on racial equity is not something we've seen in some of the past federal programmes that we've worked with,\" he added. \"I think that focus \u2026 is very important as we think about strategies to expand access to these jobs, especially for communities of colour.\"\nStefani Pashman is chief executive of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, a regional economic development group in Pittsburgh, the former steel town in Pennsylvania where Mr Biden delivered his speech on Wednesday.\nThe city, located in a state that was key to Mr Biden's election victory, has been working to reinvent itself as a centre for high-tech research in areas such as autonomous vehicles. \nMs Pashman said the president's promise of billions of government dollars has also injected new energy into ambitious local plans, like an effort by Carnegie Mellon University and rail technology company Wabtec to establish a new research lab focused on innovations in freight rail, like autonomous trains.\n\"The idea is to transform the rail industry \u2026 but we need $600m from the federal government to amplify what we're able to do at the local level,\" she said.\n\"The past few years \u2026 I don't think the government was positioned to take this on at the level that it needs to be addressed and invested in to propel our region's economy and all the economies of the nation,\" she added. \n\"It's clear that they're prioritizing infrastructure in a new way.\""

      "text": "Nature and wildlife in Wales is undergoing a \"mass extinction event\", environmental charities have said.\nAhead of next week's election, they have urged politicians to take action, with measures such as new, legally binding targets on biodiversity.\nA major study in 2019 suggested one in six species in Wales were at risk of extinction.\nCampaigners want the issue to be given the same priority as plans to fight climate change.\nThey have also called for a national nature service, offering jobs to people on wildlife restoration schemes, and for 30% of land and sea to be actively managed for nature by 2030.\nCharities believe they have widespread public support after a year in which people have reconnected with green spaces during Covid lockdowns. \nSIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nLast year the UK was one of 65 countries to sign a global pledge to reverse losses in the natural world by 2030, with a major UN conference on the issue set to take place in China in October. \nThe ramifications are huge because threatened ecosystems support us - from pollinating insects that enable us to grow food, to trees and plants that help prevent flooding while soaking up industrial emissions.\nRachel Sharp, chief executive of Wildlife Trusts Wales, said the next Welsh government needed to set out its plan \"with pace and urgency\".\n\"We're in the middle of a mass extinction event - it's really tragic that future generations won't get to experience the nature we see now,\" she warned.\n\"We've got the most amazing landscapes and seascapes and we're already seeing an increase in tourism because people are starting to understand and appreciate that. The new green economy, if we can get it right, can create new jobs, new careers.\"\nWALES ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat's happening? On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.  Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Senedd have? MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. \nAcknowledging the focus parties had put on green jobs during the election campaign, Ms Sharp said they often meant in areas such as waste management, energy generation or transport.\n\"Nature's getting left out of the picture,\" she said, arguing politicians risked playing \"one crisis off against the other\" if nature loss and climate change were not given parity.  \n\"Let's really tackle this nature crisis and actually show where Wales can be leading in the world.\"\nAt the National Botanic Gardens of Wales in Carmarthenshire, Rob Parry, chief executive of Initiative for Nature Conservation Cymru, is running a project to rear one of the UK's most critically endangered butterflies, the marsh fritillary.  \nThe group hopes to raise \u00a360,000 for the eight-year scheme, with the aim of releasing the butterflies on Llantrisant common in Rhondda Cynon Taf to try and secure a stable population in the area.  \nThe butterfly depends on a network of marshy grassland habitat, usually grazed by cattle, with a plentiful supply of the devil's-bit scabious plant - its favourite food.\nBut the loss of such habitats means its population has plummeted - with the small, glossy butterfly now only found at a handful of sites across Wales, meaning projects such as his \"with lots of different species\" will be needed in future, Mr Parry said.\n\"If we don't do something then species like the marsh fritillary and countless others will be lost from Wales - this is really the last measure that we've got.\"\nThe State of Nature 2019 report, compiled by more than 70 environmental organisations, found 666, or one in six, of the species studied were threatened with extinction in Wales, with 73 having already disappeared.\n\"The people of Wales have really spoken throughout the lockdowns and have become really connected to nature,\" Mr Parry said.\n\"So any government going forward really does need to listen to that and put projects like this and nature conservation in general at the forefront, because it's what people need right now.\"\nWales Environment Link - which represents environment and countryside organisations - said it also wanted more lessons on climate and nature in schools and for the NHS to offer green prescriptions - such as nature-based volunteering for anxiety and depression - when appropriate.\nNature Friendly Farming Network - which launches a report with its election asks of politicians on Thursday - suggested farmers were \"uniquely positioned to accelerate positive change at scale\" with the right government funding. \nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats said they would introduce \"legally binding nature recovery targets with regular milestones, backed up by monitoring and reporting\" as well as \"nature and marine recovery plans\".\nThe party also said it would make every town a \"tree town\" with a minimum of 20% tree cover in urban areas and 30% in all new developments.  \nTree cover on farms would also be supported by funding a hedges and edges scheme.\nPlaid Cymru said it would introduce a nature act to set a legal duty and targets to restore biodiversity on land and at sea.\nA spokeswoman said \"we will invest in protecting and developing an extensive network of wildlife sites\u2026 and will also close the environmental governance gap created by our departure from the EU, by establishing an independent environmental governance body for Wales\".\nNatural Resources Wales (NRW) and national parks funding would also \"reflect the key role they have to play in tackling our climate and biodiversity crisis\", she said.\nThe Welsh Conservatives said they would scrap environment watchdog NRW.\nA spokesman said the party would ensure the organisation's \"regulatory and commercial duties were carried out separately, so we can tackle issues such as nature loss and enhance biodiversity in a more effective and dynamic manner\".\nThe election provided the chance for \"change\", he said and \"the Conservatives will use this opportunity to improve environmental protection, regulation and maintenance in Wales.\"\nWelsh Labour said it would abolish more of the most commonly littered single use plastics and create a national forest for Wales.\nA new system of farm support payments to reward nature-friendly farming practices and upholding bans on fox-hunting and badger-culling are also pledged.\nA spokesman said the party's plans would \"build on Wales' world-beating recycling record with further action to support a circular economy, helping to reduce our global impact on biodiversity\"."

Cases rose by 17,000 on Wednesday - a state record. \nIn total, India reported 379,257 new infections on Thursday, the world's highest single-day total.\nThe country also reported 3,645 deaths from coronavirus - another unwanted record, in this case the highest number of fatalities in a single day since the start of the pandemic.\nWest Bengal has already seen seven phases of voting.  The state is one of the few where Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not have a majority of parliamentary seats.  \nThere has been a lot of criticism that he continued to hold large rallies there even as the virus began overwhelming the country.\nThe BBC's correspondent in the area, Amitabha Bhattasali, says some of the biggest rallies, including those attended by Mr Modi, saw throngs of people not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing.\nHospitals have been overwhelmed, oxygen is in critically low supply and crematoriums are operating non-stop.\nThe overall death toll officially surpassed 200,000 on Wednesday, though experts believe the actual number could be much higher. \nThe government had said that all adults will be eligible for Covid-19 vaccinations from 1 May, with online registration opening from 28 April.\nBut people on social media complained that they were not able to get slots because the website crashed soon after it opened.\nSo far, India has been vaccinating health workers, front line workers and adults over the age of 45.\nBut less than 10% of the population has received an initial jab and there are concerns about meeting demand.\nAlthough India is one of the world's biggest producers of vaccines, it does not yet have the stocks for the roughly 600 million people who will be eligible from 1 May.\nThe White House says the United States is redirecting its own order of AstraZeneca manufacturing supplies to India, allowing it to make more than 20 million doses of the vaccine.\nEpidemiologist Bhramar Mukherjee says India must combine the immunisation drive with a widespread lockdown to slow the spread of the virus.\nSeveral parts of the country are under lockdown and curfew, including in the capital Delhi.  \nThe government of Maharashtra, which is home to the financial capital Mumbai, is considering extending its lockdown until mid-May.\nThere is no lockdown or curfew in West Bengal state though.

      "tags": "Renewable Heat Incentive inquiry ,DUP (Democratic Unionist Party),Arlene Foster",
      "text": "Arlene Foster faced unprecedented challenges and monumental political changes during her tenure as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\nFrom Brexit to the Irish Sea border and of course the pandemic, it has been a tough few years for Northern Ireland's first minister, culminating in the revolt that has forced her to step down.\nHere BBC News NI charts her career.\nMrs Foster, a lawyer from County Fermanagh, held the DUP's top job for just over five years.\nShe became leader of the party in December 2015 and, the following month as leader of Stormont's largest party, she was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland.\nShe was the first woman and the youngest person to hold both jobs.\nWhen she took on the roles, she was viewed by many as a capable minister and a popular leader whose personal experiences shaped her passion for the unionist cause.\nBorn as Arlene Kelly in 1970, she grew up on a farm in rural County Fermanagh, close to the Irish border.\nThe Troubles played a significant role in her childhood - when she was eight years old, the IRA attempted to kill her father, a reserve police officer, outside her family home.\n\"My father came in on all fours crawling, with blood coming from his head,\" Mrs Foster told the Belfast Telegraph in 2015.\nMr Kelly survived the attack, but the family was forced to sell their farm and move away.\n\"I now know that this was a deliberate tactic of targeting vulnerable border Protestants to drive them from their homes,\" she wrote in the News Letter in January 2016 after taking Stormont's top job.\n\"I want to send a very direct message to the victims of the violence: I am one of you, I am on your side and I will not let you down.\"\nAs as teenager in 1988 the IRA set off a bomb on her school bus and the future first minister was caught up in the blast.\nThe target of the attack was the bus driver, who was also a part-time soldier in the Army's Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR).\nArlene Kelly was not hurt in the explosion, but a schoolgirl sitting next to her was seriously injured.\nWhen she left grammar school in Enniskillen, the future Mrs Foster became the first member of her family to go to university, studying law at Queen's University, Belfast. \nShe became politically active at university, joining the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and chairing Queen's Ulster Unionist Association.\nShe qualified as a solicitor and began working in private practice in Enniskillen and Portadown, County Armagh.\nOn 24 August 1995, aged 25, she married Brian Foster, and the couple went on to have three children. \nIn 2003, Mrs Foster was elected as a UUP assembly member (MLA) for her home constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone.\nBut she vehemently opposed David Trimble's leadership of the UUP and the following year she defected to Ian Paisley's DUP.\nWhen the DUP entered a power-sharing government with Sinn F\u00e9in in 2007, Mrs Foster was given her first government post - environment minister.\nShe then held posts as minister of enterprise, trade and investment and finance minister. \nWhen former DUP leader Peter Robinson stepped down as first minister in late 2015, Mrs Foster was elected unopposed as his successor.\nShe passed her first electoral test in May 2016, when the DUP consolidated its position as the largest party in Northern Ireland.\nThe following month, Mrs Foster and the DUP were on the winning side of the Brexit debate when the UK voted to leave the European Union.\nWithin a year of taking up her post as DUP leader, she was feeling the heat from a financial controversy at Stormont. \nThe Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme, which had been set up by Mrs Foster when she was economy minister in 2012, was in danger of a multi-million pound overspend.\nWhen she refused to step aside, saying she had done nothing wrong, the then Deputy First Minister Martin McGuiness resigned.\nThe nature of their joint office meant that when he quit, she lost her job too and a snap assembly election was triggered. \nThe collapse of Stormont's coalition government in January 2017 would lead to a three-year gap in devolution. \nDuring a bitter election campaign, Mrs Foster compared Sinn F\u00e9in to a \"crocodile\" that would keep coming back for more when she was asked about the party's demand for an Irish language act. \nIn the end, the DUP topped the poll and retained its place as Stormont's biggest party, but Sinn F\u00e9in narrowed the gap to a single seat.\nThe result also meant that for the first time, unionists did not hold an overall majority in the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nBut in June 2017, a snap general election produced a dramatic reversal of fortunes for Mrs Foster. \nPrime Minister Theresa May lost the Conservative's majority at Westminster, forcing her to seek the DUP's support to stay in power.\nMrs Foster and her DUP delegation negotiated more than \u00a31bn in extra public spending for Northern Ireland, in exchange for a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Tories.\nAs Mrs May tried to strike a Brexit deal with the EU however, the DUP threatened to pull the plug if it did not agree with the eventual arrangements. \nBut Mrs Foster argued there could not be an economic border in the Irish Sea, describing that as a \"blood-red line\" for the DUP.\nIn November 2018, her party placed its trust in the then backbench MP Boris Johnson who gave the keynote speech at the DUP's annual conference.\nMr Johnson received rapturous applause when he called for the proposed Irish border arrangements to be junked.\nSeveral months later, now in office as prime minister, Mr Johnson did the complete opposite and agreed to a trade border down the Irish Sea, in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.\nUnionists felt betrayed by Mr Johnson - but some pointed the finger at the DUP leadership for allowing its influence to be abused.\nMrs Foster later joked she had sent the prime minister \"to the naughty step\", with the DUP refusing to uphold its confidence-and-supply commitments with the government.\nBoris Johnson won a large majority in the December general election that year, and no longer needed DUP support. \nThe DUP meanwhile lost two of its 10 seats, with its deputy leader Nigel Dodds among the casualties.\nOut of influence at Westminster, the party was facing calls from an impatient public to return to power-sharing at Stormont.\nIn January 2020, devolution was restored with the New Decade, New Approach agreement and the DUP formed a new government with Sinn F\u00e9in and three smaller parties. \nMrs Foster resumed her role as first minister and said it was \"time for Stormont to move forward\".\nMrs Foster, along with Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, was tasked with leading the local response to the biggest global crisis since World War Two. \nThe first few months appeared to be marked by a new spirit of cross-party cooperation, as the pair frequently appeared together to appeal to the public to follow strict lockdown regulations. \nBut by June 2020, political relations were once again at breaking point.\nMrs O'Neill, along with other Sinn F\u00e9in politicians, was among about 2,000 mourners at the funeral of senior republican Bobby Storey.\nHaving ordered so many grieving families to forego the usual funeral customs to protect lives, images of the large cortege caused widespread anger.\nMrs Foster stopped appearing at joint coronavirus press conferences with Ms O'Neill - a stand-off that continued until a second wave of the virus took hold in the autumn. \nThe Covid crisis was still dominating the news agenda when the new Irish Sea border came into operation on 1 January 2021.\nUnionist anger over the Irish Sea border has grown and by April, it was cited among the reasons which contributed to a spate of riots. \nSome of Mrs Foster's critics in the DUP were also angered by her decision to abstain in a vote on banning gay conversion therapy in the Northern Ireland Assembly rather than opposing it with the majority of the party's MLAs. \nOn Tuesday, it emerged that more than 20 MLAs, four MPs and a peer had signed a letter calling for leadership contest.\nIt was clear that her tumultuous tenure as party leader - and NI First Minister - was coming to an end.\nIn her resignation statement, she urged young people to get involved in politics \"to shape Northern Ireland for the better\".\n\"My election as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party broke a glass ceiling and I am glad inspired other women to enter politics and spurred them on to take up elected office.\"\nMrs Foster added: \"I have sought to lead the party and Northern Ireland away from division and towards a better path.\n\"There are people in Northern Ireland with a British identity, others are Irish, others are Northern Irish, others are a mixture of all three and some are new and emerging. We must all learn to be generous to each other, live together and share this wonderful country.\n \"The future of unionism and Northern Ireland will not be found in division, it will only be found in sharing this place we all are privileged to call home.\"\nAs her party met in a Belfast hotel to ratify the election of her successor Edwin Poots as DUP leader, Mrs Foster shared her thoughts about the nature of her ousting with the BBC's Newscast programme.\n\"I think I said a couple of days after what had happened that politics is brutal, but even by DUP standards, it was pretty brutal,\" she said.\n\"I had absolutely no idea and was telephoned by a close colleague that this was happening on Monday evening and then by Tuesday morning, it was all in the papers, so it wasn't particularly pleasant.\"\nShe had originally indicated that she intended to stay on as first minister until the end of June, but Mr Poots was anxious to get his new ministerial team in place sooner.\nIn the end, it was agreed that Mrs Foster would stay on to host a British-Irish Council summit in her native County Fermanagh on 11 June.\nThis was her swansong as first minister - her last big political event on her home soil - and it also produced an actual song as Mrs Foster broke into a rendition of a Frank Sinatra classic.\n\"That's life, that's what all the people say. You're riding high in April, shot down in May,\" she sang at a press conference.\nHer pertinent choice of lyrics meant Mrs Foster bowed out to applause and laughter in Fermanagh.\nAt midday on Monday 14 June, the assembly member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone addressed the Northern Ireland Assembly for the final time as first minister. \nAn hour later, her resignation became official.\nOver the course of the last few weeks, Mrs Foster has often referred to the end of her \"local\" political career, so as leaves the stage in Belfast it is unlikely to be her final role in public life."

      "tags": "Companies,Travel,London Heathrow Airport,Air travel",
      "text": "The boss of Heathrow Airport has told the Home Office to \"get a grip\" on bottlenecks still causing long delays getting people through border control.\nJohn Holland-Kaye said he was not confident Border Force was ready to cope if travel restrictions are eased on 17 May.\nSome passengers have faced six-hour delays, but it's a \"completely fixable problem\", he told the BBC.\nThe Home Office said paperwork and health checks would mean more delays.\nBut Mr Holland-Kaye said that despite Heathrow seeing only 10% of normal traffic passing through the airport, Border Force still had the same staffing levels.\nLast month, there were reports of passengers at the UK's biggest airport having to wait seven hours to pass through immigration control, and three-hour waits were commonplace.\nOn Thursday, Mr Holland-Kaye told the BBC that six-hour queues were still \"not uncommon\". \n\"We have less than 10% of our normal passengers, but they [Border Force] have no fewer staff than they have before the crisis. So, this is entirely manageable by BF if only they man their desks properly.\"\nInternational travel restrictions are not due to be eased until 17 May at the earliest, but there are fears that border control delays could worsen when measures are relaxed.\n\"We have not seen quite enough action to ensure we are confident that Border Force can cope on 17 May,\" Mr Holland-Kaye said.\nThe Heathrow chief executive said the Home Office must \"get a grip on this to make sure that the Border Force does not become the choke on the UK economic recovery\".\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"We are in a global health pandemic, and people should not be travelling unless absolutely necessary. \n\"Queues and wait times will be longer if passengers have not completed the necessary requirements to enter the UK. Airlines are responsible for making sure that their passengers have completed all the necessary requirements, and airports have a crucial responsibility for ensuring travellers can social distance at passport control.\n\"Border Force is checking that every passenger has complied with current health measures when arriving at the border. Passengers should currently expect queues and wait times to be longer than normal.\"\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps, promised delays will ease once paperwork starts to be automated at border controls.\n\"As we move towards the unlock of international travel we will be addressing this issue, not least through beginning to automate the electronic e-gates with the pre-departure form,\" he told the House of Commons.\nOn Thursday, the airport revealed it had sunk a further \u00a3329m into the red in the first three months of the year, bringing total losses since the start of the pandemic to \u00a32.4bn.\nJust 1.7 million passengers travelled through the airport during the quarter, down 91% on the period in 2019.\nMr Holland-Kaye said the figures revealed the scale of the Covid hit.\nCargo volumes are also down 23% on 2019, underlining how a lack of flights affects UK trade with the rest of the world, he said.\nBut Mr Holland-Kaye hoped this was as bad as it gets now that lockdown restrictions are easing and economies are opening up.\n\"These results show how Covid has devastated the aviation sector and British trade,\" he said. \"Restarting international travel from May 17 will help to kick-start the economic recovery, allowing exporters to get their goods to market, as well as reuniting families who have been separated for over a year.\"\nHowever, he anticipated it would be a long time before travel returned to pre-pandemic levels because of uncertainty over government policy. \nDespite saying there was strong underlying demand for travel, the airport said it had cut its passenger forecast for the year to between 13 and 36 million. In 2019, 81 million people passed through Heathrow, which is owned by investors including Spain's Ferrovial, the Qatar Investment Authority, and China Investment Corp.\nMr Holland-Kaye said that cost-cutting to preserve cash had put the airport in a strong position to benefit from a recovery in air travel when it comes.\nThe aviation industry is hoping that process will start next month if travel restrictions are eased as planned. However, uncertainty remains about where people will be able to go, and how digital vaccine passports will work.\nMr Shapps has said he will chair a meeting of G7 transport ministers next week to discuss vaccine passports before announcing which countries would be open to Britons for travel in early May.\nThe pandemic has hit airlines across the world - with an estimated 50 companies gone out of business - as well as commercial plane-makers Airbus and Boeing.\nOn Thursday, Airbus posted a 2% fall in revenues to \u20ac10.4bn (\u00a39bn) for the first three months of 2021, although it expects deliveries of aircraft to customers to pick up during the year.\n\"The first quarter shows that the crisis is not yet over for our industry and that the market remains uncertain,\" said Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury."

      "text": "Flat owners should not have to pay for dangerous cladding to be removed from their buildings, Housing Secretary Michael Gove has said.\nHowever, under new government plans, anyone who has already paid for it to be replaced won't be refunded.\nIn a letter to developers in England and Wales, Mr Gove warned he would take \"all steps necessary\" to make firms pay for the removal of unsafe cladding from lower-height buildings. These are between 11m and 18m high (roughly four to six storeys).\nSteps could include:\nHowever, the plans only apply to flat owners who haven't yet paid to have cladding removed. Anyone who has already paid won't have their money refunded, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities said.\nThe time limit for leaseholders to sue builders over defective flats will also be extended from six to 30 years.\nIn a previous announcement, the government promised to remove unsafe cladding from the highest-risk buildings only - those over 18m high. This would be partly funded by a levy on the biggest developers.\nCampaigners, however, said many people living in buildings under 18m would be \"saddled with debt\" under the scheme. It's estimated that the average cladding bill is around \u00a340,000 per leaseholder.\nCladding is the process of adding a new layer of material to the outside of a building. \nIt may be installed to increase insulation or weather protection, or to improve the building's appearance.\nBut some cladding has been found to be combustible, prompting a building safety crisis affecting thousands of homeowners.\nThe cost of making a block of flats safe is supposed to be absorbed by the owners of the whole building and the land (also known as the freeholder). \nBut in practice the cost is often passed on to the owners of individual flats (the leaseholders).\nThese leaseholders have to pay for extra fire safety measures - sometimes including patrol officers - until cladding or insulation is stripped off. \nThe cost can run into tens of thousands of pounds.\nIt can also be difficult for flat-owners to sell their property - even if the cladding is classed as low risk - because some lenders are refusing to offer mortgages on them.\nIn June 2017, a fire broke out in the Grenfell Tower block in west London, killing 72 people.\nThe first phase of an inquiry said cladding installed during refurbishment helped the fire spread because it was made from combustible material.\nSafety inspections on other high-rise blocks revealed not just dangerous cladding, but other fire safety faults including defective insulation, flammable balconies and missing fire breaks.\nAs well as concerns about cladding costs, campaigners say thousands of leaseholders also face large bills to pay for other safety measures not covered by the scheme. \nThis includes fire breaks, new balconies, safety doors and sprinkler systems.\nMr Gove said it was his intention to offer support for these costs.\nThere isn't a single number on this. \nThe government says that as of 30 November, 407 buildings had cladding removed with a further 70 still with cladding (although work has already started on 41 of these).\nBut these figures only cover buildings that are over 18m tall, with the type of cladding used on Grenfell Tower.\nThe government does not supply regular statistics on other types of building. \nAbout half a million people are living in a building with some form of unsafe cladding, the Association of Residential Managing Agents says."

The High Court has today agreed with our interpretation of the law. \n\"We are committed to protecting the rights of air passengers and are determined to ensure all airlines comply with their legal obligations.\"\nRyanair does, however, have the right to seek to appeal against the judgment.\nThe CAA advised that affected customers should wait for further information before pursuing their claims.\nRyanair declined to comment.\nRyanair recently warned it was in the midst of \"the most challenging year\" in its 35-year history as a result of travel restrictions imposed amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn February, it said it expected annual losses of up to \u20ac1bn (\u00a3870m) for the year to March 2021, although it expects travel restrictions to be dropped once high risk groups are vaccinated, unleashing \"pent-up demand\".\nA recent survey by consumer group Which? found that Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic were rated the worst of the UK's major airlines for fare refunds.\nBoth airlines were given a customer \"satisfaction score\" of just 13% when respondents were asked to rate the customer service they received when applying for a refund from their airline.\nOne-third of respondents who had a flight cancelled by either Ryanair or Virgin Atlantic said they had waited more than three months for their refund.

      "text": "A man has been sentenced after blinding a motorcyclist in one eye by throwing an egg at him from a car.\nMarc Toone, 33, was hit by the missile while travelling home from work in Wigston, Leicestershire in January 2020.\nHe was taken to hospital but doctors were unable to save his right eye.\nThomas Connor, 18, was given a 12-month training and detention order after pleading guilty to multiple offences at Leicester Magistrates' Court.\nLeicestershire Police said Connors was driving a car that was linked to several reports of egg throwing on the day Mr Toone was injured.\nPeople and vehicles in the Market Harborough area were hit but no other serious injuries were reported, the force said.\nMr Toone was riding home on his motorcycle when he was hit in the face in Newton Lane.\nHe had lifted up the visor on his helmet as the cold weather had made it steam up.\nHe spent a week in hospital and underwent two operations but the sight in his right eye could not be saved.\n\"I have got used to what has happened but every day I get up and I look in the mirror and it is there,\" he said.\n\"It's a permanent reminder of what has happened and something I have to see every day.\"\nHe has returned to work as a chef but says his loss of sight had made once simple tasks much more challenging.\nHe has also struggled to sleep due to panic attacks and flashbacks.\nLeicestershire Police said a month earlier, Connors had also thrown eggs at a woman walking her dog in Whetstone, leaving her with facial swelling and eye pain.\nOn Monday, Connors, of Mere Lane, Lutterworth, admitted unlawfully inflicting grievous bodily harm, assault occasioning actual bodily harm along with a number of other offences related to driving and causing damage.\nAlong with his detention he was also ordered to pay \u00a3500 in compensation and disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for 12 months.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Boris Johnson,Matthew Hancock",
      "text": "\"Baffling\" - that is one cabinet source's verdict on how No 10 is handling the allegations about the renovations of the Downing Street flat. \nMatt Hancock repeatedly wouldn't engage in questions on the matter at Wednesday's press conference.  \nAnd Boris Johnson wouldn't answer the central question in the Commons earlier during a session of Prime Minister's Questions, where he looked more red-faced and furious than I can recall. \nThe question is a simple one: Who paid the bill for the Downing Street flat makeover at the start? \nAnd for as long as the PM won't answer that, the question will be asked again, and again, and again.\nThat's not because there's a fascination over whether he and fianc\u00e9e Carrie Symonds have chosen rattan bedside tables or Persian rugs. \nNor is what matters why they felt it necessary to overhaul the flat, which was - when we visited briefly to film with Theresa May - extremely comfortable and pretty immaculate.  \nBut it matters because there are strict rules about who can give money to politicians, and strict rules that dictate they are meant to tell the rest of us. \nWhether you are interested in this particular saga or not, that is a central principle of how politics is meant to work.\nAnd that's why some of Boris Johnson's staff at the time, not just Dominic Cummings, who has gone nuclear about the issue in public, were uneasy with what was going on.\nI've been told that there were conversations and concerns about the situation as long ago as February 2020. \nThe overall chain of events is complicated, and you can remind yourself of what it the story is all about here. \nThe prime minister said on the record earlier that no rules had been broken. \nYet there are enough question marks for an independent organisation with legal powers to have concluded it is worth a formal investigation. \nAnd the clearest question is, who picked up the tab at the start? \nIf the PM wants to remove the doubts about what happened, he could publish the information, confront the consequences and then move on. \nBut, for as long as he won't, his opponents can claim that he has something to hide.

      "tags": "United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Half a century after he entered Congress as a senator, Joe Biden returned to deliver his first address as the 46th US President. Here are the key moments.\nFor the first time in US history, the two people seated behind the president as he delivered his address were women.\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, and Vice-President Kamala Harris, who served as a California senator before Mr Biden made her his running mate, flanked the president throughout the speech, looking over Mr Biden's shoulders.\nAs he greeted the two as \"Madam Vice-President, Madam Speaker,\" Mr Biden added: \"No president has ever said those words from this podium - no president has ever said those words, and it's about time!\"\nMr Biden began his address to Congress with a not-so-subtle dig at his predecessor, Donald Trump.\nMr Biden said he \"inherited a nation in crisis\" - describing America as a \"house on fire\".\n\"Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again,\" he said, adding that America never stays down.\n\"America is rising anew. Choosing hope over fear. Truth over lies. Light over darkness. After 100 days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for take off. We are working again. Dreaming again. Discovering again. Leading the world again.\"\nRacial tensions have been at new highs in the past year following the May 2020 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. \nMr Biden referred in his address to Mr Floyd's murder at the hands of an officer, saying: \"We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America.\"\n\"We won't ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined - the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white supremacist terrorism.\"\nThe president did defend police, too, garnering applause, saying that \"most men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their communities honourably\".\nBut he said work must be done \"to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve, to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system\".\nMuch of Mr Biden's speech focused on selling his big-budget plans for overhauling US infrastructure and social programmes - all of which would rely on hiking taxes on the rich. The president insisted on Wednesday night that this was fair play.\n\"It's time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1% of Americans to pay their fair share. Just pay their fair share,\" he said.\nA lot of companies evade taxes through tax havens from Switzerland to Bermuda to the Cayman Islands, and they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions that allow for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. That's not right.\"\nMr Biden emphasised his proposed tax reforms would help \"reward work, not wealth\" and affect \"three tenths of 1% of all Americans\".\nThe government would also \"crack down\" on the millionaires and billionaires who cheat on taxes.\n\"Look, I'm not out to punish anyone - but I will not add to the tax burden of the middle class of this country,\" Mr Biden said.\n\"What I've proposed is fair.\"\nMr Biden closed the evening by recalling the events of 6 January when Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, and asked lawmakers to prove democracy can rise above such actions.\nAt the start of his speech, he called this riot \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War\".\n\"Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart? America's adversaries - the autocrats of the world - are betting it can't,\" he said.\n\"They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assaulted this Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy.\n\"They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong. We have to prove democracy still works.\""

      "title": "Downing Street refurbishment: What is the row about?",
      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Boris Johnson",
      "text": "Further questions have been asked about the funding of home improvements at the prime minister's Downing Street flat, following the release of an exchange of letters with his standards adviser.\nLord Geidt complained about not having been shown WhatsApp messages between Boris Johnson and Tory donor Lord Brownlow, which talked about the refurbishment.\nBoris Johnson and Carrie Symonds had work carried out on their private residence, the flat above 11 Downing Street.\nThe prime minister receives an annual public grant of \u00a330,000 to spend on his living quarters. But the work cost considerably more than that - at least \u00a3112,000 based on the amount we know Lord Brownlow contributed.\nThe work was initially paid for by the Cabinet Office, but \u00a352,000 was given to the Conservative Party by Lord Brownlow to cover the bills. Mr Johnson says he has now covered all the costs out of his own pocket.\nThe Conservative Party was fined \u00a317,800 after the Electoral Commission found it had failed to accurately declare all of Lord Brownlow's donations towards the renovation.\nLord Brownlow was asked in May 2020 to set up a Downing Street trust that would fund renovations to the flat above 11 Downing Street, but that trust was never established.\nIn November 2020, the prime minister approached Lord Brownlow by WhatsApp message to approve payments to the interior designer carrying out the work. \nThe Electoral Commission found in December 2021 that the subsequent \u00a352,000 payment from Huntswood Associates Ltd, whose director is Lord Brownlow, had not been properly recorded and that it should not have been described as a loan or as part of a trust.\nBut it said that separate payments of almost \u00a360,000 for the refurbishments made by Lord Brownlow directly to suppliers, did not need to be declared.\nThe Electoral Commission report led to further controversy because it referred to an exchange of WhatsApp messages between the prime minister and Lord Brownlow, which had not been seen by the adviser on standards, Lord Geidt, when he had reported on the case earlier in the year.\nLord Geidt's report in May had concluded that Mr Johnson did not break the ministerial code over the funding of the renovations.\nBut he said: \"The prime minister - unwisely, in my view - allowed the refurbishment of the apartment at No 11 Downing Street to proceed without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded.\"\nLord Geidt added: \"The record shows no evidence that the prime minister had been informed\" about the payments. His report says that when he found out in February 2021, Mr Johnson \"settled the full amount himself\". \nBut when Lord Geidt found out about the messages to Lord Brownlow, he wrote to the prime minister saying that while his overall conclusions about the ministerial code were unchanged, had he seen the messages, \"I doubt whether I would have concluded, without qualification... that 'at the point when the prime minister became aware, he took steps to make the relevant declaration and to seek advice'.\"\nMr Johnson replied, offering a \"humble and sincere apology\" for not giving him the messages, blaming security issues which had forced him to change his phone.   \nIf a politician accepts money from a donor - either as a gift or as a loan - they are expected to make that information public, normally within 28 days.\nThe concern is that if a financial gift is kept secret, it might be used to gain favours or political influence.\nThis is the exchange of messages between Mr Johnson and Lord Brownlow:\nAt the end of his message, Mr Johnson refers to the \"great exhibition plan\", which was a proposal for a cultural festival, which Lord Brownlow was involved with as a trustee of London's Albert Hall.\nLord Brownlow met Oliver Dowden, who was then culture secretary, to discuss the event six weeks after the text exchange with the prime minister, according to the meeting log. In the end, the exhibition did not happen, but Labour says Lord Brownlow's November 2020 text exchanges with the PM are still important.\n\"Lord Brownlow appears to have access to the prime minister because he was paying for the flat renovations. If that is the case, that is corruption,\" the party said.\nThe BBC has approached Lord Brownlow for comment but he has not yet responded.\nBusiness Minister Paul Scully denied that the prime minister was linking support for a Great Exhibition with financial support for flat renovations in his messages.\nHe said the Great Exhibition plan was passed to \"the right channels\" at the culture department and that Mr Johnson \"had no idea\" who would be paying for the flat refurbishments, believing the funding would come through a blind trust.\nLike several of his recent predecessors, Mr Johnson and Ms Symonds are living at No 11 because the four-bedroom flat there is much larger than the one above No 10.\nTony Blair was the first prime minister to live at No 11 - he and his wife Cherie turned the space into a family home. \nThe Grade 1-listed flat was then extensively refurbished by David and Samantha Cameron in 2011 at a cost of \u00a330,000.\nThe latest upgrade for the flat was carried out by interior designer Lulu Lytle. \nMr Johnson and his wife wanted to transform the flat from previous Prime Minister Theresa May's \"John Lewis furniture nightmare\" into a \"high society haven\", according to the society magazine Tatler."

      "text": "Three cars have been destroyed in an arson attack at the home of a police officer in Larne, County Antrim.\nThe cars were parked on the driveway of the property on the Glenarm Road and were set on fire at about 01:45 BST on Thursday.\nThe officer, his wife and their daughter were in the house at the time but were not injured.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) is investigating a motive for the attack.\nA line of inquiry will be the possible involvement of the South-East Antrim Ulster Defence Association (UDA), a loyalist paramilitary gang.\nThe organisation was behind recent rioting in Newtownabbey, County Antrim.\nAt the time, the police believed it was linked to a crackdown on its criminal activities.\nBut it is not yet clear what the motive was for the arson attack at the officer's home.\nPSNI Det Ch Insp Dunny McCubbin said it was a \"completely reckless attack\".\n\"Thankfully no injuries have been reported in what was a terrifying ordeal for the officer and his family,\" he said.\n\"There are no words to describe those who would set fire to vehicles in the dark of night outside a family home when the occupants were asleep inside.\n\"Their actions stand in stark contrast to the officer who everyday serves our community with dignity, respect and courtesy.\"\nMr McCubbin said detectives were \"keeping an open mind\" about the motivation for the attack, adding: \"A primary line of enquiry is that criminal elements may be responsible\".\nPSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne said the attack was outrageous.\nJustice Minister Naomi Long said it was an \"appalling and cowardly attack on a PSNI officer at their home, where they should be safe\".\n\"I don't underestimate the distress that is caused by an incident of this nature at a family home,\" she said.\n\"Our police officers put their lives on the line on a daily basis to keep us all safe. My thoughts are with this officer, their family and colleagues.\"\nThe Police Federation for Northern Ireland (PFNI), which represents rank and file officers, said the attack was a \"vile act of attempted intimidation\".\n\"This was thuggery and an attempt to intimidate an off-duty officer...an act of terror, an act of madness,\" said PFNI chair Mark Lindsay.\nThe chair of the Policing Board, Doug Garrett, described the attack as \"reprehensible\" and said it could have had \"deadly consequences\".\n\"To be awoken to find this destruction in the middle of the night must have been terrifying for the whole family,\" he added.\nDUP MLA and Policing Board member Mervyn Storey said there can be \"no justification or excuse for such an attack\".\n\"Unfortunately we see all too often the threat to which our police officers are exposed to and the callous disregard for both life and property that some within our society display,\" he said.\nSinn F\u00e9in assembly member Philip McGuigan also offered condemnation and said those responsible for attacks on the PSNI had \"nothing to offer society\".\nHe said that in recent months there had been \"increasingly violent rhetoric targeting the PSNI and police officers with sinister posters and graffiti appearing in loyalist areas\".\nSDLP MLA and Policing Board member Dolores Kelly described those responsible for the attack as \"criminal thugs\" and said the officer's family had been put through a \"horrendous ordeal\".\n\"Those who have involved themselves in extortion, racketeering and criminality are a poison on the lives of us all and it should be our mission to flush them out,\" she added.\nJohn Stewart, an East Antrim UUP MLA, said it was a \"particularly sinister incident\" and he hoped the perpetrators would be put \"behind bars for a very long time\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "An extra 60 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine have been ordered by the UK government as it puts together plans for a vaccination booster programme in the autumn.\nIt brings the total number of Pfizer doses ordered by the UK to 100 million. \nThe expectation is that the most vulnerable groups will be offered another jab before next winter.\nNearly two-thirds of UK adults have received one dose of a Covid vaccine with a quarter having had two.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street briefing the booster programme would \"keep us safe and free here while we get this disease under control across the world\". \nThe government said the additional Pfizer jabs will be used alongside other Covid vaccines for the booster programme.\nIt is one of three jabs authorised for use in the UK, alongside the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and one made by the US firm Moderna.\nThe announcement comes as new data from Public Health England showed that one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine reduces household transmission of the virus by up to half.\nMr Hancock said this was the \"first concrete evidence\" of how vaccines reduced the transmission of the virus. \nA further 29 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test in the UK, according to the latest government figures, taking the total by that measure to 127,480.\nA further 2,166 lab-confirmed cases were reported on Wednesday.\nThese extra supplies are not about speeding up rollout now - they are an insurance policy ahead of next winter to ensure the UK has enough supplies to offer people a booster jab.\nBut there is still much to be resolved about such a programme. \nWho will get it, whether it will be given at the same time as the flu jab and how many doses will be needed has still to be decided.\nBut perhaps the biggest question of all is whether the current vaccines will need to be tweaked to tackle the new variants.\nThese extra Pfizer doses will be the same as the current jab that is being rolled out - although if a new version of the jab is made the UK could get that.\nThe deal done for one of the other vaccines on order - CureVac - is specifically aimed at new variants. \nBut even that may not be needed. Despite all the focus on new variants, there are still plenty of reasons to think the current vaccines will offer good protection.\nIt is why any booster programme is only likely to be aimed at the most vulnerable.\nMr Hancock said the vaccination programme was \"bringing back our freedom\", but warned the biggest risk to that progress was the \"risk posed by a new variant\". \nHe said the UK had been working on plans for a booster programme for more than a year.\nOverall, the UK has secured access to 517 million doses of eight different vaccines. \nIncluding first and second doses, more than 47.5 million vaccinations have been given since the start of December. \nThe overwhelming majority are Pfizer or AstraZeneca, as the Moderna jab has only recently begun to be used.\nThe UK regulator is currently assessing both the Janssen and Novavax vaccines, which have gone through successful clinical trials. Trials are ongoing for the Valneva, GSK-Sanofi and CureVac jabs.\nMr Hancock said the \"harrowing pictures\" of the coronavirus situation in India were \"a stark reminder that this isn't over yet\" but said the UK was sending packages of support, in the form of ventilators and oxygen concentrators.\nThe health secretary said \"we don't have any excess doses of vaccine in the UK at the moment\" but said the country stood \"side-by-side\" with India.\nHe said the additional Pfizer jabs were a forward order and had not been manufactured yet, but added the UK had worked closely with India to ensure it got the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab at cost.\nProf Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, told the briefing the UK was close to the \"bottom level\" of coronavirus.\n\"We are really in very low levels that are comparable to where we were in September last year,\" he said.\nMr Hancock added that, while officials would continue to monitor the data, England remained \"on track for step three\" of the government's roadmap for exiting lockdown on 17 May.\nBut Prof Van-Tam said while vaccines could reduce a third wave of coronavirus, it was \"inconceivable\" that there will not be further bumps in the road.\n\"The modelling consensus is clear, we will have what's called a third wave,\" he said, but he added he was hopeful it \"might just be a third upsurge and much less significant\" due to the vaccine rollout.\nDr Nikki Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, told the Downing Street briefing the \"momentum\" of the vaccine programme was continuing as people aged 42 and over in England have been invited to book their jab.\nMr Hancock, who is 42, said he was \"delighted\" he would be receiving his first vaccine on Thursday and encouraged others to book theirs.\nThe government has set a target of offering a first shot to all adults in the UK by the end of July.\nVaccine invitations in Scotland have opened to over-45s and unpaid carers aged 16 to 64 can also register for a jab.\nThe Welsh government says people aged 40 and over are being offered vaccines while in Northern Ireland people aged 35 and over are now eligible."

      "tags": "Jair Bolsonaro,Brazil,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of deaths related to Covid-19 has passed 400,000 in Brazil, the second-highest in the world, as the country continues to struggle with its vaccination programme.\nThere were 3,001 deaths in 24 hours, after a peak of more than 4,000 was reached at the start of April.\nThe 14-day average of deaths and cases remains high but has seen a slight fall.\nCongress has opened an inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic.\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro, who has frequently spoken out against lockdowns, masks and defended unproved drugs as treatment, is facing widespread criticism and his support has plummeted.\nThe outbreak has been fuelled by more transmissible variants of the virus and a lack of co-ordinated national measures. The situation has improved in many areas, including where the health system was on the brink of collapse, after states and cities imposed restrictions, but they are already being eased.\nThe rate of occupancy of intensive care unit beds remains at or above 90% in more than a third of the states, according to the health institute Fiocruz, which said the scenario remained \"critical\".\n\"[There's] a tendency of a slight fall but not yet of containment of the epidemic,\" the institute said in a report (in Portuguese), warning that the daily number of deaths is likely to remain high.\nBrazil recorded 100,000 deaths in just 37 days, between March and April, which were the worst months in the country. Only the US has a higher death toll.\nSince the start of the pandemic, Brazil has had more than 14.5 million cases.\nMeanwhile, some cities have had to temporarily halt their vaccination programmes amid a shortage of doses. About 13% of the population of 212 million has received at least one dose, according to the Our World in Data tracker.\nBy Mark Lowen, BBC News, S\u00e3o Paulo\nIt is a horrific toll that Brazil may not have reached if vaccines had been bought more quickly and lockdowns imposed. But President Bolsonaro has been reluctant to act - and Brazil is now mourning more than 400,000 dead. \nOnly around 13% of Brazilians have received one vaccine dose and 6% both shots: slow procurement is one of the issues a senate inquiry will now examine, since the government turned down offers of tens of millions of shots from Pfizer last year. The parliamentary commission could recommend the president's impeachment or even criminal charges.\nMr Bolsonaro has been bullish as ever, threatening to send in the army to stop states locking down. And his supporters claim the government could not have purchased vaccine doses sooner, since it was waiting for approval from Brazil's health regulator.\nThe pandemic has fed Brazil's deep political polarisation. Mr Bolsonaro is playing to his conservative support base - but polls show it is shrinking as Brazil continues to count its dead.\nOn Tuesday, a Senate commission started an official inquiry into the Bolsonaro government's response to Covid-19. They have the power to demand documents and call on witnesses to testify, and the findings can be submitted to authorities with the ability to prosecute.\nThe commission will investigate a number of actions, including slow vaccine procurement by the president, his repeated statements downplaying the severity of the virus, and the promotion of scientifically unproven drugs such as hydroxychloroquine.\nIt will also analyse whether the government was negligent in the oxygen crisis in Amazonas state, which was ravaged by a more infectious variant earlier this year, and if indigenous communities in the Amazon were left without assistance, in what critics have described as possible genocide.\nThe inquiry could add to calls for impeachment of the president, though analysts say that is unlikely to happen. But the proceedings and possible revelations can cause serious damage to President Bolsonaro, who is almost certain to run for re-election next year, when his main rival could be former leftist President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\nPresident Bolsonaro said he was \"not worried\" by the inquiry. Since the start of the pandemic, he has opposed any lockdown measures arguing that the damage to the economy would be worse than the effects of the virus itself, a position shared by many of his supporters.\nIn a separate development, the Russian developer of the Sputnik V vaccine has said it will sue Brazil's health regulator Anvisa for defamation in a row over the product.\nAnvisa has denied state requests to approve the vaccine for import, and raised concerns about the make up of Sputnik V. At a press conference on Thursday, officials from the regulator condemned the Russian developer's \"grave accusation\". "

      "tags": "Housing,Grenfell Tower fire,UK fire safety",
      "text": "New laws that could leave flat owners facing bills for fire safety measures are \"indefensible\", say Grenfell Tower survivors and bereaved relatives. \nThe Fire Safety Act is aimed at making homes safer following the 2017 blaze, in which 72 people died.\nBut a push to include more financial protections for leaseholders was defeated in a Parliamentary vote, despite a large Tory rebellion.\nThe government has made a \u00a35bn fund available to remove cladding.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said the government was paying for remedial work to \"thousands of buildings around the country\".\nShe said the act would \"actually help to save lives by changing some of these awful regulations and guidelines that existed previously\".\nAfter the Grenfell tragedy, thousands of blocks of flats were found to be covered in similar cladding. \nOther defects were also discovered, leaving leaseholders facing large bills to pay for protective measures such as fire breaks, balconies, safer doors and sprinkler systems.\nMinisters say a loan scheme will ensure costs are capped at \u00a350 a month for safety works and that residents in the tallest tower blocks in England will not have to pay to have cladding removed. \nLeaseholders have described being trapped in homes they cannot sell, with their lives on hold potentially for years, because lenders will not offer mortgages until the cladding is removed.\nReports of the toll on residents' mental health have been widespread. \nCampaigners say leaseholders should be protected from all remediation costs that have arisen through no fault of their own. \nCritics, including some Conservative MPs, had argued the government should meet all the costs upfront and then recoup them from property developers. \nThe Grenfell United group, which was set up after the tragedy in west London, said it was \"deeply disappointed that ministers have broken their promises to leaseholders who have done absolutely nothing wrong\". \nIt described the government's position as \"indefensible\", saying it was a \"grave injustice that many innocent leaseholders will be financially ruined over fire safety issues that were not of their own making\", and it accused ministers of \"letting those responsible continue to get off scot-free\". \nLawyer Steph Pike, a leaseholder of a one-bedroom flat in Bristol, said she could be facing a \u00a370,000 bill next year to cover the cost of improvement work to her building. \nShe told the BBC the situation was \"completely unbelievable\" and said some days she asked herself: \"Is this even happening?\"\n\"I'm a lawyer, so I've got a professional qualification that I need to protect and if I have to declare myself bankrupt I'll lose that, so I'll also lose my career.\" \nLeaseholder Rachael Teebay bought her first home together with her partner in Manchester, but now she is among thousands facing huge bills.\n\"I have spent days and weeks crying about it and worrying about our future,\" she told the BBC. \n\"Declaring bankruptcy at this age, what does that do for our future? It decimates it. It's terrifying.\" \nStephen Squires, a leaseholder who lives in a tower block in Manchester bearing dangerous cladding, said ministers' reluctance to compromise was \"hugely disappointing and really makes us feel like the government do not grasp the severity of the situation we all find ourselves in through no fault of our own\".\nHe added: \"Our service charge account is running out of money, whilst the freeholder delays things. Eventually we could end up with having the lifts switched off or the electric being cut off to a 20-storey building, which would make it uninhabitable.\"\nThe campaigning group End Our Cladding Scandal said the legislation had passed unchanged, \"much to the horror of hundreds of thousands of innocent people across the country whose lives are being ruined by the buildings safety crisis\". \nIt said the government had \"fought hard\" against changes that would have saved leaseholders from \"widespread bankruptcy and financial ruin caused by bad regulations, corporate malfeasance and shoddy building work\". \n\"This [act] pulls the rug out from under a generation of homeowners\" whose lives were still at risk from unsafe buildings, it added.\nThe group has vowed to continue opposing the reforms, tweeting: \"We have the right to be angry. But the fight isn't over yet.\"\nThe new legislation modifies a previous law to clarify that building owners must manage and reduce the risk of fire in their properties.\nThe government was under pressure to get it passed before the end of the parliamentary session on Thursday.\nIt said it struck \"the right balance in protecting leaseholders and being fair to taxpayers\". \nA Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said ministers were prioritising making the tallest buildings with the most dangerous cladding safer, backed by \u00a35bn in funding.\n\"We have been clear throughout that owners and industry should make buildings safe without passing on costs to leaseholders - and we will ensure they pay for the mistakes of the past with a new levy and tax to contribute to the costs of remediation,\" they added.\n\"For lower-rise buildings which have a lower risk, our generous capped finance scheme will ensure bills are a maximum of \u00a350 per month.\""

      "text": "The Fishmongers' Hall attacker duped a prison boss over why he was wearing a bulky coat, an inquest jury heard.\nConvicted terrorist Usman Khan had a brief conversation with HMP Whitemoor's counter-terrorism head Steve Machin at a prisoner education event in central London on 29 November 2019.\nKhan said he was wearing the large coat - which concealed a fake suicide belt - because of the weather.\nHe later killed Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones before being shot dead by police.\nInquest jurors at London's Guildhall heard in the days before Khan's deadly attack the 28-year-old had bought items including the black coat he wore to the conference.\nNick Armstrong, representing the family of Mr Merritt, 25, who was a guest at the event, asked: \"Why don't you pick up the fact he's wearing the coat?\"\nMr Machin replied: \"He provided a backstory and it sort of made sense. I could see below the coat was a base layer.\n\"He said when he checked the weather he was expecting a cold day. He said: 'I don't want this being my outer top.'\"\nMr Armstrong suggested Mr Machin had dropped his guard, despite being faced with warning signs about Khan's appearance.\nMr Machin said: \"I'm not in the same headspace as when I'm at work - I wasn't there as a counter-terrorism governor, I was there as operational manager of HMP Whitemoor.\"\nGeorgina Butler, head of learning and skills at Whitemoor, was sitting with Mr Machin, Khan and Ms Jones in Fishmongers' Hall.\nJurors heard she had asked after Khan's family and found him \"fairly chatty\".\nShe said: \"I remember seeing Usman in a puffer jacket and thinking it a bit peculiar.\n\"Obviously a lot more comes to light when you reflect afterwards. I remember seeing a base layer top. I remember thinking he wore the wrong clothes, it looked too tight.\"\nThe inquest jury previously saw images of Khan wearing the coat at the Learning Together event.\nHe took it off once, but wrapped it around his waist to conceal the fake suicide belt, the court heard.\nKhan stabbed and killed Mr Merritt and Ms Jones, 23, and injured three other people, before being chased and disarmed on London Bridge by three men armed with a fire extinguisher and a narwhal tusk.\nHe was then killed by police.\nThe inquest hearing continues."

      "text": "Children's charity the NSPCC says calls and messages to its helpline have risen to record levels during the pandemic. \nIn the year to March 2021 the helpline was contacted almost 85,000 times, up 23% on the previous year.\nThe figures amplify fears that children who could not go to school during the lockdowns were more vulnerable to abuse and neglect, says the NSPCC. \nChief executive Sir Peter Wanless says government recovery plans must address the harm children may have faced. \n\"We've been hearing first-hand about the immense pressures families have faced during the pandemic and the heavy toll that has taken on children and young people. \n\"For some children this has included experiencing abuse, bereavement and other harm,\" said Sir Peter. \nHe wants governments across the UK to put children at the heart of their recovery plans. \n\"These must go beyond education, and address the harm some have experienced, so the pandemic doesn't leave a legacy of trauma for children,\" he argues. \nOf the 85,000 contacts to the helpline, the NSPCC says almost half, 47%, led to a referral - for example to police or children's services. \nThe most frequently raised concern was about adult or parental behaviour, including: \nOther issues raised included neglect, physical abuse and emotional abuse. \nSisters \"Chloe\" and \"Debra\" - who asked not to use their real names - called the helpline after finding a young boy crying on the kerb outside their home. \nHe was scared of his mum, saying \"that she hits him and he'd been suicidal over it\", said Debra. \n\"He kept bursting into tears and explained he'd run away because he'd broken his TV and was worried about what his mum would do.\"\nDebra says they were aware the lockdown was affecting young people's mental health, and that being stuck at home in abusive circumstances was making things worse.\n\"Seeing how upset he was, I knew I was doing the right thing,\" Debra says. \nThe NSPCC says that with most children now back in schools, the harm and trauma faced by some children in the pandemic will become increasingly visible. \nThe charity wants governments across the UK to focus on prevention and better protection for children. \nThis includes more money for health visitors and children's social care, better mental health support in schools and imposing a duty of care on tech firms to protect children from harm online.\nThe Scottish government says policies could change depending on the result of next week's election but, together with local authorities, it has developed a \"vision and blueprint for holistic family support\" in the wake of the pandemic, particularly for those in the most challenging circumstances.  \nElections in Wales next week mean policies could likewise change, but a government spokesperson said: \"Our national action plan sets out clear actions to prevent child sexual abuse, to protect children at risk and to support abused children.\"\nIn Northern Ireland, the Department of Health says recovery plans \"will take account of the rising number of children about whom there are concerns, the impact of the pandemic on them and seek to ensure that their needs are met\".\nEngland's Department for Education says extra government funding for the NSPCC's helpline helped boost awareness during the lockdown. \n\"The pandemic has exacerbated some of the challenges vulnerable children and young people already face during their lives,\" an official said. \n\"That is why we kept nurseries, schools and colleges open for children with a social worker and have invested millions in the front-line charities supporting them.\"\nA \u00a31.7bn funding boost for schools \"can be used to support pupils' mental health and well-being, to help put them back on track\", the official added.

      "tags": "Companies,Travel,London Heathrow Airport,Air travel",
      "text": "The boss of Heathrow Airport has told the Home Office to \"get a grip\" on bottlenecks still causing long delays getting people through border control.\nJohn Holland-Kaye said he was not confident Border Force was ready to cope if travel restrictions are eased on 17 May.\nSome passengers have faced six-hour delays, but it's a \"completely fixable problem\", he told the BBC.\nThe Home Office said paperwork and health checks would mean more delays.\nBut Mr Holland-Kaye said that despite Heathrow seeing only 10% of normal traffic passing through the airport, Border Force still had the same staffing levels.\nLast month, there were reports of passengers at the UK's biggest airport having to wait seven hours to pass through immigration control, and three-hour waits were commonplace.\nOn Thursday, Mr Holland-Kaye told the BBC that six-hour queues were still \"not uncommon\". \n\"We have less than 10% of our normal passengers, but they [Border Force] have no fewer staff than they have before the crisis. So, this is entirely manageable by BF if only they man their desks properly.\"\nInternational travel restrictions are not due to be eased until 17 May at the earliest, but there are fears that border control delays could worsen when measures are relaxed.\n\"We have not seen quite enough action to ensure we are confident that Border Force can cope on 17 May,\" Mr Holland-Kaye said.\nThe Heathrow chief executive said the Home Office must \"get a grip on this to make sure that the Border Force does not become the choke on the UK economic recovery\".\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"We are in a global health pandemic, and people should not be travelling unless absolutely necessary. \n\"Queues and wait times will be longer if passengers have not completed the necessary requirements to enter the UK. Airlines are responsible for making sure that their passengers have completed all the necessary requirements, and airports have a crucial responsibility for ensuring travellers can social distance at passport control.\n\"Border Force is checking that every passenger has complied with current health measures when arriving at the border. Passengers should currently expect queues and wait times to be longer than normal.\"\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps, promised delays will ease once paperwork starts to be automated at border controls.\n\"As we move towards the unlock of international travel we will be addressing this issue, not least through beginning to automate the electronic e-gates with the pre-departure form,\" he told the House of Commons.\nOn Thursday, the airport revealed it had sunk a further \u00a3329m into the red in the first three months of the year, bringing total losses since the start of the pandemic to \u00a32.4bn.\nJust 1.7 million passengers travelled through the airport during the quarter, down 91% on the period in 2019.\nMr Holland-Kaye said the figures revealed the scale of the Covid hit.\nCargo volumes are also down 23% on 2019, underlining how a lack of flights affects UK trade with the rest of the world, he said.\nBut Mr Holland-Kaye hoped this was as bad as it gets now that lockdown restrictions are easing and economies are opening up.\n\"These results show how Covid has devastated the aviation sector and British trade,\" he said. \"Restarting international travel from May 17 will help to kick-start the economic recovery, allowing exporters to get their goods to market, as well as reuniting families who have been separated for over a year.\"\nHowever, he anticipated it would be a long time before travel returned to pre-pandemic levels because of uncertainty over government policy. \nDespite saying there was strong underlying demand for travel, the airport said it had cut its passenger forecast for the year to between 13 and 36 million. In 2019, 81 million people passed through Heathrow, which is owned by investors including Spain's Ferrovial, the Qatar Investment Authority, and China Investment Corp.\nMr Holland-Kaye said that cost-cutting to preserve cash had put the airport in a strong position to benefit from a recovery in air travel when it comes.\nThe aviation industry is hoping that process will start next month if travel restrictions are eased as planned. However, uncertainty remains about where people will be able to go, and how digital vaccine passports will work.\nMr Shapps has said he will chair a meeting of G7 transport ministers next week to discuss vaccine passports before announcing which countries would be open to Britons for travel in early May.\nThe pandemic has hit airlines across the world - with an estimated 50 companies gone out of business - as well as commercial plane-makers Airbus and Boeing.\nOn Thursday, Airbus posted a 2% fall in revenues to \u20ac10.4bn (\u00a39bn) for the first three months of 2021, although it expects deliveries of aircraft to customers to pick up during the year.\n\"The first quarter shows that the crisis is not yet over for our industry and that the market remains uncertain,\" said Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury."

      "tags": "Asia,Delhi,India,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "India's deadly Covid-19 second wave has devastated big cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow and Pune. Hospitals and crematoriums have run out of space, and funerals are taking place in car parks. But the pandemic has now firmly gripped many smaller cities, towns and villages where the devastation is largely under-reported.\nRajesh Soni spent eight hours taking his father from one hospital to another in a tuk-tuk in Kota district in the northern state of Rajasthan on Tuesday. He couldn't get an ambulance and the rickety vehicle was his only option.  At 5pm, he decide to end his search for a hospital bed as his father's condition was deteriorating. He then \"left everything to fate\" and came home.\n\"I am giving him medicines at home, but I am not sure that he will survive. We have been left to die on the streets,\" Rajesh said. He says several private hospitals even \"conned\" him and took money to do tests, only to tell him later to take his father away as there were no beds.\n\"I am not a wealthy person. I spent whatever I had to pay the tuk-tuk driver and to hospitals. Now I am going to borrow some money to get an oxygen cylinder at home.\"\nSuch stories have become common in Delhi, the worst affected city in India, but similar accounts are now coming in from smaller cities and towns across the country.\nThe BBC looks at what's happening in five different states to see how fast the virus is spreading there. \nThe city and surrounding district has reported more than 6,000 cases in the past week, and 264 deaths since the pandemic began - but 35% of those happened in April alone. \nUp to 7 April, it was taking 72 days for the number of cases to double, but now it's 27 days.\nAll oxygen beds were occupied, and only two out of the district's 329 ICU units were free on 27 April. A senior journalist in the city told the BBC that hospitals were overrun and \"this suggests that the actual numbers are much higher\".\nThere is an acute shortage of oxygen and drugs like remdesivir and tocilizumab. The district is home to many coaching centres for students from all over the country taking exams to get into prestigious medical and engineering colleges. \nBut the students have left and the district is now in turmoil and largely away from the radar of national and international media. The journalist said the city's hospitals were not ready for what he described as a Covid tsunami. He said there was an urgent need to add \"more oxygen and ICU beds before more people start dying on the streets\".\nThe city, also known as Prayagraj, had recorded 54,339 cases up to 20 April, but it has registered a 21% increase since then, adding 11,318 cases in the past week. \nAbout 32% of the reported 614 deaths in the city happened in April alone. There is no official data on healthcare facilities in the city, but several people the BBC spoke to said they had been unable to find a bed for their loved ones.\nSeveral calls and written questions to the city's chief medical officer about the shortage of beds went unanswered. A senior journalist in the city said the actual death toll was much higher as cremation and burial grounds were functioning day and night. \nYogi Adityanath, the state's chief minister, recently said there was no shortage of drugs, hospital beds or oxygen, but experts say the reality on the ground is vastly different.\nSocial media is awash with posts from people from the state pleading for beds, oxygen and drugs like remdesivir. The chief minister has also warned that action will be taken against any private hospital that \"falsely reports\" an oxygen shortage.\nAn employee of one small private hospital told the BBC that arranging oxygen had become difficult, but he would not complain because he feared retribution. \n\"But I fail to understand why would any hospital falsely report a shortage. It makes no sense,\" he said. \nThere have also been reports about deaths due to oxygen shortages in the state. Several other districts and villages in Uttar Pradesh are also reporting that hospitals have run out of beds.\nAshish Yadav's father is in a critical condition in Kanpur district but he is unable to get him a bed and he doesn't even have access to a doctor. \n\"I have begged and pleaded everywhere, but nobody helped. Nobody is picking the helpline numbers that have been advertised,\" he told the BBC.\nThe central Indian district did not have any active cases of Covid-19 on 1 March. But it has added almost 3,000 cases in the past seven days. \nKabirdham district hospital has seven ventilators but there are no trained doctors to operate the life-support machines. According to government data, the district hospital should have 49 specialist doctors, but it has only seven. There is also an acute shortage of nurses and lab technicians. \nLocal journalists say that the district is not able to handle really sick patients as it did not prepare to manage the sharp uptick in cases. Several people have died without getting proper treatment in the district.\nBhagalpur district in the eastern state of Bihar is also badly hit. It has recorded a 26% increase in its caseload since 20 April, and the number of deaths increased by 33% in the same period.\nOnly Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College (JNMC) has ICU beds in the district, and all of its 36 units were occupied on 28 April. More than 270 out of 350 oxygen beds in the hospital were occupied. \nA senior official from the hospital told the BBC that out of its 220 doctors, 40 had tested positive in the past 10 days and four of them died. This has added to the pressure on the hospital. \nAurangabad district in the west of the state is also badly hit. It has recorded more than 5,000 cases since 5 April, and six people died in the same period, according to official data. But senior journalists in the state say the actual numbers are higher as testing is a major problem in smaller towns and cities. Many people become critical and die without ever being able to get tested for Covid-19. Such deaths don't go into official data. \nSumitra Devi struggled to get a test done in Aurangabad. She couldn't get an RT-PCR test done for days as her condition continued to worsen. Hospitals refused to admit her without a positive test result. \nSo her family took her to a small private hospital in a nearby district where she tested positive, but the hospital said she was critical and they didn't have facilities to treat her. The family then took her to a big hospital in the state's capital Patna where she was made to wait for several hours.\nShe died in the ambulance.\nThe tourist district in the Himalayas is struggling to cope with the rising number of cases. At least 131 out of its 142 ICU beds were occupied on 27 April and only 10 out of its 771 oxygen beds were free.\nIt has reported more than 4,000 cases and 82 deaths in the past week. The district is particularly finding it difficult to handle the rise because it also receives patients from remote towns and villages where healthcare facilities are negligible. \nA local doctor, who did not wish to be identified, said \"the situation was dire and he was terrified\".  \n\"We are in this situation because the government didn't plan to augment facilities in remote areas. I am worried that many people in remote Himalayan areas will die and we will never hear about them. They will never show up in statistics.\""

      "text": "Boris Johnson's personal mobile phone number has been freely available on the internet for the past 15 years, it has been revealed.\nIt was published in a think tank press release in 2006, but never deleted - and appears to be the one the PM uses.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"a serious situation [that] carries a security risk\". \nBut Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that, as far as he was aware, \"all security protocols have been followed\". \nIt appears the number has been switched off but Downing Street still has not confirmed if the number will now be changed. \nQuestions have been raised in recent weeks over who has access to ministers' personal phone numbers, amid a wider row about lobbying and influence.\nThe PM had reportedly been advised by senior officials to change his number, but this has been denied by Downing Street last week. \nSir Keir said: \"A lot of people will be concerned, not just about who has got the number but who has been using it.\n\"What has come out in recent weeks is [about] privileged access - those who can WhatsApp the prime minister for favours - and this all is further evidence that there is one rule for them and another rule for everybody else.\"\nThe Labour leader also said he had changed his number when he became director of public prosecutions in 2008, adding: \"I have kept it secure since then.\"\nBut Mr Sunak said what made the PM \"special\" was that he was \"incredibly approachable\".\nHe added: \"You see it whenever he is out and about - people feel they can relate to him, they can talk to him, they can tell him what's on their mind.\"\nMr Sunak also revealed he had not changed his own personal phone number since becoming chancellor last February.\nThe think tank press release with the PM's number on it was related to Mr Johnson's then-job as a shadow higher education minister - and MP for Henley - and invited journalists to contact him for further comment.\nTwo years later, he successfully stood to become mayor of London.\nFormer national security adviser Lord Ricketts warned hostile states with \"sophisticated cyber capabilities\" or criminal gangs could now have access to Mr Johnson's digits.\nThe crossbench peer also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he would have thought changing your mobile number when becoming PM would be an \"elementary security precaution these days\".\nBut earlier this week, the UK's top civil servant, Simon Case, told MPs that officials \"put security packages around all the communications that ministers have by whatever means\".\nHe added: \"The level of encryption and standards of security on everybody's mobile phone increasing all the time.\" \nLabour MP Rachel Hopkins said the incident had implications for security, lobbying and the risk of blackmail.\nBut Home Office Minister Victoria Atkins said the PM was \"aware of his responsibilities\" on national security.\nShe told the BBC that she had \"complete and utter confidence\" that Mr Johnson and his advisors knew what needed to be done for him to fulfil those \"duties\". \nIt was revealed earlier this month that the prime minister had contacted businessman Sir James Dyson at the start of the pandemic.\nIn an exchange of text messages, Mr Johnson promised to \"fix\" a tax issue for Sir James, whose company planned to work on building ventilators during the pandemic. \nThe PM said he had done the \"right thing\" in \"shifting heaven and earth and doing everything I possibly could\" to help increase supply. \nIn responding to the urgent call for help at the start of the pandemic, Sir James also wanted to be clear about complying with rules and protecting the business from any extra costs or liabilities.\nBut Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was wrong that people \"who've got the prime minister's number can access him and ask about tax breaks\".\nThe Daily Telegraph recently reported the UK's most senior civil servant, Simon Case, had suggested Mr Johnson change his number because it was too widely known. \nAnd the Times reported last week that a Universal Credit claimant once contacted the PM directly \"asking for help with their benefit claim\" after they were passed his number by a friend.\nMinisters are issued with official mobile phones when they get a job in government, but they are allowed to keep their own personal devices."

      "text": "Boris Johnson must not be allowed to \"mark his own homework\" over an investigation into renovations at his Downing Street flat, Labour has said.\nThe Tory Party is facing an Electoral Commission inquiry over claims a donor initially covered the costs.\nSeparately, the PM's standards adviser Lord Geidt is examining whether Mr Johnson needs to declare any donations.\nBut Labour says Lord Geidt is not fully independent because the PM can ignore his findings.\nSpeaking on a visit to Manchester, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said \"the idea of having an adviser who can investigate only if the prime minister says so just shows how weak the system is\" and he called for a \"proper, independent commission\" to look in to the controversy. \nLord Geidt was unveiled as the PM's new standards adviser on Wednesday, replacing Sir Alex Allen, who quit five months ago after a dispute with Mr Johnson over a report into alleged bullying by Home Secretary Priti Patel.\nDowning Street said the adviser role had \"always been a direct appointment of the prime minister under successive administrations\", adding that \"the same process has been followed here.\"\nThe role has been beefed up, to make it more \"pro-active\", the government says, but the prime minister remains the \"ultimate arbiter\" of ministerial behaviour, including his own.\nThe Electoral Commission - the watchdog overseeing political finances - has launched an investigation which will assess the Conservative Party's compliance with laws on political donations.\nIt said there were \"reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred\".\nA Conservative Party spokesman said: \"We believe all reportable donations have been transparently and correctly declared and published by the Electoral Commission.\"\nThe prime minister receives a public grant of \u00a330,000 per year to cover renovations at his Downing Street flat. \nBut newspaper reports suggest the bill for the latest work could be as high as \u00a3200,000.\nMr Johnson has said he paid the costs himself, but he has not specified whether this happened when he first received the bill, or whether he was loaned the money and later repaid it. \nNormally, MPs have to register within 28 days any donations or loans which could influence their actions - and there is a list of ministers' interests with separate reporting rules.\nThe government insists the prime minister \"acted in accordance with the appropriate codes of conduct and electoral law\".\nIt has said Lord Geidt will look into the \"facts surrounding\" the renovation and will advise the PM on \"any further registration of interests that may be needed\".\nBut Mr Starmer said the situation was becoming \"farcical\" and the prime minister could deal with questions about who funded the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat \"very, very quickly\".\nHe said: \"All he's got to do is answer a very simple question; which is who paid, initially, for the redecoration of your flat?\n\"The prime minister could actually end this now, tell us who paid for it in the first place, answer the question, it would take him about one minute and then he can get back on with the day job.\"\nThe FDA senior civil servants' union is currently taking legal against the government over its stance on the ministerial code.\nIt argues that decisions made under it should be subject to appeal in the courts - but the government says the code is separate from the law and should remain so.\nFDA general secretary Dave Penman told the BBC: \"The prime minister has ensured that not only is he the final arbiter of any investigation, but he retains the veto on whether an investigation starts in the first place.\"\nHe added: \"Few will take comfort from his retention of almost complete control of the process.\""

      "text": "A serving police community support officer found dead in woodland was last seen taking her dog for a walk, the BBC has been told.\nA murder investigation was launched after the body of Julia James, 53, was found in Akholt Wood, Snowdown, near Dover, just after 16:00 BST on Tuesday.\nMs James had been off duty at the time, Kent Police said. \nPolice have been carrying out searches of woodland and nearby fields, and Ms James's home has been cordoned off.\nA white police tent which was erected after Ms James's body was discovered is still in place in the woods, which is a popular spot for dog walkers.\nA few hundred metres away a house with a car and a van parked on the driveway was under police guard.\nOfficers in vans have also been posted at the start of footpaths leading off Holt Street where portable facilities have been erected.\nFloral tributes have been left close to the scene with one saying: \"Dearest Julia RIP you made [me] laugh! The kindest person I ever met.\"\nThe main road between Aylesham and Snowdown remains closed off. \nKent Police colleagues confirmed Ms James had served on the force as a PCSO and said they were pursuing \"a number of lines of inquiry\" into her death.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said she had been \"so saddened\" to learn of the death. \nSpeaking to 5 News, Ms James's nephew Karl James described his aunt as \"just a lovely person\".\nHe said: \"Obviously it's been a real shock. I work away, but my wife is here - heavily pregnant - and with young kids, so she's on edge at the moment too.\n\"So I've come home and just waiting for answers - that's the worst bit really.\"\nDetectives have appealed for anybody who was in the area on Monday or Tuesday to come forward.\nThe hunt for Julia James's killer is continuing. \nIt's a fast-moving investigation but also a difficult investigation for Kent Police officers because, of course, they are looking into the murder of one of their own officers. \nShe was last seen by a neighbour leaving her home on Tuesday afternoon as she went to walk her dog. \nWe've seen a lot of searches of fields - this is a very rural area and a lot of places are cordoned off as officers carried out fingertip searches. \nAssistant Chief Constable Peter Ayling said it had been \"a tough day for many\" on the force. \nThere were \"some shattered people today following the loss of one of our own,\" he said.\nMatthew Scott, the Kent police and crime commissioner, said his thoughts were with Ms James's family and friends. \nSt Peter's Church in Aylesham opened for prayers on Thursday morning, with flowers laid on the village green, including one that appeared to be from police colleagues.\nThe vicar, the Reverend Nick Ratcliffe, said: \"There's been shock and disbelief that this could happen so close to home in a quiet area of Kent. \n\"People are coming to terms with what's happened and they need to come somewhere and just sit quietly and reflect, say a prayer and just have time to do something to show their grief.\"\nDover MP Natalie Elphicke praised Ms James and urged the public to be vigilant.\nOn Twitter she said: \"Julia James was a popular pillar of our community.\n\"My thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends. Kent Police have advised local people to be vigilant. It is important to follow that advice\".\nEgerton Farmers' Market said Ms James was among a group of PCSOs who held \"pop-up\" stations at the market where residents could raise their concerns and ask questions.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "title": "Biden pitches 'once in a generation investment' to Congress",
      "tags": "Washington DC,United States Capitol,US politics,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden has laid out a sweeping investment plan for jobs, education and social care in his first speech to a joint session of Congress.\nDelivered on the eve of his 100th day in office, the Democrat pitched some $4 trillion (\u00a32.9tn) in spending - the largest overhaul of US benefits since the 1960s, analysts say.\nHe called it a \"once in a generation investment in America itself\".\nBut the plans face a battle in Congress before they can become law.\nThere has been widespread opposition to the proposals from the Republican Party, which is unlikely to back tax increases and more government spending.\nAnd while there is a slim Democratic majority in both houses, there has been division among the party over how far to go with the plans.\nIn a historic moment, US Vice-President Kamala Harris - the first woman to hold that office - and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi both sat behind Mr Biden during Wednesday night's address. It was the first time two women appeared behind the president during a speech to Congress.\nAfter addressing Ms Harris in his opening remarks as Madam Vice-President, Mr Biden added: \"No president has ever said those words from this podium. And it's about time.\"\nThe 78-year-old president, buoyed by solid approval ratings, presented the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan. The White House said the proposals would be funded by tax raises on corporations and the wealthiest Americans.\n\"It's time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1%... to pay their fair share,\" Mr Biden said at an event that was scaled back due to the pandemic.\nHe described the American Jobs Plan as \"a blue-collar blueprint to build America\" that would boost investment in public transport, high-speed broadband and roads and bridges. He added that the plan would be guided by the fight against climate change. \n\"When I think climate change I think jobs,\" he said. \"There's no reason why American workers can't lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries.\"\nHe said the $1.8tn American Families Plan, meanwhile, would focus on children and seek to provide:\nThe proposal follows the so-called American Rescue Plan, a $1.9tn coronavirus stimulus package that included direct cheques to most Americans, which Mr Biden signed into law last month.\nOn Wednesday, he framed these latest proposals in the context of foreign policy and said the US was \"in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21st century\". He also called for politicians from both parties to back his plans and said he was willing to work with both sides.\nJoe Biden's speech to Congress started as a victory lap and ended with a warning.\nHe began by touting what has been by all accounts a very successful rollout of vaccinations in the US, paving the way for a return to some semblance of normalcy in the months ahead. He boasted of hundreds of thousands of new jobs created in his first 100 days and a growing economy. He touted recently passed funding that will help cut child poverty in the US in half.\nThat was all a set-up, however, for the president's pitch for more - more spending and more action from Congress. He proposed a trillion-dollar package of universal pre-kindergarten, two years of free college education, family leave and childcare funding. He called for legislation on gun control, immigration, criminal justice reform and voting rights.\nHe concluded, however, by turning to the 6 January attack on the US Capitol and the threat posed to democracy by the world's autocratic nations.\nHe assured the nation that the US will prevail. His ending, however, seemed designed to create a sense of urgency - one that, perhaps, he can harness to achieve the ambitious agenda he set out on Wednesday night.\nRepublican National Committee (RNC) Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Mr Biden's first 100 days in office were \"an unqualified failure\", accusing him and his party of \"hyper-partisanship\".\n\"In his inaugural address, Biden called for unity. That was a lie, and our nation is worse-off and more divided thanks to Joe Biden,\" her statement read.\nThe top Republican in the House, Kevin McCarthy, was more concise. \"This whole thing could have just been an email,\" he wrote on Twitter.\nSenator Tim Scott - a possible contender for the White House in 2024 and the only black Republican senator - followed Mr Biden's speech with the traditional rebuttal from the opposition party.\nHe said the proposals would \"lower wages of the average American worker\" and dismissed them as a \"liberal wish list of big government waste\".\nMr Scott then discussed racism in America, accusing Democrats of wanting \"the issue more than they want the solution\".\n\"America is not a racist country. It's backwards to fight discrimination with different types of discrimination and it's wrong to try to use our painful past to dishonestly shut down debates in the present,\" he said."

      "text": "US President Joe Biden is expected to call for free pre-school and community college in his first speech to a joint session of Congress.\nSpeaking on the eve of his 100th day in office, the Democrat will call for the most sweeping revamp of US social benefits since the 1960s. \nHis plan includes $4tn (\u00a32.9tn) of spending on education and family leave.\nHistory will also be made as two women sit behind the president for the first time during a speech to Congress.\nUS Vice-President Kamala Harris and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi will both wear masks at the rostrum during Wednesday night's primetime address.\nThe US president's State of the Union-style remarks will be followed by the traditional rebuttal speech from the opposing party - delivered on this occasion by Senator Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican.\nMr Scott, a potential 2024 White House contender who is African American, is a leading voice in his party on race.\nMr Biden will speak at 21:00 EDT (02:00 BST on Thursday) from a US Capitol that is still ringed by security fencing and guarded by hundreds of National Guard troops following the storming of the complex on 6 January by pro-Trump protesters.\nAhead of his speech, he will meet congressional staff who were trapped in the building during the riot, the White House said.\nAround 1,600 guests usually attend a president's address to a joint session of Congress. But this time only about 200 people will get invitations because of virus-prevention protocols.\nBuoyed by solid approval ratings, Mr Biden will look to the tens of millions of Americans that the White House hopes will tune in from home.\nThe president will seek to build public support for two massive packages - the\u00a0American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan - which analysts project would entail the most far-reaching reform of the US social safety net since the 1960s.\nThe White House says both proposals if passed by Congress would be \"fully paid for\" by tax hikes on the richest Americans and corporations.\nThe American Families Plan, with a price tag of $1.8tn, aims to provide free pre-school for US children aged three to four, paid family leave and free community college, the White House said on Tuesday.\nIt would also extend until 2025 a child tax credit that was expanded during the pandemic, offering monthly payments to lower-income parents of around $300 per child. Democrats reportedly hope to establish these payments as a permanent government programme.\nThe White House has indicated the package would be funded by almost doubling the capital gains tax rate on incomes above $1 million to 39.6% and hiking the top income tax bracket for households earning more than $400,000 to the same level.\nReports of Biden plans for an increase in capital gains taxes sparked a stock market sell-off last week. \nWe thought that Joe Biden - all 78 years of him - would be a transitional president. He would be there to lower the political temperature; try to heal a divided nation.\nTake the absurd politics out of the response to Covid. Improve vaccine roll-out. Drain the poison from the body politic. But that aside, not do too much.\nHe appointed a largely technocratic cabinet, presumably to perform managerial functions. Maybe make the trains run on time a bit better, but not change all the rolling stock, let alone alter the gauge of the railway. \nA fitting ambition for Amtrak Joe.\nBut maybe we've got that all wrong. Is it possible that far from being transitional, he's transformational?\nThe president will also pitch his $2.3tn American Jobs Plan, which the White House unveiled last month.\nBilled as an infrastructure package, it seeks to invest in public transit, rail, airports, water pipes, high-speed broadband, roads and bridges, veterans' hospitals, childcare centres and combating racial disparities.\nThe proposal also seeks to steer the US economy towards electric cars - which today make up barely 2% of vehicles of America's roads - and clean energy.\nIt would be paid for by raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% and other taxes on multinational corporations, says the White House.\nDuring his speech, Mr Biden is also expected to address cultural flashpoints such as police reform, gun violence and the crisis at the US-Mexico border.\nLast month he signed the American Rescue Plan, a $1.9tn coronavirus stimulus package that included direct cheques to most Americans.\nSenator Scott has been a leading voice in his party on race and has talked about times he has been racially profiled by police.\nHe has hinted that his rebuttal speech will not just be about ripping into the president's agenda.\n\"We face serious challenges on multiple fronts, but I am as confident as I have ever been in the promise and potential of America.\n\"I look forward to having an honest conversation with the American people and sharing Republicans' optimistic vision for expanding opportunity and empowering working families.\"\nBut among his colleagues in Congress there has been widespread opposition to the Biden agenda.\nThe US president's party narrowly controls the House and Senate for the first time in a decade, enabling Democrats to pass that relief bill without a single congressional vote from Republicans. \nTop Republican Senator Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday: \"President Biden ran as a moderate, but I'm hard pressed to think of anything at all that he's done so far that would indicate some degree of moderation.\"\nIn addition to three packages totalling around $6tn, Mr Biden last week also unveiled plans for a $1.5tn federal budget that would significantly expand spending on domestic programmes."

      "tags": "Grenfell Tower fire,Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council,North Kensington,Grenfell Tower Inquiry",
      "text": "A Grenfell resident who predicted a \"catastrophic event\" would happen at the tower has defended his description of its management as a \"mini-mafia\". \nEdward Daffarn and another resident repeatedly attacked the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO) in a blog. \nMr Daffarn told a public inquiry his description of the organisation was not \"glib, shoot from the hip expressions\". \nSeventy-two people died in the Grenfell fire on 14 June 2017.\nGiving evidence at the inquiry into the disaster, Mr Daffarn said he had \"spent a long, long time thinking how to describe this organisation\" but he \"wouldn't change a single word of it.\nHe added felt like residents of the tower were being \"abused\" by the KCTMO. \nThe year before the fire, Mr Daffarn's blog, which he wrote with Francis O'Connor, said: \n\"It is a truly terrifying thought but the Grenfell Action Group firmly believe that only a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord, the  KCTMO, and bring an end to the dangerous living conditions and neglect of health and safety legislation that they inflict upon their tenants and leaseholders.\"\nMr Daffarn fought a campaign against the KCTMO which had been set up as an \"arm's length\" organisation to manage council property on behalf of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. \nHe was a bitter critic of the organisation in the years before the refurbishment of the building and during the work.\nA key complaint raised by Edward Daffarn in the blog related to concerns that contractors were parking in emergency bays at the base of the tower, preventing fire service vehicles from getting access in the event of a blaze. \nMr Daffarn wrote to project managers and the KCTMO that the planned closure of a car park for work on the tower would make the problem worse. \nHe was told the work would have no impact on emergency access, but he was not reassured because vehicles continued to take up the emergency bays - he felt, with management approval.\nHe emailed London Fire Brigade (LFB) in March 2014 warning that \"if there was a major fire in Grenfell Tower and fire brigade access ever became an issue... we would use the evidence recorded on our blog and in extensive email correspondence to ensure that those in charge at the TMO (Tenant Management Organisation) would face extremely serious consequences\".\nThe concerns do not appear to have been resolved at the time, according to today's evidence so far. \nHowever, the inquiry has previously found that the first fire engines called to the tower were able to park close to the main entrance and get access to water mains.\nAnother issue raised by Mr Daffarn centred on a power surge at the tower in May 2013.\nIn the email to LFB he said: \"We believe that the TMO and the council have never acknowledged the possible consequences of this catastrophic power surge and its associated fire risk.\n\"We believe the TMO must value our lives so little that something so serious can just be covered up and never acknowledged as happening.\"\nThe cause of the 2017 fire was an electrical fault behind a fridge, although the inquiry has not been able to explain it. \nThe residents were also alarmed by the findings of a fire risk assessment which they obtained after repeated emails. \nThe council and its tenant management organisation will give evidence in coming weeks. \nEdward Daffarn was accused of being \"disruptive\" and \"aggressive\" at meetings held by KCTMO during consultation with residents about the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower. \nIn an email, the local councillor, Judith Blakeman, said \"continuing to give these people so much access to put their views is unhelpful as it gives them greater legitimacy\".\nMr Daffarn disputed being disruptive but accepted he had a difficult relationship with the councillor. \nIn a closing comment, Mr Daffarn said the building's management \"didn't treat us with respect or humanity or empathy and if they had done, we wouldn't be here now\".\nThe inquiry continues."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nThe streets are crowded, the shopping centres busy and the traffic heavy. Some flock to the main bus terminal to get out of Istanbul, while others are trying to stockpile alcohol amid news of a \"booze ban\". This is the mood as Turkey prepares to enter its first full lockdown of the pandemic later. Turkey has faced restrictions, which were re-imposed at the beginning of April, but they was not enough to curb the spread of infections. At its height this month, there were more than 60,000 new cases a day and more than 300 deaths.\nCalls and messages to the NSPCC's helpline have risen to record levels during the pandemic. In the year to March 2021, the children's charity was contacted almost 85,000 times, up 23% on the previous year. The figures amplify fears that children who could not go to school during the lockdowns were more vulnerable to abuse and neglect, says the NSPCC. Chief executive Sir Peter Wanless says government recovery plans must address the harm children may have faced.\nCalls have been made for a uniform approach to the rollout of so-called Covid marshals across Northern Ireland. Some of Northern Ireland's 11 councils are planning to deploy marshals in towns and city centres, as shops reopen on Friday. They do not have specific enforcement powers, but will advise the public and businesses on social distancing rules. Retail NI has described the plan as patchy and said it was \"extremely concerned\" about the situation.\nIndia's deadly Covid-19 second wave has devastated big cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow and Pune. Hospitals and crematoriums have run out of space, and funerals are taking place in car parks. But the pandemic has now firmly gripped many smaller cities, towns and villages where the devastation is largely under-reported. The BBC looks at what's happening in five different states to see how fast the virus is spreading there.\nA widower who was struggling with mental health issues due to isolation during lockdown has walked 2,000 miles in a year after his doctor recognised he needed \"social connection\" not pills. Jim Snodgrass, 84, from Edinburgh, was expecting to receive medication for his anxiety but was instead given the phone number for the Ramblers.

But they will need to show a pass sanitaire - or health pass - the details of which have not yet been revealed.\nA pass will also be needed to attend large events.\n\"The health pass should not be mandatory for access to everyday things such as restaurants, theatres and cinemas or to go see friends,\" Mr Macron said. \"But for places with big crowds, such as stadiums, festivals, trade fairs or exhibitions, it would be absurd not to use it\".\nFrance entered a third national lockdown on 3 April, as it battled a surge in cases that threatened to overwhelm hospitals. The daily number of new cases has fallen since then, from around 40,000 to 27,000 on average over the past week.\nA further 324 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours. The total number killed by the pandemic in France is now at least 104,079, Johns Hopkins University estimates.\nThe president was strongly criticised for rejecting calls to order a third national lockdown earlier to bring down a spike in infections. \nMr Macron said it was time to start \"resuming our French-style way of life\", and people needed \"conviviality\", culture and sport. But he added that people needed to remain \"careful and responsible\"."

But the spike in the number of cases is worrying.\nFollowing a second period of restrictions starting last November, the number of daily cases fell to around 6,000 at one point in mid-February.\nBut as soon as the government started to ease the restrictions in March, a new wave struck Turkey.\nThe government then U-turned to re-impose restrictions at the beginning of April. However, that was not enough to curb the spread of infections.\nAt its height in April, there were more than 60,000 new cases a day and more than 300 deaths.\nAccording to critics, the government lifted restrictions too early and the vaccination process has not been fast enough.\nMore than 22 million vaccinations have been carried out, with 13.6 million people having received at least one dose in this country of 82 million.\nTurkey mainly uses the Chinese Sinovac vaccine, as well as lower numbers of Pfizer-Biontech.\nHealth Minister Fahrettin Koca said recently: \"We have sped up vaccine diplomacy for the injections including Sinovac, Pfizer-Biontech and (Russia's) Sputnik V\".\nAnother criticism was that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party organised packed congresses in March while many social gatherings, public protests were banned.\nScientists also say the new variants, especially the UK (Kent) strain, have accelerated the infection rate.\nWhatever the reason for the new wave, Mr Erdogan finally announced a full lockdown effective from Thursday evening until 17 May.\nMany experts are happy with the new lockdown as they say it is necessary. \nHowever, some argue that the lockdown will not last long enough to combat the rise in cases and that it may not be very effective if it is not supported by a faster vaccination programme. Any measures should also provide economic support for low-income people, they believe.\nAcross Turkish society there is a determination to see the back of this most recent wave, and the government has a clear target.\nPresident Erdogan has said: \"At a time when Europe is entering a phase of reopening, we must rapidly reduce our number of cases to fewer than 5,000, not to be left behind\".\nThe measures last throughout the rest of Ramadan and the Eid festival that follows it.\nLast year Turkey saw a 70% fall in foreign visitors. The tourist industry hopes the lockdown will help enable a reopening in time for the summer season."

      "text": "Stormont minister Edwin Poots has publicly put his name forward to be the next leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\nThe party has begun the process of appointing a new leader after Arlene Foster's resignation.\nShe will step down as DUP leader on 28 May and as first minister of Northern Ireland at the end of June.\nMr Poots is one of three DUP politicians tipped as a potential party leader.\nHe has been a member of the DUP for all of his political career and is Northern Ireland's agriculture and environment minister.\nIn a video message posted on his Twitter account on Thursday, Mr Poots paid tribute to Mrs Foster. \nHe said he looked forward to the engagement and debate with colleagues and the wider public \"in this contest\".\nThe support of a majority of the party's 27 members of the Northern Ireland Assembly will be crucial to Mr Poots' hopes of replacing Mrs Foster as leader.\nThe first senior figure within the DUP to publicly back Mr Poots was assembly member Christopher Stalford, who said his friend had the \"experience and talents to take our country and our party forward\".\nEarlier, a source said Mr Poots has a \"big advantage over any MP who might be in the running\".\n\"That is because there is a feeling in the assembly group that they were left out of the loop by the party leadership and that is why so many signed the motion of no confidence in Arlene Foster.\"\nMrs Foster, 50, announced her resignation on Wednesday after a letter of no confidence in the party leadership was signed by about 80% of its Stormont and Westminster ranks.\nThe outgoing first minister said it was important to give space over the coming weeks for the party officers to make arrangements for the election of a new leader.\nThere has been speculation of a split role, with one person as first minister at Stormont and a second as party leader at Westminster.\nPossible contenders not only include Mr Poots but also Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson, although the latter two have yet to make their position clear. \nSpeaking to BBC News NI on Friday, former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern urged Stormont parties not to allow the change of DUP leadership to destabilise the power-sharing institutions.\n\"That would be a disaster - I think instability just leaves everybody in a bad place,\" he said.\n\"Governments all over the world nowadays have coalition partners - these should be seen as normal processes.\n\"I know there are problems but the big picture is stable society, seeing your economy develop and to see the pandemic dealt with.\" \nMr Ahern - a key architect of the Good Friday peace agreement - told Newstalk Radio there could be a \"wobbly road ahead\" if Sinn F\u00e9in was to become the largest party in Northern Ireland and take the job of first minister.\nHe said he had not anticipated the \"swiftness\" of Mrs Foster's departure but added that it was \"no secret that there was a lot of discontent within the DUP over a prolonged period\".\nHe said there was \"a lot of talk around Christmas time that Mr Poots would mount some kind of a coup\".\n\"But then [Mr Poots] got sick and stood down for a while so... it looked like things were alright [for Mrs Foster],\" he added.\nOn Thursday, DUP MLA Jim Wells, who lost the party whip at Stormont in 2018 after criticising the leadership, said he believed that Mr Poots was the frontrunner for the party leadership.\nMr Wells has already expressed support for Mr Poots and there may be a move to return the whip to him.\nHe said Mr Poots had vast experience and a \"shrewd head on his shoulders\".\nA new DUP leader is likely to be elected before the end of May but a senior party source says Sinn F\u00e9in may demand concessions on the Irish language or LGBT rights before agreeing to the election of a new first minister.\n\"I don't think any of them have gamed out what is likely to happen now,\" said the source, who asked not to be named.\nThe source also said that removing Mrs Foster was a \"total mess\" that could lead to a Stormont election this year, even though the next vote for the power-sharing assembly is not due to take place until May 2022.\nSinn F\u00e9in's Michelle O'Neill - the deputy first minister leading the Stormont executive along with Mrs Foster - said the \"incoming DUP leader should recognise that the political landscape across our island has changed\".\n\"Within the executive and assembly, Sinn F\u00e9in will work with all parties to progress social reform, political change and economic prosperity but we will robustly oppose damaging policies or regressive throwback politics of the past.\"\nWithout Sinn F\u00e9in support, a new first minister cannot be elected.\nA DUP source told BBC News NI: \"I would expect negotiations to take place over the election of a new first minister but Sinn F\u00e9in will seek to extract movement on a number of issues.\n\"Unless there is a agreement I can see the issue being allowed to drift over the summer when not much happens and then a possible election in the autumn.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in Finance Minister Conor Murphy said it would be difficult for the executive to work when the DUP was \"in such a state of turmoil\".\n\"The DUP [has] been at war with itself and that disfunction has impacted on the executive and impacted on our ability to do business.\"\nMr Murphy said it would be \"irresponsible\" to have an election before May next year.\n\"We all have a responsibility to try and manage the situation through to then and we can't allow turbulence within one party to contaminate the rest of the executive in that regard,\" he said.\nAlliance Party leader and Justice Minister Naomi Long said she believed Mrs Foster had been made a scapegoat for the DUP's \"strategic errors\".\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he was worried about politics in Northern Ireland and was surprised at the pace of Mrs Foster's resignation.\n\"Politics in Northern Ireland [is] fragile, it's very divisive, opinions are very polarised,\" he said.\n\"People like me and others have to find a way of building relations that can cope with that division and give political leadership at a time when it's badly needed.\"\nOnly a small number of the DUP membership - MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) and MPs - will get to vote in a leadership contest.\nThere are 27 MLAs that hold the party whip - including Mrs Foster - and eight MPs.\nIf a contest does take place it will be the first in the DUP's 50-year history.\nDUP rules state that a leadership election should be called by 30 April, although that date could potentially pass.\nParty officers will ultimately decide the selection process.\nNormally the leadership election is simply a formality and the existing leader continues in their role but other candidates are free to challenge them.\nThe role of first minister is separate but as the largest party from the largest grouping (unionism) in the assembly, the DUP is entitled to nominate someone to hold the post of first minister.\nOnce Mrs Foster steps down as first minister, the DUP would then be asked to nominate a replacement within seven days and a vote would be held in the assembly.\nIf a replacement is not nominated the Northern Ireland secretary is obliged to call an assembly election.\nMrs Foster has endured a turbulent time as DUP leader and the fallout from Brexit - which the party supported - has put particular pressure on the party's top brass as it faces having to weather the storm caused by the Northern Ireland Protocol, which imposed a border down the Irish Sea.\nThe aftermath of Brexit caused friction both internally and between the party and some of its core voters who are unhappy at the deal which led to the Irish Sea border.\nIt has also been suggested recent changes to Northern Ireland's abortion laws and the commitment to implement an Irish language act were causing concerns with some elected DUP representatives ahead of next year's assembly election.\nOn Tuesday it emerged a letter of no-confidence was circulated among the party's MLAs and MPs - more than 20 assembly members and four MPs are understood to have signed it.\nThere was also pressure from councillors, with concerns ranging from the Northern Ireland Protocol, abortion legislation, same-sex marriage, policing and the recent gay conversion debate at Stormont.\nMrs Foster has been DUP leader since December 2015.\nThe following month, she was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland, becoming the first woman and the youngest person to hold both jobs.\nColleagues from across the political divide have sent their best wishes to Mrs Foster.\nDeputy First Minister Ms O'Neill said the pair had a decent if challenging relationship.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson thanked Mrs Foster \"for her dedication to the people of Northern Ireland\".\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said Mrs Foster was a dedicated public servant who had inspired young women to follow her example and go into politics.\nTaoiseach (Irish PM) Miche\u00e1l Martin said he had a \"positive working relationship with Arlene\".\n\"In particular I valued the constructive engagement, notwithstanding our differences, we have had in our respective roles as taoiseach and first minister,\" he said."

      "text": "Michael Collins - one of the three crew members of the first manned mission to land on the Moon, Apollo 11 in 1969 - has died aged 90, his family say.\nHe died on Wednesday after \"a valiant battle with cancer. He spent his final days peacefully, with his family by his side,\" they said.\nCollins stayed in lunar orbit as his colleagues Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the Moon.\nAldrin, 91, is now the only surviving member of the mission.\nPaying tribute to Collins, Aldrin wrote in a tweet: \"Dear Mike, Wherever you have been or will be, you will always have the Fire to Carry us deftly to new heights and to the future. We will miss you. May you Rest In Peace.\"\nIn a statement, the Collins family said that \"Mike always faced the challenges of life with grace and humility, and faced this, his final challenge, the same way\".\n\"We will miss him terribly. Yet we also know how lucky Mike felt to have lived the life he did.\n\"We will honour his wish for us to celebrate, not mourn, that life.\"\nOn 16 July 2019, Collins visited Florida's Kennedy Space Center - the site where the mission had set off exactly 50 years earlier. \nSpeaking at launchpad 39A - where the crew's rocket began the historic mission - he described how he felt during take-off.\n\"The shockwave from the rocket power hits you,\" Collins told Nasa TV. \"Your whole body is shaking. This gives you an entirely... different concept of what power really means.\"\n\"You're suspended in the cockpit... as you lift off,\" he continued. \"From then on it's a quieter, more rational, silent ride all the way to the Moon.\n\"We crew felt the weight of the world on our shoulders, we knew that everyone would be looking at us, friend or foe.\"\nBy Paul Rincon, Science editor, BBC News website\nNeil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin garnered most of the attention for the historic first Moon landing in 1969. \nBut their crewmate, Michael Collins, was just as important for the success of the mission. \nAs the command module pilot, Collins stayed in lunar orbit while Neil and Buzz bounded across the surface. But he performed crucial manoeuvres in space that were needed to get to the Moon. \nHe was sanguine about others getting the glory: \"I certainly thought that I did not have the best seat of the three,\" he said. \"But I can say in all honesty, I was thrilled with the seat that I did have.\"\nAfter leaving Nasa, he had a brief spell in politics, but later retired to Florida, where he painted and wrote. \nDespite joining Twitter in 2019, at the age of 88, he admitted that he never really enjoyed the spotlight of public life. \nBut his name will live on, as a new generation of astronauts prepares to return to the Moon in the next few years, following the trail blazed by Collins and the other pioneers of Apollo.\nOn 16 July 1969, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins were strapped into their Apollo spacecraft on top of the vast Saturn V rocket and were propelled into orbit in just over 11 minutes. \nFour days later, Armstrong and Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the lunar surface. Collins remained in the command module throughout the mission.\nArmstrong's words, beamed to the world by TV, entered history: \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\"\nAbout 400,000 people worked on the programme, at a cost at the time of $25bn.\nThe crew returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on 24 July.\nAn estimated 650 million people worldwide watched the Moon landing. For the US, the achievement helped it demonstrate its power to a world audience."

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing,Liverpool,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Four hundred delegates have attended the UK's first face-to-face, mask-free business conference in Liverpool since the start of the Covid pandemic.\nIt is hoped the \"pioneering\" event, part of a set of trials being monitored by scientists, will help pave the way for a return to more normal activities.\nAttendees did not have to socially distance or show a vaccine certificate.\nInstead they were asked to provide personal details and take a lateral-flow test beforehand and afterwards.\nThe data will be analysed at four UK universities - Edinburgh, Loughborough, Liverpool and UCL, as part of the government's Events and Research Programme (ERP).\n\"It genuinely feels like an experiment,\" said Wayne Hemingway, the designer and businessman who organised the Good Business Festival.\n\"Are people going to take their masks off, are they going to keep them on? You're allowed to shake hands,\" he told the BBC.\n\"This is also a test for events that are nothing to do with business because nobody really knows what's going to happen,\" said Mr Hemmingway.\n\"But I am pretty confident that as human beings we enjoy getting together... it's made us what we are.\"\nAfter the presentations and networking, a comedy show was due to take place to monitor audience laughter - another milestone moment.\nGarth Dallas from the event team said: \"This is just amazing. Liverpool is an event city and that's why we were chosen to be part of this.\n\"Businesses have embraced this. Not all - but enough for us to hold this event.\"\nOther pilot events being monitored in the government's research programme are the World Snooker Championships, held in Sheffield on 17 April, and the Brit Awards in London on 11 May.\nThe data gathered will be used to determine how festivals, gigs, conferences and sporting events can take place again with large audiences.\nUnder the government's current roadmap 21 June is the earliest date that such events will be allowed. \nBefore the pandemic, the business meetings and events sector was worth \u00a370bn to the economy every year and supported 700,000 jobs. \nWhile some businesses in the sector have pivoted successfully to online conferences, a lot of the sector has experienced an extremely challenging year.\nProfessor Iain Buchan, from the Institute of Population Health at the University of Liverpool, said it was \"heartening\" to see people reconnect but the organisers were also looking for lessons to learn.\n\"We want to start cautiously with venues like this that are easy to reconfigure... looking at movement in the venues, are there any bottlenecks we can do something about? Is our ventilation really working?\"\nHe said delegates were not compelled to be mask-free as part of the pilot event but to practise \"good citizenship\"... adding scientists were \"not expecting to find transmission of the virus\".\nThe events industry has been particularly hard-hit by the restrictions introduced because of the pandemic.\nIn order to \"keep events sustainable\", Professor Buchan said systems were in place to \"respond very quickly if rates increase\".\nBrendan Kenny and Jim Forshaw were among those attending the event from Liverpool's business community.\nMr Kenny, who works in the construction industry, said: \"It's absolutely fantastic. Great to see people, great to engage... do what we used to do.\"\nMr Forshaw, a flooring business owner, added: \"It's nice to get back to some sort of normality. It's nice to see people's full faces.\"\nIt has taken a considerable amount of work to get to a position where an event on this scale and under these conditions can be held safely.\nClaire McColgan, Director of Culture Liverpool, told the BBC: \"This has been the biggest learning curve of my whole career. It's been really tough.\n\"This time we're not worrying about the weather or how many people are coming to an event.\"\nShe added: \"48% of our economy comes from the visitor economy. We've had to sit on Zoom calls for a year and a half.\n\"But we're not a city about buildings, we're a city about people, animation and life.\""

      "tags": "Russia,St Petersburg,Alexei Navalny,Vladimir Putin",
      "text": "Alexei Navalny has appeared in court from prison, head close-shaven and face gaunt, and accused Vladimir Putin of attempting to rule Russia \"forever\" and caring only about \"clinging to power\". \nIt is the opposition politician's first public appearance since starting a 2.5-year jail term, seen as punishment for his fierce criticism of the Kremlin. \nNavalny spoke via videolink, his prison kit hanging loosely after a recent 24-day hunger strike over his treatment. \nHis language was as robust as ever.\nPresident Putin was a \"king with no clothes\", he said, who was \"robbing the people\" and depriving Russians of a future. Russians were being \"turned into slaves\".\nThe judge rejected Navalny's appeal against a fine for defaming a Soviet World War Two veteran who had appeared in a pro-Kremlin video. Navalny said his weight in jail had fallen to 72kg (11.3 stones), the same as he weighed in school.\nBut even as the Kremlin critic spoke, another court across Moscow was discussing a petition by the prosecutor to ban all his political organisations as \"extremist\".\nAnticipating the court's ruling, Navalny's right-hand man Leonid Volkov announced that some three dozen \"Navalny headquarters\" were being disbanded, to protect staff and supporters from prosecution. \nThe offices were set up in 2017 ahead of Navalny's attempt to challenge Vladimir Putin for the presidency; he was barred from even joining the race. \nOn Monday, the Moscow prosecutor suspended all activity by the offices, pending the court decision. The activities of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) have also been restricted. \n\"To make it clear, this decision destroys our political organisation in Russia,\" Leonid Volkov told the BBC this week. He was speaking from abroad, where he has lived since 2019 for safety as he faces multiple criminal charges himself. \n\"There is no way we can continue to operate in the country,\" the activist said, adding that the extremism laws carry punishment of up to 10 years in prison.\nThe \"extremist\" branding would be toxic, as the Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia have found out: since the religious organisation was outlawed in 2017 on the same grounds almost 500 of its followers have faced criminal prosecution. Dozens are serving hefty sentences. \nSo, across Russia, staff who once worked for Team Navalny have rushed to clear out their offices and delete social media accounts and chats.\nIn St Petersburg, where supporters queued round the block four years ago when the politician swept into town to open his first regional headquarters, there is now no sign his team were ever there.\nThe front door of their office is shuttered. Inside there is just a couple of chairs, a coat rack and a printer gathering dust.\nIrina Fatyanova, who ran Navalny's St Petersburg team until Monday, stresses that she has now severed all ties with the organisation, at risk of being labelled an extremist.\nBut she says pressure from the authorities had increased steadily since January, when Alexei Navalny returned to Russia after recovering from a nerve agent attack in Siberia. Arrested on arrival, he has been behind bars ever since.\n\"Since January, I don't think there's been one calm day when I didn't worry about a knock on my door, or some criminal case,\" Irina confided, telling me she had been followed, detained and had her house searched in recent weeks. \nBut the \"extremism\" label takes the danger to another level. \nIrina describes the move as a personal tragedy and now plans to try running for local election, independently of Team Navalny - a plan Leonid Volkov suggests may be replicated across the country. \n\"Things are frightening, but what happens if we're all scared off?\" Irina reasons. \"I don't want to look the next generation in the eyes and be ashamed.\"\nBut the strength of Alexei Navalny's movement was two-fold: his charismatic leadership and the structure he put in place, supporting activists across the country. \nMobilising via social media, they have staged street protests, promoted anti-Kremlin candidates for election and conducted anti-corruption investigations against top-level officials that have gone viral. \nBut tolerance of their activities has ended.\nIn St Petersburg this week, even a wall painting of Alexei Navalny lasted just four hours before police arrived, followed swiftly by municipal workers with daffodil-yellow paint.\nWithin moments, Navalny's image was obliterated.

      "tags": "Earth science,Antarctic,Greenland,Earth observation,Glaciers,Climate change",
      "text": "The world's glaciers are melting at an accelerating rate, according to a comprehensive new study. \nA French-led team assessed the behaviour of nearly all documented ice streams on the planet.\nThe researchers found them to have lost almost 270 billion tonnes of ice a year over the opening two decades of the 21st Century. \nThe meltwater produced now accounts for about a fifth of global sea-level rise, the scientists tell Nature journal.\nThe numbers involved are quite hard to imagine, so team member Robert McNabb, from the universities of Ulster and Oslo, uses an analogy. \n\"Over the last 20 years, we've seen that glaciers have lost about 267 gigatonnes (Gt) per year. So, if we take that amount of water and we divide it up across the island of Ireland, that's enough to cover all of Ireland in 3m of water each year,\" he says on this week's edition of Science In Action on the BBC World Service.\n\"And the total loss is accelerating. It's growing by about 48Gt/yr, per decade.\"\nThe worldwide inventory of glaciers contains 217,175 ice streams. \nSome are smaller than a football pitch; others can rival in area a mid-sized country like the UK. What nearly all have in common is that they are thinning and retreating in a changing climate, either through stronger melting in warmer air or because the patterns of snowfall that feed the glaciers have shifted.\nThe research team, led by Romain Hugonnet from the University of Toulouse, France, used as its primary source of data the imagery acquired by Nasa's Terra satellite, which was launched in 1999.\nImmense computing power was brought to bear on the process of interpreting these pictures and pulling out the changes in the glaciers' elevation, volume and mass up to 2019.\nThe team believes its approach has hammered down the uncertainties in its results to perhaps less than 5% overall. That's in large part because every single glacier examined in the study is represented based on the same methodology.\n\"This new study is a major advance as we get a high spatial resolution and, at the same time, it also provides the temporal change over the two decades directly based on satellite data, which is novel,\" explained co-author Matthias Huss from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.\n\"This data-set has been validated with an immense amount of additional, independent measurements and is highly accurate so that the uncertainties of previous studies are strongly reduced.\"\nA group led from Leeds University published its own assessment of glacier ice loss in January in the journal The Cryosphere.\nIt arrived at very similar numbers. It reported a 289Gt/yr average loss over the period 2000-2019, with a 52Gt/yr/decade acceleration. An 8% difference.\nLeeds professor Andy Shepherd told BBC News: \"Glacier melting accounts for a quarter of Earth's ice loss over the satellite era, and the changes taking place are disrupting water supplies for billions of people downstream - especially in years of drought when meltwater becomes a critical source. \n\"Although the rate of glacier melting has increased steadily, the pace has been dwarfed by the accelerating ice losses from Antarctica and Greenland, and they remain our primary concern for future sea-level rise.\""

      "text": "Arlene Foster has announced her resignation as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and as NI first minister after an internal revolt.\nMrs Foster, 50, said she would step down as DUP leader on 28 May and as first minister at the end of June.\nMore than 20 DUP NI Assembly members and four MPs signed a letter voicing no-confidence in the leadership.\nMrs Foster said it had been the privilege of her life to serve the people of Northern Ireland.  \nShe became leader of the party in December 2015 and, the following month as leader of Stormont's largest party, she was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland.\nShe was the first woman and the youngest person to hold both jobs.\nMrs Foster said it had been the privilege of her life to \"serve the people of Northern Ireland as their first minister and to represent my home constituency of Fermanagh/South Tyrone\".\n\"My election as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party broke a glass ceiling and I am glad to have inspired other women to enter politics and spurred them on to take up elected office,\" Mrs Foster said. \n\"I understand the misogynistic criticisms that female public figures have to take and sadly it's the same for all women in public life.\n\"I want to encourage you to keep going and don't let the online lynch mobs get you down.\"\nIt is understood there is majority support among the party's Stormont and Westminster ranks - about 80% -  for a change in leadership.\nIt is believed 22 of the DUP's 27 MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) and four MPs signed a letter of no confidence in Mrs Foster and the party leadership. \nOnly a small number of the DUP membership - MLAs and MPs - will get to vote in a leadership contest.\nIf there is a leadership contest, it will be the first in the DUP's 50-year history. \nMrs Foster said it was important to give space over the coming weeks for the party officers to make arrangements for the election of a new leader.\nMrs Foster has endured a turbulent time as DUP leader and the fall-out from Brexit - which the party supported - has put particular pressure on the party's top brass as it faces having to weather the storm caused by the Northern Ireland Protocol, which imposed a border down the Irish Sea. \nIt has also been suggested recent changes to NI's abortion laws and the commitment to implement an Irish language act were causing concerns with some elected DUP representatives ahead of next year's assembly election. \nThis was inevitable. It was just a question of time. \nWith those numbers against her, there was no way Arlene Foster could hang on. \nShe did not want to go, and if there was a way she could have stayed, she would have stayed. \nBut I imagine she is pretty sad tonight. I know Arlene Foster well. She loved being party leader, she loved being first minister. It's been bruising at times, it's been tough. \nThe DUP, at the minute, looks like a very difficult party to lead. \nWhoever takes over has a Herculean task to get things back on track.\nMrs Foster said she was \"the first to recognise there have been ups and downs over the last five and a half years\" of her leadership. \n\"The 2016 assembly election result and our party's best ever Westminster result in 2017 stand out among the high points when the electorate sent a clear message that they wanted to keep Northern Ireland moving forward,\" she said. \nMrs Foster added that as she prepared to \"depart the political stage\", Northern Ireland would only prosper if built on the \"foundations of successful and durable devolution\".\nIn a social media post, Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked Arlene Foster for her \"dedication to the people of Northern Ireland\" and said he hoped she stayed in public service \"for years to come\".\nIn November 2018, Mr Johnson gave the keynote speech at the DUP's annual conference, in which he said the UK must \"junk the backstop\", referring to efforts in the Brexit negotiations to avoid a hard Irish border.\nThis was met with rapturous applause, however, relations would later sour between Mr Johnson and Mrs Foster after he became prime minister when the Brexit deal imposed checks and restrictions to Irish Sea trade.\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis also paid tribute to Mrs Foster as a \"truly dedicated public servant\" and said young women in particular would be inspired by her example to follow a path into politics.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - the joint head of the Northern Ireland government along with Mrs Foster - said the incoming DUP leader should recognise that the political landscape across the island had changed.\n\"The broad community are impatient for social reform and political change which reflects a modern and progressive society where everyone can feel that they belong on an equal basis,\" she said. \nMs O'Neill said she and Mrs Foster had a decent if challenging relationship. She said they had worked well together through the Covid pandemic.\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney tweeted his best wishes to Mrs Foster.\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood also extended his best wishes to the outgoing first minister. \n\"We disagree on almost everything but she has clearly been a committed servant to her party for a long time,\" he said. \nUlster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said her departure demonstrated how difficult a life in politics could be. \nHe said there was now a place for a \"progressive and modern approach to unionism\".\nTraditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said it was a difficult day for Mrs Foster, adding he had found her \"straightforward\" in his dealings with her. \nMrs Foster was elected as the first female leader of the DUP in December 2015, taking over from Peter Robinson. She was the only candidate. \nHer time at the helm has been seen many challenges, having faced Brexit, a botched green energy scandal which subsequently led to the collapse of Stormont for three years and Covid-19.\nThe aftermath of Brexit has also caused friction both internally and between the party and some of its core voters who are unhappy at the deal which led to the Irish Sea border.\nThe DUP has argued that it has never supported the Northern Ireland protocol and has actively tried to have it overthrown.\nIt was not just MLAs and MPs that voiced their discontent in Mrs Foster. Letters from a number of party councillors were also written, calling for Mrs Foster and deputy leader Lord Dodds to resign. \nA number of issues of concern were listed, ranging from the NI Protocol, abortion legislation, same sex marriage, policing and the recent gay conversion debate at Stormont. \nPossible contenders to replace Mrs Foster include NI Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson. \nThere has been speculation of a split role, with one person for first minister and then a party leader at Westminster.\nMr Poots tweeted that he wanted to thank Mrs Foster for her \"service, sacrifice and commitment to the DUP and country\".\nGavin Robinson thanked Mrs Foster for her \"dedicated service to Northern Ireland\" and said there would be \"more to say about what lies ahead in the days to come\".\nDUP rules say a leadership election should be called by 30 April. \nNormally this is simply a formality and the existing leader continues in their role, but other candidates are free to challenge them.\nOnly a small number of party members are eligible to vote in such a contest - MPs and NI Assembly members (MLAs). There are 27 MLAs that hold the party whip - including Mrs Foster - and eight MPs.\nParty rules currently state the leader of the party must be an MLA, but there has been talk of changing this rule to allow an MP to hold the role.\nThe role of first minister is separate, but as the largest party from the largest grouping (unionism) in the assembly, the DUP is entitled to nominate someone to hold the post of first minister.\nOnce Mrs Foster steps down as first minister, the DUP would then be asked to nominate a replacement within seven days and a vote would be held in the assembly.\nIf a replacement is not nominated, then the Northern Ireland secretary is obliged to call an assembly election. \nThe New Decade, New Approach deal, which was signed in January 2020 and restored the NI Assembly after a three-year hiatus, included a commitment to extend the time to appoint a new first or deputy first minister after a resignation from seven days to six weeks.\nHowever, this has not yet been legislated for.\nA UK government spokesperson told the BBC that \"good progress\" was being made with the legislation and it would be brought forward during the second parliamentary session."

He knew the politics of the NHS inside out.\nHis understanding of the workings of Whitehall were useful in negotiating long-term NHS financial settlements with successive chancellors. He called for more joined-up working between councils running social care and their local NHS counterparts, which has resulted in the creation of so-called integrated care systems in England. \nMuch of the credit for the rollout of the vaccination programme in England must go to Sir Simon and NHS colleagues - his departure at the end of the July, as it happens, is the time by which the government has said all adults in the UK will have been offered a first dose.\nNHS staff have also administered more than 10 million second doses, which give people maximum protection against becoming ill with Covid.\nAcross the four nations of the UK, more than half the adult population - 34 million people - have received a first dose.\nSir Simon first joined the NHS in 1988 through its graduate management programme before working in international health care, frontline NHS services and at 10 Downing Street, before becoming chief executive of NHS England in 2014.\nHe was knighted in 2020 for services to health and the NHS, and will now join the House of Lords.\nNHS England said a successor would be appointed before Sir Simon steps down on 31 July."

      "text": "I've had both doses of a Covid vaccine and if you've had both doses too then what would be the risk if we met indoors?\nClearly, it would be completely against the rules in the UK for next few weeks. \nHowever, England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said such a gathering would be \"incredibly safe\".\nAnd in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control has outlined a significant relaxing of the rules for people who have been fully vaccinated, which includes meeting others indoors. \nSo what are the risks and why aren't indoor meetings already back on the menu?\nThree things combine to make it theoretically safe, if not completely free of risk:\nThe number of people testing positive in the UK is about 97% lower than the peak in January. \nStudies have shown the risk of being infected falls by about two-thirds after just one dose of either the Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. Two doses of Pfizer leads to a 90% reduction, although there is still not enough data on for AstraZeneca. \nThen a study by Public Health England showed people who had one dose of vaccine were up to half as likely to pass on the virus, even if they did catch it. A second dose is expected to lead to an even greater reduction.\nKing's College London researchers, working on the Zoe Covid Study app, estimate the risk of catching Covid tomorrow is:\nProf Van-Tam said: \"If two people who both had two doses of vaccine, and have both served at least 14 days after their second dose, then I would be highly confident scientifically that if they were reputable vaccines then indeed it would be incredibly safe for those two people to meet.\"\nHowever, Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said that was true because the main variant of the virus in the UK was B117 (the one that was first detected in Kent) and that could change. \n\"The issue is variants with escape mutations that are less affected by the vaccine, and we haven't come to clear understanding of what those risks are,\" he said.\nAt the moment, indoor meet-ups are not back on the cards until at least 3 May in Wales, 17 May in England and Scotland and 24 May in Northern Ireland.  \nProf Van-Tam said: \"It is going to be frustrating at times for people, particularly those who've had their two doses, but we just need to make sure we don't have to go backwards again on any of this and just hold the line a teeny bit longer.\"\nTo allow such greater mixing after vaccination would introduce new issues around fairness, as well as how to police different rules for people who may all live in the same household.  \nAnd while the vaccination programme is continuing to motor on, only one in four adults has had both doses. Health secretary Matt Hancock said the plan was to \"move together\".\nDr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said: \"We are trying to say that this is about the population as a whole rather than the individuals, those privileged individuals who have had two doses, being somehow able to do things that other people cannot.\"\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "A senior judge has ruled it is lawful for carers in specific circumstances to help clients find and pay for sex. \nThe ruling found it would be wrong to stop them helping a 27-year-old man with mental disabilities fulfilling a natural desire. \nThe landmark ruling could have major implications for others.\nMinisters have been given permission to appeal the judgment because of its implications for policies on combating prostitution. \nThe Court of Protection, which made the ruling, is dedicated to taking decisions for people who lack the mental capacity to live independent and safe lives. \nThe young man at the centre of the case, known only as C, is fit and healthy but lives with carers because he needs daily help with many parts of his life. \nHe has autism and a genetic disorder - but Mr Justice Hayden said that after speaking to C, he found that he was happy and well-supported. \nThe court heard that C knew he would probably never find a girlfriend but he nevertheless wanted to experience sex - and so he had asked his carers if they could find him a sex worker who would be paid for their services. \nThat request led to a hearing at the Court of Protection because it was not clear to C's carers whether they would act illegally if they agreed to help. \nUnder England's complex prostitution laws, paying for sex is a not a crime - but actions that encourage its arrangement are. \nC's carers also feared they could be jailed for up to 10 years for inciting a vulnerable person into a sexual relationship. \nIn a landmark judgment, Mr Justice Hayden ruled that the aim of sexual offences laws was to prevent abuse, rather than stand in the way of C's request. \nIf the law banned the carers from helping C, that would be discrimination because anyone else without his condition could lawfully pay for sex. \n\"It is important to recognise that those with mental health disorders have, in the past, effectively been prevented, by the law, from engaging in sexual relations,\" said the judge. \n\"It is no longer the objective of the law to prevent people with mental disorders from having sexual relationships, rather it is to criminalise the exploitation and abuse of such adults by those with whom they are in a relationship of trust.\"\nThe judge said that a second legal question - whether a paid sexual relationship would genuinely be in C's best interests - could only be considered once a specific plan had been devised. \nLawyers for Justice Secretary Robert Buckland are now appealing the ruling. They had argued that granting permission to the carers to help C would undermine attempts to reduce prostitution by using the state's care services to facilitate it. \nBut Mr Justice Hayden said the government's objective was \"logically unsustainable\". \n\"While it is entirely understandable that [secretary of state] would not wish to be seen to act in a way which might be perceived as encouraging prostitution, the fact remains that the act is legal. \n\"The secretary of state may not obstruct those who wish to participate in lawful transactions nor, logically, those who wish to help them be they carers or otherwise.\""

      "tags": "Oxford,Blindness and visual-impairment",
      "text": "\"Last year, for a lot of people was a dark and miserable year, but for me it was probably easily the best year of my life.\"\nJake Ternent has been gradually losing his central vision since birth, because of a rare inherited genetic eye condition.  \nAnd, despite the pandemic, 2020 was a landmark year for the 24-year-old, from County Durham, who became the first person in the UK to receive a revolutionary new gene therapy on the NHS.\n\"It was science fiction, about a year-and a half ago, to think that my eyesight could improve at all,\" Jake told the BBC.\nHis condition - leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) - is caused by having two faulty copies of a gene called RPE65, which is essential for maintaining healthy photoreceptor cells in the retina.\nIn 2019 the NHS agreed to fund the treatment, Luxturna, the first in a new generation of gene therapies for conditions causing blindness. It costs about \u00a3600,000 per patient to treat both eyes, though the NHS has agreed a confidential discount with the makers Novartis.\nAbout 100 people in the UK are likely to be eligible for the gene therapy, which is being carried out at four hospitals in England. \nJake underwent the procedure, which is intended to halt further sight loss, at London's Moorfields Eye Hospital in January last year.\nJake says that not only has it stabilised the sight in his right eye, it also appears to have reversed some of the decline in vision he has experienced in recent years. \n\"Just being able to see facial features on my own face is something that I haven't been able to do for years,\" he explains.\nJake recently had the gene therapy on his left eye, and will need to wait a couple of months to see if this further improves his vision.  \nA passionate football fan, he can now follow matches on television, and make out the ball as it is passed from player to player.\nHe says: \"It is something quite small for a regular-sighted person but, if you can't see who's got the ball, it takes you out of the game.\"\nJake's mum Dianne says she has seen him become more independent since the procedure.\n\"He feels he has the confidence to do a little bit more now, whereas he just wouldn't attempt many things before the operations.\"    \nThe injection delivers working copies of a faulty gene, RPE65, into the retina at the back of the eye. \nThe DNA is encased in a harmless virus which breaks into the retinal cells. \nOnce inside the nucleus, the replacement gene kick-starts production of the RPE65 protein essential for healthy vision.\nProf James Bainbridge, Jake's surgeon at Moorfields, says the results from the first patients are encouraging.\n\"It's fantastic to see these people reporting improvements even weeks after the surgery. It is making a real difference to their lives, and the hope is that these benefits will last for many years or even their lifetime.\"\nAnd he says it offers potential for other conditions.\n\"Until quite recently we've had very little to offer people with inherited blindness, but this is really transformational. It provides an opportunity to provide hope for people not only with this specific condition, but people with other similar disorders, that they can protect their sight in the long term.\n\"If the treatment can arrest the decline, that's profound.\"\nMatthew Wood, 48, has the same retinal condition and has also been slowly losing his sight since childhood. He lost his central vision around 10 years ago, and says it's had a severe impact on his daily life.\n\"Through all the years that I was growing up I was told there was no treatment and no hope to impact the cause of the disease,\" he said.\nSince receiving the gene therapy last year at Oxford Eye Hospital he has noticed some subtle, but welcome, changes in his vision.\n\"I think there is an improvement. Today, coming into this park, I noticed that there are railings above the entrance to the gate. I've been here many times but never been able to see them before.\"\nHis wife Yvonne has also noticed she doesn't have to help Matthew as much.\n\"He doesn't have to ask me to help with every little thing any more, such as the setting on the washing machine or coffee maker; everyday things that people take for granted, Matthew can now do himself.\" \nHis second gene therapy procedure is due to take place in May, and Matthew hopes it will prevent any further loss of sight.\n\"If it puts off another decline, that's going to be amazing.\"\nIn all, about a dozen people in the UK have received the gene therapy - including several children, who stand to benefit most, as they can be treated before permanent damage is done. \nRobert Henderson, a child sight specialist at Great Ormond Street Hospital, said:  \"My hope is that if we can diagnose and treat these children at a really young age, we will have a far greater chance of giving them near normal vision.\" "

      "tags": "Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office,United Nations,Department for International Development,International aid,Contraception",
      "text": "The UK government has been accused of going back on its promises by cutting 85% of aid funding pledged to the United Nations global family planning programme.\nThe UN Population Fund says the UK had pledged \u00a3154m for its projects but now says it will get around \u00a323m this year.\nAdvocates for family planning say it improves the rights of women and girls around the world. \nThe government said Covid meant tough but necessary decisions were needed.\nA spokesperson for the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO) said temporary reductions in aid spending were vital as the pandemic had badly affected public finances.\nThe government announced last year it would cut UK aid spending from 0.7% of national income to 0.5% - which amounts to a reduction of more than \u00a34bn. It has yet to confirm which programmes will be affected.\nSome MPs defended the cuts at the time as being backed by the public, with some politicians arguing that domestic spending should come first during the pandemic.\nFamily planning includes the provision of contraceptives and maternal health care for millions of women in some of the world's poorest countries.\nThe UN Population Fund - known as UNFPA - said the UK decision would be \"devastating for women and girls and their families across the world\". \nUNFPA executive director Dr Natalia Kanem said it \"deeply regrets the decision of our longstanding partner and advocate to step away from its commitments at a time when inequalities are deepening and international solidarity is needed more than ever\".\nShe estimated the \u00a3130m lost would have helped prevent about 250,000 maternal and child deaths, 14.6 million unintended pregnancies and 4.3 million unsafe abortions. \nMSI Reproductive Choices, an organisation that provides contraception and safe abortion services around the world, is set to be affected by the cuts. In 2020 it received an estimated $8.5m (\u00a36m) worth of commodities from the UNFPA.\n\"Over the last 10 years, we have seen the difference that the UK's leadership on this issue has made to millions of women around the world. The cuts will do untold harm to the progress made on preventing women dying from pregnancy related causes and jeopardise the government's commitments on girls' education and increasing resilience to the climate crisis,\" CEO Simon Cooke said. \nBekky Ashmore, an adviser with the charity Plan International UK, said the cuts would \"devastate the lives of so many women and girls, often in the poorest and most marginalised communities around the world\".\nManuelle Hurwitz, from the International Planned Parenthood Federation, said the cuts were \"shameful\".\n\"Globally, 217 million women want to avoid pregnancy but do not have access to modern contraceptives. With the funding withdrawal, this number will undoubtedly increase,\" she said, adding that the cuts would also force more girls out of school and contribute to an increase in maternal deaths and unsafe abortions. \nMinisters have previously said the UK was \"world-leading\" and \"at the forefront of global efforts to promote sexual and reproductive health and rights for women and girls living in the world's poorest countries\".\nThe former Department for International Development - which became part of an enlarged Foreign Office last year - described family planning projects as helping to break the \"cycle of poverty\" for many women.\nAnnouncing a five-year funding plan worth \u00a3600m in 2019, former International Development Secretary Alok Sharma said the package would \"help give millions of women and girls control over their bodies, so they can choose if, when and how many children they want\".\n\"That is a basic right that every woman and girl deserves,\" he said.\nFormer international development minister Baroness Sugg, who resigned last year over the aid cuts, told the BBC that reducing support for family planning would \"mean that women in 40 of the world's poorest countries will not have access to the voluntary contraception that will prevent millions of unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions\".\nTory MP Caroline Nokes, who chairs the Women's and Equalities select committee, said the cuts were \"really regressive\" and \"a big mistake\".\nShe told the BBC News Channel the UK needed to maintain its commitment to the poorest and \"shouldn't be balancing our books on their backs\", adding that MPs did not get to vote on the changes to the aid budget.\nThe Labour MP Sarah Champion, who chairs the International Development select committee, said she was \"appalled and ashamed\", describing the decision as \"incredibly short sighted\".\nAn FCDO spokesperson said: \"The UK is a world leader on international development. In 2020 we were the third biggest aid donor globally, spending \u00a314.5bn.\n\"The seismic impact of the pandemic on the UK economy has forced us to take tough but necessary decisions, including temporarily reducing the overall amount we spend on aid. We will still spend more than \u00a310bn this year to fight poverty, tackle climate change and improve global health.\n\"We are working through what this means for individual programmes. Decisions will be announced in due course.\"\nAsked about the cuts, the prime minister said the government had always been clear that it intended to return to spending 0.7% of national income on aid when it was \"fiscally prudent to do so\".\nEarlier this week, the BBC obtained an internal FCDO memo that said funding for global water, sanitation and hygiene bilateral projects would be cut by more than 80%, prompting criticism from a leading charity."

      "tags": "Snowdon",
      "text": "Wales' highest mountain could only be called by its Welsh name under plans being considered by park authorities.\nIt follows a motion brought by a Gwynedd county councillor that Snowdonia National Park authorities be asked to only refer to Snowdon as Yr Wyddfa, and Snowdonia as Eryri.\nThe mountain in Snowdonia National Park stands at 3,560ft (1,085m) and attracts about 400,000 walkers a year.\nBut the park authority said a task group would consider the proposal.\nSnowdonia National Park Authority (SNPA) said the motion was not discussed at a meeting on Wednesday as it would be considered by its task group, set up to adapt guidelines on the use of Welsh place names. \nThe Welsh name for Snowdon, Yr Wyddfa, means grave and is pronounced like \"er with-va\".\nThe story goes in a legend that the giant Rhita Gawr, the king of Wales, was buried under a cairn of stones on the summit of the mountain, following a battle with King Arthur.\nIt is said that the giant defeated 30 kings of Britain, taking their beards to create a cloak of the beards, reaching from his shoulder to the floor.\nMeanwhile, Eryri, the Welsh name for Snowdonia, is believed to originate from the Latin: oriri (to rise) and was first documented in the 9th Century, despite it long being thought to refer to the Welsh name for eagle - Eryr, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nThe English names for Snowdonia and Snowdon are thought to derive from the Saxon: snow dune, meaning snow hill.\nHill expert Myrddyn Phillips said, according to Hywel Wyn Owen and Richard Morgan's Dictionary of the Place-Names of Wales, the name Snowdon is documented as far back as far 1095, while the first known reference to Yr Wyddfa was in 1284.\nThe highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest, is not commonly known by its Tibetan name Chomolungma, meaning goddess mother of the world.\nMany Sherpas, a community indigenous to the Himalayan region, believe that the summit of Chomolungma is home to the Buddhist goddess Miyolangsangma.\nIts English name comes from Colonel Sir George Everest, who was born in Crickhowell, Powys, in 1790, who was a Surveyor General of India.\nMeanwhile, Australia's giant monolith Ayers Rock was renamed Uluru in 1993, switching from its colonial namesake, former South Australian Premier Sir Henry Ayers, to the language of its traditional owners, the Anangu people.\nIn 2002, that dual name was officially reversed, making it Uluru/Ayers Rock. Almost all Australians now refer to it as Uluru.\nCouncillor John Pughe Roberts, who put forward the motion for Snowdon and Snowdonia, said many members were \"complaining that people are changing house names, rock names, renaming the mountains\".\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme, Mr Roberts, who represents Corris Mawddwy in Gwynedd, said: \"In this area, for example Bwlch y Groes has become Hellfire Pass, Dol Hir is known as Longmeadow and this is happening in many areas.\"\nAfter learning of the decision that his motion was to be considered by the park authority's task group, he told the Local Democracy Reporting Service he was \"naturally disappointed\".\n\"There's much talk of people wrongly changing Welsh house names into English and long established place names being eradicated, but the public sector has a duty to lead the way here rather than insisting on this bureaucracy of kicking the can down the road to another committee,\" he said.\nSNPA chairman Wyn Ellis Jones said: \"Authority members decided that there was no need to consider the motion today as a Welsh place names task and finish group has already been appointed. \n\"This follows previous consideration by the members in a working group which recommended to establish and adopt guidelines to guide the use of place names by the SNPA.\"\nHe also said authority members would consider these issues once the task group was able to make recommendations. \n\"The authority is committed to protect and promote the use of native place names for everyday use and future generations,\" he added."
