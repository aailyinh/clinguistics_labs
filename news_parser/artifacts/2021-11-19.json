      "title": "Farm laws: India PM Narendra Modi repeals controversial reforms",
      "tags": "Indian farmers protest 2020,Asia,Narendra Modi,India",
      "text": "Indian PM Narendra Modi has announced the repeal of three controversial farm laws after a year of protests.\nThousands of farmers had camped at Delhi's borders since last November and dozens died from heat, cold and Covid.\nFarmers say the laws will allow the entry of private players in farming and that will hurt their income.\nFriday's surprise announcement marks a major U-turn as the government had not taken any initiative to talk to farmers in recent months.\nAnd Mr Modi's ministers have been steadfastly insisting that the laws were good for farmers and there was no question of taking them back.\nFarm unions are seeing this as a huge victory. But experts say the upcoming state elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh - both have a huge base of farmers - may have forced the decision. \nThe announcement on Friday morning came on a day Sikhs - the dominant community in Punjab - are celebrating the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. \nIn his nationally-televised address, Mr Modi said the farm laws were meant to strengthen the small farmers. \"But despite several attempts to explain the benefits to the farmers, we have failed. On the occasion of Guru Purab, the government has decided to repeal the three farm laws,\" he added.\nTaken together, they loosened rules around sale, pricing and storage of farm produce - rules that have protected India's farmers from the free market for decades. \nOne of the biggest changes was that farmers were allowed to sell their produce at a market price directly to private players - agricultural businesses, supermarket chains and online grocers. Most Indian farmers currently sell the majority of their produce at government-controlled wholesale markets or mandis at assured floor prices (also known as minimum support price or MSP). \nThe laws allowed private buyers to hoard food like rice, wheat and pulses for future sales, which only government-authorised agents could do earlier.\nThe reforms, at least on paper, gave farmers the option of selling outside of this so-called \"mandi system\". But the protesters said the laws would weaken the farmers and allow private players to dictate prices and control their fate. They said the MSP was keeping many farmers going and without it, many of them will struggle to survive. \nThey said India's stringent laws around the sale of agricultural produce and high subsidies had protected farmers from market forces for decades and there was no need to change that.\nBut the government argued that it was time to make farming profitable for even small farmers and the new laws were going to achieve that. \nFarmers in Punjab and Haryana are celebrating the news, raising flags of victory and distributing sweets. But they say the fight is not over. \n\"We have no faith in a verbal promise. Unless we see it in writing that the laws have actually been repealed, we will stay here,\" Raj Singh Chaudhary, a 99-year-old protester, told the BBC's Salman Ravi. \nMr Chaudhary is among hundreds of farmers who have been striking at the Delhi-Ghazipur border for a year. \nHis view was echoed by Rakesh Tikait, a prominent farmer leader who said they would call off the protest only after the laws were repealed in the winter session of parliament.\nAnother farmer leader said they needed additional promises from the government around assured prices for their crops to end their protest. \nThe announcement has stunned political observers as well as those who both support and oppose the laws - many tweeted saying it was a huge victory for the farmers and a \"major climbdown\" for Mr Modi. \nBut some farm leaders and economists who saw merit in the laws have expressed disappointment over their repeal.  Anil Ghanwat, head of a farmers' union in western India, said it was an \"unfortunate\" decision driven by political considerations. \nOpposition parties welcomed the decision, with Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi calling it \"a win against injustice\". And West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, took to social media to praise farmers and congratulate them. \nBJP members said the decision to repeal the laws had nothing to do with the polls and the decision was taken to end the protest. They did not say if there were plans to bring back the laws in another form later. \nNarendra Modi's decision to repeal the contentious farm laws is, at once, a strategic and political move and a belated admission of the government's haste and high-handedness. \nThe laws had whipped up an unprecedented firestorm of protests in the states of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh and posed a real challenge to Mr Modi. They had mobilised farmers and civil society in Sikh-majority Punjab and spread to parts of Uttar Pradesh, states which will see key elections early next year.\nBy repealing the laws, Mr Modi hopes to regain the confidence of the farmers in general and Sikhs in particular. It would also boost the BJP's chances in the polls. \nClick here to read the full analysis. \nThe Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella group of some 40 farmers' unions, had refused to back down despite appeals from the government to end their protest. \nFarmers continued to block motorways to Delhi through harsh winter and summer months and even through deadly Covid waves. They called for strikes across the country and dozens of them even died due to cold, heat and Covid.\nThe government initially engaged with them and offered to put the laws in abeyance for two years. But after farmers rejected their overtures, the authorities retreated, preferring to go with the wait-and-watch attitude. \nBut two things changed in the last few months.\nFirst, the son of a federal minister allegedly drove his car into a group of protesting farmers in Lakhimpur in Uttar Pradesh in early October. He denied the allegation, but was arrested. Eight people, including four farmers and a journalist, were killed in the incident which sparked outrage across the country and put the government on the back foot. \nSecond, PM Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is up against strong regional parties in the upcoming elections in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand and the government knows that angry farmers would hurt the BJP's chances of winning the crucial polls.

      "text": "Germany is set to introduce tighter curbs on people who have not been vaccinated against Covid-19, as cases in the country hit a record high.\nRestrictions for unvaccinated people will be introduced in areas where hospital admissions exceed a set threshold, Chancellor Angela Merkel and leaders of Germany's 16 states agreed. \nUnder the rules, the unvaccinated will be excluded from certain venues. \nMrs Merkel described the situation with Covid in the country as \"dramatic\". \n\"We need to quickly put a brake on the exponential rise\" in cases and intensive care unit occupancy, she said. \nThe number of daily cases in Germany rose sharply on Thursday to more than 65,000 - by far the highest figure since the pandemic began. \nThe new rules, agreed in a crisis meeting, mean that in areas with a hospitalisation rate of more than three Covid patients per 100,000 people over the past seven days, only the vaccinated and those who have recovered from the virus will be allowed to access to public spaces like sporting events, cultural shows and restaurants.\nThe majority of the country's states currently exceed this threshold.\nAreas with a hospitalisation rate of more than six will have to introduce a \"2G plus\" rule, requiring people to be tested as well as vaccinated, and regions with a rate of more than nine will have to introduce further measures, like restrictions on contact. \nMrs Merkel and the other leaders also agreed on Thursday that healthcare and care home employees must be vaccinated to control the spread of the virus. \nTheir announcement came after Germany's lower house of parliament voted in favour of a new set of Covid measures, including limiting access to public transport and the workplace to only people who have been vaccinated or tested.\nThese measures still need to be agreed by parliament's upper house on Friday, and some conservative politicians have threatened to block the bill.\nThe states of Saxony and Bavaria have already imposed so-called 2G rules placing restrictions on unvaccinated people in response to a surge in cases. \nGermany is not the first European country to introduce restrictions on people who have not been vaccinated against Covid.\nBoth the Czech Republic and Slovakia on Thursday announced tighter restrictions for unvaccinated people, in a bid to encourage vaccine uptake.\nUnder the rules approved by the Czech government, only those who are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid in the past six months will be allowed enter restaurants, attend certain events and use various other services from Monday.\nSlovakia's Prime Minister Eduard Heger described new measures there as a \"lockdown for the unvaccinated\".\nAustria earlier this week placed about two million people who have not been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 into lockdown. It means they are only allowed to leave home for limited reasons, like working or buying food. \n\"We are not taking this step lightly, but unfortunately it is necessary,\" Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said.\nTwo provinces in Austria - Upper Austria and Salzburg - will go into full lockdown from Monday, media reports say. \nOverall, Europe has again become the area most seriously affected by the pandemic. \nThe World Health Organization warned on Thursday that there will be a \"hard winter ahead\" for the region.

      "tags": "Mafia,New Jersey",
      "text": "FBI agents have searched a plot of land in the US state of New Jersey after a deathbed confession renewed hope of solving union boss Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance 50 years ago. \nFor decades, Hoffa was one of America's most powerful labour organisers.\nBut in 1975 he suddenly disappeared, and his body has never been recovered. \nInvestigators recently received a tip that a former worker on a landfill site in Jersey City had said that his father told him he had buried Hoffa's body. \nHis disappearance had long been linked with the American Mafia, with whom Hoffa had a turbulent relationship. \nAccording to the New York Times, landfill worker Frank Cappola, who died in March 2020, told a friend that his father had confessed to him that he had been ordered by a gang of unidentified men to bury Hoffa's body underground in a steel drum.\nAgents bearing search warrants arrived at a former landfill site and conducted a survey on 25 and 26 October. A spokesperson for the FBI told the newspaper that data was currently being analysed. \nHoffa was born in the tiny city of Brazil, Indiana in February 1913, and by 1957 had become one of the most powerful union leaders in the country after taking charge of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. \nThroughout his time in charge of the union, Hoffa was frequently accused of association with the American mafia and organised crime. \nRobert Kennedy, as attorney general under his brother President John F. Kennedy, tried to convict him for a variety of offences during his time in office and formed a \"Get Hoffa\" unit of prosecutors to take action against his activities. \nKennedy's efforts finally paid off when Hoffa was convicted of jury tampering in 1967, but he was later released by President Nixon in 1971 as part of a deal that forced him to step down from the teamsters leadership. \nBy summer 1975, Hoffa had lost his once considerable power and his friendship with the New Jersey Mafia boss Anthony Provenzano, nicknamed \"Tony Pro\", had soured badly. \nHe disappeared on 30 July 1975 after travelling to Michigan to meet the mobster. Ever since, his story - told in the 2019 film the Irishman - has fascinated investigators. \nThere have been several failed searches for Hoffa's body over the years. In Michigan, where Hoffa was last seen, investigators have searched many sites, from a farm to beneath a swimming pool. \nAnd in New Jersey, an urban legend has long claimed that Hoffa's remains were buried under the old New York Giants football stadium.

      "tags": "Diversity,Social media,Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport,Nadine Dorries,Social media campaign,Social media regulation debate,Liverpool",
      "text": "Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has said people have become afraid to say what they think for fear of being \"cancelled\", and that left-wing activists have \"hijacked\" social media.\nIn her first TV interview since taking the job, she said she does not plan \"to charge out on a culture war battle\".\nShe criticised online campaigners for frightening young people \"who actually do want to engage\" in serious debate.\nShe also described negative reaction to her new role as \"quite misogynistic\".\nAfter her appointment in September, comedian Dom Joly said it was \"like the result of some drunk bet\" while fellow comic Mark Thomas said Dorries, who is also a successful author, had \"written more books\" than she had read.\n\"People were making these comments for political attack and nothing else,\" she told BBC culture editor Katie Razzall. \"I just found them thoroughly unpleasant.\"\nAs culture secretary, her in-tray includes deciding whether to privatise Channel 4, introducing a law protecting young people from harms online and setting the BBC's funding by deciding the level of the licence fee until 2027.\nDorries has previously said the corporation needs \"real change\".\nShe told Razzall the BBC was \"the best of British\", but how it competes with streaming giants and how it is funded after 2027 will be \"discussions for the future\".\nShe also welcomed director general Tim Davie's recent 10-point plan to deal with \"issues like a lack of impartiality\".\n\"I think they've made a good attempt to start dealing with some of these issues,\" she said.\nSince this interview with Dorries took place, she has defended deleting a tweet in response to the BBC's Political Editor, Laura Kuenssberg, which the culture secretary later denied was a \"rebuke\" for reporting criticism of the prime minister from an unnamed Conservative MP.\nOn Friday, Dorries also announced a further \u00a3107m as part of the Culture Recovery Fund to help almost 1,000 arts and heritage organisations continue their recovery from the pandemic.\nLast month, The Observer described Dorries as the \"minister for culture wars\".\nBut in the interview, Dorries said that was \"what other people say about me, not what I say\".\nShe explained: \"Sometimes I think we just need to tone down the condemnation and the judgement, and evaluate and engage a little bit more than we do. I think social media probably contributes a lot to this.\n\"People are afraid because of the amplification in the echo chambers of social media.\"\nThe culture secretary has been outspoken on social media herself in the past,and her remarks got short shrift from those who pointed to her own record.\nLBC presenter James O'Brien, who has previously exchanged insults with Dorries in the press and on Twitter, said on Friday that she \"is part of the problem of online abuse\".\nFormer Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood wrote that the culture secretary \"is gaslighting us\". Gaslighting refers to psychological manipulation to make someone question what's true or real.\nDorries told the BBC her own strident posts are aimed at campaigners \"on the left who have hijacked that space\" rather than people who \"do want to talk about these issues seriously\".\nAs a backbencher in 2017, Dorries famously wrote on Twitter that \"left-wing snowflakes are killing comedy\".\nShe stood by that comment, noting that some comedians had recently expressed concerns that they could no longer make light of certain subjects. \"I just said it first,\" she told the BBC.\nShe also said she doesn't agree with removing statues and other memorials connected to the slave trade and other aspects of history, such as the Bank of England's removal of paintings and busts of past governors and directors.\n\"You can't, with this whole cancel culture, wipe it all out like it didn't happen and pretend it didn't exist,\" she said. \"You can't wipe away our history, either the good or the bad.\"\nThe bank said in response it would feature the portraits in a future Bank of England exhibition \"in their appropriate context\". It added it has appointed a researcher to work in its museum to \"examine in detail the bank's historic links to the transatlantic slave trade\".\nDorries grew up in one of the poorest parts of Liverpool, and said her priority is to help young people from backgrounds like hers to get involved in arts, culture and sport.\n\"Those people in those backgrounds are of every colour and every sexuality, but are we looking after everybody when we talk about diversity?\" she said.\nHer reputation precedes her - as a politician who shoots from the hip, who has previously got into fairly heated Twitter rows with detractors, and who has been dubbed in some quarters the \"minister for culture wars\".\nAhead of our meeting at the Young Vic theatre in London, one MP even told me to \"strap yourself in for that interview\".\nShe's a far more interesting culture secretary than many who have gone before, not least because she's sold more than two million books. She may also be right that the critical reaction to her appointment from some in the sector was sexist and snobbish.\nSome of her responses about how we all need to be kinder and listen a bit more to each other will raise eyebrows and worse. She's not known as someone who is kind to people on social media, or as someone who listens to those with different views. People are already accusing her of hypocrisy. And clearly if you blame the left, as she did in the interview, you are being political, sticking the boot in to the opposition.\nHer professed mission - to widen access to the cultural and sporting world - felt sincere. She's not the first to say it. But the difference is she speaks with authenticity as a result of her personal experiences.\nShe's levelled up personally, rewarded with a cabinet job after intense loyalty to Boris Johnson. But as the 10th culture secretary in 10 years, will she be around for long enough to make a difference?\nThe \u00a3107m Culture Recovery Fund money that was announced on Friday will help 925 theatres, museums, cinemas and other cultural venues and organisations \"through the recovery period\", Dorries said.\nThe recipients include Leeds Grand Theatre, English National Ballet and The Marlowe Theatre in Canterbury, Kent, which have all received at least \u00a31m each.\n\"Make no mistake about this. Many theatres would not be standing today if the government hadn't supported them over the last 20 months,\" she said.\nSome commercial theatre operators like Sir Cameron Mackintosh did not receive emergency funding, but those who applied opened their accounts to the Treasury, she said.\n\"You'll hear some people in the theatre sector say, 'We didn't get any of that money', but they are still standing and they are still running with plays back up, which actually is testament to the fact that they didn't need the funding, because they are still here. They have private investors.\"\nDorries is also working on the new Online Safety Bill, which will require social media platforms to remove harmful content quickly or potentially face multi-billion-pound fines or even jail time for executives. She told them to get ready.\n\"They've had notice. They've got fair warning,\" she said. \"This bill is coming. Abide by your terms and conditions now. Remove your harmful algorithms now.\""

      "text": "Facebook says it is introducing new features to give people more control over what appears in their news feeds.\nThe social network has been under intense scrutiny in recent years for how its algorithms promote content.\nNow, it says it is testing controls to \"adjust people's ranking preferences\" and customise the feed.\nThat includes, for example, increasing the number of posts from friends and family, and decreasing those from groups and pages.\nIt will also make controls that already exist \"easier to access\", it said - such as the favourites and snooze features, which largely live inside a settings sub-menu.\n\"We'll begin testing in countries around the world to a small percentage of people, gradually expanding in the coming weeks,\" Facebook said in its announcement post.\n\"This is part of our ongoing work to give people more control over [the] news feed, so they see more of what they want and less of what they don't.\"\nIt comes as Facebook and its newly-named parent company Meta are under political pressure to let users avoid its ranking systems.\nSo-called \"engagement-based ranking\" has been a repeated target of criticism in the testimony of Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who said it prioritised divisive and extreme content.\nFacebook disagrees with that, but the view has caught on among some.\nA group of US lawmakers has tabled a bill named the \"Filter Bubble Transparency Act\", which is designed to make sure that social networks give their users an option to use the sites without any kind of algorithmic interference.\nThat would bring Facebook much closer to its original version. In the early days, when Facebook was only really used by university students, it simply displayed every post from friends, with the most recent ones first.\nFacebook, for its part, believes that users do not actually want that. A recent report by the Washington Post discovered that Facebook has run at least two experiments in recent years, exploring what happens when the algorithmic feed is disabled.\nOne of those tests, the Post reported, resulted in users logging into Facebook less often, spending less time reading content, and posting less themselves.\n\"The documents suggest that Facebook's defence of algorithmic rankings stems not only from its business interests, but from a paternalistic conviction, backed by data, that its sophisticated personalisation software knows what users want better than the users themselves,\" the Post wrote.\nFacebook has added one way to access a chronological feed since March this year, although it is not an option available by default.\nOn its mobile apps, while scrolling through the news feed, an option for \"most recent\" will sometimes appear. It only works for that browsing session. The next time the app is opened, it will revert to the algorithmic feed."

      "tags": "Austria,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Days after Austria imposed a lockdown on the unvaccinated, it has announced a full national Covid-19 lockdown starting on Monday.\nChancellor Alexander Schallenberg said it would last a maximum of 20 days and there would be a legal requirement to get vaccinated from 1 February 2022.\nHe was responding to record case numbers and one of the lowest vaccination levels in Western Europe.\nMany other European countries are imposing restrictions as cases rise.\n\"We don't want a fifth wave,\" said Mr Schallenberg after meeting the governors of Austria's nine provinces at a resort in the west of the country.\nFor a long time, there had been a consensus over avoiding mandatory vaccinations, the chancellor said.  \nHowever, too many people had been incited not to get the jab, because of \"too many political forces, flimsy vaccination opponents and fake news\", he added. The measures are yet to be finalised.\nLatest figures show the incidence rate has risen to 1,049.9 cases per 100,000 people in the past week, and Health Minister Wolfgang M\u00fcckstein said imposing a lockdown was a \"last resort\". A record 15,809 cases were reported in the past 24 hours, in a population of under nine million.\nUnder the measures, Austrians will be asked to work from home, non-essential shops will close, and schools will remain open for children who require face-to-face learning. They will continue until 12 December, but will be reassessed after 10 days.\nNeighbouring Germany has seen several days of record infections this week, and Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken of \"a national emergency that requires a combined national effort\". \nGerman leaders have already agreed to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated people in areas with high hospital admissions. And parliament has backed requirements for people to show Covid passes on buses and trains, and in workplaces. \nBut now in Bavaria, which borders Austria, state premier Markus S\u00f6der has gone further, declaring  a \"de facto lockdown for the unvaccinated\". Bars and clubs will close for three weeks and all Christmas markets have been cancelled. Where weekly incidence rates top 1,000 per 100,000 people - restaurants, hotels, sport and culture will also close. \nSlovak Prime Minister Eduard Heger has already announced that a \"lockdown for the unvaccinated\" will start on Monday, and the Czech government is also limiting access to a variety of services. The Netherlands introduced a partial lockdown last weekend.\nIn the UK - where there is currently no lockdown, although masks have to be worn in some parts of the country - the incidence rate per 100,000 is 395.4 cases, officials figures show.\nAustria's is the first full lockdown imposed by an EU country this winter. \nThe Europe regional director of the World Health Organization, Hans Kluge, has warned of a hard winter ahead. He blamed insufficient vaccination coverage along with \"the easing of preventive measures and the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant\".\nRussia on Friday declared a record number of 1,254 Covid deaths in the past 24 hours, for the third day in a row. \nHungary reported its highest level of infections - with 11,289 new cases in a population of 10 million. A third booster jab will be made mandatory for health workers from Saturday, along with masks in most enclosed spaces.\nTighter restrictions also come into force in Belgium on Saturday, requiring working from home for four days a week.\nThere are only two ways for countries to slow the spread of Covid - build up enough immunity or limit contact between other people. \nThat wall of immunity - from a year of vaccination - is facing its first real test as winter rolls in across Europe.\nIt is already clear some countries - Austria being the most notable - have not vaccinated enough and feel the \"need\" to go back to restrictions that nobody \"wants\".\nBut it does not mean that every country is doomed to a winter lockdown.\nThose that have vaccinated more, given boosters to more and protected more of the vulnerable and elderly (who are the most likely to need hospital care) have the best shot at a manageable winter.\nThe impact of the UK having high levels of Covid through autumn, which will have topped up immunity levels, will be closely watched too.\nHowever, it is still only November. There are many dark months to get through before the weather improves and makes it harder for Covid to spread.\nDo you live in Europe? What are your experiences with coronavirus and vaccination?

      "text": "Covid case rates in England are now highest among children aged five to nine, latest weekly surveillance figures reveal.\nThe data, up to 14 November, shows this younger age group has overtaken older, secondary school aged children for the first time.\nIn recent months, the 10 to 19 age group maintained the highest rate of infections per 100,000 tested.\nIt is too soon to say what is behind the change and if it will continue.\nIn recent weeks, children aged 12 and over have started being offered Covid jabs.\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) report shows 723 cases recorded per 100,000 among children aged five to nine. \nThat's up week-on-week from 484.5 per 100,000. \nThe rate for 10 to 19-year-olds is 694.2, up from 571.7.\nCovid infections are lowest among the eldest in society - those aged 80-plus - with a weekly rate of 76 per 100,000. But this group has the greatest risk of getting more seriously ill with Covid if they were to catch it, particularly if they are not vaccinated. \nProf Steven Riley, from the UKHSA, said Covid rates continue to increase in those from younger age groups, and hospitalisations remain highest in people aged 85 and over. \n\"More people than ever are eligible for second and booster doses - and it is as important as ever to get vaccinated or receive a booster jab as soon as you are offered one.\n\"Socialising indoors in places with poor ventilation increases the risk of infection. Help protect yourself and loved ones by opening windows and doors to ventilate the room when meeting people inside. Wash your hands regularly and wear a mask in crowded places. If you have any Covid-19 symptoms, stay at home and get a PCR test as soon as possible,\" he advised. \nThe UK administered 384,421 doses of a booster vaccine on Wednesday, according to the latest UK government figures.\nOverall nearly 13.9m people have had a third dose of a Covid jab - about 24% of the population over 12 years old.\nMore than 50.6m people - or 88.1% of the UK population over 12 - have had one jab and more than 46m people - or 80.1% of people aged 12 and over - have had two vaccine doses. \nThe UK has reported 46,807 coronavirus cases in the last 24-hour period.\nThere were also 199 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded.\nMeanwhile, levels of influenza remain low, but people who are eligible for a flu shot are being urged to get one as a precaution.

      "text": "A group of charities and medical experts have urged the Scottish government to increase the minimum unit price (MUP) of alcohol from 50p to 65p.\nThe group argue that the positive effects of the policy will have been affected by inflation and the pandemic.\nThe policy sets a floor price for drinks depending on how many units of alcohol they contain. \nAt First Minister's Questions Nicola Sturgeon said the level of the price would be kept under review.\nAn MUP of 65p would see a cheap litre of vodka at 37.5% ABV (alcohol by volume) increase in price from at least \u00a318.75 to \u00a324.38.\nThe group calling for the change is made up of 28 organisations, including health and children's charities and a number of medical royal colleges.\nIn a letter to the Scottish government, they say inflation will have \"significantly eroded\" the effect of MUP, while the pandemic may have eliminated any health improvement in the population.\nThey argued that since the policy was introduced in 2018, Scotland has seen a reduction in alcohol consumption and decreases in hospital admissions from alcohol-related liver conditions.\nAlcohol Focus Scotland said that although there was a 10% decrease in alcohol related deaths in 2019, they rose by 17% in 2020 to their highest level in more than a decade. \nChief executive Alison Douglas blamed changing drinking habits during the pandemic for the increase. \n\"We've seen that minimum unit pricing can have a positive effect,\" she said.\n\"We need to off-set both the effects of inflation and of the pandemic, and adjust the minimum unit price to a level that will save more lives and prevent a new generation from developing an unhealthy relationship with alcohol.\n\"We urge the Scottish government to take action now and raise the minimum unit price to at least 65p.\"\nThe Scottish government committed to review the minimum unit price two years after it began, but this was delayed due to the pandemic.\nDr Alastair MacGilchrist, who is chairman of Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems (SHAAP), said Scotland could \"not afford\" to wait any longer.\nHe added: \"This support from a wide range of organisations shows that experts in public health and beyond believe increasing the minimum unit price is the right thing to do.\"\nDr MacGilchrist said he believed there had to be a \"sweet spot\" when setting the MUP for it to have the greatest impact.\nHe told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"If you set it too low it's not gong to be effective, but if you set it too high it's going to have an unfair impact on moderate drinkers.\n\"We think that to at least 65p would be the correct level just now and would certainly save lives.\"\nThe level of alcohol MUP was initially set in 2012, with the introduction of the policy delayed by a lengthy legal challenge in the years before its introduction.\nIn May a study found MUP had had a lasting impact in Scotland, and that alcohol sales had fallen by 8%.\nAccording to the research, the impact was mainly seen in households that bought the most alcohol - but the exception was in high-purchasing, low-income homes, who did not seem to change their habits.\nWales introduced the policy last March and campaigners have called for it to be implemented in England and Northern Ireland.\nThe Republic of Ireland is due to introduce its own MUP policy on 1 January 2022. \nAsked about MUP at First Minister's Questions on Thursday, Ms Sturgeon said an evaluation into pricing was \"ongoing\".\nShe said a Public Health Scotland report on the issue was due to be published in 2023 and noted any change must have a \"robust evidence base\".\nShe added the UK government's Internal Market Act was a source of \"great concern\" as it may affect the ability to adjust prices. \nA Scottish government spokesperson added: \"We continue to gather evidence and analyse the impact the policy has had since its introduction in 2018. \n\"Prior to the pandemic, we were seeing early encouraging signs of a reduction in alcohol sales and a reduction in alcohol specific deaths.\n\"The pandemic and the changed legal landscape post-Brexit are two significant events that are impacting on this work and must be factored into the analysis.\""

      "title": "Brexit: UK looks likely to trigger Article 16 - then what?",
      "tags": "Boris Johnson,European Union,Brexit",
      "text": "This has not been a good week for Boris Johnson. \nThe Conservative Party has been battered by allegations that some of its MPs are on the take. \nThe way the prime minister has reacted to the situation has been publicly criticised, and privately slammed by many on his own side. \nEven some of Boris Johnson's most stalwart backers in parts of the Conservative press have called foul. \nBut if you think this has been bumpy, it's not impossible that the government might find itself in a much more dramatic and risky situation with much further-reaching consequences for us all. \nIt sounds harmless enough: Article 16, an obscure set of three paragraphs agreed as part of the Brexit withdrawal deal between the UK and EU.\nSo first off, it's important to understand it is part and parcel of the agreement that both sides grappled to achieve, and then signed up to in October 2019. \nYou might remember that the Brexit arrangements left Northern Ireland, of course part of the UK, essentially in the EU's huge trading bloc for goods. \nThis meant that goods could go backwards and forwards over the land border on the island of Ireland without hassle. \nThat sorted out one aspect of the geographic reality - but it also meant that there would be checks and controls on goods going into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. \nFrom the off, that created an inbuilt difference between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. \nBoth sides were perfectly aware that these arrangements might be tricky in practice, so the deal included Article 16. \nThe Article gives either side the ability to cry foul and take their own \"safeguard measures\" if it's all going wrong - if trade is going haywire, or the deal is causing real suffering. \nEither the UK or the EU has the right to take its own action, after giving a month's notice. \nThat could mean, for example, the UK stopping checks on goods that are being sent across the Irish Sea, intended only for use in Northern Ireland. \nIn other words, if something's made in Bolton, but sold in Belfast, it wouldn't go through customs checks. \nBut the actions could be more dramatic, suspending more of the deal the two sides agreed, whether that's product standards, customs checks, or VAT rules. \nWorking out how far to go, and what is justified, is a hard first step. \nAs one cabinet minister told me: \"The mechanics aren't controversial, the difficult decision is how far you want to go.\" \nArticle 16 could be used to carry out a few tweaks, or to tear through the existing agreements. In turn, that would also have an impact on how the EU reacts. \nWhy though would the UK want to go down that road in any case, whether using it as a big bazooka or just trying to fiddle around with a few elements? \nOne diplomat told me that triggering Article 16 would be \"lose, lose, lose\", and could cause a \"total breakdown of trust, and a deep freeze in relations\" between the EU and the UK. \nFormer Prime Minister Sir John Major, who it's fair to say is no fan of the current occupant of Downing Street, has said it would be \"absurd\". \nThe main opposition parties would likely condemn the move. \nBut for months, the UK government has been saying the impact of the arrangements and how they are being implemented can't last, even though, as things stand, the part of the deal relating to Northern Ireland - known as the protocol - is certainly not being implemented in full. \nBut its effects have already caused lots of different concerns - whether that would be, as one source describes it, companies being \"buried under mountains of new paperwork\", warnings over shortages of medicines, difficulties moving pets around, or the issue that's taken up most column inches, the so-called \"sausage wars\" over the sale of chilled meats. \nThe UK believes the EU adopted an overly vigorous approach to pursuing the rules, when a lighter touch would do.  \nIn turn of course, the EU says the UK signed up to the deal, why are they surprised when Brussels insists its followed in full? \nAs ever in high-tension diplomatic spats like this, the situation is not binary, and both sides have reasons for frustration. \nOf course, intense politics are at play here too. \nUnionist politicians in Northern Ireland largely can't stand the protocol, and have deep concerns about being able to keep a lid on tensions. \nOne source warns \"if the government doesn't move and show a bit of teeth, things could implode\". \nThe DUP leader has even said if there isn't movement he could pull his support.\nWith an election due by May 2022, they are pushing for action as soon as possible. \nThere's political mistrust between the UK and the EU side too over Boris Johnson's original attitude to the deal, and whether he ever intended to stick to the legal promises he made. \nThat was stoked by his controversial former adviser, Dominic Cummings, who said publicly the government had always intended to \"ditch\" the bits they didn't like. \nAnother source familiar with the negotiations told me \"Article 16 was the route we thought we would go down from the beginning\", adding: \"it was always clear that unless the EU was willing to back down, we wouldn't be able to stick with it long term\".\nNow it is not exactly unusual for political deals to leave ambiguities, and some issues unresolved. \nGiven that the European Court did retain a role in supervising the protocol, that source suggests it was never likely to be \"compatible with the autonomy of the UK\".\nBut the admission that Boris Johnson's team believed there was something seriously up with the deal to start with has not exactly put the EU in the mood for compromise. \nAnd what Brussels has been willing to budge on so far has not been nearly enough to satisfy No 10.\nFor political and practical reasons therefore, it seems almost inevitable that unless the European Union changes its position in a significant way, and soon, that the UK will trigger Article 16. \nTalks are continuing, and while one source says, \"it's not definite\", they acknowledge that \"optimism has been waning\". \nIn fact, the UK has said publicly since July that the conditions for the trigger to be pulled have indeed been met. \nSince then, the UK view is clearly that \"the EU solution is just not good enough\". \nBut on the other side, there's sceptism over the UK's desire even to find a way out. Lord Frost, the PM's Brexit lieutenant, is \"in problem-finding, not problem- solving mode\", one source said. \nI'm told that diplomats were reassured by government that the action wouldn't be taken this week, after the talks between that will take place between the two sides on Friday. \nBut I'm told there have been discussions about starting the process, even early next week. \nDon't panic, this does not seem to have yet been resolved. \nSome in government are arguing for more explanation of the case to the public before drastic action is taken. \nOne insider described a \"reasonableness test\". Another said that the UK government wanted to build an \"evidence base\" to demonstrate why they felt the action had to be taken, before going public. \nSome of the smart money is on the bust-up not coming until December, with one government source suggesting on Thursday: \"We're going to see a bit more time pass before it happens.\"\nWhatever the moment, unless something very unexpected happens, or the negotiators and politicians on both sides have personality transplants, it seems like Article 16 will be introduced before too long. \nThe likely impact of the move seems less certain than whether Boris Johnson and Lord Frost take the decision. \nIt hasn't happened before, so there is no real precedent. \nAnd there are different schools of thought. First, it's important to understand that triggering Article 16 is starting a dispute process. \nIt's not one moment, but the start of many. \nOne source says some Brexiteer MPs \"think you trigger it and everyone starts singing Rule Britannia - no one is asking themselves what happens after you trigger\". \nTheoretically, the process begins with a month of intense technical talks to try to resolve the dispute. \nIf that doesn't work, there would probably then be an emergency meeting of EU leaders, to take the decision up to prime ministers, not just the EU Commission. \nThere could be different forms of restrictions on trade, specific sanctions, or they could give notice that they would tear up the whole trade agreement, which Ireland warned might happen this week. \nWithout getting too technical, the trigger could end up with grumpy talks dragging on over many months with lots of politicking but not much changing practically. \nBoth sides could, in a genuine way, join together to try to work things out. \nOr the trigger could, as one observer warned, boil over into a \"full scale trade war that undermines the UK and the EU's post-Covid economic recovery\".\nThe economic consequences of that could be profound for us all, if the argument really went that far. \nAnd what would Number 10 do in the end, if the UK didn't get what it wanted? \nIf, as another source suggests, Boris Johnson \"triggers the process, it finds against the UK\u2026.and ultimately the European Court says you must comply - he's snookered\".  \nAs explained here, the UK may well want to strip the European Court of Justice of its role overseeing the Protocol. \nTechnically, the Article 16 process itself does not come directly under the European Court. But if, as some fear is likely, the argument tips into a wider dispute about the application of EU law then the European Court would end up as the final arbiter. \nAt the risk of hammering the point, the UK could try to reduce the European Court's influence on Northern Ireland by starting a huge legal argument, but actually end up with its influence being confirmed. \nMid-November has been pencilled in for several months, as the moment when an actual decision was going to have to be made. \nThat final conclusion has not yet been reached. \nAnd given what could be at stake, both sides would still, in theory, like the negotiations to work. \nBut we are approaching a moment where Downing Street may decide that the huge political and economic risks of triggering Article 16 are worth it, that the downsides of the protocol are no longer tolerable, and efforts to find a compromise have run their course. \nYet the potential outcomes might make the last stormy seven days look like a moment of deep calm.

      "tags": "Priti Patel,Hamas",
      "text": "Home Secretary Priti Patel has announced she is seeking to declare the whole of Palestinian militant group Hamas a terrorist organisation.\nThe military wing of the group which controls Gaza is already proscribed a terrorist organisation by the UK.  \nHowever, the change will also cover the Islamist movement's political wing. \nIt is a criminal offence to belong to or invite support for a proscribed organisation or wear clothing which could be seen to support the group.\nThe penalty is a maximum of 14 years in prison and/or a fine. \nA proscription order laid before Parliament on Friday will now be debated and, subject to approval, will come into force on 26 November. \nHamas has carried out hundreds of deadly attacks against Israel and fired thousands of rockets at it during years of hostilities between the two sides. Israel, along with Egypt, has hemmed in the Gaza Strip since Hamas took over in 2006 and waged a series of wars against it. Human rights groups have accused both sides of committing war crimes.\nOutlawing Hamas can be seen as the completion of a bit of unfinished diplomatic business. It brings the UK into line with the US and the EU. \nThe UK has long had a policy of \"no contact\" with Hamas's political wing. Banning the group in its entirety just makes this official. \nAnd most engagement with Gaza - and the provision of humanitarian aid - has been done through international agencies such as the United Nations. \nSo, in reality, this decision may not change much in terms of Britain's engagement - or lack of it - with Hamas. But this decision should also be seen through a domestic UK prism. \nIsrael has been pushing for this for some time and the fact it is now happening reflects the deep contacts that Israel has within the Conservative Party. \nThe change also provides Conservative MPs with a new dividing line with those on the Labour left that have in the past shown sympathy for Hamas. \nMs Patel confirmed the news in a speech on security and counter terrorism in Washington DC. \n\"Hamas has significant terrorist capability, including access to extensive and sophisticated weaponry as well as terrorist training facilities, and it has long been involved in significant terrorist violence,\" she said.\n\"Hamas commits, participates, prepares for and promotes and encourages terrorism. If we tolerate extremism, it will erode the rock of security.\" \nIn response, Hamas accused the UK of supporting \"the aggressors at the expense of the victims\". \nIsrael welcomed the move as a \"significant decision\". \nForeign affairs minister Yair Lapid said: \"There is no legitimate part of a terrorist organisation, and any attempt to differentiate between parts of a terrorist organisation is artificial.\" \nUnder the Terrorism Act 2000, the home secretary may proscribe an organisation if she believes it is concerned in terrorism. \nHamas is one of 78 terrorist groups proscribed in the UK and the third proscription order laid by the home secretary within the last year. \nThe group is already designated a terrorist organisation by the US, the EU and other powers.\nHamas' military wing was proscribed by the UK in March 2001. \nAt the time, the Home Office said the government's assessment was that there was a distinction between the political and military wings of the group but now assessed this distinction to be artificial.\nHamas originally had a dual purpose of carrying out an armed struggle against Israel - led by its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - and delivering social welfare programmes.\nBut after 2005, when Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza, Hamas has also engaged in the Palestinian political process. It won the legislative elections in 2006, before reinforcing its power in Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of President Mahmoud Abbas."

Employees have unlimited paid leave and UK workers must take 24 days holiday.\n\"Our teams were expressing Zoom fatigue, as well as actual burnout,\" said Tariq Shaukat, president of Bumble. \n\"The stress comes from always being connected but when working from home, or vacationing, there's always a feeling of 'what am I missing'?\"\nIn April, LinkedIn shut down for a week, giving nearly all of its 16,000 employees a break.\nNike headquarters staff in Oregon also got a week off in August to support their mental health."

      "text": "Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest has hit its highest level in over 15 years, official data shows. \nA report by Brazil's space research agency (Inpe) found that deforestation increased by 22% in a year. \nBrazil was among a number of nations who promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030 during the COP26 climate summit. \nThe Amazon is home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people. \nIt is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. \nAccording to the latest data, some 13,235 sq km (5110 sq miles) was lost during the 2020-21 period, the highest amount since 2006. \nEnvironment Minister Joaquim Leite said the data represents a \"challenge\" and said: \"We have to be more forceful in relation to these crimes.\" \nHe added that the data \"does not exactly reflect the situation in the last few months\".  \nDeforestation of the Amazon has increased under President Jair Bolsonaro. who has encouraged agriculture and mining activities in the rainforest. \nHe has also clashed with Inpe in the past over its deforestation, accusing the agency in 2019 of smearing Brazil's reputation. \nBut at November's climate conference in Glasgow, Brazil was among a number of nations who signed a major deal to end and reverse the practice. \nThe pledge included almost \u00a314bn ($19.2bn) of public and private funds. Some of that will go to developing countries to restore damaged land, tackle wildfires and support indigenous communities. \nClose links have previously been uncovered between the deforestation of the Amazon and international supply chains. \nLast year, a Greenpeace investigation discovered links between the mass deforestation of the region and food sold in British supermarkets and restaurants. \nThe investigation found that Tesco, Asda, Lidl, Nando's and McDonalds were selling meat, sourced from a UK supplier, which had been fed on soy grown on farms built in deforested areas. \nJust this week, Jair Bolsonaro, on tour in Dubai, told investors that attacks towards Brazil on deforestation were \"unfair\".\n\"We want people to know the real Brazil,\" he said, adding that 90% of the forest is still preserved.\nWell, these latest figures reveal the real Brazil - a country whose government has from the very beginning talked up the opportunities in developing the Amazon and at the same time, belittled environmental concerns.\nNot only that, these figures were actually dated 27 October - it appears they were held until after COP26.\nJair Bolsonaro didn't turn up to COP26, but his delegation wanted to go to Glasgow and convince the world that people were wrong about Brazil - it even said it would move forward its commitment to ending deforestation by 2028.\nBut with numbers like these, who can believe Jair Bolsonaro now?

The relatively few customers who have one of those can now ask for it to be replaced free of charge.\nThe flaw in software code, found by researcher Raf Fini, from Pen Test Partners, would have allowed a hacker to reconfigure a home router simply by directing the user to a malicious website via a phishing email.\nAnd then they could \"take over someone's online life\", stealing passwords for banking and other websites, Pen Test Partner's Ken Munro told BBC News.\nThere was no evidence the flaw had been exploited but the delay fixing it was baffling, he said.\n\"While the coronavirus pandemic put many internet service providers under pressure, as people moved to working from home, taking well over a year to fix an easily exploited security flaw simply isn't acceptable,\" he said.\nAnyone with a router should change passwords from the ones set by default, Mr Munro added.\nEarlier this year, BBC News discovered an insecure Vodafone router with a default password may have allowed a stranger to take over a couple's wi-fi and use it to upload illegal images of child abuse to the internet. \nThe couple faced a police investigation that caused massive disruption to their lives and led to mental health problems. \nIn May, consumer watchdog Which? warned millions of routers that had missed several years of critical security updates, making them ripe for exploitation by hackers, remained in use in the UK."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Almost 10 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 197 countries worldwide. \nHowever, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world.  \nSome countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population - but others are some way behind.\nWith an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. \nOverall, China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with about three billion and 1.6 billion respectively. The US is third, with more than 530 million.\nMany poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, together with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a Covid vaccine.\nCovax had planned to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of 2021, but downgraded its supply forecast as a the result of global export bans, production challenges and slow regulatory approval processes.\nThe scheme has now distributed more than one billion vaccines.\nThe vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech was the first approved by the WHO, followed by several others.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. \nUnlike Pfizer's jab - which has to be kept at an extremely cold temperature (-70C) - the Oxford vaccine can be stored in a normal fridge, which makes it easier to distribute.\nMost governments have started with doses for the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. After priority groups have been vaccinated, there is a wider rollout among younger age groups. \nThe Pfizer vaccine has been approved for 12 to 15-year-olds in the US, UK, Europe and other countries. The Sinovac vaccine is being used for children as young as three in China and Colombia.\nEarly studies suggest the newly identified Omicron variant of coronavirus is better able to evade vaccine protection than previous strains, though vaccination still offers strong protection against serious illness and hospitalisation. \nA third 'booster' dose of a vaccine does appear to offer protection against infection from Omicron and at least 96 countries have begun booster vaccination programmes.\nWorldwide, more than 100 possible vaccines are undergoing trials to test their efficacy and safety. \nOur World in Data, a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity, collated the information in the map and table above.\nPopulation figures have been sourced from the United Nations' mid-2021 estimates provided by Our World in Data."

      "tags": "EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Ireland\u2013UK border,European Union,Brexit",
      "text": "After weeks of rattled nerves, and inflamed rhetoric, is sweetness and light about to break out between the UK and the EU over, you guessed it, the Northern Irish Protocol - that thorniest of problems that's come round again, and again, (and yes, again) as the two sides have grappled with life after Brexit? \nTalking to the Irish leader, the Taoiseach, who was in Cardiff for a meeting to promote harmony on both sides you might just wonder. \nMiche\u00e1l Martin said the \"mood music had changed\", urged the UK to believe that the EU's desire for a deal was real. And he hoped that Boris Johnson would not \"let the perfect be the enemy of the good\".  \nWithout wanting to remind you of all the angst of last year's Christmas Eve trade deal, he also pleaded with the prime minister not to run things down to Christmas. \nMr Martin is an affable kind of politician. \nUK ministers talk well of him in private. And clearly, like many leaders around the continent, and indeed like Downing Street, he would rather that a deal was done.  \nIt seems that he himself, having warned only a couple of weeks ago that the UK's threatened course of action would be \"reckless\" and \"unwise\", has concluded that it's wiser in contrast, to play down the tensions, to talk up the chances of a deal. \nBut there's still a rub. \nAmong the whispers about fixes that could be in the offing, possible budges on the EU side, suggestions that talks could, after all stretch beyond Christmas, there is a fundamental disagreement. \nThe Irish leader disputed the UK and the Northern Irish Unionists' claim that the way the protocol works is too onerous, over zealous - simply, over the top. He told me that's been \"overstated\", \"there is no abundance of checks\". \nThat is a total contradiction of the problem the UK identifies and wants to fix. For as long as the two sides disagree about what reality looks like it's hard to be sure of any real progress. \nWhatever the perceived shift in political rhetoric, the UK has long been clear unless there is a change in the EU's concrete offer, they are on the way to move into a legal dispute, article 16, part of the process that exists to solve problems, but that could tip into something serious. \nAnd for all the Taoiseach's friendlier tone, for all the speculation, UK ministers and insiders privately maintain that if there isn't a budge, then there will be a bigger bust up.  \nFor a reminder of what all that's about you can read more here.\nLord Frost, Boris Johnsons' Brexit negotiator heads back to Brussels later for another bout of talks. \nTalking means legal fighting is on hold, but it doesn't mean it isn't on the way.

      "tags": "Mansfield,Rail travel,Birmingham,HS2,Derby",
      "text": "Plans to scrap the eastern leg of HS2 in favour of a link that terminates in the East Midlands have met with a mixed reaction in the region.\nThe government's new Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) states the Birmingham to Leeds route will now terminate at East Midlands Parkway, in Nottinghamshire.\nIt also plans to electrify the existing Midlands Mainline and invest about \u00a311bn in rail links in the region.\nWhile some were relieved at the decision, others were disappointed.\nBen Bradley, Conservative MP for Mansfield and the leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, described the proposals to link the East and West Midlands through Leicestershire as \"fantastic\".\n\"The biggest thing for us in Nottinghamshire is our economic development and jobs creation,\" he said.\n\"Off the back of this, we are linking disadvantaged communities into huge sites for jobs.\"\nHowever, Lilian Greenwood, Labour MP for Nottingham South, accused the government of selling the region short and branded the axing of the eastern leg a \"rail betrayal\".\nShe said: \"The [plan] is a huge betrayal of our region and, by spinning this as a good deal, Ben Bradley is simply selling our county and our region short.\n\"We'll lose out on massively improved connections to Leeds, the North East and Scotland.\n\"By scrapping the full eastern leg, we won't get the extra capacity needed to create more local rail services and get more freight on rail - and lorries off our roads.\"\nI've been travelling with the Prime Minister this morning. I joined him at Newark for a short hop to Doncaster.\nHe pored over a rail map and pointed out that HS2 is going to be delivered to the East Midlands despite earlier reports of its demise.\nA multi-billion pound investment which will, however, only take the new line to East Midlands Parkway.\nHe also pledged the long-awaited and long-demanded electrification of the whole Midlands mainline which runs through Leicester and Nottingham to Sheffield.\nAnd while HS2 will halt at the Parkway station near East Midlands Airport, the line will continue to Toton and a new rail transport hub will still be built there connecting local services.\nAnd it may not be the end of the full eastern leg.\nThat could still happen in the long term.\nAlex Norris, Labour MP for Nottingham North, added: \"This U-turn will be a blow to our regional and local economies.\"\nOriginal proposals for the route suggested it would run through communities on the Derbyshire/Nottinghamshire border to a major hub at Toton, connecting the cities of Nottingham and Derby.\nUnder the new plans, the Midlands Mainline will be electrified as far as Sheffield - something rail campaigners have long called for - and Toton will become a mainline station.\nThis will connect to the reopened Maid Marian Line - closed during the 1960s Beeching Cuts - to provide passenger connectivity with places like Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Selston and Pinxton.\nIt comes alongside a commitment to extending the Robin Hood Line out to Edwinstowe and Ollerton.\nThe Local Democracy Reporting Service suggests this is a project long campaigned for by politicians including the Government's chief whip and Sherwood MP Mark Spencer.\nThis would connect with the Maid Marian Line in Ashfield to reach the Toton station, and eventually on to HS2 via the light rail connection.\nJason Zadrozny, the independent leader of Ashfield District Council, welcomed the Maid Marian Line news but criticised the overall HS2 plans.\n\"We've always said reopening the Maid Marian Line to passengers was a no-brainer,\" he said.\n\"With regards to HS2 - it's been the worst kept secret in Nottinghamshire for years that HS2 would not stop at Toton.\n\"[The government] talks about levelling up, yet this looks like it will further exacerbate issues in Nottinghamshire and put us further behind the rest of the UK.\"\nHowever Midlands Connect - the government-funded regional transport group - said there were positives in the plans.\nChair Sir John Peace said: \"Today's announcement gives businesses and local leaders the reassurance they've been waiting for - that HS2 is coming to the East Midlands.\n\"Although these plans are different in some respects to what we'd expected, there are a lot of... things to be excited about - a new high speed connection between Birmingham and East Midlands Parkway [and] direct links on to HS2 for Derby, Nottingham, and Chesterfield.\"\nHe added the delivery of a new station at Toton could start, which would help kickstart regeneration in that area.\n\"The plans around Toton, the adjacent freeport and the wider Development Corporation could create 84,000 jobs and add billions in value to the regional economy; the developments cover the size of three Olympic Parks,\" he said.\nHe added an upgrade of an East Coast Mainline junction at Newark - also mentioned in the plan - would allow better connectivity with Nottingham, Lincoln and other regional hubs.\nResidents in the towns and villages affected by the original HS2 scheme, said they were relieved about its axing.\nGeoff Cotton, who has lived in Trowell since 1988, would have seen HS2 come past his house.\n\"Obviously it's pleasing from a selfish point of view, but I do also feel that the way the economy is working at the moment with people working from home more, the need to travel down to London fast isn't as significant as it would have been,\" he said.\nHowever, he criticised the amount of time the decision had taken.\n\"People's lives have been totally put on hold for a long time because nobody is saying what is going to happen,\" he said.\n\"People haven't been able to move on with their lives because they can't sell their properties.\"\nJill Sisson, who has lived in Trowell for more than 50 years, would have seen her home demolished.\n\"I'm quite happy to be staying here,\" she said.\n\"To have been living with all this pressure is very hard. I don't think it's been handled very well. One minute you're hearing one thing and the next minute you're hearing something else.\n\"It leaves you up in the air as to what's going to happen. It's all the uncertainty.\"\nSim Harris, editor of Rail News, said the proposals for the eastern leg of HS2 had always had problems.\n\"The idea of running the line to the east of Derby and the west of Nottingham meant neither city got a high speed station,\" he said.\n\"Putting it at Toton was an unfortunate compromise. By the time residents had travelled there, they could have been on their way to London on a regular train.\"\nHe viewed the location of East Midlands Parkway as a better choice. \"It will prove a useful east-west corridor and could mean a faster service between Derby, Nottingham and Birmingham,\" he said.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "title": "Kyle Rittenhouse trial: When can you shoot as self-defence?",
      "tags": "Jacob Blake shooting,Wisconsin,United States",
      "text": "Last year, a US teen shot three people during unrest on the streets of Wisconsin. Attorneys at his murder trial will argue he acted in self-defence.\nKyle Rittenhouse, 18, is charged with killing two men and wounding another during disorder in the streets of Kenosha last August. \nOn Tuesday, a friend testified that Mr Rittenhouse called him \"freaking out\" moments after the shootings and told him he had to shoot because \"people were trying to hurt him\". \nProsecutors will argue the Illinois native came looking for trouble that night. Mr Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty. \nHere's what we know about the case so far.\nThe night before the shootings, 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse travelled from his home in Antioch, Illinois to his friend Dominic Black's place in Kenosha, in neighbouring Wisconsin. He brought with him an AR-style semiautomatic rifle allegedly purchased on his behalf by Mr Black.\nLocal officials had declared a state of emergency one day earlier amid mass protests and street unrest over the shooting of Jacob Blake, a black man. The incident came just three months after a national outcry over the police murder of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis.\nOn 25 August 2020, the two young men said they joined other armed civilians in protecting local car dealerships and cleaning up graffiti.\nLater in the day, bystander video captures Mr Rittenhouse being chased into the car park of a used car dealership by Joseph Rosenbaum, 36.\nMoments later, unseen on video, Mr Rittenhouse fires four times and kills Rosenbaum.\nAs he runs down the street away from the scene, Mr Rittenhouse falls and multiple people converge upon him.\nAnthony Huber, 26, hits him in the head and neck with a skateboard. Mr Rittenhouse kills him with a bullet to the stomach.\nGaige Grosskreutz, 27, approaches him with a pistol in hand. Mr Rittenhouse wounds him with a shot in the arm.\nAll three victims were white.\nHe is now facing six counts, including reckless homicide, intentional homicide and recklessly endangering safety.\nIf convicted of the most serious charges, he could spend decades in prison.\nThe prosecution and defence made their opening arguments in court on Tuesday.\nAttorneys for Mr Rittenhouse claim he came to Kenosha to protect businesses from looters and rioters, not to harm anyone.\nArguing he had no choice but to shoot at the men he engaged with, they will try to show that each individual attacked Mr Rittenhouse or tried to grab his gun.\nMr Black, who allegedly supplied Mr Rittenhouse with his rifle illegally and faces his own trial, testified on Wednesday that his friend called him shortly after the incident. He told the court Mr Rittenhouse had been \"really scared\" and felt threatened.\nThe defence is also likely to present evidence that Mr Rittenhouse was carrying a first aid kit and had friendly interactions with police that led him to believe he was doing the right thing.\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, Kenosha police were captured on video tossing bottles of water to Mr Rittenhouse and other armed civilians.\n\"We appreciate you guys, we really do,\" one grateful officer is heard saying.\nMr Rittenhouse's defenders say he was exercising his right to bear arms, in defence of liberty.\nBoth Mr Rittenhouse's $2m (\u00a31.5m) bail and his legal defence fund were covered by fundraising online.\nIn a video released by Mr Rittenhouse's legal team last year, a voice declared he was \"being sacrificed by politicians. Their end game is to strip away the constitutional right of all citizens to defend our communities\".\nKenosha County Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger and his team of prosecutors will need to persuade the jury that Mr Rittenhouse was not acting in self-defence.\nThey will argue he was a \"teenage vigilante\" who came to Kenosha \"with the intent to violently clash with those opposed to his beliefs\".\nThe attorneys will question why Mr Rittenhouse travelled across state lines and why he was outdoors long after an 8pm curfew imposed by city officials.\nWisconsin state law prohibits those under 18 from being armed, unless they are hunting, so there will likely be scrutiny of how and why the weapon was obtained.\nMr Rittenhouse's support for law enforcement and his affinity with firearms are well-documented on social media, and could be presented as evidence in court.\nProsecutors will also seek to prove the men who intercepted him were simply trying to stop him.\nBut convincing the 20-person jury to convict Mr Rittenhouse will be an uphill climb, says John Gross, a criminal defence expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\"Once the evidence suggests that the defendant may have acted in self-defence, the burden shifts to the prosecution, and the prosecution has to disprove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted in self-defence,\" he explains.\n\"It was late at night, the scene was very chaotic and there were a lot of people carrying weapons, so it remains to be seen how strong a case the prosecution will be able to make,\" he says.\nBut, he adds, \"the law generally does not recognise your right to use deadly force to defend property, only your person\".\nIn the US, people can justify their use of deadly force against another when it reasonably appears necessary.\nWisconsinites may not be prosecuted if their methods of self-defence were \"necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm\". The legal standard comes with a two-part test.\nJurors must decide whether or not the use of deadly force was objectively reasonable under the circumstances.\n\"Did the person reasonably fear that they were about to be assaulted and seriously injured? If they did, then they would be entitled to use self-defence,\" says Mr Gross.\nThen, the 20-person jury must also \"put themselves in the shoes of the defendant\" to decide if, knowing what he knew then, Mr Rittenhouse sincerely believed he was in danger.\n\"In the moment the defendant used deadly force, if his belief was reasonable but mistaken, it's still considered reasonable under the circumstances,\" he notes.\nMr Gross tells the BBC that the dual test will need to be applied three times over - unlike in other self-defence cases - because Mr Rittenhouse shot three people.\nHe also points out the challenge ahead for jurors as the highly politicised case unfolds.\n\"People either see [Mr Rittenhouse] as a hero or a villain,\" says Mr Gross. \"It's going to be challenging for jurors to focus on the specifics of the case and strip away a lot of the baggage that has been attached to him.\""

      "title": "Covid passes set to stay as Europe heads for winter",
      "tags": "Austria,France,Slovenia,Germany,Denmark,Coronavirus vaccines,Serbia,Italy,Netherlands,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been protests and complaints of restricted freedom, but much of Europe is now using Covid passports to enter bars, restaurants, cinemas and museums.\nItaly also requires a Covid pass to enter a workplace and Austria is about to follow suit. \nAlthough England does not require a pass, from Friday, the UK's digital Covid pass will be accepted across the European Union. \nOur correspondents around Europe have been getting to grips with the rules.\nItaly has adopted arguably the most rigid Covid pass rules in Europe, writes Mark Lowen in Rome. The Green Pass QR code - from at least one Covid vaccination, negative test or proof of recovery - has to be shown for everything from indoor restaurants to cinemas, gyms and intercity trains. It is also required by all employees in the public and private sectors when they turn up for work. Passes are checked regularly and my family, visiting from the UK, were amazed how rigidly Covid rules, including masks, are respected here. \nIn France it is surprising how quickly the passe sanitaire has become part of daily life, writes Hugh Schofield in Paris. Few think twice now before presenting their mobile phones at bars, cinemas and museums, or on TGV trains and at airports. It is a normalised ritual.  \nIt's a different story in the Netherlands, writes Anna Holligan. In all the beach bars, restaurants and city cafes I've visited since the pass was introduced on 25 September, I have not once been asked to flash my pass, although I have been asked at the cinema. The rules state anyone aged 13 and over has to show a Covid entry pass, although not for shops or taking part in sports events.\nDenmark actually phased out its coronapas last month, writes Adrienne Murray in Copenhagen. It was first in Europe to adopt a pass in April but has now downgraded Covid-19 to a no longer \"socially critical\" disease.\nIn Germany, if you go out to eat or drink, it's good to know the latest Covid regulation lingo, writes Damien McGuinness in Berlin. Handmade signs with a large 2G have popped up on the doors of many restaurants, cafes and bars. 2G means only people who are either geimpft (vaccinated) or genesen (recovered) can go in. No sign means the usual 3G rule applies, which includes negative tests too.\nAustrians have used 3G certificates for months, writes Bethany Bell in Vienna. A friend and I went recently to one of my favourite restaurants in Vienna, which serves excellent Wiener Schnitzel and apple strudel. \"You have your Green Passes, I suppose?\" asked the waiter suspiciously. He glanced briefly at our digital certificates, then handed over the menus. Some establishments check on the passes very strictly, others don't even bother to ask.\nIn Switzerland, Covid passes are obligatory and the rules strictly applied, says Imogen Foulkes in Bern. And now that Covid tests aren't free anymore, going out for a beer gets pretty expensive. The vaccination rate is stagnating at around 62% and the government wants more people to get the jab. \nAnna Holligan: After some early consternation, the majority of pragmatic Dutch accepted the pass as a means of resurrecting their social lives while shrugging off social distancing. When I've asked waiters or box-office workers if they want to see the QR code proving my vaccination the answers vary from \"no, it's okay, we trust you\" to \"we don't actually have the technology\". A recent study by I&O Research found around a third of cafes and restaurants in the Netherlands were not scanning the coronapasses. \nAdrienne Murray: Danes are tech-savvy and accepted the app quickly as it offered a quick path out of lockdown. But because the coronapas came in well before people were double-vaccinated it required regular testing. Free test centres sprung up in neighbourhoods all over Copenhagen and towns elsewhere. These have mostly closed now that 75% of over-12s are fully vaccinated and a third booster is being rolled out.\nGuy Delauney, Balkans correspondent: I've detected little enthusiasm for the passes, travelling through Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and North Macedonia. While one restaurant on the main square in the Macedonian capital Skopje barred entry to people without passes, another had no checks at all. Staff complain of abuse, so a sign or a sticker on a table often acts as a fig leaf for official policies. \nMark Lowen: There's a stereotype of Italians as a nation not minded to follow rules - but by being hit first in Europe, the pandemic seems to have changed that, and Italy's \"no-vax\" movement is relatively small. \nThere have been some protests. Crowds stormed and smashed up a trade union building and then anti-Green Pass workers staged sit-ins and protests in Trieste, blockading the country's most important commercial port. Police broke them up with tear gas and water cannon. \nImogen Foulkes: Opponents of the Swiss pass complain the strict policies undermine their constitutional freedoms. There are demonstrations every week, some of which have turned violent. Enough signatures have been gathered to call a referendum on 28 November to abolish the passes. If the Swiss do vote to get rid of them, it could make travel in Europe problematic - as the Swiss pass is recognised across Europe's passport-free Schengen area.\nHugh Schofield: Of course there are people in France who object on principle to having to prove their credentials at every turn. Every Saturday there are demonstrations in Paris and other cities, bringing together anti-vaxxers with libertarians and protesters against \"health discrimination\". Contrary to what some expected, though, these have not turned into a mass movement, and are dwindling in strength.\nAnna Holligan: There have been a few challenges in the Netherlands: one failed lawsuit argued the pass was discriminatory because it treated unvaccinated people differently without good reason. Supermodel Doutzen Kroes announced on Instagram that she would not be \"forced to take the shot\" or \"forced to prove my health to participate in society\". But opposition to the pass in the Netherlands appears to be more a matter of principle than practicality.\nBethany Bell: While many Austrians welcomed the passes as a step towards more freedoms, the opposition far-right Freedom Party has championed those who disagree with the measures. Its head, Herbert Kickl, has accused the government of splitting society into \"the good vaccinated and the bad unvaccinated\". \nGuy Delauney: There have been protests in Slovenia's capital every Wednesday in recent weeks and some have involved violent confrontations with the police, who have used teargas and water cannon to clear the crowds. \nSerbian protesters have also been making themselves heard in Belgrade in recent days - despite the fact that the Covid pass there only applies to bars and restaurants after 22:00. One epidemiologist described that approach as \"trying to put out a fire with a glass of water\". \nAdrienne Murray: Denmark's coronapas was agreed across all parliamentary parties, even the opposition, with the promise that it would only be used for a finite time. And it was. Some public protests were held but they were attended by hundreds not thousands.\nHugh Schofield: The effect of the French passe sanitaire on levels of vaccination seems incontrovertible. From the beginning of August vaccinations shot up.  Clearly many who were hesitating decided for the sake of a return to normal-ish life, it was necessary to take the plunge. Today 50 million French people have been totally vaccinated, including 88.4% of over-12s. And since mid-October a second part of the national arm-twist has come into effect: the end of free tests. The passe sanitaire has two options: either show proof of vaccination or a recent negative test. With this second option now incurring a cost, there'll be a further incentive for vaccination.\nDamien McGuinness: Germany has also dropped free antigen tests under its 3G rule, so anyone eligible who refuses the vaccine has to pay. Businesses can now choose for themselves whether to allow unvaccinated customers inside and this 2G rule is seen as a way of encouraging vaccination. It can be a selling point for customers. One Berlin cafe-owner said he had only had one objection from a regular. \"I just replied that he had excluded himself by deciding to not get vaccinated,\" he told me.  \nMark Lowen: Nothing motivates an Italian like threatening to bar them from their favourite trattoria and when compulsory passes were announced there was a sudden spike in vaccination appointments. Italy has some of the highest vaccination rates in Europe, with around 82% having received both doses, but that rate has slowed slightly and 40% of the workers at Trieste port still haven't been vaccinated, while far-right parties have courted the anti-vax and anti-Green Pass movement.\nGuy Delauney: Slovenia has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the EU, and its efforts to implement a Covid pass system initially helped boost take-up. That was until the constitutional court suspended a mandatory pass for public sector workers. Shops and restaurants all display notices reminding customers they need a valid PCT certificate, as it is known. But enforcement is patchy and official inspectors are thin on the ground. \nMark Lowen: They'll certainly stay in Italy until the end of the year, but possibly in a nod to the protest movement the deputy health minister has said they could be \"reassessed\" next year if the data continues to show manageable infection numbers, low hospitalisations, and rising vaccine rates. The government says the alternative to compulsory passes is new restrictions, and most Italians will do whatever they can to avoid another lockdown. \nAdrienne Murray: The passes in Denmark may have gone but Covid is still here. Cases have recently risen back above 1,000 a day and are expected to go up further. However, there is little trace of the pandemic in everyday life, just the hand gel at the entrance to the supermarket. There's no social distancing, it's rare to see anyone in a face mask and guidance to work from home lifted in early August.\nBethany Bell: As of 1 November, Austrians will have to show 3G passes to go to work. And this winter they will also have to show the certificates if they want to go skiing. Passes will be checked when people buy tickets for the ski lifts. And there are even stricter plans for apr\u00e8s-ski, where antigen tests will no longer be accepted - only a vaccination certificate, proof of recovery or negative PCR test result will do.\nHugh Schofield: The initial hope was that the passe sanitaire could be phased out in France from mid-November. That is not going to happen. The government is warning that though the Covid situation is vastly improved from two months ago, there are still risks of a winter resurgence. Last week a new health bill passed its first reading in parliament, which would make possible an extension of the passe until July 2022.   \nGuy Delauney: Coronavirus case numbers have been surging across the Western Balkans, so despite the poor response to Covid passes, governments are likely to try again.

      "text": "Northern Ireland's largest electricity company Power NI is to increase its prices for domestic customers by 21.4% from 1 January 2022.\nIt means a typical household bill will go up by \u00a3131 a year. The tariff has been approved by the Utility Regulator.\nPower NI said the increase was due to a rise in prices across the global wholesale gas market.\nIt has about 450,000 domestic customers and this is the second tariff increase it has announced this year.\nIn July, it announced a 6.9% price rise.\nConsumers across Northern Ireland are facing higher prices this winter as gas and electricity providers pass on increasing costs to customers. \nWilliam Steele, customer solutions director for Power NI, said the firm would try to assist customers struggling to pay their bills.\n\"We work very hard to keep our prices as low as possible but regrettably there has been a rapid and sustained increase in wholesale gas prices over recent months,\" he said.\n\"Like other suppliers we have no choice but to pay these increased costs, which feed into the cost of wholesale electricity and have a knock-on effect on our tariffs.\n\"In these challenging times and with such a volatile market we held off making this change for as long as possible, with this price change not coming into effect until January 2022.\n\"As soon as we see an opportunity to reduce prices, we will do so without delay.\n\"For any customers who are worried about paying a bill, please get in contact and we can help you.\"\nThe company said customers could help to offset the increase by ensuring they were on the best payment plan and registering for online billing.\nJohn French, chief executive of the Utility Regulator, said it was unclear how long it would be before global prices began to fall.\n\"The drivers behind this increase are that we have had one of the least windy summers since 1961, meaning generation from cheaper wind power has been very low,\" he said.\n\"This low output from wind has meant that there has been an increased use of conventional gas, coal, and oil fired power stations.\n\"Unfortunately, the cost of gas, coal, and oil has increased significantly on global markets over the last 12 months, and since the wholesale cost of electricity makes up over 60% of a domestic customer's bill these sharp increases impact heavily on Power NI's tariff.\"\nMr French said market analysts were predicting higher wholesale prices \"for the next 18 to 36 months\".\n\"If wholesale prices begin to reduce, our system of regulation in Northern Ireland allows us to act to make sure that reductions are fully passed onto consumers as quickly as possible.\""

We wish him well for the next chapter.\"\nBBC director of news Fran Unsworth described him as a \"fantastic presenter and interviewer, whose wisdom and skill will be a loss to our screens\".\nMarr will continue to present The Andrew Marr Show until the end of the year.\nHe wrote on Twitter that he will \"leave behind many happy memories and wonderful colleagues\".\n\"But from the New Year I am moving to Global to write and present political and cultural shows, and to write for newspapers.\"\nHe added: \"I have been doing the Andrew Marr show every Sunday morning for 16 years now and that is probably more than enough time for anybody!\"\nMarr, who also co-hosts BBC Radio 4's Start the Week, began his journalism career in the press, including as editor of The Independent in the 1990s.\nGlobal executive president Ashley Tabor-King described him as \"one of the finest and most respected broadcasters and journalists of our time\".\nHe said: \"LBC now takes its next step.

He maintains his innocence. \nHis case has attracted the support of celebrities including reality TV star Kim Kardashian and anti-death penalty activists.\nJones' execution by lethal injection was scheduled for 16:00 local time (2200 GMT) at the state penitentiary in McAlester.\nBut Gov Stitt, a Republican, said he intervened \"after prayerful consideration and reviewing materials presented by all sides of this case\".\nThe state's Pardon and Parole Board earlier recommended in a 3-1 majority vote that Jones' sentence be commuted to life in prison with the possibility of parole.\nThe case has attracted widespread attention in recent years, partly due to the 2018 ABC documentary series \"The Last Defense\". \nMore than six million people have signed a Justice for Julius petition which states he was put on death row because of \"fundamental breakdowns in the system tasked with deciding\". \nJones was found guilty of fatally shooting Mr Howell, an insurance executive, during a 1999 carjacking on his driveway. \nIn October, he was among five people who won stays of execution from a three-judge panel of the 10th Circuit US Court of Appeal.\n\"I did not kill Mr Howell,\" he wrote in a letter to the parole board in April, after exhausting his appeals. \n\"I did not participate in any way in his murder; and the first time I saw him was on television when his death was reported.\"\nBut Mr Howell's relatives have said Jones' calls for clemency have victimised them further.

      "text": "Belarus's authoritarian leader has told the BBC it is \"absolutely possible\" his forces helped migrants cross into Poland but denies they were invited.\nThousands of migrants, mainly from the Middle East, have been trying to get into the EU via Belarus for months.\nIn an exclusive interview, Alexander Lukashenko told me: \"We're Slavs. We have hearts. Our troops know the migrants are going to Germany.\" \n\"Maybe someone helped them. I won't even look into this,\" he added. \nThe EU, Nato and the US have accused the Belarus leader of luring migrants to the border with the false promise of easy entry to the EU. Something he has denied.\n\"I told them [the EU] I'm not going to detain migrants on the border, hold them at the border, and if they keep coming from now on I still won't stop them, because they're not coming to my country, they're going to yours,\" he told me.\n\"But I didn't invite them here. And to be honest, I don't want them to go through Belarus.\" \nMr Lukashenko has been in power since 1994 but his re-election as president last year was widely discredited by the West and not recognised by the EU.\nThousands of protesters and opposition activists were detained and opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya was forced out of Belarus after claiming victory. Her team criticised the BBC for conducting Friday's interview, which they described as \"giving the floor to a dictator\".\nMs Tikhanovskaya later told the BBC the interview provided Mr Lukashenko with \"a platform for lies and propaganda\". \nIn our interview at the presidential palace, I asked the Belarus leader about peaceful protesters being beaten and then tried to hand him a video showing people emerging from a notorious detention centre in Minsk with injuries they had sustained through torture. \n\"OK, OK, I admit it, I admit it,\" he said. \"People were beaten in the Okrestina detention centre. But there were police beaten up too and you didn't show this.\"\nI then asked him about how he had gone about destroying civil society, including the closure of 270 non-government organisations since July.\n\"We'll massacre all the scum that you [the West] have been financing. Oh, you're upset we've destroyed all your structures! Your NGOs, whatever they are, that you've been paying for,\" he responded. \nThe EU claims Mr Lukashenko has been orchestrating the border crisis with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia in recent months in retaliation for sanctions imposed on Belarus for its brutal crackdown on opponents who took part in mass protests after the August 2020 election.\nMs Tikhanovskaya said sanctions provided the EU and US with \"powerful leverage\" against Mr\u00a0Lukashenko. \"He understands only the language of power,\" she said.\nShe accused his regime of blackmailing European countries over their \"support for the Belarusian democratic movement\".\nThe EU earlier accused Mr Lukashenko of taking an \"inhuman, gangster-style approach\" to the migrant issue.\nAt least 2,000 migrants were stranded in camps next to Belarus's border with Poland until they were eventually moved this week to a logistics warehouse nearby.  \nAn estimated 5,000 migrants remain in Belarus, although hundreds flew back to Kurdish northern Iraq on a repatriation flight on Thursday."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Brexit,Trade",
      "text": "A Brexit deal, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, is at the centre of a dispute between the UK and the European Union (EU).\nSince it came into force at the start of 2021 the protocol has disrupted trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK has suggested it could suspend parts of the arrangement by triggering part of the protocol known as Article 16.\nThe protocol allows lorries to deliver goods without having paperwork and goods checked when they cross the border from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland.\nThis arrangement was easy to maintain before Brexit. When both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were part of the EU, they automatically followed the same EU trade rules, which meant no checks were required.\nHowever, a new arrangement was needed after Northern Ireland (along with the rest of the UK) left the EU. The EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods, such as milk and eggs, arrive from non-EU countries. Similar rules exist in other areas, such as medicine licensing. \nTo try to get round the problem the UK and the EU negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is now part of international law.\nRather than checks taking place along the Irish border, it was agreed any inspections and document checks would take place between Northern Ireland and  Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) instead.\nThis was allowed after it was agreed that Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU rules on product standards (part of the EU's single market rules). \nChecks on GB goods take place at Northern Ireland ports to make sure they comply with EU laws. However, this has led to criticism that a new trade border has effectively been created in the Irish Sea. \nUnionists are strongly opposed to the checks because they don't want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK.\nAlso, not all checks under the protocol have been fully implemented yet. For example, supermarkets had reduced paperwork required under a temporary \"grace period\". However, the UK decided to extend these periods - something the EU said was a breach of international law. \nDespite signing up to the agreement in 2019, the UK government now says the protocol represented a huge compromise by the UK and has accused the EU of applying it too rigidly.\nThe UK is calling for changes, which include:\nArticle 16 is a set of three paragraphs in the protocol that allows either side to suspend any part of the agreement that causes \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\".\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss - now the UK's lead Brexit negotiator - said she would trigger Article 16 if the UK failed to secure changes.\n\"I want a negotiated solution but if we have to use legitimate provisions, including Article 16, I am willing to do that,\" she wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.\nIf the UK went down this route, it could prompt the EU to respond with measures that would impose tariffs (or import taxes) on aspects of trade between the two sides.\nThe EU has warned that any such move would \"lead to instability and unpredictability\".\nThe EU has set out proposals, but says a renegotiation of the text of the Protocol is out of the question:\nIn return, the EU wants extra safeguards to prevent products from Great Britain crossing into the Republic of Ireland.\nThe border is a sensitive issue because of the history of Northern Ireland and the agreements made to bring peace, which included the removal of visible signs of the border.\nThe fear is that if any infrastructure were to be installed, such as cameras or border posts, it could become a target and lead to political instability.\nDuring negotiations, all sides agreed that protecting the 1998 Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority."

      "text": "There is \"serious intent\" in the EU to solve post-Brexit difficulties over the Northern Ireland border, Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin has said.\nSpeaking to the BBC, he said the \"mood music\" surrounding EU-UK negotiations had improved in recent weeks.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol in the Brexit deal aims to avoid implementing border checks on the island of Ireland.\nIt keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU.\nBut the protocol also creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, meaning some goods such as meat and eggs are subject to checks when they enter Northern Ireland from Great Britain. \nThis has angered some Northern Irish politicians, including DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who said the protocol was disrupting businesses and harming trade. \nIn an interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Martin admitted feeling \"frustrated\" that the issue had hindered the \"full flowering\" of the two sides' alliance.\nAnd he warned the UK against acting unilaterally, saying it would \"undermine\" relationships.\nThe Taoiseach's comments come ahead of a meeting between the UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost and the EU Commission Vice-President Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d in Brussels on Friday aimed at resolving problems arising from the protocol. \nSpeaking immediately before his meeting with Lord Frost, Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d warned the post-Brexit trade deal was \"intrinsically linked\" to settling the protocol, adding: \"One cannot exist without the other\".\nHe ruled out a renegotiation of the protocol, insisting solutions were available within its framework, which could \"become reality if the UK plays its part\".\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d welcomed what he said was a \"change in tone\" from the UK during the negotiations, adding that he hoped \"actions will follow the words\".\nArriving for the talks, Lord Frost told reporters he was \"very much\" looking forward to seeing if progress could be made, adding that his preference was for a \"negotiated\" way through the problem, but if not, Article 16 of the protocol remained on the table.\nThe article allows either side to suspend any part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement that causes \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\".\nIf the UK did trigger Article 16, the EU could respond by imposing tariffs on trade between the two sides. \nLord Frost warned there were still \"quite significant gaps\" between the two sides but welcomed the Taoiseach's comment about the EU's \"serious intent\" to resolve the difficulties.\nIn his BBC interview, Mr Martin insisted there was \"not an abundance of checks\" on the border and that Northern Ireland benefitted from having access to both the European and UK markets.\nHowever, he added that the EU \"sincerely\" wanted to engage with the problems, which he said could be \"resolved with goodwill on all sides\". \nHe acknowledged that \"there have been periods during these talks when they've dragged on with very little happening\" but added that \"now there's a bit of engagement, of serious intent\".\nMr Martin said the protocol was \"never going to be perfect\", adding: \"It's important that we don't allow perfect become the enemy of the good.\"\nHe also urged the prime minister to believe that Brussels' offer of compromise was genuine and urged him not to take too long to move towards a deal saying \"don't leave it to Christmas Eve this year\" - a reference to last year's Brexit deal which was agreed on 24 December.\nMr Martin is an affable kind of politician. \nUK ministers talk well of him in private. And clearly, like many leaders around the continent, and indeed like Downing Street, he would rather that a deal was done.  \nIt seems that he himself, having warned only a couple of weeks ago that the UK's threatened course of action would be \"reckless\" and \"unwise\", has concluded that it's wiser in contrast, to play down the tensions, to talk up the chances of a deal. \nBut there's still a rub. \nRead more from Laura\nEarlier this month, Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney warned that the whole post-Brexit deal between the UK and the EU could collapse over the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nBut, Mr Martin suggested the \"mood music\" had since changed.\n\"A number of weeks ago there was a different atmosphere governing the situation and there was all sorts of rumours and vibes... since then, that has calmed down somewhat,\" he said.\nBut he still warned the UK against acting \"unilaterally\", arguing it could \"undermine\" the two countries' relationship. \nThe full interview from BBC Newscast is available on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds."

      "tags": "NI Health,Robin Swann,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People working from home in Northern Ireland during the first wave of the pandemic \"should be working from home\" again, the health minister has advised.\nRobin Swann said a previous decision to relax the working from home messaging should be reversed, it is understood.\nThe comments formed part of a document issued to the executive on Thursday.\nThis week the Department of Health said more restrictions before Christmas were possible unless transmission of the virus drops significantly.\nOn Friday Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride said: \"No-one should be in any doubt about the seriousness of the situation we are facing into.\n\"Unless we get this virus back under control... what we are looking at is potentially our hospital system being overwhelmed by mid-December,\" he told BBC News NI.\nHowever he said he did not believe that Northern Ireland would \"go back to the damaging impact of lockdowns\".\nDiscussing the topic of Christmas parties, Sir Michael urged people to be \"selective\" about which events they attended and for organisers to do risk assessments in advance.\n\"People should not be cancelling their plans at this stage but they should be thinking of planning carefully to minimise the risk to themselves and others,\" he said.\nMr Swann's advice on working from home came after he instructed officials to draft a paper looking at other ways to improve adherence with existing restrictions.\nIt followed a contentious vote by Stormont ministers to approve Covid-19 vaccine passports for domestic use in Northern Ireland from next month.\nThe plan means people will have to provide proof of vaccination against Covid-19 or proof of a negative coronavirus test result to access nightclubs, pubs or restaurants.\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had voted against the proposals but Mr Swann and other Stormont ministers said the use of vaccination status certification would save lives.\nAt present, executive advice on working from home is that people should continue to do so where they can.\nNew Covid-19 advice coming into effect in the Republic of Ireland on Friday is for anyone who can work from home to do so unless it is necessary to do otherwise.\nIrish bars, restaurants and nightclubs will also close at the earlier time of midnight.\nIt is understood that in Mr Swann's document he suggests that a decision taken by the executive on 23 September encouraging employers to \"begin planning a gradual return to the workplace\" for employees should be reversed.\nThe proposal states: \"I believe that message should be reversed to once again advise employees to work from home where they can and to advise employers to support this where possible.\"\nIt goes on to say that the message should be communicated by stating that if a person worked from home when the pandemic began in March 2020 then \"they should be working from home now\".\nAdvice from health officials suggests strengthening the message would help reduce the risk of transmission of coronavirus inside and outside workplaces.\nSir Michael, the chief medical officer, told BBC News NI on Friday that research had shown that working from home was \"one of the single most effective interventions\" to control the virus.\n\"It reduces mixing in the workplace, it reduces infection and transmission in the workplace but also travelling to and from the workplace,\" he said.\n\"There is strong scientific evidence that it is an effective intervention.\"\nHe said the level of transmission of the virus in Northern Ireland needs to be brought \"back under control\".\n\"Now is the time to act, we have time to act, we have a number of weeks to act and take action immediately,\" he said.\nIt is understood that in the advice paper Mr Swann has also proposed giving the Stormont assembly a debate on the Covid passport regulations before they become enforceable on 13 December.\nThe DUP had called for that to happen ahead of the measures taking effect.\nIt is understood that the document also advises ensuring enforcement against those breaching existing Covid restrictions, including people who do not comply with wearing face coverings where they are legally required.\nMr Swann said that unless that happened the public would see \"compliance as unimportant and optional\" and would lessen the benefits of wearing face coverings.\nSDLP MLA Colin McGrath said he believed the police should be enforcing penalties for people not wearing face coverings.\nSir Michael told BBC News NI that wider restrictions had to be considered in sectors \"where we know the risks are higher\".\n\"The Covid certificates for domestic use is one way of putting in those wider restrictions and keeping those higher risk settings open,\" he said.\nThe health minister is also understood to have said in his paper that communications on public health are \"much more effective when delivered with a united voice by all executive ministers\".\nIt is understood the minister is proposing that the executive asks the assembly speaker to allow a debate or an alternative method to allow MLAs to consider the regulations.\nThe executive will have to consider Mr Swann's paper but it is not clear yet when that may happen.\nAlliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw said she was concerned that Northern Ireland was moving \"into a very bleak Christmas for people\".\n\"We want people to enjoy their Christmas but it has to be with risk mitigations in place,\" she said."

      "tags": "Afghanistan",
      "text": "A group of Afghan girl footballers have flown into the UK, the culmination of an extraordinary rescue effort that began after the Taliban seized power.\nThe costly operation brought together an unlikely cast of characters, from Muslim sports-people to spies, philanthropists, and a Hasidic rabbi.  \nThe girls - aged between 13 and 19 - arrived from Pakistan overnight. \nTheir flight was chartered by a Jewish aid organisation and was paid for by the US star, Kim Kardashian-West.\n\"It's Mission Accomplished,\" said Khalida Popal, former manager of Afghanistan's national women's team, who co-ordinated their rescue from Denmark. \"I'm so happy and so proud of these girls. They were traumatised. They've been through so much and managed to stay strong. Now they can start a new life and breathe freedom.\"\nRabbi Moshe Margaretten, President & Founder of the Jewish aid group, the Tzedek Association, expressed his relief. \"As the son and grandson of Holocaust survivors,  a time when righteous non-Jewish people stepped up to the plate to help save so many Jewish people, I know in my heart that we must be there for others in their time of need at a time when their very lives are at risk,\" he said.\nThe teenagers, mostly from the Afghan provinces, all feared for their lives when the Taliban captured their cities. Some of their families had received death threats.\n\"People were searching houses for them\" Ms Popal told the BBC. \nTerrified, they made their way to Kabul and were due to be evacuated to the Gulf state of Qatar at the end of August.\nThey were almost within sight of the airport when they were pulled off their buses because of security warnings. Two hours later, the airport was struck by a suicide bomb, killing more than 180 people.\nSo they went into hiding. \n10 days later, following intense lobbying on their behalf, they were given the personal permission of the Pakistani Prime Minister, Imran Khan, to cross the border. \nBut they only had temporary Pakistani visas. \nWith the clock ticking, a frantic effort to find them a new home began.\nThe girls had the support of Leeds United Football club chairman Andrea Radrizzani. They also had the ear of the UK government - through a chain of former interpreters for the British military and influential veterans. Last month, they were granted visas.\nBut they still needed funding to get them on a flight. Reality TV star Kim Kardashian-West and her shapewear company SKIMS agreed to cover the costs. \nA charter was organised, which flew the group of 130 people into Stansted airport last night. They are due to spend the next 10 days in quarantine.\n\"We've achieved our first goal,\" Khalida Popal told the BBC. \"The next goal is to work with footballing organisations to help them start new careers in football.\"  \n\"So many people were involved,\" Ms Popal said. \"It's the hardest thing I've done in my life.\"\nIn separate rescue missions, the women's national team was flown to Australia as part of the mass Western evacuation in August. And members of Afghanistan girls' team were given asylum in Portugal.\nBut dozens of young Afghan female footballers remain stuck in Afghanistan, desperate for a way out."

This was attributed to wear and tear of the spine.\nMr Biden, the oldest US president to take office, had his last full medical examination in December 2019.\nAt the time, his doctor released a medical report describing him as \"healthy, vigorous\" and \"fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nThe government wasn't fully prepared for the impact of Covid-19, lacking detailed plans on shielding, job support schemes and school disruption, according to a report by spending watchdog the National Audit Office. It says planning had centred on a flu pandemic or infectious diseases such as Ebola, and not an illness with the characteristics of Covid involving a lower mortality rate but the ability to spread via people with no symptoms. The government says the pandemic presented unprecedented challenges to health systems around the world.\nIt seems people may have heeded warnings to do their Christmas shopping early, in light of supply problems caused in part by the pandemic. People spent more on clothing and toys in October, with retail sales 0.8% higher than in September, according to the Office for National Statistics, with some retailers suggesting early Christmas trading boosted sales.\nNorthern Ireland's health minister is arguing \"people should be working from home\" again, if they did so at the start of the pandemic. A document issued by Robin Swann to the Stormont executive suggests reversing the guidance issued to employers in September to \"begin planning a gradual return to the workplace\", BBC News understands. On Wednesday, Northern Ireland's Department of Health said more restrictions before Christmas were possible but it was likely there will be a debate in the assembly before any changes come into force.\nNHS doctors have spoken out about receiving abusive messages from coronavirus sceptics and anti-lockdown protesters. And in the US, deep political divides over mask and vaccine mandates have deepened since the Covid vaccine became widely available. One doctor in Tennessee tells us she's been forced away from her home after facing threats and taunts.\nHas Covid changed the way we shop forever - even with major purchases, such as cars? Cazoo and Cinch are among a new breed of car dealer allowing shoppers to buy, part-exchange and finance used vehicles entirely online. And Nathan Coe, from car advertising giant AutoTrader, says it has started a ripple effect, with traditional dealerships also shifting more of their sales process online. Some buyers love the ease of the process. However, Emma Hull who bought online tells us \"never again\" after her Audi A1 arrived dirty and scratched on delivery.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWondering which children are being vaccinated - and why? Here's our explainer.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Parents in England must be allowed to buy some uniform from High Street shops as well as school suppliers, according to new government rules.\nSecond-hand items should be made available and the cost of anything branded must be kept to a minimum.\nEducation Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said the legally binding guidelines would make uniforms \"far more affordable\".\nThe move has been welcomed by education unions - but child poverty campaigners say more action is needed.\nResearch by the government, in 2015, suggested parents could save almost \u00a350 on average, if they bought all uniform items from High Street shops instead of designated suppliers.\nMany schools have already tried to reduce costs, in line with voluntary guidelines, but this new statutory advice strengthens that obligation. \nFrom next autumn, items with logos should be kept to a minimum and more uniform from any shop, such as supermarkets, should be allowed.\nSchools are also being asked to make sure second-hand uniforms are available as an affordable and sustainable option.  \nMr Zahawi said school uniforms \"should be a real source of pride\" and not \"a burden for parents or a barrier to pupils accessing education\".\n \"This new binding guidance will help to make uniforms far more affordable for families by driving costs down as we work hard to level up the country,\" he said.\nJohn Adams, an Open University student and parenting blogger in Kent, says it has cost him \u00a3100 to kit out just one of his daughters for school this term.\nThat was for two shirts, two skirts and a pair of school shoes. \nHe says branded items are the most expensive and uniform in general is becoming more costly now his eldest is nearly in adult sizes. \nAnd he even encouraged his daughters to wear their PE kit at home during Covid lockdowns.\n\"Why not? It had been paid for and they were at home so much they weren't getting worn at school,\" he says.\n\"Kids do also get a lot of use out of uniform and there's no question that school uniform endures a lot of abuse.\n\"That said, it never ceases to amaze me how much I spend on uniform.\"\nMr Adams, who runs Dad Blog UK, adds the new rules' emphasis on the environmental benefits of second-hand uniforms will help remove the \"ridiculous stigma\" around reused items.\nMatt Easter, who co-chairs the Schoolwear Association industry body, welcomed the statutory guidance, which he said would help ensure \"parents get good value for money\" without placing \"unreasonable burdens on schools or uniform suppliers\".\n\"Importantly, it reinforces that the majority of schools are already doing the right thing and, in most cases, will already be fully, or almost, compliant,\" he said.\nAssociation of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton also welcomed the statutory guidance but added: \"Schools already follow the government's non-statutory guidance on school uniform.\n\"Schools are acutely aware of the need to keep uniform costs to a minimum, particularly as they often have many students who come from disadvantaged homes. \n\"They deal on a daily basis with the impact of the high level of child poverty the government has failed to address.\"\nChild Poverty Action Group chief executive Alison Garnham said the guidance was \"just the first step\", schools needed to \"develop approaches that support all families\" and the government should fund local authorities in England to provide clothing grants for parents on low incomes.\n\"We know that parents struggle with the cost of school uniform and that kids are excluded from activities for not having the right kit,\" Ms Garnham said.\n\"No parent should have to go into debt to buy school uniform. \n\"No child should be priced out of participation at school.\""

      "tags": "Belarus border crisis,Belarus,European Union,Poland,Migration",
      "text": "For almost two weeks, Shwan Kurd has been stuck in limbo. The 33-year-old from Iraq is one of thousands of migrants currently stranded at the Belarus-Poland border.\nThey have been caught up in a political tussle between the European Union and Belarus's leader, Alexander Lukashenko. He has been accused of funnelling migrants through Belarus to destabilise EU nations in revenge for sanctions - something his government denies.\nCold, hungry and exhausted, Mr Kurd is convinced Poland will let him cross the border, allowing him to seek a new life of opportunities in the EU.\nBetween him and that life stands a forbidding barbed-wire fence and hundreds of Polish soldiers. In a landscape reminiscent of a war zone, the crisis on the Poland-Belarus border has reached a chaotic stalemate.\n\"We're still at the border line,\" Mr Kurd told the BBC on Thursday. \"There are so many Polish soldiers.\"\nThose soldiers have markedly increased in number since a large group of migrants attempted to cross the border on Monday. The group came from the capital, Minsk, and converged on a crossing at Kuznica, near Grodno in north-west Belarus.\nThere, some migrants tried to force their way through Poland's barrier, using tools to cut the barbed wire. \nPoland accused Belarusian border guards of helping them, calling it a major provocation. While some migrants managed to slip through, most did not, leaving them with few options.\nPoland won't let them cross but, according to some migrants, nor will Belarusian border guards allow them to return to Minsk either. Unsure about where to turn next, many of the migrants have settled in a make-shift camp near the Kuznica crossing.\nMr Kurd spoke to us from the camp, where he had been sleeping for days in freezing overnight temperatures, metres from Poland's barbed-wire fence.\n\"We need supplies, there are children here. No food has been given to us,\" Mr Kurd said.\nJournalists and aid groups say they have not been able to access the area since Poland declared a state of emergency on its border with Belarus in September. The measure gave Poland powers to restrict the movement of people along the frontier.\nAras Nader, a British-Iraq, has been working as an interpreter for Grupa Granica, a network of Polish NGOs. He told the BBC he attempted to reach the border recently to find his wife and children, who were on the Belarusian side.\n\"I begged the police because my family is stuck. I told them on the phone, they are hungry, they don't have anything,\" he said. \n\"I just asked them to let me through with food and water. But they didn't let me and asked me to pay a fine.\"\nHis family eventually managed to get through the border despite the strict controls, which haven't stopped migrants arriving in ever-greater numbers.\nMr Kurd said he flew to Minsk from the Iraqi capital Baghdad at the start of November. \nHe said there was no work for him in his country, which has been ripped apart by war in recent decades and has an economy that's heavily dependent on oil.\n\"We have nothing. There's no life in our country,\" he said. \"We hope to arrive and enjoy life, that's all. We want to do our jobs. We have so many good people - doctors, scientists, teachers.\"\nMr Kurd may soon be followed by many others. Some 300km (186 miles) from the Polish border in Minsk, many more migrants are preparing to tread the same uncertain path.\nBy Tuesday morning, about 300 mostly Iraqi migrants had gathered in Minsk's central square.\nBBC journalist Will Vernon spoke to several of them in the square. Their stories were all the same. They were waiting, they said, to go to the Polish border - a four-hour drive away, at least.\nThey said they had paid for a visa and flights as part of a package costing several thousand dollars.\nMazyar and his friends, from Iraq, said they paid about $3,000-4,000 (\u00a32,200-2,900). \"We want to get to Germany or the UK,\" he said.\nOthers on the square alleged they had been beaten and badly treated by Belarus police officers and soldiers, who had tried to force them towards neighbouring Lithuania instead of Poland.\nOne man said he had been sleeping on the street, braving Minsk's sub-zero night-time temperatures.\nThe EU has accused Belarus of enticing these migrants with the false promise of easy entry to its member states. They are flown in and pushed towards the border by Belarusian forces as part of an \"inhuman, gangster-style approach\", the EU has alleged.\nThis week, as the crisis reached fever pitch, the EU listed some 20 countries from which migrants have flown into Minsk, mainly on tourist visas. Many have come from countries in Asia and the Middle East, particularly Iraq.\nEarlier this year, the BBC followed the journey of one group from Iraq to the EU via Belarus. They bought their visas and flights from a travel agency in Iraq before paying smugglers to take them to the border.\nThey made it to EU countries, but others are not so fortunate.\nOn the Belarusian side of the border, the mood flickers between hope and desperation. For Mr Kurd, the new life he covets is so close, yet so far.\n\"So many people's lives are in danger if we don't arrive,\" Mr Kurd said.\n\"So many little children and old people. Some people are sick, some people can't walk. But there are no supplies and no medicine here. Every night, the temperature is under zero. It's so, so cold.\""

      "text": "Two men convicted of the murder in 1965 of the US civil rights leader Malcolm X have had their convictions quashed.\nMuhammad Aziz and Khalil Islam did not get the justice they deserved, the Manhattan District Attorney said. \nThe State Supreme Court said a reinvestigation found \"significant evidence that was not known at the time of the trial\" and which would likely have seen the men acquitted.\nMalcolm X was shot dead at a New York City ballroom in front of his family. \nAziz and Islam - along with a third man, Thomas Hagan - were convicted of the murder, and sentenced to life in prison. \nThe three men - members of the Nation of Islam political and religious movement - have all since been paroled. Islam died in 2009.\nState Supreme Court Justice Ellen Biben said if the newly uncovered evidence had been presented at trial, it would have created a probability that the \"verdict would have been more favourable\".\nShe told the men she regretted the court could not fully undo the \"serous miscarriage of justice... and give you back the years that were lost\".\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance apologised for what had been \"serious, unacceptable violations of law and the public trust\" and said the men had not got the justice they deserved.\nA review of the convictions was launched in 2020, after the District Attorney met representatives of the Innocence Project, a non-profit legal group campaigning for justice for individuals it said had been wrongly convicted.\nEarlier this year Malcolm X's daughters requested that the murder investigation be reopened in light of new evidence.\nThey cited a deathbed letter from a man who was a policeman at the time of the 1965 killing, alleging New York police and the FBI conspired in the murder.\nMalcolm X was a charismatic advocate for black empowerment. After years as the prominent spokesman for the Nation of Islam - which advocated separatism for black Americans - his views later became more moderate. He was 39 when he was killed."

      "tags": "Austria,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Days after Austria imposed a lockdown on the unvaccinated, it has announced a full national Covid-19 lockdown starting on Monday.\nChancellor Alexander Schallenberg said it would last a maximum of 20 days and there would be a legal requirement to get vaccinated from 1 February 2022.\nHe was responding to record case numbers and one of the lowest vaccination levels in Western Europe.\nMany other European countries are imposing restrictions as cases rise.\n\"We don't want a fifth wave,\" said Mr Schallenberg after meeting the governors of Austria's nine provinces at a resort in the west of the country.\nFor a long time, there had been a consensus over avoiding mandatory vaccinations, the chancellor said.  \nHowever, too many people had been incited not to get the jab, because of \"too many political forces, flimsy vaccination opponents and fake news\", he added. The measures are yet to be finalised.\nLatest figures show the incidence rate has risen to 1,049.9 cases per 100,000 people in the past week, and Health Minister Wolfgang M\u00fcckstein said imposing a lockdown was a \"last resort\". A record 15,809 cases were reported in the past 24 hours, in a population of under nine million.\nUnder the measures, Austrians will be asked to work from home, non-essential shops will close, and schools will remain open for children who require face-to-face learning. They will continue until 12 December, but will be reassessed after 10 days.\nNeighbouring Germany has seen several days of record infections this week, and Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken of \"a national emergency that requires a combined national effort\". \nGerman leaders have already agreed to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated people in areas with high hospital admissions. And parliament has backed requirements for people to show Covid passes on buses and trains, and in workplaces. \nBut now in Bavaria, which borders Austria, state premier Markus S\u00f6der has gone further, declaring  a \"de facto lockdown for the unvaccinated\". Bars and clubs will close for three weeks and all Christmas markets have been cancelled. Where weekly incidence rates top 1,000 per 100,000 people - restaurants, hotels, sport and culture will also close. \nSlovak Prime Minister Eduard Heger has already announced that a \"lockdown for the unvaccinated\" will start on Monday, and the Czech government is also limiting access to a variety of services. The Netherlands introduced a partial lockdown last weekend.\nIn the UK - where there is currently no lockdown, although masks have to be worn in some parts of the country - the incidence rate per 100,000 is 395.4 cases, officials figures show.\nAustria's is the first full lockdown imposed by an EU country this winter. \nThe Europe regional director of the World Health Organization, Hans Kluge, has warned of a hard winter ahead. He blamed insufficient vaccination coverage along with \"the easing of preventive measures and the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant\".\nRussia on Friday declared a record number of 1,254 Covid deaths in the past 24 hours, for the third day in a row. \nHungary reported its highest level of infections - with 11,289 new cases in a population of 10 million. A third booster jab will be made mandatory for health workers from Saturday, along with masks in most enclosed spaces.\nTighter restrictions also come into force in Belgium on Saturday, requiring working from home for four days a week.\nThere are only two ways for countries to slow the spread of Covid - build up enough immunity or limit contact between other people. \nThat wall of immunity - from a year of vaccination - is facing its first real test as winter rolls in across Europe.\nIt is already clear some countries - Austria being the most notable - have not vaccinated enough and feel the \"need\" to go back to restrictions that nobody \"wants\".\nBut it does not mean that every country is doomed to a winter lockdown.\nThose that have vaccinated more, given boosters to more and protected more of the vulnerable and elderly (who are the most likely to need hospital care) have the best shot at a manageable winter.\nThe impact of the UK having high levels of Covid through autumn, which will have topped up immunity levels, will be closely watched too.\nHowever, it is still only November. There are many dark months to get through before the weather improves and makes it harder for Covid to spread.\nDo you live in Europe? What are your experiences with coronavirus and vaccination?

      "text": "The suspicious death of a prominent Belarusian dissident - Vitaly Shishov - in Kyiv follows other unsolved cases involving Belarusian dissidents stretching back years. \nUkrainian police have opened a murder inquiry after finding Shishov hanged in a park, a day after he disappeared in the Ukrainian capital.\nThere are suspicions that agents loyal to authoritarian Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko were responsible. Shishov was running a group in Ukraine looking after Belarusians who had fled Mr Lukashenko's large-scale police crackdown, which began last August.\nAnother high-profile Belarusian dissident died in Kyiv in July 2016, blown up by a car bomb: journalist Pavel Sheremet. His hard-hitting coverage of political oppression in Belarus angered the authorities. Sheremet was jailed in 1997, beaten up in 2004 and then he emigrated to Russia, where he was a star TV reporter.\nSheremet also criticised both Russia's military intervention in Ukraine in 2014 and what he considered Ukraine's mistakes in relation to Russia. \nIn Kyiv he worked for Ukrayinska Pravda, an investigative news website founded by journalist Georgy Gongadze, who exposed official corruption. Gongadze was murdered in 2000, his headless body discovered in woods. Three policemen were later jailed in the case.\nAmnesty International called the murder of Sheremet \"a heinous crime\" and \"despicable attack on freedom of expression\". It demanded a thorough, independent investigation.\nIn 2010 the founder of the Belarus dissident group Charter 97, Oleg Bebenin, was found hanged at his weekend home outside Minsk. Officials said he had committed suicide - a claim rejected by his colleagues, who said he had been committed to his work and had not hinted at any personal problems.\nOne of them, Dmitry Bondarenko, saw Bebenin's body and reported suspicious injuries: a broken ankle, cuts and scratches on his hands and chest, and bruises on his back.\nThe still unresolved disappearances of four high-profile Belarusian dissidents in 1999-2000 have been strongly condemned by Western politicians and human rights groups. They have urged Mr Lukashenko to investigate them properly.\nHowever in 2011 a US State Department report on human rights abuses in Belarus noted: \"there was evidence of government involvement in these cases, but authorities continued to deny any connection with the disappearances\".\nThe four were: \nThe Council of Europe (CoE) - the top European human rights watchdog - said its own investigation pointed to \"steps taken at the highest level of the state to actively cover up the true background of the disappearances\".\nThe CoE report also named several top Belarusian officials suspected of involvement in the disappearances. It demanded a proper Belarusian investigation.\nIn 2001 two ex-staff from the Belarus prosecutor's office who had fled abroad, claimed that Zakharenko, Gonchar and Krasovsky had been killed by a special forces \"death squad\". Later an ex-special forces soldier made a similar claim. Mr Lukashenko denied ordering any such operation, Radio Free Europe reported.\nWATCH: Belarus police crackdown in 2020"

      "text": "The Metropolitan Police has apologised to the families of four men murdered by the serial killer Stephen Port.\nPort is serving a whole-life term for killing Anthony Walgate, Gabriel Kovari, Daniel Whitworth and Jack Taylor in Barking over 16 months.\nInquests are examining whether the Met Police's investigations into the murders were adequate.\nGiving evidence at the hearings, a senior police officer said the force was \"deeply sorry\" over its response.\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Cundy told the inquests at Barking Town Hall: \"It is a matter of personal disappointment to me that many of the things that should have been done weren't done.\n\"I am deeply sorry, personally and on behalf of the [Metropolitan Police Service], that we didn't conduct the initial investigations to the standards that you rightly expected.\"\nMr Walgate, Mr Kovari, Mr Whitworth, and Mr Taylor, who were all in their early 20s, were killed by overdoses of GHB administered by Port at his east London home, between June 2014 and September 2015.\nThe inquests have heard about a long series of failures in the four investigations.\nJohn Pape, a friend of Mr Kovari, previously told the inquest jury that he thought the Met was \"institutionally homophobic\".\nHe said the force had not taken the deaths as seriously as it would have done if the victims were young women who had died after ingesting date-rape drugs.\nThe force has argued that the failings were due to incompetence, rather than homophobia."

      "title": "HS2 rail extension to Leeds scrapped amid promise to transform rail",
      "tags": "Rail travel,HS2,High Speed Rail,Northern Powerhouse Rail,Grant Shapps",
      "text": "The government has scrapped the Leeds leg of the HS2 high-speed rail line as part of a package that ministers promise will transform services.\nThe prime minister said the overhaul would mean faster travel up to 10 years earlier than planned, and said claims of broken promises are \"total rubbish\".\nThe package won support from some business leaders, and anti-HS2 groups.\nBut Boris Johnson faced criticism that he had reneged on investment promises to the Midlands and north of England.\nThe axing of a new East Midlands-Leeds high-speed line, with HS2 trains now to run on existing upgraded routes, and a scaling back of the Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) project, drew strong condemnation.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson had \"ripped up\" promises he made that HS2 would go all the way to Leeds and that there would be a new NPR line from Manchester to Leeds.\n\"This was the first test of 'levelling up' and the government has completely failed and let down everybody in the North. You can't believe a word the Prime Minister says,\" he said.\nThere was also criticism that a significant portion of the \u00a396bn pledged as new investment has already been announced, such as \u00a3360m to improve ticketing.\nOn a visit to a Network Rail logistics hub near Selby, Mr Johnson dismissed the charges of broken promises as \"total rubbish\", insisting the government would deliver on them \"eventually\".\n\"Of course there are going to be people who always want everything at once. And there are lots of people who are [going to] say, look, what we should do is carve huge new railways through virgin territory, smashing through unspoilt countryside and villages and do it all at once,\" he said.\nAnd in a BBC interview later the prime minister said that laying new track through countryside would take decades to complete.\nMr Johnson said: \"You can wait decades and dig up virgin countryside and plough through villages, but you have to wait an awful lot longer and it costs an awful lot more. \n\"I'm afraid that we are going to be building a huge amount of new line but what we're doing is doing it in the most efficient possible way and to bring the maximum possible commuter benefits.\" \nIn addition to the HS2 changes, there is also a scaling back of a new Trans-Pennine rail route between Manchester and Leeds as part of the NPR project to improve links between major northern cities. \nThe route between Leeds and Manchester will now be a combination of new track and enhancements to existing infrastructure.\n\"We're cutting journey times from Manchester in half from 2 hours 9 min to 1 hour 11 min,\" said Mr Johnson.\n\"We're also cutting times from Manchester to Leeds from 55 min to 33 min and [creating] a crossrail for the Midlands for the first time.\"\nHe added that there would also be a new high-speed line taking the time needed to travel from the West Midlands to East Midlands, from 1 hour 14 min down to 26 min. \n\"What that means is you will be able to have HS2 trains all the way up to Sheffield, taking half an hour off the time up to Sheffield,\" Mr Johnson stressed.\n\"You will have a crossrail for the north, a crossrail for the Midlands and then the HS2.\"\nTory MP Robbie Moore, whose Keighley seat sits close to Bradford, said he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the plan, which had \"completely short-changed\" his constituents.\nBradford had expected to be included on the proposed Leeds to Manchester route and to see a station built to accommodate new trains.\n\"We are one of the most socially deprived parts of the UK and we must get better transport connectivity,\" Mr Moore said.\nDelivering the Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) in the Commons, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs it was an \"ambitious and unparalleled programme\" to overhaul inter-city links across the north and Midlands, and \"speed up the benefits for local areas and serves destinations people most want to reach\".\nWork has already started on the first phase of HS2, linking London and the West Midlands. The next section will extend the line to Crewe.\nThe final phase was to take HS2 to Manchester and Leeds.\nCommenting on plans for rail links between the East Midlands to Leeds, Mr Shapps said: \"We'll study how best to take HS2 trains into Leeds as well\".\nHowever, that is likely to be via upgrades to existing rail network, a move condemned by MPs and regional business leaders who said a high-speed line was vital to the economic growth of the Midlands and north England.\nLabour MP Hilary Benn, who represents Leeds Central, said: \"Today that promise has been broken, and Leeds and the North have been betrayed.\"\nAndy Bagnall, director general of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said: \"While millions of people will benefit from this major investment in boosting connectivity between major cities in the North of England and the Midlands, leaving out key pieces of the jigsaw will inevitably hold back the ability for the railways to power the levelling up agenda and the drive to net zero.\"\nby Katy Austin, BBC transport correspondent\nThe government's argument is that faster delivery at lower cost is now the best approach. It also makes the case for putting cash towards better local services, not just high speed inter-city connections. \nThat won't wash with those who will accept nothing but the original proposals for both HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail - with their full capacity benefits, as well as journey times. They feel a promise is being broken. \nBradford is one example of this; a city whose leaders view a new, full high-speed link to both Manchester and Leeds as essential to regeneration.\nOpponents of HS2 - a controversial project - will see today's news as a relief. Although the door has not been fully closed to the eastern leg being completed at some future date. \nHowever, businesses in Yorkshire who hoped HS2 would bring jobs, investment and confidence, albeit not for a while, feel that opportunity has just been diminished. \nLabour also point out that despite the \u00a396bn label, much of this money had already been earmarked for HS2.\n'Waste of money'\nNews that part of HS2 was being scrapped was met with \"elation\" by campaigners against the line.\nSandra Haith, from an anti-HS2 group in Bramley, Rotherham, said she was pleased, \"not only as a resident of Bramley, but as a taxpayer. It's a complete waste of money\".\nShe said: \"The eastern leg costs a lot of money and it basically connects two cities. We can't get on it. We've got all the pain and no gain.\"\nHowever, business people warned about the economic loss from scrapping the HS2 line. James Greenhalgh, who runs the Flamingos Coffee House, in Leeds, told the BBC it would deter investment in the city.\n\"We want to encourage other businesses to move up from London, up to Leeds, get people moving around and coming to our city centre. It is really tough, it is stopping businesses from expanding,\" he said.\nThere was praise, though, from business leaders at regional trade body Midlands Connect.\nChairman Sir John Peace said: \"Although these plans are different in some respects to what we'd expected, there are a lot of positives in here and lots of things to be excited about - a new high-speed connection between Birmingham and East Midlands Parkway, direct links onto HS2 for Derby, Nottingham, and Chesterfield and a commitment to the Midlands Rail Hub.\""

Mick gave so much to this planet and he adored David. Mick's journey shall continue.\"\nAs well as being Bowie's official photographer, he also directed videos for Jean Genie and Space Oddity.\nHe went on to work with modern artists like Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga, Snoop Dogg and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.\nRock was born in London in 1948 and studied at Cambridge University, where he started to take photographs of local gigs and made contacts including Cambridge native Barrett and Mick Jagger's younger brother Chris.\nHis own life was caught on camera in Barnaby Clay's 2016 film Shot! The Psycho-Spiritual Mantra of Rock, which Rock dedicated to \"the timeless genius of David Bowie and Lou Reed\".\n\"They made an important contribution to the development of my own sensibility,\" he told Rolling Stone in 2017.\n\"When I was having trouble, they both helped me out financially. They bought my prints. When I was in the hospital for my heart bypass surgery, the first flowers that were there waiting for me were from Lou and David.\"\nPaying tribute, Charlatans frontman Tim Burgess said Rock \"made music look so exciting\".\nMusic journalist Simon Price wrote: \"'Iconic' is an overused word, but Mick Rock's photos are that.\"\nThe cause of his death has not yet been announced.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Ministry of Justice,Parole Board",
      "text": "Double child killer Colin Pitchfork has been arrested and recalled to prison, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has said.\nHe was released two months ago after spending 33 years in jail for murdering two teenage girls in the 1980s.\nIt is understood Pitchfork, 61, was returned to custody on Friday over a breach of licence conditions.\nThe BBC was told staff at a hostel where he was living had grown increasingly concerned about elements of his behaviour.\nHowever, there was no suggestion any further offence had been committed.\nA Probation Service spokesperson said: \"Protecting the public is our number one priority.\n\"When offenders breach the conditions of their release and potentially pose an increased risk, we don't hesitate to return them to custody.\"\nPitchfork was jailed in 1988 for raping and murdering 15-year-olds Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth in Leicestershire.\nHe raped and strangled Lynda Mann in Narborough in November 1983 and killed Dawn Ashworth three years later.\nIn June, the Parole Board concluded it was safe to release Pitchfork, who was the first murderer to be convicted using DNA evidence.\nUpon his release, the MoJ said Pitchfork, 61, would remain under supervision for the rest of his life.\nThe BBC's home and legal correspondent Dominic Casciani said hostel staff had become concerned about some elements of his general behaviour and engagement with them.\nThey concluded he was not being as honest as he could be - although there was not one specific incident that triggered an alarm.\nDawn Ashworth's mother said she was \"pleased\" the child killer had been recalled to prison.\nBarbara Ashworth said: \"I'm pleased that he's been put away and women and girls are safe and protected from him now.\n\"It's a safer place when he's behind bars and I won't have to worry about other people being hurt by him for the time being.\n\"But there's always the worry that he might get out again, he seems to have a lot of people on his side who give him the benefit of the doubt.\n\"But for now, I have to be pleased about the news.\" \nColin Pitchfork spent a number of years preparing for potential release in an open prison but instead of being returned there, tonight he is in a closed jail.\nIn practice that means he now faces significant obstacles in winning the right to be released again.\nIn 28 days the Parole Board will formally review what to do with him - and typically in a situation like this they order a full hearing.\nThat is not likely to take place until the Spring and it might only look at whether Pitchfork should stay in a closed prison rather than be re-released. \nEven if he were allowed to return to an open prison, he probably would not be able to make another application to be released on licence until at least the middle of 2023.\nPitchfork repeatedly argued in jail that he was fit to be released.\nHis recall will however come as vindication to those who said he should never have got out.\nAnd included in that group is the former Justice Secretary Robert Buckland who challenged the decision to release the killer. \nSouth Leicestershire MP Alberto Costa had campaigned to stop the murderer's release.\nHe said: \"I was informed earlier this evening by the policing minister that double child rapist and killer Colin Pitchfork has been recalled to prison.\n\"Pitchfork's behaviour has given sufficient cause for concern to the probation authorities.\n\"Pitchfork is under the most stringent of licence conditions and perhaps this recall evidences that those conditions are working.\n\"I will urgently take this matter up with the government to ensure that public safety remains the number one focus.\"\nPitchfork was subject to more than 40 licence conditions including living at a designated address, taking part in probation supervision, wearing an electronic tag, taking part in lie detector tests and having to disclose what vehicles he used and who he spoke to, with particular limits on contact with children.\nHe was also subject to a curfew, had restrictions on using technology and limits on where he went, and was banned from entering Leicestershire without the permission of officials.\nThe government had formally challenged Pitchfork's release on the grounds it was \"irrational\" after widespread criticism of the decision.\nThe challenge had quoted professional witnesses as saying he had the \"capacity to manipulate and deceive the professionals he had worked with\".\nIt detailed an incident where Pitchfork had lied to a female shopworker while out of prison on temporary licence, telling her he was married when he was not after giving her chocolates \"to thank her for fixing his phone\".\nHowever, the challenge was rejected by a judge-led review in July, leaving opponents powerless to halt the release.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Travellers who have had a booster dose of a Covid jab in England are now able to prove their vaccination status using the NHS Covid Pass. \nIt enables quarantine-free travel to countries such as Israel, Croatia and Austria, which have a time limit for vaccination status to be valid. \nThird doses are not being added to the domestic pass as they are not currently needed to qualify as fully vaccinated.\nLast week booster jabs were extended to all over-40s in the UK. \nBooster doses were initially offered to over-50s, front-line health and social care staff and people with health conditions that put them at greater risk from the virus. \nMore than 13 million booster jabs have been administered in the UK so far. \nPeople can already prove whether they have had a first or second dose, a recent negative test or recently recovered from the virus using the NHS App. \nThe NHS Covid Pass is used for travel, as well as for entry to some domestic venues which require it. It will not be necessary to show proof of a booster to travel to England. \nIn England, it is not currently mandatory to show proof of vaccination for any venues. However, it is compulsory for nightclubs and large events in Scotland and cinemas, theatres, nightclubs and large events in Wales.\nThe Northern Ireland executive has also voted to introduce mandatory Covid passports in venues like nightclubs and cinemas. \nBooster jabs now show up automatically for users of the digital Covid pass in England, as of midday on Friday, but the information is not immediately available via the Covid Pass letter service. \nThe government said this would be updated in due course. \nBoosters will appear on the Covid Pass in Wales from 29 November. However, evidence of a third dose is not needed to enter venues in Wales which require a Covid Pass. \nTim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK welcomed the move, saying ensuring travel is as \"straightforward as possible is vital\". \n\"However, we still have a way to go to return to pre-pandemic levels of demand,\" he added. \nPaul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, said the development was \"a major step forward\", boosting confidence for people to book trips over the Christmas period. \nHowever, he said the government must \"urgently\" update the app so teenagers can also prove their vaccination status. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"We want to make it as easy as possible for people to show their vaccine status if they are travelling abroad.\n\"This update to the NHS Covid Pass will mean people can have their complete medical picture at their fingertips if they are going on holiday or seeing loved ones overseas.\"\nVaccines minister Maggie Throup urged people to get their booster as soon as they were eligible, saying it was \"the best way you can protect yourself ahead of winter\". \nResults from a UK trial of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine found a booster increased protection against symptomatic disease to nearly 95% in those aged 50 and above. \nAs well as boosters, some people with severely suppressed immune systems are being given a third primary jab as part of their basic vaccination - and they may also be offered a booster at a later date."

      "title": "Brexit: What is Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol?",
      "tags": "NI Brexit,Brexit",
      "text": "There is growing speculation that the UK is planning to use Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol in the coming weeks.\nThe Irish prime minster has warned that this would \"undermine\" relationships between the two countries.\nThe UK government says it \"would not go down this route gratuitously or with any particular pleasure\".\nIn October 2019, the UK and EU agreed a special Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, known as the protocol.\nIt leaves Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods.\nThat means that goods can flow freely between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, removing the threat of a \"hard border\".\nHowever, goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control - amounting to what is being referred to as an \"Irish Sea border\".\nArticle 16 of the protocol sets out the process for taking unilateral \"safeguard\" measures if either the EU or UK concludes that the deal is leading to serious practical problems or causing diversion of trade.\nThose safeguards would amount to suspending parts of the deal.\nSafeguard measures can be taken if the protocol is leading to serious \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\" that are liable to persist.\nSo, while it is not intended to be used for temporary or minor problems there is no specific guidance on what qualifies as a \"serious\" difficulty.\nAdditionally, it can be used if the protocol is leading to \"diversion of trade\", but again there is no guidance on how exactly that should be interpreted.\nIn July the UK government said that, in its opinion, the threshold has been reached for using safeguards, but it is choosing not to use them for now.\nA month's formal notice is supposed to be given before any action is taken, although immediate action is allowed in \"exceptional circumstances\".\nThat is not the intention. \nArticle 16 of the protocol sets out the process for taking unilateral \"safeguard\" measures if either the EU or UK concludes that the deal is leading to serious practical problems or causing diversion of trade.\nAdditionally, it says that priority shall be given to measures that will \"least disturb\" the functioning of the protocol.\nAfter safeguarding measures are implemented, negotiations should continue, with the measures being jointly reviewed every three months with a view to their abolition or limitation.\nHowever, this would still seem to give the UK government quite wide discretion on what action to take.\nIf it believes the rules for getting goods into NI from GB are irredeemably complicated it could move to entirely suspend articles 5, 7, 8 and 10 of the protocol which deal with customs, products standards, VAT and state aid.\nThat would effectively end the Irish Sea border and from the EU's perspective create a backdoor into its single market.\nSuch a move would be close to the approach to the Protocol laid out in the UK \"command paper\" in July \nThe paper described an arrangement where there would be \"no need for certificates and checks for individual items that are only ever intended to be consumed in Northern Ireland\".\nChecks and controls would still be carried out on goods destined for Ireland with these largely identified by the traders involved - a sort of \"honesty box border\".\nRaoul Ruparel, who was a senior Brexit advisor to Theresa May, says he thinks this sort of maximalist approach to Article 16 is likely.\n\"What the UK wants to do is quite clear. It will likely suspend parts of the protocol around the (Irish Sea) border - customs and agrifood especially,\" he tweeted.\n\"It will move to implement its approach as set out in the command paper.\"\nThe UK calculation may be that after a period of conflict the EU will ultimately reverse the entire thrust of its Northern Ireland policy since 2017 and accept that an ultra-light touch approach is sufficient to protect the single market.\nIf the EU concludes that the UK's actions create an \"imbalance\" between its rights and obligations under the protocol, then it can take \"proportionate rebalancing measures\".\nThese are not defined and would largely be determined by what the UK does.\nSam Lowe, an analyst at the Centre for European Reform, says if, for example, the UK were to suspend the entire protocol, and \"in effect dare the EU to either enforce a border between Ireland and Northern Ireland or between Ireland and the rest of the EU, we should expect the EU's response to be explosive\".\nHowever, he thinks if the UK still enforces some controls on goods entering Northern Ireland from great Britain, the EU's response will probably be \"more measured\".\n\"In terms of immediate response, any EU rebalancing measures would need to be proportionate, and 'strictly necessary to remedy the imbalance'. \n\"These caveats limit the scope of the EU's immediate (legal) response,\" he added.\nThe EU is also understood to be preparing legal measures which, for example, could challenge the scope of the UK's Article 16 actions.\nUltimately, the EU could impose tariffs on UK goods but that would only be possible after a lengthy arbitration process.\nThe arbitrators would first have to find that the UK is in breach of the protocol.\nThen the UK would have to refuse to remedy that breach, at which point the EU could retaliate under the terms of the wider Brexit deal, the TCA.\nIt could require another arbitration process to rule whether the use of tariffs is proportionate retaliation.\nThere is a potentially faster legal track known as infringement proceedings which could lead to the UK being fined.\nThe EU could also take more informal political measures.\nAnton Spisak, policy lead at the Tony Blair Institute, tweeted that the EU's response to \"an expansive use of Article 16 will have to be robust enough to have a deterrent effect\".\nHe suggests that would mean \"quick, unilateral and asymmetrical actions that can be passed easily through the European Council\".\nThese measures could include blocking UK accession to Horizon Europe research programme.\nIf the EU thinks arbitration and legal action would take too long to have an effect it could reach for the nuclear option.\nA clause in the TCA allows either side to terminate the whole deal with a year's notice. \nNine months notice is required if it is just the trade elements of the deal which are to be terminated.\nIf that happened it would effectively set a course for a no-deal Brexit, with tariffs on a broad range of goods and other significant barriers to EU-UK trade.\nMujtaba Rahman, analyst at the Eurasia Group consultancy, says this is figuring in EU considerations.\n\"I expect no intermediate step such as tariffs. Just an immediate, emergency EU Council & political decision to suspend the UK-EU trade deal,\" he tweeted.\nHe added that would mean next year would see \"a re-run of Brexit... with renegotiation of Irish border issue, with threat of no-deal tariffs looming in the background\"."

      "tags": "Democratic Republic of Congo,Joseph Kabila",
      "text": "Companies owned by family and friends of former Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila had millions of dollars of public funds funnelled through their bank accounts, according to Africa's biggest data leak.\nThe money was transferred to the companies' accounts at the Congolese arm of the BGFI bank. \nMillions of dollars in cash were then taken out of the accounts.\nMr Kabila was president at the time of the bank transfers. \nIn a statement published online, he called the reports \"unfounded accusations\".\nThe leak included more than three million documents and information on millions of transactions from the BGFI (Banque Gabonaise et Fran\u00e7aise Internationale) bank, which works in several African countries and France. Online French investigative journal Mediapart and the NGO Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF) obtained the information. \nBBC Africa Eye had access to the evidence, as part of a consortium called Congo Hold-up, co-ordinated by the media network European Investigative Collaborations (EIC).\nThe investigation raises questions about who benefitted from the money transfers and possible conflicts of interests.\nThe managing director of BGFI's DR Congo subsidiary, BGFI Banque RDC, from 2012 to 2018 was Francis Selemani, Joseph Kabila's foster-brother. \nMr Kabila's sister, Gloria Mteyu, owned 40% of BGFI's DR Congo operation, which was set up in 2010.\nOne privately owned company, Sud Oil, was shown to have received nearly $86m in public funds from November 2013 to August 2017. \nThese include at least $46m from the DR Congo banking regulator, BCC, $15m from the state mining company G\u00e9camines, and $1.3m from the country's electoral body, Ceni. \nThe only information the BBC found from the leak concerning these payments was an invoice for just over $1m from Ceni to Sud Oil for petroleum products.  \nThe BBC found no evidence Sud Oil was trading in petroleum products at the time.\nMr Selemani's wife, Aneth Lutale, owned 80% of Sud Oil and Mrs Mteyu owned the remaining 20% from 2013 to 2018.\nMillions of dollars were transferred out of Sud Oil's BGFI accounts to other private companies' BGFI accounts. Some of these were owned by relatives or business associates of Mr Kabila, who was president from 2001-2019. \nOne of these companies, Kwanza Capital, was majority owned by Congolese businessman Pascal Kinduelo, with Sud Oil taking a minority stake. Mr Kinduelo was chair of BGFI Bank RDC at the time. \nMr Kinduelo was also a former owner of Sud Oil, before transferring ownership. \nThe investigation found the bank allowed many high-value cash withdrawals from Sud Oil accounts, including one for $6 million. By law a maximum of $10,000 is allowed to be withdrawn in cash per day. This limit can only be breached for specific, documented purposes, such as national emergency or defence reasons. \nBBC Africa Eye found no evidence in the leak that correct procedures were followed in these instances. These cash withdrawals from Sud Oil accounts totalled at least $50 million covering a four-year period. Once the money was withdrawn, it is believed to have become untraceable. \nOur investigation was only able to establish that Sud Oil, for the period 2013 to 2018, had one employee, managing director David Ezekiel, and a small office in the capital Kinshasa as its address. In October 2013 Sud Oil purchased a real estate complex in the capital for $12m, basing the company there. \nIt also had a contract with BGFI Banque RDC to provide new vehicles to several of its senior management, including Mr Selemani. It charged $70,000 to provide his four-wheel drive car. \nBBC Africa Eye found no evidence of any other business activities. \nThe investigation had access to an internal BGFI audit, completed in July 2018, heavily criticising the bank's DR Congo operation. The audit was never meant to be made public. \nIt gave a score of \"very high risk\" for the DR Congo subsidiary. It also referenced a lack of integrity and transparency in the declaration of conflicts of interest and compliance in its operations with clients.\nThe audit named Mr Selemani as having at least 16 declared conflicts of interest, including links to private companies holding accounts at the bank. It also highlighted several high-value transactions by Sud Oil.\nTwo weeks after the report was complete, Mr Selemani was moved to a new role at BGFI's head office in Gabon. He reportedly received $1.4m on leaving BGFI Banque RDC. He is reported to have left BGFI in November 2018. \nSud Oil changed ownership in 2018  and Kwanza Capital was closed down the same year. Mrs Mteyu is understood to have given up her 40% stake in BGFI Banque RDC.\nBBC Africa Eye contacted BGFI, Joseph Kabila, Francis Selemani, Aneth Lutale, David Ezekiel and Gloria Mteyu over the information contained in the leak. None responded to our questions. We also contacted Pascal Kinduelo, who declined to respond.  \nGecamines and BCC did not reply to the BBC's requests for a response. \nThe head of Ceni at the time of its dealings with Sud Oil, Corneille Nangaa, declined to comment on the payment, citing parliamentary confidentiality rules. Mr Nangaaa added that a new management team was now in place at the electoral body.\nBBC Africa Eye's investigation will be available online to watch from 29 November. "

      "tags": "Electricity pricing,Energy industry,NI economy",
      "text": "Northern Ireland's largest electricity company Power NI is to increase its prices for domestic customers by 21.4% from 1 January 2022.\nIt means a typical household bill will go up by \u00a3131 a year. The tariff has been approved by the Utility Regulator.\nPower NI said the increase was due to a rise in prices across the global wholesale gas market.\nIt has about 450,000 domestic customers and this is the second tariff increase it has announced this year.\nIn July, it announced a 6.9% price rise.\nConsumers across Northern Ireland are facing higher prices this winter as gas and electricity providers pass on increasing costs to customers. \nWilliam Steele, customer solutions director for Power NI, said the firm would try to assist customers struggling to pay their bills.\n\"We work very hard to keep our prices as low as possible but regrettably there has been a rapid and sustained increase in wholesale gas prices over recent months,\" he said.\n\"Like other suppliers we have no choice but to pay these increased costs, which feed into the cost of wholesale electricity and have a knock-on effect on our tariffs.\n\"In these challenging times and with such a volatile market we held off making this change for as long as possible, with this price change not coming into effect until January 2022.\n\"As soon as we see an opportunity to reduce prices, we will do so without delay.\n\"For any customers who are worried about paying a bill, please get in contact and we can help you.\"\nThe company said customers could help to offset the increase by ensuring they were on the best payment plan and registering for online billing.\nJohn French, chief executive of the Utility Regulator, said it was unclear how long it would be before global prices began to fall.\n\"The drivers behind this increase are that we have had one of the least windy summers since 1961, meaning generation from cheaper wind power has been very low,\" he said.\n\"This low output from wind has meant that there has been an increased use of conventional gas, coal, and oil fired power stations.\n\"Unfortunately, the cost of gas, coal, and oil has increased significantly on global markets over the last 12 months, and since the wholesale cost of electricity makes up over 60% of a domestic customer's bill these sharp increases impact heavily on Power NI's tariff.\"\nMr French said market analysts were predicting higher wholesale prices \"for the next 18 to 36 months\".\n\"If wholesale prices begin to reduce, our system of regulation in Northern Ireland allows us to act to make sure that reductions are fully passed onto consumers as quickly as possible.\""

      "tags": "Rail travel,HS2,High Speed Rail,Northern Powerhouse Rail,Grant Shapps",
      "text": "The government has scrapped the Leeds leg of the HS2 high-speed rail line as part of a package that ministers promise will transform services.\nThe prime minister said the overhaul would mean faster travel up to 10 years earlier than planned, and said claims of broken promises are \"total rubbish\".\nThe package won support from some business leaders, and anti-HS2 groups.\nBut Boris Johnson faced criticism that he had reneged on investment promises to the Midlands and north of England.\nThe axing of a new East Midlands-Leeds high-speed line, with HS2 trains now to run on existing upgraded routes, and a scaling back of the Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) project, drew strong condemnation.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson had \"ripped up\" promises he made that HS2 would go all the way to Leeds and that there would be a new NPR line from Manchester to Leeds.\n\"This was the first test of 'levelling up' and the government has completely failed and let down everybody in the North. You can't believe a word the Prime Minister says,\" he said.\nThere was also criticism that a significant portion of the \u00a396bn pledged as new investment has already been announced, such as \u00a3360m to improve ticketing.\nOn a visit to a Network Rail logistics hub near Selby, Mr Johnson dismissed the charges of broken promises as \"total rubbish\", insisting the government would deliver on them \"eventually\".\n\"Of course there are going to be people who always want everything at once. And there are lots of people who are [going to] say, look, what we should do is carve huge new railways through virgin territory, smashing through unspoilt countryside and villages and do it all at once,\" he said.\nAnd in a BBC interview later the prime minister said that laying new track through countryside would take decades to complete.\nMr Johnson said: \"You can wait decades and dig up virgin countryside and plough through villages, but you have to wait an awful lot longer and it costs an awful lot more. \n\"I'm afraid that we are going to be building a huge amount of new line but what we're doing is doing it in the most efficient possible way and to bring the maximum possible commuter benefits.\" \nIn addition to the HS2 changes, there is also a scaling back of a new Trans-Pennine rail route between Manchester and Leeds as part of the NPR project to improve links between major northern cities. \nThe route between Leeds and Manchester will now be a combination of new track and enhancements to existing infrastructure.\n\"We're cutting journey times from Manchester in half from 2 hours 9 min to 1 hour 11 min,\" said Mr Johnson.\n\"We're also cutting times from Manchester to Leeds from 55 min to 33 min and [creating] a crossrail for the Midlands for the first time.\"\nHe added that there would also be a new high-speed line taking the time needed to travel from the West Midlands to East Midlands, from 1 hour 14 min down to 26 min. \n\"What that means is you will be able to have HS2 trains all the way up to Sheffield, taking half an hour off the time up to Sheffield,\" Mr Johnson stressed.\n\"You will have a crossrail for the north, a crossrail for the Midlands and then the HS2.\"\nTory MP Robbie Moore, whose Keighley seat sits close to Bradford, said he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the plan, which had \"completely short-changed\" his constituents.\nBradford had expected to be included on the proposed Leeds to Manchester route and to see a station built to accommodate new trains.\n\"We are one of the most socially deprived parts of the UK and we must get better transport connectivity,\" Mr Moore said.\nDelivering the Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) in the Commons, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs it was an \"ambitious and unparalleled programme\" to overhaul inter-city links across the north and Midlands, and \"speed up the benefits for local areas and serves destinations people most want to reach\".\nWork has already started on the first phase of HS2, linking London and the West Midlands. The next section will extend the line to Crewe.\nThe final phase was to take HS2 to Manchester and Leeds.\nCommenting on plans for rail links between the East Midlands to Leeds, Mr Shapps said: \"We'll study how best to take HS2 trains into Leeds as well\".\nHowever, that is likely to be via upgrades to existing rail network, a move condemned by MPs and regional business leaders who said a high-speed line was vital to the economic growth of the Midlands and north England.\nLabour MP Hilary Benn, who represents Leeds Central, said: \"Today that promise has been broken, and Leeds and the North have been betrayed.\"\nAndy Bagnall, director general of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said: \"While millions of people will benefit from this major investment in boosting connectivity between major cities in the North of England and the Midlands, leaving out key pieces of the jigsaw will inevitably hold back the ability for the railways to power the levelling up agenda and the drive to net zero.\"\nby Katy Austin, BBC transport correspondent\nThe government's argument is that faster delivery at lower cost is now the best approach. It also makes the case for putting cash towards better local services, not just high speed inter-city connections. \nThat won't wash with those who will accept nothing but the original proposals for both HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail - with their full capacity benefits, as well as journey times. They feel a promise is being broken. \nBradford is one example of this; a city whose leaders view a new, full high-speed link to both Manchester and Leeds as essential to regeneration.\nOpponents of HS2 - a controversial project - will see today's news as a relief. Although the door has not been fully closed to the eastern leg being completed at some future date. \nHowever, businesses in Yorkshire who hoped HS2 would bring jobs, investment and confidence, albeit not for a while, feel that opportunity has just been diminished. \nLabour also point out that despite the \u00a396bn label, much of this money had already been earmarked for HS2.\n'Waste of money'\nNews that part of HS2 was being scrapped was met with \"elation\" by campaigners against the line.\nSandra Haith, from an anti-HS2 group in Bramley, Rotherham, said she was pleased, \"not only as a resident of Bramley, but as a taxpayer. It's a complete waste of money\".\nShe said: \"The eastern leg costs a lot of money and it basically connects two cities. We can't get on it. We've got all the pain and no gain.\"\nHowever, business people warned about the economic loss from scrapping the HS2 line. James Greenhalgh, who runs the Flamingos Coffee House, in Leeds, told the BBC it would deter investment in the city.\n\"We want to encourage other businesses to move up from London, up to Leeds, get people moving around and coming to our city centre. It is really tough, it is stopping businesses from expanding,\" he said.\nThere was praise, though, from business leaders at regional trade body Midlands Connect.\nChairman Sir John Peace said: \"Although these plans are different in some respects to what we'd expected, there are a lot of positives in here and lots of things to be excited about - a new high-speed connection between Birmingham and East Midlands Parkway, direct links onto HS2 for Derby, Nottingham, and Chesterfield and a commitment to the Midlands Rail Hub.\""

      "tags": "Republic of Ireland,David Frost,Ireland\u2013UK border,Brexit,Sir Jeffrey Donaldson",
      "text": "There is \"serious intent\" in the EU to solve post-Brexit difficulties over the Northern Ireland border, Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin has said.\nSpeaking to the BBC, he said the \"mood music\" surrounding EU-UK negotiations had improved in recent weeks.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol in the Brexit deal aims to avoid implementing border checks on the island of Ireland.\nIt keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU.\nBut the protocol also creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, meaning some goods such as meat and eggs are subject to checks when they enter Northern Ireland from Great Britain. \nThis has angered some Northern Irish politicians, including DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who said the protocol was disrupting businesses and harming trade. \nIn an interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Martin admitted feeling \"frustrated\" that the issue had hindered the \"full flowering\" of the two sides' alliance.\nAnd he warned the UK against acting unilaterally, saying it would \"undermine\" relationships.\nThe Taoiseach's comments come ahead of a meeting between the UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost and the EU Commission Vice-President Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d in Brussels on Friday aimed at resolving problems arising from the protocol. \nSpeaking immediately before his meeting with Lord Frost, Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d warned the post-Brexit trade deal was \"intrinsically linked\" to settling the protocol, adding: \"One cannot exist without the other\".\nHe ruled out a renegotiation of the protocol, insisting solutions were available within its framework, which could \"become reality if the UK plays its part\".\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d welcomed what he said was a \"change in tone\" from the UK during the negotiations, adding that he hoped \"actions will follow the words\".\nArriving for the talks, Lord Frost told reporters he was \"very much\" looking forward to seeing if progress could be made, adding that his preference was for a \"negotiated\" way through the problem, but if not, Article 16 of the protocol remained on the table.\nThe article allows either side to suspend any part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement that causes \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\".\nIf the UK did trigger Article 16, the EU could respond by imposing tariffs on trade between the two sides. \nLord Frost warned there were still \"quite significant gaps\" between the two sides but welcomed the Taoiseach's comment about the EU's \"serious intent\" to resolve the difficulties.\nIn his BBC interview, Mr Martin insisted there was \"not an abundance of checks\" on the border and that Northern Ireland benefitted from having access to both the European and UK markets.\nHowever, he added that the EU \"sincerely\" wanted to engage with the problems, which he said could be \"resolved with goodwill on all sides\". \nHe acknowledged that \"there have been periods during these talks when they've dragged on with very little happening\" but added that \"now there's a bit of engagement, of serious intent\".\nMr Martin said the protocol was \"never going to be perfect\", adding: \"It's important that we don't allow perfect become the enemy of the good.\"\nHe also urged the prime minister to believe that Brussels' offer of compromise was genuine and urged him not to take too long to move towards a deal saying \"don't leave it to Christmas Eve this year\" - a reference to last year's Brexit deal which was agreed on 24 December.\nMr Martin is an affable kind of politician. \nUK ministers talk well of him in private. And clearly, like many leaders around the continent, and indeed like Downing Street, he would rather that a deal was done.  \nIt seems that he himself, having warned only a couple of weeks ago that the UK's threatened course of action would be \"reckless\" and \"unwise\", has concluded that it's wiser in contrast, to play down the tensions, to talk up the chances of a deal. \nBut there's still a rub. \nRead more from Laura\nEarlier this month, Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney warned that the whole post-Brexit deal between the UK and the EU could collapse over the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nBut, Mr Martin suggested the \"mood music\" had since changed.\n\"A number of weeks ago there was a different atmosphere governing the situation and there was all sorts of rumours and vibes... since then, that has calmed down somewhat,\" he said.\nBut he still warned the UK against acting \"unilaterally\", arguing it could \"undermine\" the two countries' relationship. \nThe full interview from BBC Newscast is available on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds."

I hadn't appreciated they weren't in control of their reproductive function.\"\nDr Siaron West said it was only after training she realised repeat visits were not a failing of the patient.\n\"It was one of the things their perpetrators used to control them,\" she said.\nShe is part of a scheme training GPs to spot the symptoms of domestic abuse.\nThe Iris programme encourages doctors to ask if everything is OK at home and refer those in need to specialist advocate educators based at the surgery.\n\"I sat through the Iris training and at least half a dozen of my patients sprang into my mind,\" said Dr West.\n\"I realised that they'd be coming back to see me again, and again, and again with physical and mental health problems and we weren't getting anywhere.\"\nIris was introduced in Wales in 2015, with pilots funded by the South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner, covering the Cardiff and Vale health board area. \nReferrals to specialist support went from an average of five per year, to 250 and the scheme has since been rolled out to other health boards, with Aneurin Bevan among the most recent.\nDr West - clinical lead for the scheme in Caerphilly - said gynaecological problems were three times more common among women experiencing abuse, but other clues included cystitis, depression and anxiety.\n\"The other things were mental health, drug and alcohol use - perpetrators will use those things to make their partners an unreliable witness.\n\"So that when they fall down and they have got bruises the GP, as well as the rest of the family, say 'well - she drinks a bit too much' or 'she's mentally unwell, she's probably making things up'. \n\"It's very difficult for them to be believed when they have a drug or alcohol problem and it's very easy for their perpetrators to manipulate them using those things.\n\"We're not completely oblivious but until my Iris training I was not aware of the extent to which I was inadvertently colluding with perpetrators. That's a horrible feeling - realising perpetrators are very clever and you've been caught up in that.\"\nIris is run as a social franchise, with different domestic abuse charities across different parts of Wales. \nIn Caerphilly and Newport, Llamau has been operating the franchise over the past six months and said referrals have gone from three to more than 70.\nNicola Fitzpatrick, head of the charity's domestic abuse services, said GPs may not have previously been confident to start the conversation with patients.\n\"I think that was part of the initial concern that practices may have had - they have got time-limited slots in order to see somebody. So how do they get to what might be going on in that person's home, whilst trying to diagnose the presenting condition?\"\nEvery GP practice on the scheme gets training for all staff - including receptionists and nurses - as well as a specialist domestic abuse support worker for those who get referred.\nMs Fitzpatrick said, with the low to medium risk cases of abuse, the majority of victims had never disclosed to anyone what was going on, or spoken to the police, but see their GP's surgery as a safe space to open up.\n\"That's a theme that we see especially with older people who have been in relationships for 40, 50 years and think there is no other alternative - that is the only life that they've had.\"\nShe explained for many, support would mean safely staying in their relationship.\n\"If you have been in that relationship and it's the only one you've known for 40 years, you're asking the world of that person to suddenly leave and take a leap of faith in a completely different world.\"\nThe scheme has also helped address issues such as so-called honour-based violence, forced marriage and female genital mutilation.\nIris advocate educator Meena sees a lot of this in Newport. \nShe has worked in this field for nearly two decades and has received threats from perpetrators - for this reason, we are not using her real name.\nShe said language barriers or uncertain immigration status could leave victims even more dependent on perpetrators.\n\"Clients who suffer with female genital mutilation suffer multiple water infections, cystitis, scarring, bleeding and they're happy to ask the GP for support.\n\"So we've got our victims talking. It's given them an understanding - they're thinking about what this impact may be on their children and their children's future.\n\"What we've identified with supporting victims from ethnic minorities, there may be multiple perpetrators. They could be cultural leaders, it could be family members, brother-in-law, sister-in-laws.\"\nForced marriage was another issue, she said, with women brought to the city from other countries  \"just so she could serve a purpose\".\n\"There may be an agreement where the son wasn't really interested with forming a new relationship and starting a family with this woman.\nThere could be a family promise, lands and wealth involved, or it could be that she's going to look after the in-laws.\""

      "tags": "Jacob Blake shooting,Wisconsin",
      "text": "A US teenager who shot dead two men during racial unrest has been cleared of homicide and all other charges after claiming self-defence.\nKyle Rittenhouse, 18, killed the men and wounded a third on the streets of Kenosha, Wisconsin, on 25 August 2020.\nDuring the high profile and politically divisive trial, his defence said he had feared for his life. Prosecutors argued he was looking for trouble that night.\nNational Guard troops have been sent to the city amid fears of unrest. \nUS President Joe Biden called on people to \"express their views peacefully\", saying that while the outcome of the case \"will leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included, we must acknowledge that the jury has spoken\". \nMr Rittenhouse fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and then wounded 27-year-old Gaige Grosskreutz. Mr Rittenhouse and the men he shot are all white. \nHe faced five charges, including intentional homicide, which carries a life sentence. \nHis fate was decided by a 12-person jury made up of seven women and five men, who had spent more than three days deliberating.\nThe teenager began to shake with sobs and nearly collapsed as he heard the words \"not guilty\" read out five times.\nTwo nights before he turned up in Kenosha last year, riots had erupted on its streets after police shot Jacob Blake, a black man, leaving him paralysed. \nMr Rittenhouse, then aged 17, had travelled to the city from his home in Illinois. Armed with a semi-automatic rifle, he said he sought to help protect property from unrest.\nDuring the trial, jurors were shown video, sometimes frame by frame, leading up to and after each shooting.\nIn their closing arguments, Mr Rittenhouse's lawyers argued that he was \"trying to help this community\" and \"reacted to people attacking him\". Prosecutors, meanwhile, questioned why he broke curfew in a city he did not live in and \"pretended to guard\" people and property he was not familiar with.\nThe case has become a flashpoint in the highly polarised debate over gun rights in the US. \nMr Rittenhouse is championed as a hero by those who say he tried to keep the peace in sometimes violent protests. Others were horrified by what they saw as a heavily armed teenage vigilante in a volatile setting. \nBBC correspondent Nomia Iqbal, who was at the courthouse on Friday, said several cars drove past tooting their horns and shouting \"Free Kyle\" and \"We love the second amendment\", which covers the right to keep and bear arms. \nOn the court steps Jacob Blake's uncle was in tears and said he was shocked at the verdict. \nMr Huber's parents said there was \"no accountability\" for their son's killer.\n\"It sends the unacceptable message that armed civilians can show up in any town, incite violence, and then use the danger they have created to justify shooting people in the street,\" they said in a statement.\nBut Mr Rittenhouse's defence attorney Mark Richards said his client \"wished none of this would have ever happened\" and just wanted to get on with his life.\nDavid Hancock, a spokesman for the Rittenhouse family, told CBS they had expected the acquittal, adding that they were now \"in an undisclosed location\".\nReactions from politicians on Friday highlighted divisions over the case.\nWisconsin Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes, a Democrat, was among those to denounce the verdict. \n\"Over the last few weeks, many dreaded the outcome we just witnessed,\" he was quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying. \n\"The presumption of innocence until proven guilty is what we should expect from our judicial system, but that standard is not always applied equally. We have seen so many black and brown youth killed, only to be put on trial posthumously, while the innocence of Kyle Rittenhouse was virtually demanded by the judge.\"\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio went further, in a tweet describing the verdict as \"disgusting\".\nBut Republicans including Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson welcomed the decision.\n \"Justice has been served,\" he said, quoted by AFP. \"I hope everyone can accept the verdict, remain peaceful, and let the community of Kenosha heal and rebuild.\"\nThe state's former governor, Scott Walker, also tweeted his approval: \"All of us who knew what actually happened in Kenosha last year assumed this would be the verdict. Thankfully, the jury thought the same.\"\nIn a brief statement, the office of the Kenosha County District Attorney - which handled the prosecution's case - said it respected the verdict and called for calm. \nWisconsin's Governor Tony Evers said it was \"time to move forward, together\".

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has said that he is weighing a US diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympic games due to be held in Beijing, China. \n\"That is something we are considering,\" he told reporters ahead of talks with the leaders of Mexico and Canada.\nA diplomatic boycott would mean that no US officials are sent to attend the games. The decision comes amid rising tension in the US-China relationship. \nOn Monday, Mr Biden held his first direct talks with China's Xi Jinping. \nAt the White House, Biden spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the US and China leaders did not discuss the Olympics during their three-hour virtual meeting on Monday. \nBoth Democratic and Republican lawmakers have called for a diplomatic boycott as a means to protest against Chinese human rights abuses. \nA diplomatic boycott would not affect athletes, but Ms Psaki said the US is still finalising \"what our presence will be\" at the games, which are due to begin on 4 February. \nThe US has accused China of genocide towards the Uighurs - a Muslim minority group which lives mostly in the autonomous region of Xinjiang. \nTensions have also risen over the way China has acted to repress political freedoms in Hong Kong.\nMr Biden's comment came as he was hosting Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for formal talks at the White House.\nThe talks, dubbed the Three Amigos Summit, are expected to focus on border issues, tax subsidies for electric vehicles, Covid precautions and other issues. \nLast month, US senators proposed a draft amendment to a bill that would ban the US State Department from spending government funds to \"support or facilitate\" the attendance of US diplomats at the Games. \nNancy Pelosi, the most senior Democrat in Congress, has called for a boycott, saying that US leaders who attend would lose their \"moral authority\".\nRepublican Senator Tom Cotton said on Thursday that diplomatic boycott of the \"genocide Olympics\" would be \"too little, too late\" and called for a total boycott of all athletes, officials and US corporate sponsors. \nNikki Haley, the former US representative to the UN under Donald Trump, has also called for a complete boycott.

      "text": "Security forces in Uganda have shot dead a Muslim cleric accused of working with an armed group linked to suicide bombings in the capital Kampala.\nOfficials said Sheikh Muhammad Abas Kirevu had recruited for cells run by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) - rebels who have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group. \nHe was killed just outside Kampala.\nAt least four people were killed by attackers on motorbikes who blew themselves up in the city on Tuesday. \nMore than 30 others were injured in the attack, which IS said it was behind and officials have blamed on the ADF.\nThe Islamist militant ADF was formed in Uganda in the 1990s but is now based in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since pledging allegiance to IS in 2019, it has increasingly carried out attacks in the group's name.  \nTwenty-one people have been arrested since Tuesday's attack, in what police have described as the dismantling of ADF terrorist cells in Kampala and across the country. \nPolice spokesperson Fred Enanga said 13 suspects, including several children, were intercepted while trying to cross the border into DR Congo. \nOn Wednesday, four suspected ADF operatives were killed near the border.\nA manhunt is also under way for another cleric, Sheikh Suleiman Nsubuga, who is accused of training terrorists, radicalising potential recruits, and providing materials to make improvised explosive devices.\nTuesday's attack was the latest in a number of recent bomb explosions in Kampala. \nLast month, a 20-year-old waitress was killed after a device, left in a shopping bag, detonated in a bar in the city. Days later several people were injured when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a bus near Kampala. Police say both were linked to the ADF.\nThe bombings on Tuesday marked the biggest attack the ADF has been linked to in Uganda since establishing relations with IS. "

His family settled in the United Arab Emirates in 1996.\nAl Swealmeen left for Syria 12 years ago, then headed to Turkey.\nHe reportedly arrived in the UK in 2014 and had an application for asylum, in which he claimed to be Syrian, rejected the following year, but had made a fresh appeal in January this year.\nHis submissions were under review at the time of his death.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "When you hear about people eating insects, the chances are you think of the bushtucker trial on I'm a Celebrity, which starts this weekend.\nBut food ingredients made from insects could be coming to a menu near you.\nThis is the focus of research being carried out at Aberystwyth University.\nScientists at the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences (IBERS) are looking at insects as a potentially valuable source of animal feed and food for people.\nThe work is part of ValuSect - which stands for valuable insects - an international project aiming to improve the sustainable production and processing of insect-based products.\nInsects are a common feature of people's everyday diets in countries including Mexico, China and Ghana.\nThey offer a more environmentally-friendly source of protein than many other foods and could help feed the world's growing population.\nChatting over a tray of 20,000 live mealworms, Dr Tiffany Lau, a postdoctoral research associate at IBERS, said insect ingredients could form part of a range of foods.\n\"They could be made into protein shakes, protein smoothies, they could be insect burgers, falafels, muffins anything you could think of really,\" she said.\n\"I would eat them - maybe not when they're looking like this though. \n\"They would be dried and ground into powder before you make them into food anyway, so you wouldn't look at it like worms hanging out of your burger, it would be made into a sort of patty.\"\nThe scientists at Aberystwyth are studying the nutritional value of processed insects, which Prof Alison Kingston-Smith said could be an important source of sustainable protein.\n\"They're full of protein and polyunsaturated fatty acids which is really good for us,\" she said.\n\"What we want to do is understand how we can feed the insects to make them the best quality they can be to deliver the nutritional quality that we need for feed and food.\n\"The most usual incorporation is into something like an energy bar.\"\nValuSect, a consortium of partners coordinated by Thomas More University in Belgium, has been studying crickets, grasshoppers and yellow mealworms as human food. \nA new grant will see the black soldier fly added to the research menu and extend the work to look at using insect products in animal feed.\nFindings will be shared with food and agriculture businesses across northern Europe.\nResearch indicates that approximately 30% of EU consumers are willing to eat insect-based food. \nValuSect aims to increase this number by improving the quality of insect production and processing, carrying out consumer tests, and reducing its environmental impact.\nSome insect-based ingredients are already available and Prof Kingston-Smith believes the choice of insect food products is likely to increase in the coming years.\nShe added: \"You wouldn't hide the fact that (food) contains insect protein - but I think it's the idea of eating an intact locust is less appealing than something that's in a product where that textural connotation is different.\n\"If we look at the way that food consumption has changed over the last few decades, we're far more accepting of different types of food, different flavours. We want to embrace all different cultures in our food tastes, and I think insects is just the next the next step in that.\n\"In another 20 years it will be commonplace to go and find your insects on the a la carte menu.\""

      "text": "A spike in the number of deaths of newborn babies in Scotland is to be investigated. \nAt least 21 babies under four weeks old died in September, a rate of 4.9 per 1,000 births. \nInfant death rates vary widely from month to month, but the increase is larger than expected from chance alone.\nPublic Health Scotland (PHS) and other agencies will now look into whether the Covid pandemic or other factors could be behind the increase.\nThe average mortality rate among newborns is just over two per 1,000 births. \nWhile all child deaths are investigated, the Herald newspaper reported that this wider inquiry was triggered when the mortality rate passed a \"control\" threshold, designed to pick up abnormal trends in infant deaths. \nIn a commentary on the figures, PHS says: \"Exceeding the upper control limit indicates there is a higher likelihood that there are factors beyond random variation that may have contributed to the number of deaths.\"\nPHS said there was \"currently no indication of links between these deaths and Covid-19 infection\" although the data will be examined further.\nDr Sarah Stock, an expert in maternal and fetal health at University of Edinburgh, said it was rare for newborn babies to become infected or seriously-ill with Covid but she said the virus could be having an impact in other ways. \n\"We know, for instance, that when pregnant women have Covid they can become seriously unwell, and in order to protect the mother and baby that can lead to pre-term deliveries,\" she said. \"Pre-term delivery is the biggest driver of neonatal mortality. \n\"We also know that the pandemic has put a lot of pressure on health services and that could be having an impact.\"\nPHS is now working with the Scottish National Neonatal Network , the Maternity and Children Quality Improvement Collaborative and the Scottish government to understand possible contributing factors.\nFigures for the number of stillborn babies also increased in September but not beyond the upper warning or control limit. \nDeaths of newborn babies have fallen steadily in recent decades with the mortality rate per 1,000 births dropping from double figures in the 1970s to 2.1 in 2020."

      "text": "More than 500 excess deaths may have occurred in Northern Ireland's emergency departments between 2020 and 2021 due to crowding, a report has said.\nThe findings are from a Royal College of Emergency Medicine report.\nExcess deaths are a measure of how many more people died than would be expected based on figures from previous years.  \nThe Department of Health said it would study the report carefully, adding patient safety was its priority. \nThe UK-wide report, which looked at the harm crowding has on patients, calculated the Northern Ireland figure using a mathematical model. \nEmergency department overcrowding has made headlines recently as UK hospitals struggle to cope with rising numbers. \nThe report, which also examined the impact of prolonged waits, said that crowding has always been \"unconscionable\".\nIt said the figures for across the UK \"lay bare the reality that lives are being lost to an issue that could be eradicated for good\".\nIt calculated that as many as 566 excess deaths could have occurred in Northern Ireland between 2020 and 2021.\nWhile they cannot confirm at this stage the actual number, the report also suggested that, in time and with further research, the figure could prove to be higher.  \n2020 saw a huge and unexpected rise in deaths because of the pandemic.   \nThe president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine in Northern Ireland, Dr Paul Kerr, told BBC News NI that the findings should be \"treated with caution\". \n\"These figures are concerning,\" he said. \n\"However the calculation of the extra deaths associated with prolonged waits in emergency departments is complex and the methodology used in NHS England may not be directly applicable to Northern Ireland,\" he added.\n\"We hope this early work will lead to further work specifically for local hospitals, which we have been recommending for some time, to give a better insight into the harm caused by crowding and long waits for admission,\" he said. \nIn a statement, the Department of Health said emergency departments continue to face \"sustained and severe pressures\". \nIt said it had taken a range of actions to support them, including financial supports. \n\"The HSCB (Health and Social Care Board) is also working collaboratively with the Public Health Agency, the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and the five provider Trusts to improve waiting times at our emergency departments, enhance flows through the system and facilitate timely discharge,\" the department said. \nThe report, which specifically examines hospitals in England, calls on the government to restore bed capacity to what it was pre-pandemic. \nIt said workforce planning is also essential, which must include actions to retain existing staff who are reaching burnout as well as efforts to recruit new staff.  \nBy applying mortality data and figures for those who waited between eight to 12 hours in an emergency department, the report estimated 303 excess deaths in Scotland, 709 in Wales and 4,519 in England.\nThe report also said that what these figures do not show is the harm that may come to those waiting even longer than 12 hours."

      "tags": "HS2,High Speed Rail,Northern Powerhouse Rail,Northern",
      "text": "The government's decision to scale back its rail plans has been branded a \"betrayal\" of northern England.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the eastern leg of HS2 - running from the Midlands to Leeds - had been cut.\nMPs have also accused the government of breaking promises over Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) - a raft of upgrades and additions to the network.\nMr Shapps said the new Integrated Rail Plan would bring benefits much sooner.\nBoris Johnson doubled down on the Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) project after he became prime minister, and would later include it as a manifesto promise.\nIn 2019 Mr Johnson pledged \"to fund the Leeds to Manchester route\" and \"turbo-charge the economy\".\nThe government insists it is still delivering NPR through additional investment, and said upgrades to existing routes would cut journey times and increase capacity much sooner than the previous plans.\nSome have said the new announcement marks a significant shift away from previous plans and recommendations, with politicians and businesses in some northern cities angry at the government's changes.\nThe HS2 line was due to be extended from the West Midlands to Leeds. This would have cut journey times between London and Leeds to one hour and 21 minutes. \nMPs from Yorkshire said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had repeatedly promised that HS2 and a new Leeds-Manchester line going via Bradford as part of NPR would be \"built in full\".\nHowever, HS2 will only be built as far as a new East Midlands Parkway station, about six miles south-west of Nottingham. That means London-Leeds journey times will be one hour and 53 minutes, some 32 minutes longer than planned. The government has not ruled out bringing HS2 to Leeds, but no timescale has been given.\nThe dropping of the Leeds to Manchester NPR plan means Bradford will miss out on inclusion along the new line. Ministers have promised upgrades to the existing links between the cities and shorter journey times.\nLabour MP Hilary Benn, who represents Leeds Central, said the promise to build the new line to Manchester had been broken \"and Leeds and the North have been betrayed\".\nAdding to Mr Benn's criticism of the plans was Tory MP Robbie Moore, whose Keighley seat sits close to Bradford.\nThe city had expected to be included on the proposed Leeds to Manchester route and to see a station built to accommodate new trains.\nMr Moore said he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the new plan, which had \"completely short-changed\" his constituents.\n\"We are one of the most socially deprived parts of the UK and we must get better transport connectivity,\" he said.\n\"I still want to see Northern Powerhouse Rail delivered with a main stop in Bradford, so that we can unlock our economic opportunities.\"\nThe Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA), which represents rail workers, concluded that Bradford would be \"the biggest loser\".\nIt said Bradford had been found to have the worst transport connections of any UK city due to a lack of direct rail routes and slow connections.\nA report out earlier this week found the city had the worst connections of any city in the UK, despite being the UK's seventh largest city and being centrally located.\nManuel Cortes, the TSSA's general secretary, said the plan showed the government had \"sold out the North with more broken promises\".\nIn June, Transport for the North recommended that new lines should be built between Liverpool and Leeds via Manchester and Bradford.\nA high-speed line will instead be built between Warrington, in Cheshire, and Marsden, on the West Yorkshire border.\nExisting lines on the remainder of the route between Liverpool and Leeds will be upgraded.\nLabour Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham described it as \"second best for the North again\".\n\"What we are hearing today [is] part new line, part upgrades; that isn't what we were promised and that isn't good enough,\" he said.\n\"I am thinking about everyone living here today, but what about the people's grandchildren and great grandchildren. We are going to saddle them with the wrong railway system for centuries.\"\nIn Sheffield and surrounding towns and cities, concerns were raised about damage to the countryside and disturbance of local communities as a result of HS2's construction.\nThe high-speed service will still run to Sheffield, but the announcement it would not go further was cautiously welcomed in some areas.\nChris Read, Labour leader of Rotherham Council, which has lobbied against plans to route HS2 through the area, said the U-turn was a \"victory for common sense at last\", but urged ministers to keep their promises on the scale of investment in northern rail services.\nBut the new announcement has brought uncertainty in some places, such as the Shimmer estate in Mexborough, near Doncaster. It was due to be demolished to make way for the eastern leg, and many homeowners left when they learned an 60ft (18m) high viaduct was due to be built to carry high-speed lines.\nAfter the announcement, local councillor Andy Pickering said those who remained had been \"left in complete limbo\".\nThe Integrated Rail Plan has effectively \"wiped Hull off the mainline rail map\", according to the Labour Party.\nThe city had hoped the plan would include the electrification of the line between Hull and Selby, to improve its connection to the East Coast Mainline and cut journey times to Leeds.\nHull's Labour leader, councillor Daren Hale, said it was an \"absolute scandal\" for ministers to say that journey times between Hull and Manchester would improve due to upgrades to the line between Leeds and Manchester.\n\"Yet again the people of Hull and this area have been overlooked,\" he said.\nPoliticians in Hull are expecting to meet with rail ministers to discuss the announcement and repeat their demands for direct improvements.\nIf life is about comprises then a very big one has just been put upon northern England.\nIt doesn't have the same train commuter culture as south east England because the stations and rail lines aren't there but it does aspire to have something which allows better use of public transport. To level up.\nCurrently it is a land where new trains run on old lines.\nYorkshire wanted to be at one end of HS2. A new high speed line across the Pennines has been seriously talked about - arguably promised by Boris Johnson.\nThe compromise is the new connection between Yorkshire and Birmingham will be partially high speed and the new line between West Yorkshire and Manchester will be high speed west of the Pennines. The rest of the existing line via Huddersfield will be upgraded.\nJourney times will be quicker - and many people will be satisfied with that. Others will be left wondering what could have been.\nAt present, Leeds to Manchester Victoria takes 53 minutes on the fastest service. This will get much better but not before years of engineering work.\nJourney times cross country from York and the north-east will also improve. There's a pledge to give a large part of urban West Yorkshire a mass transit system. That could finally see trams in Leeds - something talked about for decades. Bradford gets a faster connection to Leeds but is left in the sidings again in trans pennine terms.\n\u00a396bn on the railways is a lot of money - change will be noticeable - but it falls far short of aspirations this government built up."

      "tags": "NI Health,Robin Swann,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People working from home in Northern Ireland during the first wave of the pandemic \"should be working from home\" again, the health minister has advised.\nRobin Swann said a previous decision to relax the working from home messaging should be reversed, it is understood.\nThe comments formed part of a document issued to the executive on Thursday.\nThis week the Department of Health said more restrictions before Christmas were possible unless transmission of the virus drops significantly.\nOn Friday Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride said: \"No-one should be in any doubt about the seriousness of the situation we are facing into.\n\"Unless we get this virus back under control... what we are looking at is potentially our hospital system being overwhelmed by mid-December,\" he told BBC News NI.\nHowever he said he did not believe that Northern Ireland would \"go back to the damaging impact of lockdowns\".\nDiscussing the topic of Christmas parties, Sir Michael urged people to be \"selective\" about which events they attended and for organisers to do risk assessments in advance.\n\"People should not be cancelling their plans at this stage but they should be thinking of planning carefully to minimise the risk to themselves and others,\" he said.\nMr Swann's advice on working from home came after he instructed officials to draft a paper looking at other ways to improve adherence with existing restrictions.\nIt followed a contentious vote by Stormont ministers to approve Covid-19 vaccine passports for domestic use in Northern Ireland from next month.\nThe plan means people will have to provide proof of vaccination against Covid-19 or proof of a negative coronavirus test result to access nightclubs, pubs or restaurants.\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had voted against the proposals but Mr Swann and other Stormont ministers said the use of vaccination status certification would save lives.\nAt present, executive advice on working from home is that people should continue to do so where they can.\nNew Covid-19 advice coming into effect in the Republic of Ireland on Friday is for anyone who can work from home to do so unless it is necessary to do otherwise.\nIrish bars, restaurants and nightclubs will also close at the earlier time of midnight.\nIt is understood that in Mr Swann's document he suggests that a decision taken by the executive on 23 September encouraging employers to \"begin planning a gradual return to the workplace\" for employees should be reversed.\nThe proposal states: \"I believe that message should be reversed to once again advise employees to work from home where they can and to advise employers to support this where possible.\"\nIt goes on to say that the message should be communicated by stating that if a person worked from home when the pandemic began in March 2020 then \"they should be working from home now\".\nAdvice from health officials suggests strengthening the message would help reduce the risk of transmission of coronavirus inside and outside workplaces.\nSir Michael, the chief medical officer, told BBC News NI on Friday that research had shown that working from home was \"one of the single most effective interventions\" to control the virus.\n\"It reduces mixing in the workplace, it reduces infection and transmission in the workplace but also travelling to and from the workplace,\" he said.\n\"There is strong scientific evidence that it is an effective intervention.\"\nHe said the level of transmission of the virus in Northern Ireland needs to be brought \"back under control\".\n\"Now is the time to act, we have time to act, we have a number of weeks to act and take action immediately,\" he said.\nIt is understood that in the advice paper Mr Swann has also proposed giving the Stormont assembly a debate on the Covid passport regulations before they become enforceable on 13 December.\nThe DUP had called for that to happen ahead of the measures taking effect.\nIt is understood that the document also advises ensuring enforcement against those breaching existing Covid restrictions, including people who do not comply with wearing face coverings where they are legally required.\nMr Swann said that unless that happened the public would see \"compliance as unimportant and optional\" and would lessen the benefits of wearing face coverings.\nSDLP MLA Colin McGrath said he believed the police should be enforcing penalties for people not wearing face coverings.\nSir Michael told BBC News NI that wider restrictions had to be considered in sectors \"where we know the risks are higher\".\n\"The Covid certificates for domestic use is one way of putting in those wider restrictions and keeping those higher risk settings open,\" he said.\nThe health minister is also understood to have said in his paper that communications on public health are \"much more effective when delivered with a united voice by all executive ministers\".\nIt is understood the minister is proposing that the executive asks the assembly speaker to allow a debate or an alternative method to allow MLAs to consider the regulations.\nThe executive will have to consider Mr Swann's paper but it is not clear yet when that may happen.\nAlliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw said she was concerned that Northern Ireland was moving \"into a very bleak Christmas for people\".\n\"We want people to enjoy their Christmas but it has to be with risk mitigations in place,\" she said."

      "title": "Kyle Rittenhouse case: Why it so divides the US",
      "tags": "Jacob Blake shooting,Wisconsin,United States",
      "text": "Few US trials in recent years have generated such acrimony. What is it about the Kyle Rittenhouse case that so divides the country?\nInside the courtroom, the 18-year-old was visibly shaking as he heard the jury clear him of all five charges, including intentional homicide.\nHe killed two men during racial unrest in Wisconsin, but successfully convinced the jury he only used his semi-automatic weapon because he feared for his life.\nMeanwhile, outside court cars drove past tooting their horns and cheering. Some leaned from windows to shout \"Free Kyle!\" and \"We love the Second Amendment!\"\nSome were distraught at the verdict - one man collapsed on the courtroom steps in tears, saying if Mr Rittenhouse had been black and brandishing a weapon like that, he would have been shot dead.\nHere's why the case provoked such deeply held emotions.\nKyle Rittenhouse's acquittal hinged on the specific details of Wisconsin's self-defence laws, taking into account Mr Rittenhouse's state of mind at the moment of shootings. The first occurred when Joseph Rosenbaum tried to grab Mr Rittenhouse's gun, the next two after two men - one of whom was armed - confronted Mr Rittenhouse following Rosenbaum's shooting.\nThe law considers whether Mr Rittenhouse believed himself to be in imminent threat of harm, but it does not factor in the choices he made in the hours and days beforehand that put him in the middle of a volatile situation, with guns drawn and tempers flaring. \nThe trial could prompt renewed consideration of self-defence laws across the US and whether they sufficiently weigh the totality of circumstances involving the use lethal force, particularly in a society where restrictions on the possession of firearms have been loosened.\nThe trend up until now has been to expand the right of self-defence in many states through \"castle doctrine\" and \"stand your ground\" laws that give individuals a presumptive right to use force to protect their homes and themselves, rather than to back down from a confrontation.\nThe divisiveness of the Rittenhouse trial could further fuel the debate over whether those laws go too far - or not far enough.\nRace is not central to this case, but for one man it is. \nJacob Blake, who is black, was shot seven times by a white police officer in Kenosha last year. \nIt was that shooting which sparked the violent protests in the first place. The police officer remains in the force. Mr Blake said in an interview that if Mr Rittenhouse had been of a different ethnicity, \"he'd be gone\". \nMr Rittenhouse was not immediately arrested after he shot three white men - two of them fatally - despite surrendering to police. \nBlack Lives Matter protesters outside the court say it is \"white privilege\" that has allowed the teenager to even have a fair trial. \nControversially, in closing arguments Mr Rittenhouse's defence attorney Mark Richards referenced the Blake shooting saying: \"Other people in this community have shot people seven times and it's been found to be OK, and my client did it four times in three-quarters of a second to protect his life.\" \nIt's renewed this debate over exactly who is allowed to possess guns and then proclaim self-defence when they kill someone. \nThe Rittenhouse trial has once again highlighted laws restricting gun possession and use in America that varies widely by state and local jurisdiction. Often the regulations are less than precise, the product of intense legislative debate over the types of firearms covered and under what circumstances the laws apply.\nA day before closing arguments in the Rittenhouse trial, Judge Bruce Schroeder ordered that one of the charges - that Mr Rittenhouse violated a state law prohibiting a person under 18 from possessing a \"dangerous weapon\" - be dropped because the rifle Mr Rittenhouse was carrying wasn't prohibited to him.\nThe decision turned on the length of the firearm's barrel, which would have been prohibited if it were a few inches shorter. \nGun-control activists have cited this as yet another example of the kind of loophole that could be remedied by more uniform national gun laws. \nWhile the 30-year-old Wisconsin law contains a provision to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to go hunting, they view the weapon Mr Rittenhouse was carrying as clearly \"dangerous\" in the circumstances he used it. \nGun rights activists, on the other hand, have celebrated Mr Rittenhouse's right to possess such weapons and use them to defend himself.\n\"If it wasn't for 17-year-olds with guns,\" tweeted Ohio Republican Senate candidate Josh Mandel, \"we'd still be British subjects.\"\nBruce Schroeder is the longest-serving circuit judge in the Wisconsin state court system. He was appointed by a Democratic governor in 1983 and has won election to his seat seven times since then, each by overwhelming margins.\nPerhaps it was inevitable that the judge would become a focus in such a high-profile, nationally televised trial, but the unusual American tradition of electing judges has made a delicate political situation even more fraught.\nOver the years, Judge Schroeder has developed idiosyncrasies, such as allowing defendants to conduct the random drawings that select their final jury and quizzing jurors on esoteric trivia. He's also established a reputation as a pro-defence jurist - one further cemented by his testy exchanges with prosecutors during the Rittenhouse trial.\nGiven the highly charged political nature of the trial, many of those quirks and choices have been scrutinised for evidence of bias. His rulings to drop the illegal firearm charge and saying the men Mr Rittenhouse shot could not be called \"victims\" were criticised by many on the left.\nEven his choice of mobile phone ringtone, the patriotic anthem God Bless the USA - a staple of Donald Trump rallies in recent years - made headlines as possible evidence of his political proclivities.\nLegal analysts have generally concluded that Judge Schroeder's rulings have been within the norms for such proceedings, but with the impartiality of the entire US criminal system challenged in last year's protests against institutional racism and police shootings - including the one in Kenosha - those norms are under scrutiny, as well.\nThe facts of that night have never been up for debate - Kyle Rittenhouse killed two men and injured a third.\nInstead the jury had to work out why he did it. He was being chased by a group of people when he fired the fatal shots. Was he acting in self-defence or was he a dangerous vigilante provoking an already volatile situation in a city he did not belong to? \nMany groups who want tighter gun control say it was the latter. They are worried that by being cleared of the charges, Mr Rittenhouse's case now sets a precedent - that anyone can turn up to angry protests with a gun, but without facing any consequences.  "

      "text": "Covid case rates in England are now highest among children aged five to nine, latest weekly surveillance figures reveal.\nThe data, up to 14 November, shows this younger age group has overtaken older, secondary school aged children for the first time.\nIn recent months, the 10 to 19 age group maintained the highest rate of infections per 100,000 tested.\nIt is too soon to say what is behind the change and if it will continue.\nIn recent weeks, children aged 12 and over have started being offered Covid jabs.\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) report shows 723 cases recorded per 100,000 among children aged five to nine. \nThat's up week-on-week from 484.5 per 100,000. \nThe rate for 10 to 19-year-olds is 694.2, up from 571.7.\nCovid infections are lowest among the eldest in society - those aged 80-plus - with a weekly rate of 76 per 100,000. But this group has the greatest risk of getting more seriously ill with Covid if they were to catch it, particularly if they are not vaccinated. \nProf Steven Riley, from the UKHSA, said Covid rates continue to increase in those from younger age groups, and hospitalisations remain highest in people aged 85 and over. \n\"More people than ever are eligible for second and booster doses - and it is as important as ever to get vaccinated or receive a booster jab as soon as you are offered one.\n\"Socialising indoors in places with poor ventilation increases the risk of infection. Help protect yourself and loved ones by opening windows and doors to ventilate the room when meeting people inside. Wash your hands regularly and wear a mask in crowded places. If you have any Covid-19 symptoms, stay at home and get a PCR test as soon as possible,\" he advised. \nThe UK administered 384,421 doses of a booster vaccine on Wednesday, according to the latest UK government figures.\nOverall nearly 13.9m people have had a third dose of a Covid jab - about 24% of the population over 12 years old.\nMore than 50.6m people - or 88.1% of the UK population over 12 - have had one jab and more than 46m people - or 80.1% of people aged 12 and over - have had two vaccine doses. \nThe UK has reported 46,807 coronavirus cases in the last 24-hour period.\nThere were also 199 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded.\nMeanwhile, levels of influenza remain low, but people who are eligible for a flu shot are being urged to get one as a precaution.

      "tags": "Alcohol,Scotland health,Scottish government,Minimum alcohol pricing",
      "text": "A group of charities and medical experts have urged the Scottish government to increase the minimum unit price (MUP) of alcohol from 50p to 65p.\nThe group argue that the positive effects of the policy will have been affected by inflation and the pandemic.\nThe policy sets a floor price for drinks depending on how many units of alcohol they contain. \nAt First Minister's Questions Nicola Sturgeon said the level of the price would be kept under review.\nAn MUP of 65p would see a cheap litre of vodka at 37.5% ABV (alcohol by volume) increase in price from at least \u00a318.75 to \u00a324.38.\nThe group calling for the change is made up of 28 organisations, including health and children's charities and a number of medical royal colleges.\nIn a letter to the Scottish government, they say inflation will have \"significantly eroded\" the effect of MUP, while the pandemic may have eliminated any health improvement in the population.\nThey argued that since the policy was introduced in 2018, Scotland has seen a reduction in alcohol consumption and decreases in hospital admissions from alcohol-related liver conditions.\nAlcohol Focus Scotland said that although there was a 10% decrease in alcohol related deaths in 2019, they rose by 17% in 2020 to their highest level in more than a decade. \nChief executive Alison Douglas blamed changing drinking habits during the pandemic for the increase. \n\"We've seen that minimum unit pricing can have a positive effect,\" she said.\n\"We need to off-set both the effects of inflation and of the pandemic, and adjust the minimum unit price to a level that will save more lives and prevent a new generation from developing an unhealthy relationship with alcohol.\n\"We urge the Scottish government to take action now and raise the minimum unit price to at least 65p.\"\nThe Scottish government committed to review the minimum unit price two years after it began, but this was delayed due to the pandemic.\nDr Alastair MacGilchrist, who is chairman of Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems (SHAAP), said Scotland could \"not afford\" to wait any longer.\nHe added: \"This support from a wide range of organisations shows that experts in public health and beyond believe increasing the minimum unit price is the right thing to do.\"\nDr MacGilchrist said he believed there had to be a \"sweet spot\" when setting the MUP for it to have the greatest impact.\nHe told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"If you set it too low it's not gong to be effective, but if you set it too high it's going to have an unfair impact on moderate drinkers.\n\"We think that to at least 65p would be the correct level just now and would certainly save lives.\"\nThe level of alcohol MUP was initially set in 2012, with the introduction of the policy delayed by a lengthy legal challenge in the years before its introduction.\nIn May a study found MUP had had a lasting impact in Scotland, and that alcohol sales had fallen by 8%.\nAccording to the research, the impact was mainly seen in households that bought the most alcohol - but the exception was in high-purchasing, low-income homes, who did not seem to change their habits.\nWales introduced the policy last March and campaigners have called for it to be implemented in England and Northern Ireland.\nThe Republic of Ireland is due to introduce its own MUP policy on 1 January 2022. \nAsked about MUP at First Minister's Questions on Thursday, Ms Sturgeon said an evaluation into pricing was \"ongoing\".\nShe said a Public Health Scotland report on the issue was due to be published in 2023 and noted any change must have a \"robust evidence base\".\nShe added the UK government's Internal Market Act was a source of \"great concern\" as it may affect the ability to adjust prices. \nA Scottish government spokesperson added: \"We continue to gather evidence and analyse the impact the policy has had since its introduction in 2018. \n\"Prior to the pandemic, we were seeing early encouraging signs of a reduction in alcohol sales and a reduction in alcohol specific deaths.\n\"The pandemic and the changed legal landscape post-Brexit are two significant events that are impacting on this work and must be factored into the analysis.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you on Saturday.\nMillions of travellers who have had a booster dose of a Covid vaccine in England are now able to prove their vaccination status using the digital NHS Covid Pass. It enables quarantine-free travel to countries such as Israel, Croatia and Austria, which have a time limit for vaccination status to be valid. Booster jabs appeared automatically for users of the Covid pass from midday on Friday, but the data is not available immediately via the Covid Pass letter service. Third jabs are not being added to the domestic pass as they are not currently needed for someone to qualify as being fully vaccinated. Boosters were first offered to over-50s, health and social care staff and people with certain health issues before being offered to over-40s in the UK last week.\nJust days after imposing lockdown on the unvaccinated, Austria has announced a nationwide Covid lockdown starting on Monday amid record infections. Under the lockdown, which will last a maximum of 20 days, non-essential shops will close and people will be asked to work from home. But schools will remain open for children who need in-person learning. The measures will continue until 12 December, with a review after 10 days. Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said people would be legally required to get vaccinated from 1 February 2022. Austria has one of the lowest vaccination levels in Western Europe.\nA cinema in Swansea has been told to shut down after its owner defied Welsh government rules and refused to ask for Covid passes. Earlier this week, Anna Redfern, owner of Cinema & Co, said she would not obey the law, saying it was an \"infringement of our human rights\". Notices were pinned outside the premises, stating the business had not carried out a Covid risk assessment. Since Monday, people have had to show an NHS Covid pass in Wales to legally enter cinemas, theatres and concert halls. Ms Redfern confirmed to the BBC she had been told to close by Swansea council, but would not comment further. \nA top whisky expert has revealed how he is still living in lockdown because he fears losing his senses and his livelihood to Covid-19. Since March 2020, Blair Bowman has only gone out of his Edinburgh home for walks and to collect his weekly food shop. Pre-Covid, he travelled the world for corporate events, but now does all his work online - and his business is booming. Mr Bowman told BBC Radio Scotland's Mornings programme that currently \"the risks are just much too high for me.\"\nA intensive care consultant in Wales has written a moving open letter to NHS staff as they continue to deal with Covid-19. Having previously wrote an open letter to patients and their families during the pandemic, Dr Matt Morgan, who works at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, decided to write another for his exhausted colleagues. He read his latest letter on BBC Radio 4's Today on Friday morning, telling staff: \"You may be cracked, but not broken. You are still there. You still care.

      "title": "Take-at-home treatment for spinal muscular atrophy",
      "text": "Patients with a rare genetic condition that causes progressive muscle weakness are to benefit from a new treatment available on the NHS in England.\nRisdiplam, an oral medicine taken once a day, has been shown in trials to improve muscle movement and control in patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA).\nIt is the third approved SMA treatment in the past three years. \nUnlike others, it does not involve an injection and can be taken at home.\nThe inherited disease leads to the loss of nerve cells involved in walking, crawling, sitting, breathing and swallowing. \nRisdiplam boosts the level of a key protein lacking in patients with SMA. This is expected to increase survival of nerve cells that control movement to manage the symptoms of the disease and slow down its progression.\nMore than 200 patients in England have already had risdiplam via an early access scheme and NHS England says several hundred more will now benefit who have a diagnosis of SMA types 1,2 or 3.\nMelvil Vedrenne-Cloquet, who is nine and from south London, has been on risdiplam for nearly four years.\nHis father, Benjamin Vedrenne-Cloquet, is French and enrolled him on a clinical trial in Paris.  \nBenjamin told the BBC: \"It's great to see Melvil improving a little bit every day. He has more stamina and is able to handle the stairs better.\n\"We felt very privileged to have been able to access this drug before other patients in the UK and we are delighted it will be more widely available now.\"\nOf the three main types of SMA, type 1 is the most serious. Without treatment, children mostly don't survive beyond the age of two.  \nMelvil has type 3 where the decline in function is far more gradual.   Difficulties with standing and walking may develop, but life expectancy is not usually affected.\nMelvil recorded a video when he started a new school to explain his condition to other pupils.  \nIn it he said: \"SMA makes my legs and belly muscles weak and work very differently to yours. I cannot run or jump. I can walk slowly. One metre for me, is the same as five metres for you.\" \nThe two other treatments for SMA have to be given in hospital, by injection. They include a one-off gene therapy Zolgensma, which has a list price of nearly \u00a32m, making it the world's most expensive medicine.\nThe second treatment, Spinraza (nusinersen) is given by spinal injection four times per year. It costs \u00a3450,000 in the first year, though, as with Zolgensma and risdiplam (Evrysdi), the NHS has negotiated a confidential discount. \nRisdiplam costs \u00a37,900 per bottle and may last patients just a couple of weeks as dosage depends on weight.   \nChris Towler, who is 25, has type 3 SMA and is one of many who could potentially benefit from risdiplam. In the past two years he has lost the ability to walk while waiting for Spinraza.  \nChris, who has a masters in sports management and is a coach, says he has a positive attitude but is not optimistic that he will get either treatment quickly. Nonetheless he says it would make a big difference.  \n\"Just to have the certainty that it is not going to get any worse would be huge. I may not get back my ability to walk, that's fine. I'm still happy in the skin that I live in,\" he said.\nDr Elizabeth Wraige, consultant paediatric neurologist at Evelina London Children's Hospital, said: \"We now have options for patients with all three types of spinal muscular atrophy. If someone's not able to receive one type of treatment, maybe they will be able to take one of the others. I think it makes a huge change. It really alters the outlook for people with SMA and gives them hope for the future.\"\nNHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard said: \"In the last three years the NHS has revolutionised care for people with SMA, by securing access to a trio of innovative treatments- Spinraza, Zolgensma and now risdiplam- where three years ago clinicians had no effective medicines at all.\n\"Spinal Muscular Atrophy is a cruel disease and the leading genetic cause of death among babies and young children, which is why NHS England has been determined to make these treatment available to people as soon as possible to help transform the lives of patients and their families. \nSMA UK said: \"We're absolutely delighted. Risdiplam offers so much more flexibility in people's lives. We will continue to advocate for its provision across all the UK.\"\nThe charity is campaigning for newborn screening for SMA.  "

      "tags": "Belarus border crisis,Belarus,British Army,European Union,Poland,Migration",
      "text": "About 150 British army Royal Engineers will be sent to help reinforce Poland's border with Belarus, the defence secretary has said.\nThe border is seen as an entry point to the EU, and there have been tensions in recent weeks with Belarus being accused of pushing migrants towards it.\nBen Wallace said a small reconnaissance team of engineers had already been to the area to assess the situation.\nThey would not be combat troops but \"guys with diggers\", he added.\nBelarus's long-time authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, denies facilitating the arrival of migrants and sending them towards the border with Poland in revenge for EU sanctions imposed in June.\nThe crisis deepened on Tuesday when Polish forces used tear gas and water cannon to repel those trying to cross into the country.\nSome attempted to breach a heavily fortified crossing and threw missiles at the Polish forces, leaving several with injuries.\nMr Wallace said the engineers would be dispatched \"within days or weeks\" but said he would first inform parliament about the planned deployment.\nSpeaking to the BBC during a visit to Poland Mr Wallace said: \"What we will do is send some Royal Engineers - that is part of the Army designed for building or making fences or roads or putting in infrastructure. \n\"We are going to be using that part of our forces to help the Poles and potentially other Baltic states to secure their border.\" \nHe stressed the soldiers would not be combat troops but people with \"the ability to build roads and checkpoints and observation posts\", adding: \"This is not combat this is support to the Poles.\" \nOn the humanitarian situation, the defence secretary said: \"I'm particularly worried for the women and children and the vulnerable people who are being trafficked by the Belarusians into this game they seem to be playing. \n\"It's a horrendous thing to do to force migrants to be a tool in a game to try to destabilise their neighbours.\"\nDuring his visit Mr Wallace visited British troops already stationed in Poland as part of Nato's Enhanced Forward Presence. He also signed an agreement in principle to sell Poland air defence missiles.\nMigrants have been living in camps in freezing conditions and with little food or water just inside Belarus, stranded between Polish guards on one side and Belarusian guards on the other.\nOn Wednesday, after more than a week of stalemate, Belarus said it had provided temporary shelter for about 1,000 people. \nPoland, with EU backing, is determined not to let the migrants into the bloc and has warned that the situation may go on for months.\nIt has also been accused of pushing people back across the border into Belarus, contrary to international rules of asylum.\nThe European Commission has accused Belarus of promising easy entry to the EU.\nBut Belarus has said it is trying to repatriate stranded migrants along the border, but that many have refused to return to their home countries."

      "text": "Workers at a London stockbrokers will have unlimited holiday from next year to try to prevent staff burnout.\nFinncapp employees will have to take a minimum of four weeks leave plus two or three days every quarter.\nUnlimited paid holiday is a perk popular among some US tech firms but less so among financial services companies.\nFor some companies it works well, increasing productivity, but others found staff took less time off.\nFinncapp, which also gives financial advice, has been \"exceptionally busy\" as City mergers and capital markets boom, chief executive Sam Smith told the BBC.\nMs Smith said the company really started to notice how much mental health strain employees were under in February this year.\nOn Zoom calls, people were getting frustrated and some were not wanting to communicate.\n\"People were fed up and had no resilience left because of having been in the pandemic for a long time,\" she said.\nStaff had worked very long hours from home in the pandemic, especially during lockdowns, and the \"lines between work and life became blurred\", Ms Smith said.\n\"There were no boundaries, no respite, it was just constant,\" she said, not only in her company but in others.\nAnd because everyone else was working, that put more pressure on people to just keep working, she said.\nBy June, mental health pressures were starting to hit employees' physical health, with people taking time off, and the company decided to change its working practices.\nFrom 1 January, staff will have to take minimum leave, and that does not include time off to care for sick parents, children or pets, or time off for parents evenings or to deal with household problems such as a broken boiler.\n\"All these things are not holiday,\" Ms Smith said.\nThe company decided to set out minimum amounts of leave that must be taken - which was first reported by Bloomberg - as the fear was that just having a blanket policy of offering unlimited leave could backfire.\nThat is what happened at software firm CharlieHR, where an unlimited leave policy led to staff not taking enough holiday.\n\"The reality is that it's not actually unlimited,\" chief operating officer Ben Gately previously told the BBC.\nOther firms have been trying to deal with workplace stress by giving workers some time off.\nDating app Bumble temporarily closed its offices in June for a week to combat workplace stress.\nIt brought in a policy where twice a year there is a week-long company-wide holiday. Employees have unlimited paid leave and UK workers must take 24 days holiday.\n\"Our teams were expressing Zoom fatigue, as well as actual burnout,\" said Tariq Shaukat, president of Bumble. \n\"The stress comes from always being connected but when working from home, or vacationing, there's always a feeling of 'what am I missing'?\"\nIn April, LinkedIn shut down for a week, giving nearly all of its 16,000 employees a break.\nNike headquarters staff in Oregon also got a week off in August to support their mental health."

      "text": "There has been progress in talks between the EU and UK but \"significant gaps remain\", Lord Frost has said.\nThe UK Brexit minister made the comments after meeting European Commission Vice-President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d.\nLord Frost said there was the potential to \"generate some momentum\" in the talks, which will continue next week.\nThe men were discussing the operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThe protocol is the deal between the EU and UK which was agreed as a way to avoid a hardening of the Irish land border.\nIt leaves Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, meaning goods can flow freely with the Republic of Ireland.\nHowever, goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control - amounting to a so-called Irish Sea border.\nThe EU has acknowledged its is causing difficulties to some businesses and needs to be improved.\nHowever the UK is seeking more fundamental changes, including removing the European Court of Justice from an oversight role.\nTechnical talks ahead of Friday's meeting had focused on guaranteeing the supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said there had been progress in this area, adding: \"We now need to press on and get this crucial issue across the line. \n\"This is a real test of political goodwill.\"\nHe said that on the issue of customs there had been \"initial useful engagement at a technical level\".\nLord Frost said that with medicines, any solution needed to ensure that products were available at the same time and on the same basis across the whole of the UK.  \nHe added that there had not been \"substantive progress on the fundamental customs and SPS (agrifood) issues relating to goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland\".\nThe two men are due to meet again in London next Friday.\nEarlier, UK cabinet minister Michael Gove said he was confident of making progress on issues over the Northern Ireland Protocol without triggering Article 16.\nArticle 16 of the protocol allows unilateral \"safeguard\" measures to be taken if either the EU or UK concluded that the deal was leading to serious practical problems or causing diversion of trade.\nThat would amount to a suspension of parts of the deal.\nOn Thursday, the Lord Frost reiterated that triggering Article 16 remained an option for the UK.\nThe EU believes the use of Article 16 is unjustified and would be used by the UK as pretext to repudiate the protocol.\nMr Gove said the protocol had meant disruption to trade and inconvenience for people in Northern Ireland.\nBut he praised a constructive approach from the European Commission.\nSpeaking at the British-Irish Council summit in Cardiff, Mr Gove said Lord Frost had \"signalled that while of course it is always possible Article 16 may require to be invoked - we are confident we will be able to make progress without it\".\nLate on Thursday night, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin said there was \"serious intent\" in the EU to solve the disagreement on Northern Ireland.\nHe said the mood music surrounding EU-UK negotiations had improved in recent weeks but he admitted feeling frustrated that the issue had hindered the \"full flowering\" of the two sides' alliance."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Swansea,Cinemas,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A cinema has been told to shut down after the owner defied the law and refused to ask for Covid passes.\nEarlier this week, Anna Redfern, owner of Cinema & Co in Swansea, said she would not be complying with the Welsh government rules.\nMs Redfern confirmed to the BBC she had been told to close by Swansea council, but would not comment further.\nSwansea Council said it was \"considering further steps\" after Cinema & Co remained open on Friday.\nThe council confirmed the closure notice can remain in place for up to 28 days.\nNearly 3,000 people have now raised \u00a344,000 in support of her \"standing by the right to free choice\".\nThe Welsh government said the scheme played a key role in keeping people safe from the virus.\nThe scheme, which applies to anyone over the age of 18, has been in place since 11 October for nightclubs and large-scale events. \nBut anyone wanting to go to the theatre, concert halls and cinemas must now also show the pass to prove they are either fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours.\nThe cinema was open this morning and had at least a dozen people inside the venue's small cafe. \nMany were drinking hot drinks and the owner Anna Redfern was standing behind the till. \nMs Redfern confirmed she had been ordered to close by Swansea council officers, but said she wouldn't do an interview with the BBC as she was \"very tired\" after a \"stressful\" night. \nShe said she would be releasing a statement later.\nIn a Facebook post, the business said the new rules facing cinemas, theatres and concert halls were \"unfair and killing the entertainment industry\".\nIt said it would \"take a stand\" against the \"discriminatory and unlawful\" measures. \nThe decision was met with a mixed response, with some criticising the independent cinema's stance and others voicing their support. \nWelsh government regulations state that businesses have to complete a risk assessment before opening and that should include whether a Covid pass is needed and how it would be enforced.\nFixed penalty notices can be given to businesses that breach regulations, with the maximum fine for repeat offences being \u00a310,000. \nThe closure notice has been placed on the outside entrance of the cinema, in line with the regulations set out by the council.\nSwansea council said the closure notice would end once coronavirus safety measures were in place.\nThe notice was issued \"due to the absence of any measures to protect the public against Covid 19\", it said.\n\"We have since been made aware the business has reopened and we are now considering further steps to ensure the venue complies with the current Covid regulations,\" the council added.\nCoronavirus case rates in Wales remain high, and the Welsh government has not ruled out extending Covid pass rules to pubs and bars in the run up to Christmas.\nOn Friday, Public Health Wales reported eight further deaths from coronavirus and 2,446 new cases.\nIt takes the cumulative number of deaths to 6,342 and the total number of cases to 484,744.\nThe seven day rolling case rate per 100,000 people has risen again to 512.5, compared to yesterday's figure of 504.9 per 100,000 people.\nThe rate for positive Covid PCR tests is up slightly to 19.2%.\nThe Welsh government said: \"The use of the NHS Covid pass for cinemas, theatres and concert halls is required by law in Wales - it is not optional for these venues.\n\"Cases of coronavirus in Wales remain very high. The NHS Covid pass is another way we're strengthening the measures we have in place to keep us all safe.\"\nThe NHS covid pass is available digitally, but you need to register for an NHS login via the website."

      "tags": "Social media,US gun violence,Wisconsin,Black Lives Matter,Donald Trump,US race relations,United States",
      "text": "A US teenager has been cleared of all charges in relation to two men he shot and killed during unrest in Wisconsin. What do we know about Kyle Rittenhouse?\nAfter a black man, Jacob Blake, was shot seven times in the back by a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020, two nights of rioting erupted.\nOn the third night, 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse fired on three men with a military-style semi-automatic rifle, killing two and seriously injuring a third.\nHe was arrested at his mother's home in Antioch, Illinois, some 30 minutes from Kenosha. A day later he was charged with one count of first-degree intentional homicide and one count of first-degree reckless homicide.\nVideos indicate he spent hours on Tuesday apparently helping patrol the streets. He told journalists it was his \"job\" to guard buildings and even offer medical assistance to protesters.\nBefore dropping out of high school, he participated in cadet programmes with the fire department and police.\nHis social media profiles show his support for law enforcement.\nA Facebook photo of him was framed with the \"Blue Lives Matter\" logo - a pro-police movement that has occasionally clashed with Black Lives Matter supporters.\nSeveral of his posts honoured police officers killed on duty, and he also posted pictures of himself wearing full police uniform. He is a former member of a local police cadet programme, Grayslake Police Department says.\nGuns are another of his passions. Photos show him posing with weapons, practising target shooting and assembling a rifle. \nAfter leaving school, he had a few jobs including one as a lifeguard.\nWhen the protests over Jacob Blake's shooting became violent, Mr Rittenhouse travelled to the city and armed himself with a semi-automatic rifle, with the intention of protecting property, he said.\nIn an interview on the night before the shootings, he echoes police language when telling a journalist why he is armed. \n\"Part of my job also is to protect people. If someone is hurt, I'm running into harm's way,\" he says.\nHe was captured on video at different times during that night. At one point, he speaks to police who offer him water. \nLater, he was shown being pursued by a group of people, one of whom appeared to fire into the air. \nThe teenager turns to see where the sound is coming from as another person tries to attack him. \nAt that point, the teenager appears to shoot the man, later identified as Joseph Rosenbaum. He was unarmed but Mr Rittenhouse said in court that he had tried to grab his gun, testimony corroborated by one of the prosecution's own witnesses.\nFleeing momentarily, he finds himself chased by a crowd who had seen him shoot Rosenbaum, before falling to the ground, and firing his gun. One of those hit by the gunfire falls to the ground, fatally injured. He is later named as Anthony Huber. Huber was seen on video swinging his skateboard at Rittenhouse.\nAnother person runs away apparently injured. In court, Gaige Grosskreutz acknowledged confronting Rittenhouse with a gun, even pointing it at him, but he denied he ever intended to shoot him. \nOne of the charges brought against him was possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18. It was later dropped when his lawyers successfully argued state law allowed for someone under 18 to possess the firearm.\nCorrection 9th October 2020: This article was amended in the hours after publication to give a more detailed account of the sequence of events and make clear that Kyle Rittenhouse was seen on video being pursued by a group of people before the first shooting."

      "tags": "Austria,Vienna,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Carina, a yoga teacher in Vienna, is not vaccinated against Covid-19 and wants to remain that way. \nSo she is now under lockdown, like around two million other unvaccinated Austrians.\nShe is only allowed to leave her home for essential reasons like work or shopping for food, and is barred from caf\u00e9s and restaurants. So I met her in a Vienna park, where she is allowed to take exercise. \nCarina says she doesn't understand the rationale behind the lockdown and that it makes her feel sad.\n\"I was walking by some cafes this morning,\" she told me. \"It's a bit strange to look inside and to know that I couldn't go in. It makes you feel really excluded, and ostracised.\" \n\"I'm one of these people that is made into the enemy,\" she said. \"And that doesn't sit well.\"\n\"I don't want people to get sick. I am careful. I get tested. I'm not at very great risk [from Covid-19] and I feel like it's a very personal decision. I understand people who do get vaccinated and when people don't want to get vaccinated.\"\nThere have been demonstrations in several parts of the country in protest against the lockdown. \nPolice say they'll carry out random spot checks on people in public places and fine anyone who can't show a certification of vaccination or recovery. \nAround 65% of Austria's population is fully vaccinated, one of the lowest rates in western Europe.\nThe country is currently seeing the highest rate of daily infections for Covid-19 since the pandemic began.\nChancellor Alexander Schallenberg says the government was forced to act because of the surge in new infections.\nHe said the vaccination rate was \"shamefully low\" and would \"keep us trapped in a vicious circle, from one lockdown to the next\".\nSince the measures tightened, more Austrians have been getting jabbed. Long lines have formed outside one Vienna vaccination centre. Some were coming for booster shots, others for their first injections. \nDr Thomas Szekeres, head of the Austrian Medical Chamber, says he is hoping the vaccination rate will rise to 80% or more.  \n\"We know that vaccination is the only way to decrease the number of infections,\" he says. \"We know this from other countries. We hope that the lockdown for unvaccinated Austrians will be enough to decrease the number of infections. But the experts are not sure about that. Maybe we will need additional measures to reach the goal to decrease the number.\"\nMany Austrians have welcomed the increase in vaccinations, but some are concerned the lockdown for the unvaccinated isn't constitutional.\nKarl Weller, a Viennese businessman, told me he is very much in favour of the jab. \"It is necessary for our health and our economy,\" he said. \n\"But I think it's a catastrophe, to divide between the vaccinated and not vaccinated. People start to become more and more angry and they are afraid.\"\n Shopping for clothes and other non-essentials is now only possible for the vaccinated. \nDoris, who was out in central Vienna, said she was losing patience with those who refuse to get jabbed. \n\"The only solution is that we all have to be vaccinated. That's the only solution. Otherwise, we have the problem for quite a long time. And we really want to get rid of it.\""
