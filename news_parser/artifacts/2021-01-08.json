      "tags": "Tourism,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Travel,Coronavirus testing,Air travel,Common Travel Area (CTA),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All international passengers will soon have to test negative for Covid-19 before travelling to the UK.\nPeople arriving by plane, train or boat, including UK nationals, will have to take a test up to 72 hours before leaving the country they are in.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said travellers \"can't board... without having that negative test\".\nBut even with a negative test, arrivals from countries not on the travel corridor list must still quarantine.\nMr Shapps said the government was \"very keen\" to set up compulsory testing now because of the new variant of the virus circulating in South Africa, which he said was \"causing great concern with the scientists\". \n\"They're not sure whether, for example, the vaccine will be able to deal with it in the first place, and we're very, very keen to keep it out,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\nThe new variant prevalent in South Africa has got some potentially concerning changes that experts are closely monitoring. While it is extremely unlikely the mutations would render vaccines useless, scientists are doing tests to make sure immunisation will still work well.\nEven in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked in a matter of weeks or months to be a better match if necessary, experts say.\nIt comes after a further 1,162 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK on Thursday - the second consecutive day of more than 1,000 recorded fatalities. There were also 52,618 new cases.\nThe R number - the average number of people that one infected person will infect - is now between one and 1.4, scientists have estimated.\nAmid the surge in cases, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to offer \"hundreds of thousands\" of Covid vaccines per day in England by 15 January. On Friday, a third vaccine - made by Moderna - was approved for use in the UK.\nUnder the new rules - which are expected to come in from next week - anyone who arrives in the UK and has not got proof of a negative test could face an immediate \u00a3500 fine.\nBut there will be exemptions for:\nAll passengers arriving from countries not on the government's travel corridor list must still self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of their test result.\nMr Shapps told LBC the testing rule will come into force \"likely on Wednesday or Thursday next week\", and details of how to get tests abroad will be published on the gov.uk website.\nThe rule will be UK-wide, although Northern Ireland said it had only \"agreed in principle\" and was working to solve any policy and operational issues.\nNon-essential travel abroad is not currently allowed in the UK, after lockdowns were brought in.\n\"All in all, the thought of an idyllic holiday 'away from it all' has been about as far from the truth as possible,\" says Rob Howard, who is is currently on holiday in Tenerife.\nHe flew out before Christmas and - after deciding to extend his holiday by a week and rebooking a cancelled flight - is due to fly back next Wednesday.\nReacting to the news that he will now likely need to take a Covid test before travelling, Rob, from Nuneaton, says: \"We are going to be expected to self isolate for 10 days so what is the point of this?\" \nMeanwhile, freelance MOT tester Matthew Auty, who lives in Normandy in France but works in Portsmouth during the week, says he's unhappy about the potential cost.\n\"These restrictions are reasonable for tourist travel but they are unfair for people in my position,\" he says.\nFigures from the aviation industry have urged the government to lift the rules as quickly as possible.\n\"This measure will destroy any confidence in forward bookings for air travel and for ferries, and it will essentially close off the UK,\" said Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary.\nHe called for the government to set an \"end date\" for the rules, adding: \"The real solution to this is vaccination, not artificial travel restrictions.\n\"Boris Johnson has told us he will have vaccinated the 14 million high risk categories by the middle of February. What we need Grant Shapps to do today is confirm then that this ridiculous pre-arrival testing will then be removed by the middle of February.\"\nThe boss of Heathrow, John Holland-Kaye, said of the rule: \"If this will help, then so be it.\"\nBut he called it a \"really belt and braces approach\", adding: \"We have always argued for pre-departure testing as an alternative to quarantine... now we're going to have both\".\n\"And it can only be a temporary measure, very few people will travel with this in place,\" he added to BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nTim Alderslade, the chief executive of the industry body Airlines UK, said the move should be \"a short-term, emergency measure only\".\n\"Once the rollout of the vaccine accelerates, the focus must be on returning travel to normal as quickly as possible\", he added, including \"removing the need to quarantine or test\".\nLabour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the new measures were \"necessary\" but highlighted that the opposition party \"has been calling for a comprehensive strategy on testing for international travel since April\".\nIt comes after England banned travellers from countries near South Africa to stop the spread of the new local Covid variant.\nThe latest travel curbs come as all of the UK is under strict Covid rules, with lockdowns in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland - meaning there is very little international travel.\nAt a Downing Street press conference on Thursday, the prime minister confirmed almost 1.5 million people in the UK had now received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, but warned there would likely be \"lumpiness and bumpiness\" as the rollout continued.\nThe government has set a target to offer vaccination slots to the top four priority groups - including all over-80s - by 15 February.\nAre you currently abroad?

Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests.\nFrom 28 January people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nUntil then, the self-isolation period was seven days, down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on day six and seven. \nThe Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive.\nIt is advising meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated.\nPeople, it said, should leave at least a day between social events.\nFrom 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. \nBut under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January.\nThe rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended.\nPeople are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped.\nWhile wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nLimits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August.\nFor important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures.\nAll guests will need to take a lateral flow test.\nPeople attending weddings, civil partnership or alternative wedding ceremony or reception, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero.\nHowever the Welsh government says it strongly advises people to wear a face covering indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nYou can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply.\nOn 25 January 2022, the Welsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidays for the first time since the start of the pandemic. \nNightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four stage plan, they have been allowed to open from 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. \nHowever, Covid passes are still needed for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. \nFrom 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500.\nOn 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. \nPupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January.\nA legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with \u00a360 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, has been scrapped from 28 January.\nHowever, the Welsh government has said it will remain important to work from home if you can.\nYou have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations.\nIt also means people from other parts of the UK can come here.\nAll holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May."

      "text": "Childcare organisations are demanding to see evidence that it is safe for them to remain open while schools and colleges have closed to most pupils.\nStaff have close contact with children and babies daily, when they change nappies and receive them by the hand from parents, for example.\nMinisters have insisted early years settings are safe as young children have very low rates of the virus. \nNurseries argue the evidence cited is based on data about old variant Covid.\nEngland's three main nursery organisations, the Early Years Alliance, the National Day Nurseries Association and childminders' group, Pacey, have joined together to mount a #ProtectEarlyYears campaign. \nThey want the government to provide clear scientific evidence on the risks to early years staff of staying open, particularly in light of the increased transmissibility of the new variant of Covid-19.\nSue Cardy, owner and manager of Ready Teddy Go Pre School, in Shoeburyness, Essex said: \"There isn't anyone who has asked: 'Is it 100% safe for us to remain fully open? No one can see the virus and staff may be asymptomatic, and so we all run an element of risk of catching or spreading it.\"\nShe added: \"Staff have families and are not all young... 50% of my staff are over 50 and some have underlying medical conditions.\"\nVicky, the manager of a church pre-school in Cheshire West and Chester said she could potentially have 30 children plus 10 staff in a church hall, with no PPE recommended, and limited social distancing.\n\"As an early years provider, I am increasingly worried about the safety of both staff and children, yet if we chose to partially close, we could be financially penalised.\"\nAnd Georgie Morrell from Brighton and Hove said: \"Since re-opening, I have had four households tell me. they are Covid positive. \n\"This is clearly very close to home and yet we have been given no choice or support but to remain open and carry on.\"\nNeil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said: \"It is simply not acceptable that, at the height of a global pandemic, early years providers are being asked to work with no support, no protection and no clear evidence that is safe for them to do so. \n\"We know how vital access to early education and care is to many families, but it cannot be right to ask the early years workforce to put themselves at risk. That is why it is vital that the government takes the urgent steps needed to safeguard those working in the sector, particularly mass testing and priority access to vaccinations. \nNursery providers are calling for staff to be tested, priority for vaccination and for state funding lost due to lower numbers during the pandemic, to be replaced by government. \nPurnima Tanuku, chief Executive of National Day Nurseries Association, said nurseries were determined to support families during the current lockdown.\nBut, she added: \"Time and again, whether it's on PPE, cleaning costs, testing or staffing, early years providers have been overlooked by the Department for Education. \n\"Now, they are the only part of the education sector fully open to all children and must be given priority.\"\nOn Wednesday, vaccines minister Nadim Zahawi said there was very little risk to younger children.\n\"The nursery sector has taken tremendous care in making sure the premises are also Covid safe. It is the right thing to do.\"\nThe Department for Education is yet to comment on the #ProtectEarlyYears demands."

      "text": "Boeing has agreed to pay $2.5bn (\u00a31.8bn) to settle US criminal charges that it hid information from safety officials about the design of its 737 Max planes.\nThe US Justice Department said the firm chose \"profit over candour\", impeding oversight of the planes, which were involved in two deadly crashes.\nAbout $500m will go to families of the 346 people killed in the tragedies.\nBoeing said the agreement acknowledged how the firm \"fell short\".\nBoeing chief executive David Calhoun said: \"I firmly believe that entering into this resolution is the right thing for us to do - a step that appropriately acknowledges how we fell short of our values and expectations. \n\"This resolution is a serious reminder to all of us of how critical our obligation of transparency to regulators is, and the consequences that our company can face if any one of us falls short of those expectations.\"\nThe Justice Department said Boeing officials had concealed information about changes to an automated flight control system, known as MCAS, which investigations have tied to the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019.\nThe decision meant that pilot training manuals lacked information about the system, which overrode pilot commands based on faulty data, forcing the planes to nosedive shortly after take-off. \nBoeing did not co-operate with investigators for six months, the DOJ said.\n\"The tragic crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 exposed fraudulent and deceptive conduct by employees of one of the world's leading commercial airplane manufacturers,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General David Burns. \n\"Boeing's employees chose the path of profit over candour by concealing material information from the FAA concerning the operation of its 737 Max airplane and engaging in an effort to cover up their deception.\"\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Boeing was charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the US, which will be dismissed after three years if the firm continues to comply with the deal.\nOf the total settlement, the majority - $1.77bn, some of which has already been paid - is due to go the firm's airline customers, who were affected by the grounding of the planes following the crashes.\nThe firm also agreed to pay a penalty of $243.6m.\nBut attorneys for the victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash said the deal on Thursday would not end their pending civil lawsuit against Boeing.\n\"The allegations in the deferred prosecution agreement are just the tip of the iceberg of Boeing's wrongdoing \u2014 a corporation that pays billions of dollars to avoid criminal liability while stonewalling and fighting the families in court,\" said a statement from the group of lawyers representing them.\nThey added that the FAA \"should not have allowed the 737 Max to return to service until all of the airplane's deficiencies are addressed and it has undergone transparent and independent safety reviews.\"\nBoeing says it has now addressed concerns about the Max, while the plane returned to service in the US in December.\nThe charge against Boeing was that its employees used \"misleading statements, half truths and omissions\" to dupe the regulator charged with maintaining the safety of US aviation.\nIn the circumstances, you could say the company got off relatively lightly.\nIt has avoided prosecution, and a large part of the settlement involves compensation to airlines - a fair amount of which it would probably have ended up paying anyway.\nThe company would doubtless like to use this moment to draw a line under one of the most traumatic episodes in its history. \nYet while the 737 Max is back in the air, the scrutiny of Boeing and the FAA is unlikely to stop here. \nCritics, including victims' families, lawyers and politicians, insist serious questions about the aircraft remain - and they're still pushing for answers."

We need a long-term plan to support businesses across the supply chain - not just those required to close.\"\nMore people were also looking for work as a result of redundancy, the research suggested.\nJobs in the healthcare and medical professions were the most widely advertised, while the number of roles in hotels and catering fell.\nMr Carberry also pointed out that the jobs market seemed to be recovering at varying speeds across the country.\n\"London continues to lag behind. London is home to some of the most deprived boroughs in the country, so this is particularly worrying,\" he said.\nJobseekers should be ''strategic'' and target sectors experiencing job shortages as well as those that are growing, says Gerwyn Davies, an analyst at human resources body the CIPD.\nThe shortage occupation list - used to offer work visas to people moving to the UK - quickly shows where workers are needed, and includes fields like engineering, web programming and graphic design.\nTech recruiter Amy Golding suggests applying to companies which are fully digital, regardless of the role you want, as the pandemic has accelerated the shift to online working.\nRead more on how to boost your chances of finding a job here.\nThe most recent UK unemployment rate - for August to October - was 4.9%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nThat is an increase of 0.7% over the previous three months, and means that 1.69 million people were unemployed.\nRedundancies hit a record 370,000 in the three months to October, although that began to ease towards the end of the period.\nBut those figures pre-date the November and January national lockdowns in England - and unemployment is excepted to continue to rise, peaking at a rate of 9.7%, according to the Office for Budgetary Responsibility, the government's independent forecaster.\nAnalysts have previously suggested that future unemployment levels are very hard to predict and depend on a number of factors, such as the wind-down of the existing furlough scheme, and how quickly the vaccine rollout in the UK allows businesses to reopen and staff to go back to work.\nMinister for Employment Mims Davies said of the new research: \"It's encouraging to see an increase in hiring at the close of last year which puts hope on the horizon that once we've progressed with the rollout of a vaccine, our labour market will recover.\"\nShe added: \"We know this is a difficult time for people and through our Plan for Jobs we're continuing to support jobseekers to get skills for new sectors and find the work that is out there.\""

Police said it appeared she had been injured by a shark. \nThe attack happened at Waihi Beach on North Island not far from the country's biggest city Auckland. \n\"Police extend our deepest sympathies to Kaelah's family and loved ones at this very difficult time,\" police said in a statement.\n\"We appreciate her death was extremely traumatic for those who were at Waihi Beach yesterday and we are offering victim support services to anyone who requires it,\" the statement said.\nShark attacks are unusual in the country and this is thought to be the first fatality since 2013. Local media cited witnesses as saying the woman had been swimming right in front of the lifeguard flags on Thursday.\nWhen they heard screams, lifeguards went out by boat immediately and pulled her to shore. \nIt is not clear what kind of shark attacked Kaelah Marlow, but an eyewitness reportedly claimed it was a great white, a species which is protected in the waters around New Zealand.\n\"Sharks are reasonably common near all northern beaches of New Zealand, most are harmless and even species considered dangerous very rarely interact with swimmers,\" shark researcher Kina Scollay told the BBC.\n\"My thoughts and sympathies are with the victim's family and we need to remember that this is a real tragedy to real people. I worry that this gets lost sight of in the media scramble after such events.\"\nMr Scolley said that while attacks were rare, there were ways to be careful about interactions that could go wrong. Among the risk factors are, for instance, fish feeding events or dead animals in the water. \n\"If a large shark approaches or is seen nearby people should stay calm, warn those nearby and calmly exit the water,\" he said.\nA seven-day rahui, a traditional Maori prohibition restricting access to an area, has been placed on the beach.\nThe last recorded shark attack was in 2018 when a man was injured - but survived  - at Baylys Beach. Over the past 170 years, there have only been 13 fatal shark attacks documented in New Zealand, according to the country's department of conservation."

There have now been just short of 80,000 deaths by the measure. The announcement came as another 68,053 new cases of Covid were recorded and the reproduction (R) number - the rate at which an infected person spreads the virus on average - rose slightly to between 1 and 1.4.\nA third vaccine has been approved for use in the UK. The jab, from US company Moderna, works in a similar way to the Pfizer one already being administered by the NHS. It offered nearly 95% protection from severe Covid in trials - but supplies are not set to be available until the spring. See how the vaccines compare here.\nA major incident has been declared in London with Mayor Sadiq Khan warning the spread of Covid is \"out of control\" and threatening to overwhelm hospitals.

An idea of freedom, an idea of democracy.\n\"As you say, in so far as he encouraged people to storm the Capitol, and in so far as the president has consistently cast doubt on the outcome of a free and fair election, I believe that was completely wrong.\n\"I believe what President Trump has been saying about that has been completely wrong and I unreservedly condemn encouraging people to behave in the disgraceful way that they did in the Capitol.\"\nThe PM, speaking at a Downing Street briefing, then welcomed the confirmation of President-elect Biden, saying \"democracy has prevailed\".\nHundreds of the president's supporters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday - where lawmakers were meeting to confirm Mr Biden's election victory - and staged an occupation of the building in Washington DC. \nBoth chambers of Congress were forced into recess, as protesters clashed with police and tear gas was released.\nA woman died after being shot by police, and three others died as a result of \"medical emergencies\", local police said.\nUK politicians from different parties have all condemned Mr Trump's actions in encouraging the storming of the Capitol. \nEarlier, Home Secretary Priti Patel said the president's comments had \"directly led\" to the events and he \"didn't do anything to de-escalate that\".\nShe added: \"He basically has made a number of comments yesterday that helped to fuel that violence and he didn't actually do anything to de-escalate that whatsoever... what we've seen is completely unacceptable.\"\nSpeaking on Thursday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Trump should \"take responsibility\" for what happened, calling it the \"culmination of years of the politics of hate and division\".\nSir Keir added he welcomed the outgoing president's agreement to an orderly handover, but told reporters \"he should have said it a long time ago.\"\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Trump had been \"inciting insurrection in his own country,\" and called it a \"dark period\" in US history. \n\"What we witnessed last night is not that surprising. In some senses, Donald Trump's presidency has been moving towards this moment almost from the moment it started,\" she told ITV's Good Morning Britain.\nScotland's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the home secretary should \"give serious consideration\" to denying Mr Trump entry to the UK after he leaves office. \nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said certification of Mr Biden's victory was \"good to see\" after the \"shocking events\" on Wednesday, adding the UK condemned the violence \"unequivocally\". \nFormer Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May, who shared time in office with Mr Trump, said there should be \"no place for the rule of the mob\". \nBut senior Welsh Conservative Andrew RT Davies has been criticised after comparing the rioting to politicians who supported a second referendum on Brexit.\nMr Davies, a member of the Welsh Parliament, later tweeted that \"violence must never be tolerated\".\nHis party colleague, the Conservative MP Simon Hoare, suggested Mr Trump could be sent to the US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay:\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has written to express his \"solidarity\" with US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose empty office was broken into by protesters. \n\"Seeing your office trashed in that way and its occupation by one of the rioters was particularly outrageous. I am just so relieved you were not hurt,\" he wrote. "

      "tags": "Little Mix,Christmas music,Official UK music charts,Music",
      "text": "Little Mix have risen to top the top of UK singles chart after Christmas songs released their grip on the top 40.\nSweet Melody has become the band's fifth number one, three months after it was released - and will be their last with Jesy Nelson, who quit last year.\nThe 29-year-old said in December that nine years in the girl group had taken \"a toll on her mental health\". \nLittle Mix's victory is part of a huge chart upheaval, after 56 Christmas songs dropped out of the top 100.\nAmong them was last week's number one, Wham's Last Christmas, which set a new record for the biggest-ever fall from the top. The festive ballad has now left the chart altogether.\nThe previous record-holder - Three Lions, by The Lightning Seeds with Frank Skinner and David Baddiel - fell from number one to 96 after England crashed out of the World Cup in 2018.\nSweet Melody has risen from number nine to number one this week, giving Little Mix their first chart-topper since Shout Out To My Ex in 2016.\nJade Thirlwall told BBC Radio 1 the milestone was particularly important because it was \"the last single we did as a four with Jesy\".\n\"And it's even more special that now, going into 2021 as a three, we've got the first number one,\" she added.\nAcknowledging a fan campaign to boost the song's chart position, bandmate Perrie Edwards said: \"I just want to squish every single fan who managed to get it to number one.\n\"The power they have, I'm sorry. The song's been out for months!\"\nWith fans abandoning their festive playlists, the stage was also set for singles that had previously been forced out of the top 40 to stage a dramatic return.\nDua Lipa's Levitating jumped 63 places to number five, reclaiming a position it last held on 3 December; and Tate McRae's You Broke Me First rocketed from number 74 to nine. In total, there were 39 new entries or re-entries in the top 75.\nIn the album chart, Taylor Swift's Evermore returned to number one, four weeks after its surprise pre-Christmas release, while companion album Folklore climbed to number 12.\nMeanwhile, Harry Styles' Fine Line reached a new chart peak at number two following the release of a video for his latest single Treat People With Kindness, which sees him dance with Fleabag's Phoebe Waller-Bridge.\nLewis Capaldi's Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent - the UK's biggest-selling album of both 2019 and 2020 - also climbed to number six, notching up its 86th week in the top 10. \nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Marks & Spencer has temporarily stopped selling hundreds of items in its Northern Ireland stores due to Brexit red tape.\nThe retailer said it feared its food would be blocked due to new rules governing shipments between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nA growing number of firms have spoken out about paperwork delays at ports.\nThe government said traders and hauliers need to take steps to comply with new border rules.\nM&S took the decision to temporarily drop hundreds of products, including chocolate fudge pudding and sweet and sour chicken, from its Northern Ireland stores after it saw competitors' lorries barred from travelling between the mainland and Northern Ireland.\nAn entire consignment in a lorry can be held up if only one item in the truck doesn't have the correct customs forms filled out.\nThe retailer said it aimed to get the products back up for sale soon.\nAn M&S spokesperson said: \"We have served customers in Northern Ireland for over 50 years and our priority is to make sure we continue to deliver the same choice and great quality range that our loyal customers have always enjoyed.\n\"Stores have been receiving regular deliveries this week, however following the UK's recent departure from the EU, we are transitioning to new processes and we're working closely with our partners and suppliers to ensure customers can continue to enjoy a great range of products.\"\nIn addition to problems shipping goods internally in the UK, the new Brexit trade rules are creating problems for exporters and traders transporting goods to and from the EU, say firms.\nThe UK sealed a trade deal with the European Union (EU) on 24 December that was billed as preserving its zero-tariff and zero-quota access to the bloc's single market.  \nBut in addition to red tape causing delays, major retailers that use the UK as a distribution hub for European business could face possible tariffs if they re-export goods to the EU. \nOn Friday, M&S chief executive Steve Rowe warned of more red tape and a rise in export costs to some countries.\n\"The best example I can give you of that is Percy Pig,\" he said,\n\"Percy Pig is actually manufactured in Germany. If it comes to the UK and we then send it to Ireland, in theory it would have some tax on it,\" he added.\nM&S said it was \"actively working to mitigate\" the effects of the \"rules of origin\" regulations, under which products are taxed differently depending on which country they come from.\nOther firms have also been hit by the confusion caused by new Brexit trading rules.\nParcels giant DPD has suspended some services, while seafood exporter John Ross said the chaos was like being \"thrown in the cold Atlantic without a lifejacket\".\nShane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, which represents chilled transport and storage companies, said the emerging problems had come despite the amount of cross-border traffic still being quite low.\n\"Trade flows are still only about 50% of what we would expect, but even at those levels we are seeing levels of confusion and delays,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"The feeling is we are building to quite a significant potential disruption.\"\nA government spokesman acknowledged that there had been \"some issues\", but said ministers had always been clear there would be some disruption at the end of the transition period.\nThe Cabinet Office said in a statement that the volume of border crossings had been low so far this year, but that it expected crossings to steadily increase to normal levels.\nThis brings the potential for \"significant disruption if traders and hauliers have not taken the necessary steps to comply with the new rules,\" the Cabinet Office said.\nOut of about 1,500 lorries per day trying to get from Great Britain to the EU in the new year, 700 have been turned away - mainly due to a lack of a negative Covid test for drivers, it said.\n\"We have always been clear there would be changes now that we are out of the customs union and single market, so full compliance with the new rules is vital to avoid disruption,\" said Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove.\nHowever, anger is growing among companies whose livelihoods depend on export trade.\nIn a letter on Friday to Business Secretary Alok Sharma, Scottish salmon producer John Ross Jr launched a stinging attack on the government's handling of the situation.\nThe firm's sales director, Victoria Leigh-Pearson, wrote that the company had in recent months \"had to endure the government issuing a barrage of useless information\" and an \"absence of factually correct information from all government agencies.\" It amounted, she said, to \"gross incompetence\".\nPart of the letter to Alok Sharma:\nAs I write, perishable goods that were dispatched from our facility five days ago, headed for France following a process that your department advised, have still not crossed the border. This usually takes only 24 hours because they are consolidated with the produce of other companies, which have not been able to follow the correct procedures due to a knowledge gap directly attributable to your department.\nEntire trucks are currently being rejected without explanation by the French customs authority. Our hauliers have now pulled their services as such a backlog has been created. Other hauliers are not taking on new customers. Today, we've even had confirmation that the IT systems of the UK and France are incompatible. After four years you only establish this now?\nYour so-called 'deal' is worthless if this situation is not fixed immediately, and unless you put in place measures to address the issues that continue to unfold on a daily basis. Moreover, as a seafood exporter, it feels as though our own government has thrown us into the cold Atlantic waters without a lifejacket.\nYours sincerely, Victoria Leigh-Pearson, Sales Director, John Ross\nJohn Ross is not the only Scottish seafood exporter suffering. The industry says it has been hit by a \"perfect storm\" of Brexit disruption, which could sink a centuries-old industry.  \n\"These businesses are not transporting toilet rolls or widgets. They are exporting the highest quality, perishable seafood which has a finite window to get to markets in peak condition,\" said Donna Fordyce, chief executive of Seafood Scotland.\n\"If the window closes, these consignments go to landfill.\"\nShe said the sector has already been weakened by Covid-19, the closure of the French border before Christmas as well as \"layer upon layer\" of problems associated with Brexit. \nThe group fears that without exports, the fishing fleet will have little reason to go out. \n\"In a very short time, we could see the destruction of a centuries-old market which contributes significantly to the Scottish economy,\" added Ms Fordyce.\nUK government Minister for Scotland David Duguid blamed Scottish leaders for the issues.\n\"The Scottish Government has persistently refused to accept the democratic vote to leave the EU, but that does not allow them to abdicate their responsibilities to Scottish businesses,\" he said.\n\"Over the past 18 months they have assured the fishing industry that the systems they were putting in place would be adequate. They clearly are not.\"\nParcel delivery service DPD UK said it had paused its European Road Service because of the '\"increased burden\" of customs paperwork for packages heading to the EU, including the Republic of Ireland.\nDPD said 20% of parcels had \"incorrect or incomplete data attached\", which meant they would have to be returned.\nIn an email to its business customers, the company said that it had been a \"challenging few days\" for its international operation, and that it would \"pause and review\" its service.  It plans to restart on 13 January. \n\"It has now become evident that we have an increased burden with the new, more complex processes, and additional customs data we require from you for your parcels destined to Europe\" the firm wrote. \nThe boss of one of Wales' largest hauliers said logistical problems have emerged at the Irish border too. \nAndrew Kinsella, managing director of Gwynedd Shipping, said his company has a backlog of 60 lorries waiting to be shipped to Dublin.\nHe said many hauliers are finding that their customers are not able to generate the special declarations that are needed to ultimately enable a lorry to get onto a ferry.   \n\"Whilst you don't see queues at ports and terminals the reality is that these queues are developing elsewhere in our depot in Holyhead, in our depot in Deeside and in our depot in Newport in South Wales, and lots of hauliers have depots in the proximity of ports,\" he said. \n\"There are a lot of issues about demarcation about who is going to arrange the export declaration with the UK revenue authorities, who's going to arrange the import declaration, the hauliers then trying to arrange the import safety and security declaration to create an ENS number which helps you generate a PBN number so there has been a lot of everyone finding their feet\".\nCorrection 9th April 2021: An earlier version of this article included a photo showing queues of lorries at Dover Port.

      "tags": "NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Two more life-saving drugs have been found that can cut deaths by a quarter in patients who are sickest with Covid. \nThe anti-inflammatory medications, given via a drip, save an extra life for every 12 treated, say researchers who have carried out a trial in NHS intensive care units. \nSupplies are already available across the UK so they can be used immediately to save hundreds of lives, say experts. \nThere are over 30,000 Covid patients in UK hospitals - 39% more than in April.\nThe UK government is working closely with the manufacturer, to ensure the drugs - tocilizumab and sarilumab - continue to be available to UK patients.\nAs well as saving more lives, the treatments speed up patients' recovery and reduce the length of time that critically-ill patients need to spend in intensive care by about a week. \nBoth appear to work equally well and add to the benefit already found with a cheap steroid drug called dexamethasone. \nAlthough the drugs are not cheap, costing around \u00a3500 per patient, on top of the \u00a35 course of dexamethasone, the advantage of using them is clear - and less than the cost per day of an intensive care bed of around \u00a32,000, say experts.\nLead researcher Prof Anthony Gordon, from Imperial College London, said: \"For every 12 patients you treat with these drugs you would expect to save a life. It's a big effect.\"\nIn the REMAP-CAP trial carried out in six different countries, including the UK, with around 800 intensive care patients:\nProf Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: \"The fact there is now another drug that can help to reduce mortality for patients with Covid-19 is hugely welcome news and another positive development in the continued fight against the virus.\"\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:  \"The UK has proven time and time again it is at the very forefront of identifying and providing the most promising, innovative treatments for its patients.  \n\"Today's results are yet another landmark development in finding a way out of this pandemic and, when added to the armoury of vaccines and treatments already being rolled out, will play a significant role in defeating this virus.\" \nThe drugs dampen down inflammation, which can go into overdrive in Covid patients and cause damage to the lungs and other organs. \nDoctors are being advised to give them to any Covid patient who, despite receiving dexamethasone, is deteriorating and needs intensive care.\nTocilizumab and sarilumab have already been added to the government's export restriction list, which bans companies from buying medicines meant for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country. \nThe research findings have not yet been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Vaccination,University of Oxford,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new vaccine that protects against Covid-19 is nearly 95% effective, early data from US company Moderna shows.\nThe results come hot on the heels of similar results from Pfizer, and add to growing confidence that vaccines can help end the pandemic. \nBoth companies used a highly innovative and experimental approach to designing their vaccines.\nModerna says it is a \"great day\" and they plan to apply for approval to use the vaccine in the next few weeks. \nHowever, this is still early data and key questions remain unanswered. \nThe trial involved 30,000 people in the US with half being given two doses of the vaccine, four weeks apart. The rest had dummy injections. \nThe analysis was based on the first 95 to develop Covid-19 symptoms. \nOnly five of the Covid cases were in people given the vaccine, 90 were in those given the dummy treatment. The company says the vaccine is protecting 94.5% of people. \nThe data also shows there were 11 cases of severe Covid in the trial, but none happened in people who were immunised. \n\"The overall effectiveness has been remarkable... it's a great day,\" Tal Zaks, the chief medical officer at Moderna, told BBC News. \nDr Stephen Hoge, the company's president, said he \"grinned ear to ear for a minute\" when the results came in.\nHe told BBC News: \"I don't think any of us really hoped that the vaccine would be 94% effective at preventing Covid-19 disease, that was really a stunning realisation.\"\nThat depends on where you are in the world and how old you are. \nModerna says it will apply to regulators in the US in the coming weeks. It expects to have 20 million doses available in the country. \nThe company hopes to have up to one billion doses available for use around the world next year and is planning to seek approval in other countries too. \nThe UK has today announced that, from spring, it will have five million doses of the Moderna vaccine, enough to vaccinate 2.5 million people. It has already outlined plans that prioritise the oldest people for immunisation. \nWe still do not know how long immunity will last as volunteers will have to be followed for much longer before that can be answered.\nThere are hints it offers some protection in older age groups, who are most at risk of dying from Covid, but there is not full data. \nMr Zaks told the BBC their data so far suggests the vaccine \"does not appear to lose its potency\" with age.\nAnd it is not known whether the vaccine just stops people becoming severely ill, or if it stops them spreading the virus too.\nAll these questions will affect how a coronavirus vaccine is used.\nNo significant safety concerns have been reported, but nothing, including paracetamol, is 100% safe.\nShort lived fatigue, headache and pain were reported after the injection in some patients.\n\"These effects are what we would expect with a vaccine that is working and inducing a good immune response,\" said Prof Peter Openshaw, from Imperial College London. \nBoth vaccines use the same approach of injecting part of the virus's genetic code in order to provoke an immune response.\nThe preliminary data we have seen so far is very similar - around 90% protection for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and around 95% for Moderna's.\nHowever, both trials are still taking place and the final numbers could change.\nModerna's vaccine appears to be easier to store as it remains stable at minus 20C for up to six months and can be kept in a standard fridge for up to a month.\nPfizer's vaccine needs ultra-cold storage at around minus 75C, but it can be kept in the fridge for five days. \nThe Sputnik V vaccine, developed in Russia, has also released very early data which suggests it is 92% effective.\nModerna has developed an \"RNA vaccine\" - it means part of the coronavirus's genetic code is injected into the body. \nThis starts making viral proteins, but not the whole virus, which is enough to train the immune system to attack.\nIt should train the body to make both antibodies - and another part of the immune system called T-cells to fight the coronavirus.\nIn the space of a week, the positive results from Pfizer, Moderna and Russia have transformed our chances of ending the pandemic.\nBefore the first results, the talk was of a vaccine that offered maybe 50% protection. Those expectations have been blown out of the water - not only are vaccines possible, they appear to be potent. \nThe data so far also raise hopes that the other vaccines in development will be successful too, but now as one challenge draws to an ends, another begins. \nThe logistical effort of actually vaccinating, potentially billions of people, around the world is gargantuan. \nSome experts have claimed normality by spring, others by next winter, others still think there is a long journey ahead.\nThe answer will depend on how quickly countries can get this \"hope in a vial\" into the arms of people. \n\"This news from Moderna is tremendously exciting and considerably boosts optimism that we will have a choice of good vaccines in the next few months,\" said Prof Peter Openshaw from Imperial College London.\nHe added: \"We need more complete details than we have in this press release, but this announcement adds to the general feeling of optimism.\"\nProf Trudie Lang, from the University of Oxford, said: \"It is very good news indeed to see another vaccine coming through with similar efficacy results as were reported last week from Pfizer. \n\"This is also an interim analysis, which means that there were enough cases within the vaccinated volunteers to give statistical significance and allow the team to break the blind to determine who had the active vaccine and who had placebo.\" \nDr Richard Hatchett, the head of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, said: \"The Moderna results are as good as we could have hoped for and really terrifically encouraging.\"\nFollow James on Twitter"

Because that will get us all out of this, whatever our role is, and we will get society out of this.\"\nAfter speaking to Ms Pelley and her colleagues about how they supported one another, the prince said: \"It's good that you and your team are keeping your spirits high and I always find that having some sort of sense of humour through everything is very important, otherwise we all go mad.\""

      "text": "Stormont ministers have clashed over the planned school transfer test scheduled for next month.\nSinn F\u00e9in, SDLP and Alliance ministers argued the test run by the Association for Quality Education (AQE) should not go ahead due to the Covid-19 crisis.\nDUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster, who chaired the meeting, rejected a call to put it to a vote.\nIt was agreed that Education Minister Peter Weir would present a paper on the issue at a future meeting.\nThe exchanges at the executive have been described as \"tense\" by some observers.\nSpeaking on Friday evening, Mrs Foster said it was \"about parental choice\" and if parents wished to pursue academic selection, it was \"a legal route\". \nShe said \"using Covid as an excuse\" to try and get rid of academic selection, was \"very, very wrong\". \nMrs Foster said it was important to prevent the misuse of the executive's any-other-business function, and \"that is why today's vote could not happen\". \n\"Other parties wanted it to happen,\" she said.\n\"If you allowed that to happen, then any majority of ministers could come along, and raise any sort of issue without having looked at the policy implications, or the procedures.\"\nThe attempt during the meeting at Stormont to halt the test was opposed by DUP ministers, who accused others of using the coronavirus crisis to attack grammar schools which use it.\nThe ministers who wanted the test to be cancelled insisted their position was not linked to the wider debate about academic selection in Northern Ireland.\nThe issue was raised during the any-other-business section of the meeting and First Minister Mrs Foster said that Stormont rules prevented a vote on substantive matters discussed during that time.\nLater Sinn F\u00e9in minister Deirdre Hargey said: \"Unfortunately there was a decision taken today by some not to allow a vote to take place on this issue. \n\"I feel there would have been parties that would have clearly backed my position and understand the concerns around this.  \n\"I do see that some of the grammar schools under AQE have moved, in not going ahead with academic selection. I commend the leadership that they have shown. I hope that others can follow in that leadership.\"\nMeanwhile, four grammar schools, Royal School Dungannon, Belfast Royal Academy, Victoria College and Campbell College have said they will not be using the AQE test to admit pupils this year. \nHowever Campbell College said it is obliged to host an AQE test if it goes ahead.\nStrabane Academy had already announced on Wednesday that it would not facilitate the additional test and would instead apply contingency criteria.\nThere has been controversy throughout this week about whether the transfer test should go ahead as lockdown restrictions tightened in Northern Ireland.\nIt is used by the majority of Northern Ireland grammar schools to select pupils.\nThe first in a series of tests was due to take place on Saturday but on Tuesday the exam providers said that would not happen.\nOne provider cancelled its test while another - the AQE - said it was moving its test to a single sitting in February.\nOn Friday, three of the 34 schools that normally use the test said they would not be proceeding with it this year.\nRoyal School Dungannon (RSD) in County Tyrone, one of Northern Ireland's oldest grammar schools, told parents of primary seven pupils in the area that its governers had \"unanimously decided\" against using the test.\nThe school was established in 1614 and has about 650 pupils.\nIn its letter to parents, the school said it still supported the principle of academic selection but would use its \"contingency admissions criteria\" for admitting pupils to year eight in September.\n\"Our most important consideration was giving certainty to P7 pupils and families during the Covid-19 public health crisis,\" said the school.\n\"The AQE test will therefore not take place at RSD on 27 February.\"\nIt added: \"We realise that the children have worked hard in preparing for the tests and that this is not how any of us would have wanted the transfer process to have worked this year.\"\nIt said its decision was \"in the best interests of the children's immediate welfare and their longer term prospects of success\".\nThe school said its contingency admissions criteria would soon be available on its website.\nSome grammar schools have already published criteria for how they would admit pupils if the transfer test does not take place.\nTwo Belfast schools have also pulled out of using the test.\nVictoria College said it \"did not consider it appropriate\" to run academic selection this year in the interests of the \"safety, health and wellbeing of parents, pupils and staff\".\n\"We understand fully that this is an emotive and divisive issue and that whilst this news will be welcomed by some it will cause anxiety for others,\" a letter from the school board read.\nThe school said it would review its contingency admissions criteria and publish it \"in due course\".\nBelfast Royal Academy has also decided against using the test this year, saying it hoped the move would \"alleviate any further anxiety\" for children and their parents.\nThe school said it would publish its contingency admissions criteria on Monday."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it is \"excellent news\" that a third coronavirus vaccine has been approved for use in the UK. \nIt is made by US company Moderna and works in a similar way to the Pfizer one already being offered on the NHS. \nThe UK has pre-ordered 17 million doses of the Moderna vaccine - 10 million more than planned - but supplies are not expected to arrive until spring.\nIt is the last Covid vaccine with final trial data published. \nThere are hundreds still in development, with some expected to report findings in the near future. \nAround 1.5 million people in the UK have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine so far, with either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines already approved by UK regulators.\nThat figure includes almost a quarter of those aged over 80 in England - people at highest risk of severe illness or death from the virus.\nVaccines are being given to the most vulnerable first, as set out in a list of nine high-priority groups, covering around 30 million people in the UK. \nThe prime minister has said the aim is to vaccinate 15 million people in the UK by mid-February, including care homes residents and staff, frontline NHS staff, everyone over 70 and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. \nHealth and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"This is further great news and another weapon in our arsenal to tame this awful disease.\"\nThe UK had originally ordered 7 million doses of the Moderna jab, but has increased this to get even more people immunised as quickly as possible. \nIn total, the UK has now ordered 367 million doses of vaccines to protect against Covid-19.\nNadhim Zahawi, vaccine deployment minister, said: \"The NHS is pulling out all the stops to vaccinate those most at risk as quickly as possible, with over 1,000 vaccination sites live across the UK by the end of the week to provide easy access to everyone, regardless of where they live.\n\"The Moderna vaccine will be a vital boost to these efforts and will help us return to normal faster.\"\nThe Moderna vaccine, an RNA vaccine like Pfizer's, injects part of the virus's genetic code in order to provoke an immune response.\nIt requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a normal freezer. \nIn comparison, the Pfizer/BioNTech one requires temperatures closer to -75C, making transport logistics much more difficult.\nThe AstraZeneca jab is easier to store and distribute, as it can be kept at normal fridge temperature.\nAll of these vaccines require a second booster shot, but a first dose is likely to be given to as many people as possible.\nIn trials with more than 30,000, the Moderna vaccine offered nearly 95% protection from severe Covid. \nNo vaccine is 100% effective and it takes time for protection to build. For all of the Covid vaccines, we still do not know how long immunity will last. \nPeople who have received a coronavirus vaccine should continue to follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others. \nEU and US regulators have already approved the Moderna vaccine."

      "text": "All international passengers will soon have to test negative for Covid-19 before travelling to the UK.\nPeople arriving by plane, train or boat, including UK nationals, will have to take a test up to 72 hours before leaving the country they are in.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said travellers \"can't board... without having that negative test\".\nBut even with a negative test, arrivals from countries not on the travel corridor list must still quarantine.\nMr Shapps said the government was \"very keen\" to set up compulsory testing now because of the new variant of the virus circulating in South Africa, which he said was \"causing great concern with the scientists\". \n\"They're not sure whether, for example, the vaccine will be able to deal with it in the first place, and we're very, very keen to keep it out,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\nThe new variant prevalent in South Africa has got some potentially concerning changes that experts are closely monitoring. While it is extremely unlikely the mutations would render vaccines useless, scientists are doing tests to make sure immunisation will still work well.\nEven in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked in a matter of weeks or months to be a better match if necessary, experts say.\nIt comes after a further 1,162 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK on Thursday - the second consecutive day of more than 1,000 recorded fatalities. There were also 52,618 new cases.\nThe R number - the average number of people that one infected person will infect - is now between one and 1.4, scientists have estimated.\nAmid the surge in cases, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to offer \"hundreds of thousands\" of Covid vaccines per day in England by 15 January. On Friday, a third vaccine - made by Moderna - was approved for use in the UK.\nUnder the new rules - which are expected to come in from next week - anyone who arrives in the UK and has not got proof of a negative test could face an immediate \u00a3500 fine.\nBut there will be exemptions for:\nAll passengers arriving from countries not on the government's travel corridor list must still self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of their test result.\nMr Shapps told LBC the testing rule will come into force \"likely on Wednesday or Thursday next week\", and details of how to get tests abroad will be published on the gov.uk website.\nThe rule will be UK-wide, although Northern Ireland said it had only \"agreed in principle\" and was working to solve any policy and operational issues.\nNon-essential travel abroad is not currently allowed in the UK, after lockdowns were brought in.\n\"All in all, the thought of an idyllic holiday 'away from it all' has been about as far from the truth as possible,\" says Rob Howard, who is is currently on holiday in Tenerife.\nHe flew out before Christmas and - after deciding to extend his holiday by a week and rebooking a cancelled flight - is due to fly back next Wednesday.\nReacting to the news that he will now likely need to take a Covid test before travelling, Rob, from Nuneaton, says: \"We are going to be expected to self isolate for 10 days so what is the point of this?\" \nMeanwhile, freelance MOT tester Matthew Auty, who lives in Normandy in France but works in Portsmouth during the week, says he's unhappy about the potential cost.\n\"These restrictions are reasonable for tourist travel but they are unfair for people in my position,\" he says.\nFigures from the aviation industry have urged the government to lift the rules as quickly as possible.\n\"This measure will destroy any confidence in forward bookings for air travel and for ferries, and it will essentially close off the UK,\" said Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary.\nHe called for the government to set an \"end date\" for the rules, adding: \"The real solution to this is vaccination, not artificial travel restrictions.\n\"Boris Johnson has told us he will have vaccinated the 14 million high risk categories by the middle of February. What we need Grant Shapps to do today is confirm then that this ridiculous pre-arrival testing will then be removed by the middle of February.\"\nThe boss of Heathrow, John Holland-Kaye, said of the rule: \"If this will help, then so be it.\"\nBut he called it a \"really belt and braces approach\", adding: \"We have always argued for pre-departure testing as an alternative to quarantine... now we're going to have both\".\n\"And it can only be a temporary measure, very few people will travel with this in place,\" he added to BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nTim Alderslade, the chief executive of the industry body Airlines UK, said the move should be \"a short-term, emergency measure only\".\n\"Once the rollout of the vaccine accelerates, the focus must be on returning travel to normal as quickly as possible\", he added, including \"removing the need to quarantine or test\".\nLabour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the new measures were \"necessary\" but highlighted that the opposition party \"has been calling for a comprehensive strategy on testing for international travel since April\".\nIt comes after England banned travellers from countries near South Africa to stop the spread of the new local Covid variant.\nThe latest travel curbs come as all of the UK is under strict Covid rules, with lockdowns in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland - meaning there is very little international travel.\nAt a Downing Street press conference on Thursday, the prime minister confirmed almost 1.5 million people in the UK had now received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, but warned there would likely be \"lumpiness and bumpiness\" as the rollout continued.\nThe government has set a target to offer vaccination slots to the top four priority groups - including all over-80s - by 15 February.\nAre you currently abroad?

      "text": "The storming of the US Capitol building in Washington DC stunned viewers around the world.\nBut how did Americans feel seeing the seat of their government being ransacked?\nWe asked members of our BBC voter panel for their views.\nSimon grew up in Uganda during its civil war and became a US citizen last year. A master's student and stay-at-home father, he warns that, while things may settle down, \"democracy is not guaranteed\".\nI'm disgusted but not surprised. I anticipated this would happen and it was a matter of when, not if. \nI didn't anticipate that it would happen in the capital. This is the president whose people - since the racial justice movement in the summer - said they were for \"law and order\". So the \"law and order\" people broke into the Capitol and changed the American flag with the Trump flag. History shows that has not happened in over 200 years, so it tells you how dangerous this man is.\nIn Uganda, in November, when the opposition was arrested, people took to the streets and got shot. Here, in the summer, the Capitol building was protected and they were breaking up peaceful protests. \nIt's clear that [Trump supporters] have been organising, we've seen this was going to happen, yet we subconsciously did not think that white people are a threat. That is the construct of this country and how law enforcement viewed it.\nTaylor is a staunch Trump supporter and recently travelled to Washington DC for a post-election pro-Trump rally. A photographer by trade, she was upset by the rioting but believes unsubstantiated claims that left-wing radicals were behind the violence.\nIt was just heart-breaking to watch what was going on and the behaviour of protesters is just not like the Trump people I've been around. If it did come from any conservatives, then I condemn it. There's no excuse for violence. \nIt doesn't change my support for Trump. The people that love Trump, that's not going to change no matter if he gets a second term or not. It just means we're going to hold out for 2024 and hope either he runs again or his kids do.\nOur country is going to go downhill over the next four years if Biden does take office. I'm actually moving today out of the city into the suburbs of a Republican county because I am afraid of how Democratic counties will end up under a Biden presidency. \nWe're going to catapult towards socialism and communism. I'm worried for the country's future, but regardless of who takes office, we have a lot of healing to do. I hope we can all find our common humanity and embrace each other when this is all over, which is hopefully soon.\nJames is a lifelong Republican who worked on Capitol Hill for the party for nearly two decades, but cast his first ever vote for a Democrat in the 2020 election. He was stunned by 6 January's events and expects it to become a bad footnote in the country's history.\nI find it absolutely shocking. I didn't think it would come to this. \nI had actually thought about going down to the protests with a sign that said \"Republicans Against Trump\". My brother said, if I had done that, there would have been five deaths, not four, and he may have been right. I'm astounded by the stupidity of these people who show up without masks and who are being filmed. Quite a few of them are going to prison. It's a serious situation when you break past a police barricade and go into a building that's supposed to be secure.\nI have a lot of friends who say things couldn't get worse, but I have to remind them, as a student of history, that it has been worse. The Civil War was much worse. There was a lot of violence in the South during the Reconstruction period. This is something the country will get over. I was heartened by President-elect Biden's speech yesterday. Finally we've got someone who's sounding presidential. We haven't had it for the last four years.\nA'Kayla is a college student who supports the Black Lives Matter movement. She says law enforcement \"coddled\" the rioters at the Capitol and thus made an argument for police reform because they were far more aggressive at protests she attended.\nIt's so irritating I can't put into words how frustrating it is. They stormed the Capitol and the police were gentle and lackadaisical with them. I expected the police to use force, but they were so kind and gentle. During the summer, when the Black Lives Matter protests were going on, so many people were injured, locked up and lost their lives. \nFrom my own experience, marching peacefully on the front lines in Charleston, we had tear gas thrown at us and had to pour milk in our eyes. It was excruciating. And for what? We're marching for a cause, because we had the murder of somebody by the police. What are they upset about? They're upset because we are living in a democracy and they didn't get their way.\nDuring one of the debates, when Trump said \"stand back and stand by\", is this what he was talking about? This is the calm before the storm. I think it's going to get way more ugly, but Kamala [Harris] and Joe [Biden] are a symbol of change and hope. \nWhether [Trump supporters] like it or not, America is moving towards a more progressive country and there's going to be a lot of changes."

However, with tighter restrictions and passenger numbers falling, it is no longer appropriate to do this.\nHe added that as the vaccination programme was rolled out and government guidance changed, the company would regularly review when services could restart. \n\"We plan to be back on the road as soon as the time is right and have put a provisional restart date of Monday 1 March in place,\" he said.\nNational Express first suspended coach services during the coronavirus crisis in April, then restarted in July.\nServices have been operating at half capacity, with strict cleaning and Covid protocols. As the tier structure came into operation, demand for services reduced.\nAs with the previous suspension, employees will be furloughed. \nFirms that transport passengers, including coach, rail and aviation businesses, have been under intense pressure during the coronavirus crisis.\nAvanti West Coast, the train operating company running services on the West Coast mainline, has confirmed it will cut its timetable from 18 January. \nAvanti says the new timetable will 'more closely reflect the current demand for our services whilst still allowing key workers, and those needing to make essential journeys, to travel with confidence'.\nDuring the first major lockdown in March, services on key intercity routes were reduced from three an hour to one. This included services from both Manchester and Birmingham to London.\nThe Department for Transport has been consulting with all train operators about service reductions during the latest lockdown. \nThe exact scale of reduction is still being worked on, but the DfT says service levels may fall to as low as 40% of the normal timetable by some operators. \nThe focus is to ensure essential workers can still make essential journeys. \nAn Avanti West Coast spokesperson said: \n\"Following discussions with the Department for Transport we will be introducing a new timetable on Monday 18 January. This will more closely reflect the current demand for our services whilst still allowing key workers, and those needing to make essential journeys, to travel with confidence.\"\nOn Thursday, Ryanair also announced that it would make big cuts to its flight schedule from 21 January, with few, if any flights to or from the UK or Ireland until \"draconian travel restrictions are removed\".\nTrain services are expected to be reduced in lockdown, with some in the industry anticipating reductions of between 50% and 60% compared with normal service.\nIn the first national lockdown in England, services were reduced to almost half."

      "tags": "Impeachment of Donald Trump,US Capitol stormed,Nancy Pelosi,Donald Trump,United States",
      "text": "Former US President Donald Trump is being put on trial by lawmakers for allegedly inciting a riot at the US Capitol.\nLast month Mr Trump became the first president in US history to be charged with misconduct - or impeached - twice by the lower chamber of Congress.\nRepublicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to pass an article of impeachment that accused Mr Trump of \"incitement of insurrection\".\nThe article alleged that Mr Trump had made false allegations of election fraud and encouraged his supporters to storm Congress on 6 January.\nNow a trial is being held in the upper chamber of Congress, the Senate, which will decide whether to convict or clear Mr Trump of the charge.\nThis is an unprecedented moment for the US, which has never put an impeached president on trial after they have left office.\nSo, what can we expect?\nThe trial in the Senate is political, rather than criminal. A vote will be held at the end of the trial to determine whether Mr Trump is guilty of the charge.\nA two-thirds majority of the 100-member Senate must back a guilty verdict to convict Mr Trump.\nIf Mr Trump is convicted, senators could also vote to bar him from ever holding public office again.\nThe trial opened on Tuesday with a four-hour debate on whether the proceedings were unconstitutional because Mr Trump is no longer president. A 56-44 majority then voted in favour of continuing, with six Republicans backing the measure. \nEach side will then be given 16 hours in total to make their arguments, and this will be limited to eight hours in any one day. \nThere will be an option to request a debate and a vote on whether witnesses should be called.\nBoth Democrats and Republicans are said to favour a speedy trial, amid an ongoing effort to get President Joe Biden's Covid-19 relief plan approved. \nIt is thought a vote on a conviction could come as early as Monday if no witnesses are called.\nDemocrats prosecuting the case opened the proceedings by showing a dramatic video montage of Mr Trump's 6 January speech and the deadly rioting by some of his supporters.\n\"That's a high crime and misdemeanour,\" Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland - who is leading the case - said of the footage. \"If that's not an impeachable offence, then there's no such thing.\"\nThey say Mr Trump is \"personally responsible\" for the riot and must be convicted.\nAccording to a pre-trial legal brief, they will say his repeated refusal to concede the election led to an \"incitement of insurrection against the republic he swore to protect\".\nMr Trump's \"statements turned his 'wild' rally on 6 January into a powder keg waiting to blow\", they will argue.\nAlthough he is no longer in office, Mr Trump \"must answer comprehensively for his conduct in office from his first day in office through his last\", Democrats argue.\nThey have called for Mr Trump to be disqualified from ever running for office again.\nOn the opening day, his defence lawyers argued unsuccessfully that it was unconstitutional to put a private citizen through the impeachment process. \nDefence lawyer David Schoen said the Democrats were using \"the guise of impeachment as a tool to disenfranchise\" those who support Donald Trump.\nHis lawyers are now likely to change tack and argue that Mr Trump's supporters stormed Congress of their own accord. \nAccording to their own pre-trial brief, they will argue that Mr Trump's pre-riot remarks did not amount to incitement. \nThe former president's call to \"fight\" was not meant to be taken literally, they say.\n\"To characterise this statement alone as 'incitement to insurrection' is to ignore, wholesale, the remainder of Mr Trump's speech that day, including his call for his supporters to 'peacefully' making their 'voices heard,'\" they add.\nMoreover, FBI documents had shown that the riot was planned days in advance, the lawyers said.\nIt is never happened before, so it is untested and the US Constitution does not say.\nImpeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon were ended when he quit in 1974.\nSo Mr Trump could take his case to the Supreme Court, claiming his trial was unconstitutional.\nSome lower ranked officials have been impeached after leaving office.\nThat is certainly what prosecutors wanted. Last week, they sent a letter inviting him to testify under oath \"at a mutually convenient time and place\".\nThe prosecution team suggested that they would cite Mr Trump's silence as further proof that their allegations were true.\nWithin hours, however, the former president's lawyers had rejected the request as a publicity stunt.\nThey made clear he would not testify voluntarily. The prosecutors do have the power to issue a subpoena - or an order to compel him to appear in court to testify - but that is considered unlikely.\nSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts presided over the first impeachment trial of Mr Trump, but will not do so again.\nDemocratic Senator Patrick Leahy - third in the line of presidential succession - is presiding over the trial instead.\nProsecuting the case are nine House Democrats, known as the impeachment managers.\nMr Trump is being represented by two attorneys - Bruce Castor and David Schoen.\nAll 100 US senators have been sworn in as jurors in the trial.\nDemocrats only hold half the 100 seats so they would require 17 Republicans to vote against someone from their own party.\nThat is a high bar for a party that has largely remained publicly loyal to Mr Trump.\nTen Republicans in the House supported impeachment and a handful of senators have indicated they are open to it.\nBut Tuesday's vote implied loyalty toward the former president in his party remained high enough to avoid a conviction.\nIf he is convicted by the Senate, lawmakers must hold another vote to block him from running for elected office again - which he had indicated he planned to do in 2024.\nThis could be the biggest consequence of this impeachment.\nIf he is convicted, a simple majority of senators would be needed to block Mr Trump from holding \"any office of honour, trust or profit under the United States\".\nSo 50 senators plus a casting vote from Vice-President Kamala Harris would be enough to damn Mr Trump's hopes of political power.\nThis could be appealing to Republicans hoping to run for president in the future and those who want Mr Trump out of the party.\nThere has been talk of Mr Trump losing benefits granted to his predecessors under the 1958 Former Presidents Act, which include a pension and health insurance, and potentially a lifetime security detail at taxpayers' expense. \nHowever, Mr Trump is likely to keep these benefits if he is convicted after leaving office.\nThat was over his dealings with Ukraine, although he denied any wrongdoing.\nHe was accused of pressing the country's leader to open an investigation into Mr Biden, then his emerging rival for the White House, and his son Hunter.\nMr Trump appeared to use military aid as leverage. He was impeached by the House and cleared by the then Republican-controlled Senate."

But the Senate acquitted him on both charges in February 2020.\nNo US president has ever been impeached twice. However, the prospect of an impeachment conviction seems remote because of Mr Trump's Republican broad support in the Senate.\nOne moderate Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, told the Anchorage Daily News on Friday that Trump simply \"needs to get out\". And Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a regular critic of Trump, said he would \"definitely consider\" impeachment. \nBut there is so far no indication that enough members of the president's party would agree to convict him.\nThat means an impeachment in the House might only be a symbolic action to hold Mr Trump accountable for the invasion of Congress.\nAn internal Senate memo says the soonest it could take up any articles of impeachment from the House would be on 19 January, the day before Mr Trump's term expires, and a trial could only begin after he had left office.\nConstitutional experts are split on whether impeachment can still proceed to a Senate trial in this event.\nIf convicted, Mr Trump would lose benefits granted to former presidents, and senators could vote to bar him permanently from public office.\nThe unprecedented move comes as an isolated Mr Trump holed up at the White House on Friday and his main means of communication with the outside world, Twitter, banned him from its platform.\nThe siege of the Capitol has put senior politicians on edge, prompting the Democratic House Speaker Pelosi to talk to the nation's top military officer about ways to prevent Mr Trump from accessing nuclear codes.\nIn a dramatic day in Washington DC on Friday, other developments included: \nThe draft resolution, which has been shared with BBC partner CBS News, consists of one article: \"incitement of insurrection\".\n\"Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanours by willfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States,\" the draft reads.\nIn the resolution, the lawmakers accuse the president of making statements that encouraged and resulted in \"imminent lawless action at the Capitol\".\nThe draft also says this was \"consistent with his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct\" the certification of President-elect Biden's win in November's presidential election.\n\"He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States,\" the draft says.\nThe president urged his supporters to march on the Capitol on the day Mr Biden's electoral college victory was to be confirmed by Congress.\nHe held a rally at which he repeatedly cast doubt on the legitimacy of the presidential election, alleging, without evidence, that it was \"stolen\" from him.\n\"We're going to walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and Congressmen and women,\" Mr Trump told the crowd, exhorting his supporters \"to fight\".\nDemocrats and some Republicans have argued that these words amounted to incitement.\nImpeachment allows Congress - the part of the US government that writes and brings in laws - to put presidents on trial.\nArticles of impeachment are charges brought against a president by the House of Representatives. If the House votes to pass them, proceedings move to the Senate, which decides whether or not to convict.\nIt is a rare event and a political process, rather than a criminal one.\nMr Trump was the third US president to have been impeached.\nThe two others, Bill Clinton in 1999 and Andrew Johnson in 1868, were left in office by the Senate.\nPresident Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached.\nOn Wednesday, with Washington still reeling from the Capitol riot, Democrats held a conference call in which they talked for three hours about the prospect of removing the president from office. \nCBS News reports that Democrats were overwhelmingly supportive of the effort, with just one, Oregon Representative Kurt Schrader, arguing that such a move would be too divisive for the country.\nMrs Pelosi told her members that her preference would be to see Mr Trump removed by the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness.\nIf that did not happen, impeachment would be on the table, she said.\nUS media reports say Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been personally involved in discussions about invoking the 25th Amendment.\nHowever, such a course of action is said to be highly unlikely, and there is no sign that Vice-President Pence is prepared to use the amendment. \nOn Friday, Mrs Pelosi called Mr Trump \"unhinged\" and said Congress must do everything possible to protect Americans while he is in office.\nIn a later statement, Ms Pelosi said the House Democratic Caucus had a \"sad, moving and patriotic\" discussion about the possibility of impeachment.

      "text": "Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world. \nA range of vaccines are being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying. \nIt is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet many people are still vulnerable. \nThe restrictions on our lives help keep the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread. \nVaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are \"the\" exit strategy from the pandemic.\nThe three vaccine frontrunners are those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca.\nPfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design.\nThey inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. \nThese have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. \nThe Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe.\nIt is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures.\nAll three are supposed to be given as two doses.\nA single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has now been approved for use in the UK.\nTwenty million doses of the jab, which was 85% effective in stopping severe illness from Covid-19 in trials, will arrive later this year.\nBecause only one dose is needed - and the vaccine can be stored in a fridge - it could have a significant impact around the world. A billion doses are planned this year.\nAnother jab, Novavax, is also being reviewed by drugs regulators.\nIt uses a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body. \nThere are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US. \nThe Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection.\nThe Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according to late stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised.\nThe vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death.\nIt is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic. \nHowever, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid.\nNonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown. \nUnderstanding which method produces the best results will be explored in challenge trials where people are deliberately infected with the virus.\nNew versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world. \nHowever, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first \"real-world\" data on the new variants.\nBoth showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading.\nThe results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target.\nWe may need to change the vaccines we use in the future."

Part of me still can't believe in his death five years ago, but maybe that's because there's a part of me where he's still alive and always will be.\"\nOn Friday, Bowie's previously unreleased covers of Bob Dylan's Tryin' to Get to Heaven and John Lennon's Mother were also put out into the world.\nBBC Four is hosting a Bowie Night on Friday, while there will be special programmes on BBC Radio 4 and 6 Music. They include Bowie: Dancing Out in Space, which will air simultaneously on the two stations on Sunday.\nIn it, producer Tony Visconti describes how Bowie and Lennon first met awkwardly in a New York hotel room ahead of their collaborations on the former's cover of The Beatles' Across the Universe and his own 1975 song Fame.\n\"He was terrified of meeting John Lennon,\" says Visconti. \"About one in the morning I knocked on the door and for about the next two hours, John Lennon and David weren't speaking to each other.\n\"Instead, David was sitting on the floor with an art pad and a charcoal and he was sketching things and he was completely ignoring Lennon.\n\"So, after about two hours of that, he [John] finally said to David, 'Rip that pad in half and give me a few sheets. I want to draw you.' So David said, 'Oh, that's a good idea', and he finally opened up. So John started making caricatures of David, and David started doing the same of John and they kept swapping them and then they started laughing and that broke the ice.\"\nMeanwhile, next weekend will see the release of Stardust, a film biopic about Bowie's journey to becoming Ziggy Stardust, starring singer and actor Johnny Flynn.\nHowever, Bowie's family have not given it their blessing, meaning the film-makers were not allowed to use any of his music. Instead Flynn, as Bowie, is seen performing songs by Jacques Brel, The Yardbirds and one of Flynn's own compositions.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "The Australian city of Brisbane has begun a snap three-day lockdown after a cleaner in its hotel quarantine system became infected with coronavirus.\nHealth officials said the cleaner had the highly transmissible UK variant and they were afraid it could spread.\nBrisbane has seen very few cases of the virus beyond quarantined travellers since Australia's first wave last year.\nIt is the first known instance of this variant entering the Australian community outside of hotel quarantine.\nThe lockdown is for five populous council areas in Queensland's state capital.\nPremier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced the measure on Friday morning local time, about 16 hours after the woman tested positive.\nMs Palaszczuk said the lockdown aimed to halt the virus as rapidly as possible, adding: \"Doing three days now could avoid doing 30 days in the future.\"\n\"I think everybody in Queensland... knows what we are seeing in the UK and other places around the world is high rates of infection from this particular strain,\" she said.\n\"And we do not want to see that happening here in our great state.\"\nAustralia has reported 28,500 coronavirus infections and 909 deaths since the pandemic began. By contrast, the US, which is the hardest-hit country, has recorded more than 21 million infections while nearly 362,000 people have died of the disease.\nThe lockdown will begin at 18:00 on Friday (08:00 GMT) in the Brisbane city, Logan and the Ipswich, Moreton and Redlands local government areas. \nResidents will only be allowed to leave home for certain reasons, such as buying essential items and seeking medical care. \nFor the first time, residents in those areas will also be required to wear masks outside of their homes.\nAustralia has faced sporadic outbreaks over the past year, with the most severe one in Melbourne triggering a lockdown for almost four months. \nA pre-Christmas outbreak in Sydney caused fresh alarm, but aggressive testing and contact-tracing has kept infection numbers low. The city recorded four local cases on Friday.\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison's government has pledged to start mass vaccinations in February instead of March as was planned.\nSimon Atkinson, BBC News in Brisbane\nAt 8:00 today I popped to the local supermarket for some bread, milk - and because it's summer here - a mango. I was pretty much the only customer.\nWhen I went past the same shop a couple of hours later it was a different story - 50 people standing in the drizzle - queuing to get inside as others emerged with bulging shopping bags. \"Heaps busier than Christmas,\"  a cheery trolley attendant told me. \"It's off the scale\".\nDespite the \"don't panic\" messages from authorities, pictures on social media show it's a pattern being repeated across the city.\nWhile shutdowns are common around the world, the tough and sudden stay-at-home order for Brisbane has caught people on the hop here after months of near normality. \nBut while such a rapid, hard lockdown off the back of just a single case of Covid-19 will seem crazy in some parts of the world, I've not come across too many people complaining.\nAnd I don't think that's just because Aussies love to follow a rule. This is the first time the UK variant of the virus has been detected in the community in Australia.\nAnd nobody here wants Brisbane to go through what Melbourne suffered last year. Even if it means going without mangoes."

      "tags": "US Capitol stormed,Donald Trump,US politics",
      "text": "The US is reeling after supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol building in Washington DC on the day Congress was meeting to confirm Joe Biden's election victory.\nLawmakers were forced to take shelter, the building was put into lockdown and four people died in the chaos that followed a pro-Trump rally near the White House. \nHere's a breakdown of how events unfolded on Wednesday.\nJust before midday local time (17:00 GMT) thousands of people gather at the Ellipse, near the White House, to hear the president speak at a \"Save America\" rally. \nHe tells them: \"We're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue... and we're going to the Capitol and we're going to try and give\u2026 our Republicans, the weak ones... the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.\"\nAs the speech ends, crowds start to drift towards the Congress building, about a mile and a half away, where they are met by police barriers.\nThe Capitol is home to the two chambers of the US government that make up Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate. \nChanting crowds start to gather on both sides of the building at around 13:10, grappling with police at the metal barricades. \nTear gas and pepper spray are used to try to keep the protesters at bay. \nPolice officers struggle to maintain control of the situation as protesters advance on the building on multiple fronts. \nOn the east side, the crowd force their way through barricades on the Capitol Plaza and move on the main entrance, quickly gaining access to the Great Rotunda. \nOnce inside, they head for the House and Senate chambers. \nIgor Bobic, a journalist for the Huffington Post, captures a group of men forcing a police officer to retreat up a set of stairs as they continue their advance. \nSenators are forced to abandon the process of confirming President-elect Biden's victory and the building goes into lockdown.\nThe doors of the House chamber are locked and a makeshift barricade is erected in front of them. Security officials guard the entrance, guns drawn.\nWithin an hour, protesters have also broken police lines on the west side of the Capitol, scaling walls to reach the building itself before smashing windows and forcing doors open. \nOther videos and images show rioters storming through the building's ornately-decorated corridors and chambers chanting \"USA!\" and \"Stop the steal\".\nShortly before 15:00, gunshots are reportedly heard inside the building. \nPhotos and video footage later show a female protester being shot as she tries to break through the barricaded doors of the Speakers' Lobby. \nDespite efforts by police and others at the scene to save her, she is later reported to have died.\nOn the other side of the building, protesters break into the Senate chamber, one taking seat in the Speaker's chair. \nAnother protester is photographed nearby sitting in Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office, with his foot on the table.\nAfter growing condemnation of the riots, President Trump eventually calls for calm, telling the protesters to leave peacefully: \"Go home. We love you, you're very special.\"\nBy 17:40, the building is cleared and made secure ahead of the 18:00 curfew ordered by DC Mayor Muriel Bowser. \nSeveral thousand National Guard troops, FBI agents and US Secret Service are deployed to help.\nMore than six hours after the storming of the building, senators return and resume the day's business of certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election.\nAt 03:41 on Thursday, Congress confirms President-elect Joe Biden will succeed President Trump on 20 January. \n."

      "text": "Google's plan to replace web browser cookies with a system that shares less data with advertisers is being investigated in the UK.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said Google's plan could have a \"significant impact\" on news websites and the digital advertising market.\nIt had already raised concerns that publishers' profits could sink if they were unable to run personalised ads.\nBut Google said digital advertising practices had to \"evolve\".\nCookies are small files a web browser stores on a user's device when they visit a webpage.\nThey can be used to remember what items a person has added to their online basket and deliver personalised content.\nThey can also be used to track somebody's activity online and deliver targeted advertising.\nSome cookies known as cross-site or third-party cookies can let publishers track a person's web activity as they move from one website to another.\nBy default, Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox browsers already block cross-site cookies.\nBut Google intends to go further by ending support for all cookies except first-party ones - those used by sites to track activity within their own pages.\nIt wants to replace them with new tools that give advertisers more limited, anonymised information such as how many users visited a promoted product's page after seeing a relevant ad - but not tie this information to individual users.\nAccording to one industry group opposing the move, Google's Chrome browser is installed on more than 70% of computers in the UK.\nSo even if other web browsers do not adopt the same approach the move would still be significant.\n\"Google's Privacy Sandbox proposals will potentially have a very significant impact on publishers like newspapers, and the digital advertising market. But there are also privacy concerns to consider,\" said Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA.\nA coalition of about a dozen small tech companies and publishers - Marketers for an Open Web (Mow) - claims some of its members' revenues could drop by as much as two-thirds.\nMoreover, it suggests the move would put too much power into Google's hands.\n\"Google will effectively control how websites can monetise and operate their business,\" it warned last month.\n\"This means that any business that buys or sells advertising will be reliant on Google for a part of the process, whether they like it or not. \n\"This will reduce the ability of independent players to compete with Google, strengthening its monopoly control of online commerce.\"\nThe group has also raised concerns about other related matters, including the tech firm's plan to end support for user-agent strings.\nThese are bits of text that browsers send to websites at the start of a user's visit to reveal details about the device and browser being used. \nPublishers use this information to optimise the way their sites appear. \nBut Google is phasing out support on the grounds that they are also used as an alternative to cookies to track users, and sometimes cause compatibility issues.\nThe CMA previously issued a report into the matter in July.\nAt that point it acknowledged that while there were benefits to consumers from the kinds of privacy measures Google was proposing, they might be outweighed by other concerns.\nIt added that \"many news publishers\" had expressed concern that their news sites would become \"unsustainable\".\nUntil recently, the European Commission was responsible for most large and complex competition cases involving the UK.\nOn 1 January, the CMA took over these responsibilities on a local level due to Brexit.\nLast November, the government announced it would create a new Digital Markets Unit within the CMA. \nThe organisation subsequently detailed how it would to govern the behaviour of Google, Facebook and other tech platforms \"that currently dominate\" online markets, and give consumers \"more control over how their data is used\".\nThe new unit becomes operational in April, but is dependent on legislation going through Parliament before it gets new powers, and that may not happen until 2022.\nSince that would be too late to block Google's Privacy Sandbox plans, the probe is being carried out under the existing regime.\nEven so, all those involved will be watching closely for signs of how willing the authority is to confront the US's largest tech companies."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

If it comes to the UK and we then send it to Ireland, in theory it would have some tax on it,\" he added.\nM&S said it was \"actively working to mitigate\" the effects of the \"rules of origin\" regulations, under which products are taxed differently depending on which country they come from.\nOther firms have also been hit by the confusion caused by new Brexit trading rules.\nParcels giant DPD has suspended some services, while seafood exporter John Ross said the chaos was like being \"thrown in the cold Atlantic without a lifejacket\".\nShane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, which represents chilled transport and storage companies, said the emerging problems had come despite the amount of cross-border traffic still being quite low.\n\"Trade flows are still only about 50% of what we would expect, but even at those levels we are seeing levels of confusion and delays,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"The feeling is we are building to quite a significant potential disruption.\"\nA government spokesman acknowledged that there had been \"some issues\", but said ministers had always been clear there would be some disruption at the end of the transition period.\nThe Cabinet Office said in a statement that the volume of border crossings had been low so far this year, but that it expected crossings to steadily increase to normal levels.\nThis brings the potential for \"significant disruption if traders and hauliers have not taken the necessary steps to comply with the new rules,\" the Cabinet Office said.\nOut of about 1,500 lorries per day trying to get from Great Britain to the EU in the new year, 700 have been turned away - mainly due to a lack of a negative Covid test for drivers, it said.\n\"We have always been clear there would be changes now that we are out of the customs union and single market, so full compliance with the new rules is vital to avoid disruption,\" said Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove.\nHowever, anger is growing among companies whose livelihoods depend on export trade.\nIn a letter on Friday to Business Secretary Alok Sharma, Scottish salmon producer John Ross Jr launched a stinging attack on the government's handling of the situation.\nThe firm's sales director, Victoria Leigh-Pearson, wrote that the company had in recent months \"had to endure the government issuing a barrage of useless information\" and an \"absence of factually correct information from all government agencies.\" It amounted, she said, to \"gross incompetence\".\nPart of the letter to Alok Sharma:\nAs I write, perishable goods that were dispatched from our facility five days ago, headed for France following a process that your department advised, have still not crossed the border. This usually takes only 24 hours because they are consolidated with the produce of other companies, which have not been able to follow the correct procedures due to a knowledge gap directly attributable to your department.\nEntire trucks are currently being rejected without explanation by the French customs authority. Our hauliers have now pulled their services as such a backlog has been created. Other hauliers are not taking on new customers. Today, we've even had confirmation that the IT systems of the UK and France are incompatible. After four years you only establish this now?\nYour so-called 'deal' is worthless if this situation is not fixed immediately, and unless you put in place measures to address the issues that continue to unfold on a daily basis. Moreover, as a seafood exporter, it feels as though our own government has thrown us into the cold Atlantic waters without a lifejacket.\nYours sincerely, Victoria Leigh-Pearson, Sales Director, John Ross\nJohn Ross is not the only Scottish seafood exporter suffering. The industry says it has been hit by a \"perfect storm\" of Brexit disruption, which could sink a centuries-old industry.  \n\"These businesses are not transporting toilet rolls or widgets. They are exporting the highest quality, perishable seafood which has a finite window to get to markets in peak condition,\" said Donna Fordyce, chief executive of Seafood Scotland.\n\"If the window closes, these consignments go to landfill.\"\nShe said the sector has already been weakened by Covid-19, the closure of the French border before Christmas as well as \"layer upon layer\" of problems associated with Brexit. \nThe group fears that without exports, the fishing fleet will have little reason to go out. \n\"In a very short time, we could see the destruction of a centuries-old market which contributes significantly to the Scottish economy,\" added Ms Fordyce.\nUK government Minister for Scotland David Duguid blamed Scottish leaders for the issues.\n\"The Scottish Government has persistently refused to accept the democratic vote to leave the EU, but that does not allow them to abdicate their responsibilities to Scottish businesses,\" he said.\n\"Over the past 18 months they have assured the fishing industry that the systems they were putting in place would be adequate. They clearly are not.\"\nParcel delivery service DPD UK said it had paused its European Road Service because of the '\"increased burden\" of customs paperwork for packages heading to the EU, including the Republic of Ireland.\nDPD said 20% of parcels had \"incorrect or incomplete data attached\", which meant they would have to be returned.\nIn an email to its business customers, the company said that it had been a \"challenging few days\" for its international operation, and that it would \"pause and review\" its service.  It plans to restart on 13 January. \n\"It has now become evident that we have an increased burden with the new, more complex processes, and additional customs data we require from you for your parcels destined to Europe\" the firm wrote. \nThe boss of one of Wales' largest hauliers said logistical problems have emerged at the Irish border too. \nAndrew Kinsella, managing director of Gwynedd Shipping, said his company has a backlog of 60 lorries waiting to be shipped to Dublin.\nHe said many hauliers are finding that their customers are not able to generate the special declarations that are needed to ultimately enable a lorry to get onto a ferry.   \n\"Whilst you don't see queues at ports and terminals the reality is that these queues are developing elsewhere in our depot in Holyhead, in our depot in Deeside and in our depot in Newport in South Wales, and lots of hauliers have depots in the proximity of ports,\" he said. \n\"There are a lot of issues about demarcation about who is going to arrange the export declaration with the UK revenue authorities, who's going to arrange the import declaration, the hauliers then trying to arrange the import safety and security declaration to create an ENS number which helps you generate a PBN number so there has been a lot of everyone finding their feet\".\nCorrection 9th April 2021: An earlier version of this article included a photo showing queues of lorries at Dover Port.

      "text": "Film director Michael Apted, best known for the Up series of TV documentaries following the lives of 14 people every seven years, has died aged 79.\nHe also directed Coal Miner's Daughter, Gorillas In The Mist and the 1999 Bond movie The World Is Not Enough.\nThe original 7 Up in 1964 set out to document the life prospects of a range of children from all walks of life.\nThe show was inspired by the Aristotle quote \"give me a child until he is seven and I will show you the man\".\nThe first 7 Up show was followed by 14 Up at the start of the next decade, which interviewed the same children as teenagers - and the pattern was set right up until 63 Up in 2019.\nThroughout all those intervening years ITV viewers became engrossed with the stories of private school trio Andrew, Charles and John, of Jackie who went through two divorces, of Neil who went from jobless and homeless to Liberal Democrat councillor, and of working class chatterbox Tony, whose life ambition was to become a jockey.\nApted's shows - which won three Bafta awards - have often been described as the forerunner of modern-day reality TV series, giving its participants the time to tell their own stories on screen. \nBut unlike their modern counterparts, the original Up children tended to fade away from the limelight in the seven years between each chapter. \nIn 2008, Apted was made a companion of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to the British film and television industries.\nThomas Schlamme, president of the Directors Guild of America, said Apted was a \"fearless visionary\" whose legacy would live on.\nHe said Apted, who was born in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, \"saw the trajectory of things when others didn't and we were all beneficiaries of his wisdom and lifelong dedication\".\nITV's managing director Kevin Lygo said the director's six-decade career was \"in itself truly remarkable\".\nHe said the Up series \"demonstrated the possibilities of television at its finest in its ambition and its capacity to hold up a mirror to society and engage with and entertain people while enriching our perspective on the human condition\".\n\"The influence of Michael's contribution to film and programme-making continues to be felt and he will be sadly missed,\" Lygo added.\nMichael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, producers of the James Bond film franchise, said Apted \"was a director of enormous talent\" and \"beloved by all those who worked with him\".\n\"We loved working with him on The World Is Not Enough and send our love and support to his family, friends and colleagues,\" they said.\nA post on the Twitter account of the band Garbage, who performed the theme for The World Is Not Enough, labelled Apted a \"delightful, charming soul\".\nComposer David G Arnold, who composed the Bond theme and worked with Apted on three other non-Bond movies, said he felt \"lucky\" to work with him.\n\"A more trusting, funny, friendly and, most importantly, kind, person you'd never meet. So pleased to have known him and so sad that he's gone,\" Arnold wrote on Twitter."

The risk here is whether such brands might cannibalise M&S branded products,\" he added.\nEmily Salter, retail analyst at GlobalData, said M&S was \"paying the cost for its inability to adapt fast enough to changing shopping habits\". \n\"M&S's recovery is slow versus other apparel players, as it continues to be hurt by an online platform unable to make up for lost store sales,\" she added.\nShe saw little point in a potential purchase of Jaeger, as it would be \"costly to turn around and do little to boost the retailer's fortunes\". \nHowever, she said M&S's focus on value in food had \"started to pay off, with decent sales growth, especially considering dampened footfall on High Streets\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

We'll have another update for you at 18:00 GMT. \nInternational passengers - including British nationals - will have to provide a negative Covid-19 test result taken within 72 hours of departure before travelling to the UK. The measures are aimed at stopping the spread of \"new strains\" of coronavirus, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says.\nThe time ambulances spent queuing to offload patients at under-pressure hospitals in parts of England is \"off the scale\", the Royal College of Emergency Medicine says. Data leaked to BBC News shows ambulance waiting times at hospitals in the South East rose by 36% in December compared with the same month in 2019, while a paramedic tells us the knock-on effect means people having to wait longer for ambulances to arrive. Read the full investigation.\nSchools and colleges in Wales will stay closed to most pupils until the February half term unless there is a \"significant\" fall in Covid cases. First Minister Mark Drakeford also says current lockdown restrictions will be extended and \"strengthened\", meaning showrooms join non-essential shops, hospitality venues, licensed premises and leisure facilities in having to shut.\nIn a race against a faster-spreading variant of coronavirus, ministers have pinned their hopes of ending a third national lockdown on protecting the most vulnerable groups by spring. So how could the UK's biggest mass-vaccination programme protect tens of millions of people from Covid-19 within months? Our Visual Journalism team reports.\nWith schools closed to the majority of pupils across the UK, disadvantaged pupils once again face a challenge to access online learning.

      "text": "People who have had Covid vaccines are being warned to still take care.\nVaccination has been shown to prevent severe infection, so even if people do catch the virus, they would be protected from getting seriously ill.\nThe call comes as an NHS nurse working for the Hywel Dda University Health Board area said she contracted Covid-19 while waiting for her second dose.\nThe health board said while the vaccine \"reduces your chance of suffering\", \"no vaccine is 100% effective\".\nThe Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, which started being rolled out in the UK last month, offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 after a second dose.\nOn Friday, the First Minister advised people receiving the vaccine to \"continue to act in a precautionary way\".\nMark Drakeford said those people should \"recognise the new protection that they have\" but \"recognise as well that for many weeks, and for some months ahead, coronavirus is going to continue to be a feature of all our lives\".\nThe hospital nurse, who works in the Hywel Dda University Health Board area in west Wales, said she felt \"angry and heartbroken\" about catching Covid at this stage.\nThe nurse, who has asked not to be identified, said she was initially relieved to be offered the chance of a vaccine and despite difficulties getting an appointment, she said she received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine last month.  \n\"It gave me peace of mind. It made me feel safer and that I was doing the right thing for my family... but it gives a false sense of security,\" she said.\nThe nurse said she was told it would take 10 days for the vaccine to offer some protection and reduce the risk of transmission. \nHowever, three weeks after the jab, she said she began to feel unwell - with \"quite severe symptoms\" of a bad cough, high temperature and breathlessness - and said she was \"shocked\" when she tested positive for coronavirus.\nShe said her partner and one of her children also tested positive.\nThe British Medical Association Cymru Wales has previously expressed concern about the length of time between doses.\nDoctors' union, BMA Cymru Wales, said there was a lack of evidence to support waiting 12 weeks for a second vaccine dose.\nChair Dr David Bailey said: \"Our families don't choose to be exposed to a much higher dose of Covid, so we feel it's right that we should be protecting health workers and their families.\"  \nHywel Dda health board said it had already vaccinated more than 10,000 high-risk people, including frontline NHS staff.\nDeputy Chief Executive Dr Philip Kloer, said: \"It is always distressing to hear about staff contracting the virus. Whilst the vaccine reduces your chance of suffering from Covid-19, no vaccine is 100% effective.\n\"There is particular risk that you may have contracted Covid-19 immediately prior to having the vaccine without knowing it, or that you may contract it in the week or two following vaccination as your body builds up protection.\n\"We have communicated the UK policy and assurances on second doses to our staff and assured them they will receive their second dose within 12 weeks of the first.\"\nHe added: \"Working within the NHS at the moment is very challenging and we acknowledge how difficult this is.\n\"Staff have worked tirelessly and made many sacrifices on behalf of caring for our communities and we are extremely grateful. We have put in place additional support and counselling and psychological support services.\""

      "text": "The funeral of EastEnders and Carry On actress Dame Barbara Windsor has taken place in London.\nRoss Kemp, who played her on-screen son in the soap, was among the 30 mourners and gave a reading, as did actor and friend Christopher Biggins.\nDame Barbara died in December at the age of 83, having had dementia.\nThere were floral arrangements spelling Babs, The Dame and Saucy, and a mock pub sign showing her as The Queen Peggy in the style of the soap's Queen Vic.\nDame Barbara played pub landlady Peggy Mitchell in EastEnders for more than two decades.\nScott Mitchell, who was married to Dame Barbara for 20 years, was joined at Golders Green Crematorium by family and friends including comedians Matt Lucas and David Walliams.\n\"As Covid has denied so many of Barbara's family, friends and fans a chance to say farewell properly, I wanted to share the order of service to let people be a small part of it,\" Mr Mitchell told the PA news agency.\n\"My heart goes out to every family who have experienced the same restrictions at their loved ones' funerals.\"\nHe added: \"I would again like to thank my family, friends, the media and the public for their incredible support and well wishes since Barbara's passing.\"\nDame Barbara's coffin was brought into the crematorium to sound of Frank Sinatra's On The Sunny Side Of The Street, and the service featured a recording of Sparrows Can't Sing from the actress's 1963 film of the same.\nIt finished with the famous topless photo of Dame Barbara from the film Carry On Camping, alongside her quote: \"That picture will follow me to the end.\"\nLong-time friend Anna Karen, who played Dame Barbara's on-screen sister Aunt Sal in EastEnders, also paid tribute during the service.\nThe funeral was also attended by Loose Women's Jane Moore and EastEnders actor Jamie Borthwick. However, the numbers were limited due to coronavirus social distancing.\nAlzheimer's Research UK recently said it had seen a spike in donations since Dame Barbara's death, and a JustGiving page set up as a tribute to her and in aid of the charity has raised more than \u00a3150,000 (including Gift Aid).\nMr Mitchell said that was \"beyond anything we may have dreamed of\".\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "COP26,California wildfires,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "New data from EU satellites shows that 2020 is in a statistical dead heat with 2016 as the world's warmest year. \nThe Copernicus Climate Change Service says that last year was around 1.25C above the long-term average. \nThe scientists say that unprecedented levels of heat in the Arctic and Siberia were key factors in driving up the overall temperature. \nThe past 12 months also saw a new record for Europe, around 0.4C warmer than 2019.\nLast December, the World Meteorological Organization predicted that 2020 would be one of the three warmest years on record. \nThis new, more complete report from Copernicus says that last year is right at the top of the list. \nThe Copernicus data comes from a constellation of Sentinel satellites that monitor the Earth from orbit, as well as measurements taken at ground level. \nTemperature data from the system shows that 2020 was 1.25C warmer than the average from 1850-1900, a time often described as the \"pre-industrial\" period.\nOne key factor driving up the temperatures was the heating experienced in the Arctic and Siberia. \nIn some locations there, temperatures for the year as a whole were 6C above the long-term average.\nThis exceptional warming led to a very active wildfire season. Fires in the Arctic Circle released a record amount of CO2, according to the study, up over a third from 2019. \nThe Copernicus service concludes that while 2020 was very marginally cooler than 2016, the two years are statistically on a par as the differences between the figures for the two years are smaller than the typical differences found in other temperature databases for the same period.\nMore data on 2020's temperature will be released in the next week or so from other agencies, including Nasa and the UK Met Office. \nThe scientists say that the closeness between the years is all the more remarkable considering the impacts of the El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a weather cycle. \nTwenty-sixteen was made warmer by a strong El Ni\u00f1o event while 2020 was made slightly cooler by an emerging La Ni\u00f1a in the second half of the year.\nEurope also saw a new record level of warming for the year, 0.4C warmer than 2019. A major heat wave in July and August was an important factor driving up the mercury across the continent. \nGlobally, the 10-year period from 2011-2020 is the warmest decade, with the last six years being the six hottest on record. \n\"Twenty-twenty stands out for its exceptional warmth in the Arctic and a record number of tropical storms in the North Atlantic,\" said Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\"It is no surprise that the last decade was the warmest on record, and is yet another reminder of the urgency of ambitious emissions reductions to prevent adverse climate impacts in the future.\"\nWhile a strong La Ni\u00f1a may cool temperatures a little in 2021, levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are likely to remain high, contributing to ongoing warming. \nNew data from the UK's Met Office suggests that average concentrations of CO2 will reach levels that are 50% higher than they were before the industrial revolution. \nResearchers predict that annual average CO2 concentration at the Mauna Loa recording station in Hawaii will be around 2.29 parts per million (ppm) higher in 2021 than in 2020. \nDespite the global slowdowns caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the scientists say this rise is being driven by emissions from the use of fossil fuels and from deforestation.\nWhile weather patterns linked to the La Ni\u00f1a event may boost growth in tropical forests and increase the amount of the gas that's absorbed, it won't be enough to slow the overall rise. \nThe Met Office says that CO2 will exceed 417ppm in the atmosphere for several weeks from April to June. \nThis is 50% higher than the level of 278ppm that pertained in the late 18th Century as widespread industrial activity was just beginning. \n\"The human-caused build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere is accelerating,\" said Prof Richard Betts from the Met Office.\n\"It took over 200 years for levels to increase by 25%, but now just over 30 years later we are approaching a 50% increase.\"\n\"Reversing this trend and slowing the atmospheric CO2 rise will need global emissions to reduce, and bringing them to a halt will need global emissions to be brought down to net zero. This needs to happen within about the next 30 years if global warming is to be limited to 1.5C.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Universities,Renting,University of Manchester,Liverpool John Moores University,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Growing numbers of students in England have pledged to withhold rent on university accommodation they cannot use during the Covid lockdown.\nOrganisers say this is building up to be a major protest, estimating that about 15,000 students at dozens of universities have signed up so far. \nThey want a rebate on rent when many students are being kept off campus at the start of term.\nBut universities say they only provide 20% of student accommodation. \nUniversities UK says this means \"many decisions on refunds will be made by private landlords and other providers\".\nIn November, University of Manchester offered a 30% rent rebate for the first half of the academic year, worth about \u00a31,000 to each student in halls. \nThe move followed protests over lack of support during the coronavirus pandemic which saw students tear down temporary fencing in one demonstration.\nThe reduction will be applied to direct debit payments this month, with students who have already paid for the whole year getting a refund.\nBut organiser of the Rent Strike Now campaign, Ben McGowan, said the new lockdown means students are still paying for halls they are unable to return to which has prompted a wave of student anger. \nOn Twitter, campaigners listed more than 40 universities where they said students were pledging to withhold rent. \n\"Most of us are being told not to go back so we're paying for accommodation we can't use and there's been no extra support from universities and government,\" added Saranya Thambiranjah, a first year at Bristol University who also helps run the campaign.\n\"Rent striking is a great way to make our voices heard and get universities to listen our concerns.\" \nStudents at universities not yet part of this campaign have said they will organise similar challenges on their own campuses, including Coventry and Keele.  \nAt Nottingham Trent University, student campaigner Rebecca Hyde, who is doing a masters in broadcast journalism, said 244 students had so far pledged to withhold rent on university halls since their campaign was launched a few days ago. \nShe believes universities should do more to help students who are having to pay for rooms they are unable to use through no fault of their own. \nShe says her course leaders have been brilliant but missing out on using studios and running \"news days\" with her fellow students \"is just so disappointing\". \nNottingham Trent University says it understands student concerns over rents and urged the government \"to show leadership to find a solution that is fair to all students\". \n\"At NTU, only a minority of our students are in accommodation operated by or on behalf of the university. \n\"We do not want a repeat of the situation in the summer term of 2020 where most of our students were reliant on the goodwill of private accommodation providers who did not always do the right thing,\" said the university in a statement.\nAt King's College London, campaign secretary \"Juno\" likewise reported hundreds of new pledges to withhold rent in the past few days, saying students felt they had been \"lured\" into their accommodation  at the start of the academic year. \nA King's spokesperson promised that students would not be charged for accommodation they are unable to use during lockdown. \nAbout a quarter of students are in privately-run purpose built accommodation, and one of the biggest of these providers, Unite Students, is also facing demands. \nLiverpool John Moores student Suhail Accad, in Unite accommodation, says his rent strike post on Instagram has gained 3,000 followers and has had 8,000 shares in just a few days. \n\"It's expensive to stay here,\" says Suhail. \nUnite was unable to comment directly on the threat of rent strikes but maintains that it is doing all it can to help keep students and staff safe \"during this challenging period\".\nUniversities UK said universities were looking at the issue \"actively\" and considering what support they can offer students. \n\"Universities recognise the financial pressures the pandemic has placed on students and are providing increased financial and other support as a result.\n\"With government restrictions reducing the numbers of students returning in person to universities, now is the time for the government to seriously consider the financial implications for students and institutions and what support they will provide.\" "

      "text": "Two women have described how they were surrounded by police, read their rights and fined \u00a3200 each after driving five miles to take a walk.\nThe women were also told the hot drinks they had brought along were not allowed as they were \"classed as a picnic\".\nGuidance for the current lockdown says people can travel for exercise as long as it is in their \"local area\".\nThe police force involved, Derbyshire Police, said driving for exercise was \"not in the spirit\" of lockdown.\nOne of the would-be walkers, Jessica Allen, assumed \"someone had been murdered\" when she arrived at Foremark Reservoir on Wednesday afternoon. \n\"As we drove in there was a police van, a police car, and there were loads of police there,\" said Ms Allen, who lives in Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire.\n\"I genuinely thought someone had been murdered; the place is normally so quiet. The next thing, my car is surrounded. I got out of my car thinking 'There's no way they're coming to speak to us'. Straight away they start questioning us.\n\"One of them started reading my rights and I was looking at my friend thinking 'This must be a joke'.\n\"I said we had come in separate cars, even parked two spaces away and even brought our own drinks with us. He said 'You can't do that as it's classed as a picnic'.\"\nHer friend, Eliza Moore, said she was \"stunned at the time\" so did not challenge police and gave her details so they could send a fixed penalty notice.\n\"Just seeing a police officer anyway is quite scary for some people and we were really not expecting to be approached and to be told we were doing something wrong,\" she said.\n\"We don't want to get away with it if we have broken the rule, but it seems a bit unfair that you can be fined on something that's so vague.\" \nGuidance issued by the Cabinet Office states that people can leave their homes for exercise but should not travel outside their \"local area\".\nHowever, the actual legislation does not specify a maximum distance that people are allowed to travel for exercise.\nBoth the guidance and legislation state people can exercise with one other person, as Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore did.\nHuman rights barrister Adam Wagner said: \"There is no law against travelling to exercise. The guidance is not legally binding and the police have no power to enforce it unless it is reflected in the lockdown regulations which in this case it is not.\"\nDerbyshire Police said: \"It is up to each individual officer on a case-by-case basis to decide what is reasonable as the legislation does not proscribe a distance.\"\nThe BBC contacted the Cabinet Office, Home Office, College of Policing and National Police Chiefs' Council to ask for clarification over what they define as \"local area\" in relation to exercise. None could clarify this.\nHowever, the College of Policing said: \"In overall terms police officers across England and Wales will be using their discretion and professional judgement about whether or not someone has a reasonable excuse for travelling for exercise and being outside the place where they are living.\"\nMs Allen said she is taking the pandemic \"very seriously\" as her brother is a doctor working on a Covid ward in London, and her parents have both had coronavirus.\nShe said she drove to the reservoir as she knew it would be less crowded than near her house.\n\"I'm self-employed but my business is closed and I'm trying to fill my time,\" she said.\n\"I suffer from anxiety and when you go by the water you feel so much better. The only thing I've got to look forward to is planning a walk with my friend.\"\nMs Allen said the experience was \"very intimidating\" and had left her feeling scared of police in general.\n\"I was so shook up afterwards,\" she said. \"The fact they read my rights. I thought 'Am I going to prison for going on a walk?'\n\"I'm not a criminal but we were treated as if we were criminals and it really made me feel for those people who are wrongly arrested and questioned by police, because it wasn't a nice situation to be in.\"\nDerbyshire Police said in a statement: \"Driving to a location - where exercise could easily have been taken closer to a person's home - is clearly not in the spirit of the national effort to reduce our travel, reduce the possible spread of the disease and reduce the number of deaths.\n\"Each officer will use their professional judgement on a case-by-case basis, however, people should expect to be challenged and understand the clear reasons why they may be asked about their movements given the critical situation the NHS currently finds itself in.\"\nAndrew Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire, said he regarded the reservoir as a local area.\nHe tweeted: \"I'm concerned that my constituents are facing fines from Derbyshire Police for taking exercise in what I would class as the local area.\n\"It is important that common sense is used when enforcing guidelines, and a fine rather than issuing guidance appears to be rather over zealous.\"\nDerbyshire Police has also been giving fixed penalty notices to people who visit Calke Abbey and Elvaston Castle.\nOne man said his parents were given a fixed penalty notice after driving seven miles to Calke Abbey from their home in Whitwick, Leicestershire.\n\"Upon approaching the park there was a team of police officers so my parents decided to pull in and check that no laws were being broken,\" he said.\n\"Immediately they were hit with a \u00a3200 fine. When my parents said that they weren't aware this was too far and they'd go home immediately, the police officer simply said 'It's too late'.\"\nGuidance from the College of Policing says officers should follow the \"Four Es\" and only give fixed penalty notices as a last resort.\nWhen asked about this, Derbyshire Police said: \"The four Es are still in use, however, where there are cases of blatant breaches of the regulations then fines will be issued by officers.\"\nDuring the first lockdown, the force was criticised for releasing drone footage of people walking in the Peak District.\nSpeaking at the time, Lord Sumption - a former Supreme Court judge - said it was \"disgraceful\" and \"shamed our policing traditions\".\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

We really tried. NHS staff pleaded with people that Christmas is not worth it. Now one in 30 people in London have Covid and ICUs are overwhelmed. My heart is broken.\"\nAn analysis of Public Health England figures show in the week to 3 January, the number of cases rose across all of the London's boroughs compared with the previous week, with 17 individually recording more than 1,000 cases per 100,000 people.\nTesting increased in parts of the city after a drop over the Christmas period but positivity was high among people taking lab-based tests - suggesting more testing is needed to find undiagnosed cases in the community.\nIn the past week, many parts of the capital saw a rise in deaths where a person had tested positive for coronavirus in the previous 28 days - with some areas recording more than double the number of deaths compared with the previous week. \nHowever, reporting over the Christmas period may have affected this.\nOut of the 18 acute hospital trusts in London providing figures to the government, all of them recorded having more beds being filled by coronavirus patients than in the previous week.\nBarts NHS Health, one of London's largest trusts, saw a 30% increase in coronavirus patients between 29 December and 5 January, to 830.\nThe mayor of London's announcement comes after the counties of Sussex and Surrey declared similar major incidents on Thursday.\nHe said the London Ambulance Service was currently taking up to 8,000 emergency calls a day, compared to 5,500 on a typical busy day.\nThe London Fire Brigade said more than 100 firefighters had been drafted in to drive ambulances to help cope with the demand.\nEvery frontline agency involved in protecting the public has a legal duty to prepare for emergencies by devising and testing major incident plans.\nThese public bodies declare a major incident when the situation they're confronting is so big or terrible that it's not only likely to cause serious harm, but it will also compromise their ability to respond effectively. \nIn general terms, that means public bodies can legally stop delivering some everyday services, so that their personnel, attention and resources can be diverted to the emergency confronting them. \nAt other times, the plans will lead to the military sending soldiers to aid the civilian effort, as we have seen already during the pandemic. \nPrevious major incidents include the Grenfell Tower disaster in London, the Salisbury Novichok poisonings and the 2017 terrorism attacks.\nLondon's regional director for Public Health England Kevin Fenton said the current wave of coronavirus was \"the biggest threat\" the capital has faced in this pandemic to date.\nProf Fenton urged Londoners to \"cut contacts\" and \"reduce movements\".\nHe added: \"The emergence of the new variant means we are setting record case rates at almost double the national average, with at least one in 30 people now thought to be carrying the virus.\n\"We know this will sadly lead to large numbers of deaths, so strong and immediate action is needed.\"\nMr Khan is warning that London is \"at crisis point\".\n\"If we do not take immediate action now, our NHS could be overwhelmed and more people will die,\" he said.\n\"Londoners continue to make huge sacrifices and I am today imploring them to please stay at home unless it is absolutely necessary for you to leave. Stay at home to protect yourself, your family, friends and other Londoners and to protect our NHS.\"\nHe said he had written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking for more financial support for Londoners who need to self-isolate and are unable to work, and for daily vaccination data.\nMr Khan also called for the closure of places of worship and for face masks to be worn routinely outside the home, including in crowded places and supermarket queues, in a bid to curb case numbers.\nBBC London political correspondent Karl Mercer\nThe mayor of London was in a sombre mood when I spoke to him earlier this afternoon. One in 20 Londoners in some areas now has Covid, and there is a real fear that hospitals will simply be overwhelmed in the next two weeks. \nDeclaring a major incident is a real indication of the levels of concern felt not just at City Hall but across London's emergency services and the NHS. \nMore Londoners are now in hospital with coronavirus than at the peak of the first wave last April - and those numbers are growing by more than 800 every day.\nIt's believed the last mayor to declare a London-wide major incident was Boris Johnson in response to the 2011 riots. \nThe coming days will be some of the most challenging in the city's recent history.\nKatie Sanderson, a junior doctor working in London, said she is worried how long medical staff can cope with the surge of patients. \n\"[Staff] are working on wards and spending long amounts of time with patients who need high-intensive oxygen therapy,\" she said.\n\"It is technically challenging and the emotional burden is enormous. I see it in a flatness in their demeanour, like we've all got used to doing things which before were totally inconceivable.\"\nGeorgia Gould, chair of London Councils, described London's rising coronavirus rate as \"dangerous\".\nShe added: \"One in 30 Londoners now has Covid. This is why public services across London are urging all Londoners to please stay at home except for absolutely essential shopping and exercise.\n\"This is a dark and difficult time for our city but there is light at end of the tunnel with the vaccine rollout. We are asking Londoners to come together one last time to stop the spread - lives really do depend on it.\"\nEarlier this week as the prime minister introduced an England-wide lockdown, the Met Police said officers were going to be \"more inquisitive\" towards Londoners seen outside.\nThe Met handed out 1,761 fines for breaches of coronavirus laws between 27 March and 20 December.\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said the major incident was a \"stark reminder\" of the point London is at in the pandemic.\nHe said: \"These rule-breakers cannot continue to feign ignorance of the risk that this virus poses or listen to the false information and lies that some promote downplaying the dangers. \n\"Every time the virus spreads it increases the risk of someone needlessly losing their life.\"\nIn response to Mr Khan's announcement the government said the NHS is continuing to \"face a huge challenge\"\nA spokeswoman added: \"It is absolutely paramount people in London, and the rest of the country, follow the rules and stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives.\n\"We are working closely with NHS England to support hospitals in the capital, including additional bed capacity at the London Nightingale. \n\"Financial support is in place for workers who need to self-isolate - including a \u00a3500 payment for those on the lowest incomes who have been contacted by NHS Test and Trace.\"\nFor more London news follow on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel.\nHave any of the issues raised in this article had an impact on you?

      "title": "Q&A: What is the latest Covid advice for children in Wales?",
      "tags": "Schools,Welsh government,Wales education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Schools in Wales are closed until at least 18 January after the Welsh Government reversed an earlier decision to let schools start opening from Wednesday.\nIt came after unions threatened legal action over concerns about the new coronavirus variant.\nWales went into a nationwide stay-at-home level 4 lockdown the weekend before Christmas, with First Minister Mark Drakeford recently warning it was likely to continue until the end of January at least.\nSo what is the latest advice for children in Wales?\nNo. The advice from the Welsh Government is clear. Mixing is not permitted between households (unless in a support bubble) and no indoor or outdoor gatherings are allowed.\nNo children's activities like Scouts or dance classes are permitted to meet.\nHere's the rule on outdoor play from the Welsh Government: \"Children can play outside with members of their own household or support bubble but should not arrange to meet with children from other households. This applies to under-11s as well as to over-11s.\n\"Where children are old enough to understand the rules, they should be encouraged to follow them and to avoid mixing with other children outside their household or support bubble.\"\nThe new variant of Covid is \"hugely more transmissible\" according to an Imperial College study, raising the reproduction (R) number of the virus by between 0.4 and 0.7.\nThe Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) said in a report on 23 December the role of children in transmitting the variant was being investigated.\nEarly results from the Imperial study had indicated that the virus was spreading more quickly among under-20s, particularly among secondary school age children.\nBut the very latest data indicates that it was spreading quickly across all age groups, according to Prof Axel Gandy who was a member of the research team.\n\"One possible explanation is that the early data was collected during the time of the November lockdown [in England] where schools were open and the activities of the adult population were more restricted. We are seeing now that the new virus has increased infectiousness across all age groups,\" he said.\nSo while children might transmit the virus more easily than the previous version of the virus, so will everyone else.\nBut the evidence is that there is limited spread of the virus in primary age children, with teenagers more likely to transmit it, although not any more so than adults.\nMeanwhile, the most recent analysis by Public Health Wales has found 71.6 % of schools have had a Covid-19 case.\nOf 3,157 school cases reported in the three weeks before Christmas, 832 were in schools in Cwm Taf Morgannwg and 702 were in Aneurin Bevan health board area.\nThe Welsh Government advice that children under the age of 11 do not have to socially distance is still in force.\nHowever, as level 4 restrictions are in now in place, they clearly state that no-one, including children, should be meeting up either indoor or outdoors with other people, as stated above. Schools are currently closed and therefore class or year group bubbles, where social distancing does not apply, are not meeting. These bubbles are not allowed to meet outside of school.\nIn effect this means children should be socially distancing from anyone not in their household or support bubble.\nChildcare settings such as (non-school) nurseries, creches and child minders remain open.\nPeople are still allowed to use relatives or friends for childcare but only \"when no other options are available\".\nThe Welsh Government advice adds: \"Children should not be cared for outside of their home if they are ill, or by anyone who is ill.\n\"Adults dropping off children for childcare should not enter someone else's home.\"\nAs stated above, the rules allow relatives to provide childcare but only as a last resort. Otherwise households are not allowed to mix, indoors or outdoors, unless you are in a support bubble with them.\nThe two scenarios for support bubbles with a grandparent would be if a grandparent lives alone, or if a single-parent household needed support from grandparents.\nFamilies would have to make up their own minds in those scenarios whether the children could pose a risk to their grandparents' health and make decisions accordingly."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "With the country in lockdown and a new faster-spreading variant of coronavirus rampant, it's clear the UK is in a race to vaccinate. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson wants all the over-70s, the most clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers to be offered a jab by mid-February, to allow the restrictions to be eased. \nThat requires about 13 million people to be given the opportunity to be vaccinated - but so far only one million have been.\nAnd ensuring a quick rollout to the rest is fraught with difficulties. \nThere is enough vaccine in the country, BBC News has learned, but getting it into people's arms could be hampered by:\nTwo Covid vaccines have now been approved - one produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and another made by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.\nThe UK government has ordered 140 million doses - enough for the whole population. \nThe first hurdle is manufacture of the vaccine. \nThis involves two crucial stages - the production of the substance and then a process called fill and finish whereby the vaccine is put into vials and packaged up for use.\nAnd there is already a concern about the latter stage, with the availability of key ingredients and equipment including glass vials a key issue. \nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam says fill and finish was a \"critically short resource across the globe\".\nThat is part of the reason why the amount of the two vaccines ready to go is more limited than ministers had hoped. \nUK plants have made somewhere around 15 million or so doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - that in itself is less than ministers said would be made at this stage (early in the pandemic they said there would be 30 million by the autumn).\nBut only four million have been through the fill-and-finish process. \nThe UK has used plants in Germany and the Netherlands to do some of this for the early batches.\nBut the government has also invested in a plant in Wrexham to ensure there is domestic capacity.\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, meanwhile, is made outside of the UK - it comes from a plant in Belgium. \nWhen it arrives in the UK, it has already been placed into vials.\nBut so far, fewer than five million doses have been delivered - less than half the number that should have been - because of problems with manufacture, including the fill-and-finish process.\nHowever, the Department of Health and Social Care said it had been monitoring the supply chain for \"some time\" and was confident the arrangements in place for the supply and onward deployment of vaccines were sufficient.\nEven once a vaccine is in the vials though, there is still one more step before the NHS can start using it. \nEach batch has to be checked and certified by the Medicines and Healthcare Products regulatory Agency.\nAnd it can be several weeks before the vaccine can be given to the NHS to put in people's arms.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has called this a \"rate-limiting factor\".\nAbout four million doses of the Oxford vaccine have been available for some weeks - they were put into vials last year - but as yet only just over 500,000 have been certified as safe to use.\nSources close to the NHS vaccination programme said this had been one of the key frustrations - saying it was taking up to 20 days for batches to be tested and released.\nThe MHRA said each batch had to be biologically tested for quality, while the manufacturer's documentation describing its production and quality-control testing process was reviewed.\nThose close to the process say it does take a couple of weeks - and with more vaccine being produced, there is increased demand on the labs that do the work.\n\"You have to remember this is being injected into people,\" they said. \"We cannot rush this.\"\nBoth vaccines have to go through this process.\nOnce batches have been certified, they are ready to be distributed to the NHS vaccination centres.\nEventually, there will be a network of more than 1,000 local centres across the UK.\nCurrently, just over 700 are up and running. \nThese are being run from a wide variety of venues, from hospitals and large GP centres to community venues, racecourses and, perhaps in the future, conference centres and sports stadiums.\nThe instability of the Pfizer-BioNTech has been well documented. \nIt has to be kept in ultra-cold storage and, once thawed, used within five days.\nThis has meant it is stored at major hospitals and gives the local vaccination centres just days to use up batches after they are delivered.\nThe Oxford vaccine, meanwhile, can be stored at fridge temperature, which makes it easier to distribute.\nBut even once they are at these vaccination centres, delivery of both vaccines is dependent on having the right numbers of staff available.\nCurrently, GPs, nurses, healthcare assistants and pharmacists are giving the vaccines. \nBut as the vaccination campaign ramps up, these will need to be supplemented by additional vaccinators.\nProvision has been made to train other health professionals, from physiotherapists and dentists to dieticians.\nBut there are reports an \"overload of bureaucracy\" - including mandatory courses in fire safety and preventing radicalisation - is slowing down this training.\nMinisters have said they will try to reduce the bureaucracy - amid warnings by the National Audit Office an army of nearly 50,000 vaccinators will be needed.\nAlthough at the moment, there are thought to be enough staff to cope with the limited amount of vaccines available.\nBritish Medical Association GP leader Dr Richard Vautrey said: \"We will need support eventually but not now. \n\"At the moment, the biggest issue is the NHS having enough supply of the vaccine to give.\"\nNearly a million doses have been given since people started to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, in early December, which puts the UK third globally in the most vaccinations done per head.\nAnd with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine being used from this week, the NHS is hoping to double that number in the next seven days.\nGovernment sources said there would be disappointment if it did not reach two million doses a week by late January.\nThat - and a little bit more - will be needed to hit the mid-February target.\nBut even then, and assuming most people in these priority groups have come forward, the impact would not be immediate. \nIt takes a few weeks for the immune response to kick in.\nSo it would be early March before the full impact of the vaccination of these priority groups is felt.\nThen, however, it could have a significant effect.\nClose to nine in 10 Covid deaths have been in these priority groups.\nThey will have had only one dose, which, for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, is effective at preventing 70% of infections.\nBut the evidence suggests this will be enough to stop serious illness.\nSo if all goes to plan, the pathway to significantly easing restrictions comes into view.\nBut the complex nature of the supply chain coupled with the complexity of delivering vaccines to large numbers of people means it will take just one thing to go wrong to cause serious problems getting the UK out of this lockdown in the timeframe hoped."

      "tags": "US Capitol stormed,United States Capitol,Donald Trump,United States",
      "text": "US President Donald Trump has less than two weeks left in office, but the Senate's top Democrat has called for his presidential powers to be removed immediately after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday.\n\"What happened at the US Capitol yesterday was an insurrection against the United States, incited by the president. This president should not hold office one day longer,\" Senator Chuck Schumer said in a statement.\nHe added that Mike Pence should invoke the 25th Amendment, which allows for a transfer of power from the president to the vice-president, either temporarily or permanently.\n\"If the vice-president and the cabinet refuse to stand up, Congress should reconvene to impeach the president,\" he said.\nDemocrats of the House Judiciary Committee have also written a letter to Vice-President Pence urging him to act to remove Donald Trump from office, saying he had stoked an act of insurrection and \"sought to undermine our democracy\". \nThe 25th Amendment allows the vice-president to become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness.\nThe part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties.\nThey would need to sign a letter to the speaker of the House of Representatives and the presiding officer of the Senate declaring the president is unfit to govern or incapable \"of discharging the powers and duties of his office\".  At this point, Vice-President Mike Pence would automatically take over. \nThe president is given the chance to offer a written response, and if he contests the finding, then it falls on Congress to decide. Any vote in the Senate and House of Representatives ordering the president's removal requires a two-thirds majority.\nUntil the issue is resolved, the vice-president would act as president. \nDiscussions about invoking the 25th Amendment also arose after President Trump's Covid-19 diagnosis in October last year, amid concern he may be too sick to run the country. \nAround the same time, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced legislation based on the 25th Amendment that created a commission to review a president's fitness for office. \nThe 25th Amendment was ratified in 1967, four years after the assassination of John F Kennedy, and was intended to address questions of presidential succession if a president becomes incapacitated.\nAnd for this reason, a number of presidents have used the amendment - specifically section three - which allows them to temporarily hand over power to their vice-presidents.  \nIn 2002 and 2007, President George W Bush placed his vice-president in charge when he was sedated during routine colonoscopies. President Ronald Reagan did the same in 1985 when he was in hospital for cancer surgery. \nBut to date, no sitting president has ever been permanently removed using the 25th Amendment. \nThere have been calls for President Trump to be impeached for a second time. \nMinnesota Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar announced she was drawing up articles of impeachment against him, with a growing number of fellow Democrats voicing their support. \nDonald Trump has already been impeached once - by the Democrat-led House in December 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. \nHe faced two charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress - but was later acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. \nHe is only the third US president in history to have been impeached. \nTo impeach means to bring charges in Congress that will form the basis for a trial. \nThe US constitution states a president \"shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanours\".\nIt is a political process, rather than a criminal one.\nIt happens in two stages - articles are brought to the House of Representatives where, if passed, they proceed to the Senate for a trial. \nBut here, a two-thirds vote is necessary for a president's removal - and this milestone has never been reached in US history. \nIf President Trump were replaced through the impeachment process, Vice-President Mike Pence would move into the Oval Office. \nNo president has ever been impeached twice during his time in office. \nQuestions remain as to whether there would be enough time to impeach Donald Trump before his term ends on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated.

      "text": "Schools and colleges in Wales will stay closed to most pupils until the February half term unless there is a \"significant\" fall in Covid cases.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford also confirmed current lockdown restrictions would be extended and \"strengthened\".\nThis means non-essential retail, hospitality venues, licensed premises and leisure facilities remain closed and showrooms must now shut as well.\nMr Drakeford said: \"The pandemic has reached a significant point.\"\nHe told BBC Radio Wales the announcement was the \"best certainty\" he could offer parents, pupils and teachers, \"in a world which is highly uncertain and where things change almost every single day\".\nThe phased return to face-to-face learning at some Welsh universities has also been postponed, while internal GCSE, A-level and AS-level assessments have been cancelled.\nThe announcement follows a similar move in England, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already said schools would not open before half term.\nSpring half term in Wales is scheduled to take place the week beginning Monday 15 February. \nWales has been in an alert level four lockdown since 20 December in an attempt to reduce the transmission of coronavirus.\nOn Thursday, 63 further deaths from coronavirus were reported by Public Health Wales.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Wales, Mr Drakeford said the new variant was more easily spread and stricter lockdown measures were now needed to keep people safe.\nMinisters are in talks with employers and unions and changes are set to be announced for workplaces - to protect workers - early next week.\nMr Drakeford said he wanted to see the way supermarkets were policed return to the way they were during the first lockdown, with strict number limits in stores and social distancing measures abided to.\nBut he said a curfew, meaning people would have to be in their homes by a certain time, similar to that seen in Northern Ireland, was not currently being considered. \nSchools and colleges had already been told they would have to teach online until 18 January at the earliest, however this will now continue if cases of the virus do not fall \"materially\" before the next review date on 29 January.\nIf cases do not drop, that would mean schools would reopen on 22 February at the earliest, and internal exams have also been cancelled.\nBut teaching unions have warned that more uniformed lateral flow testing needs to be in place and teachers must be vaccinated before talks on how to reopen schools can begin.\nSpeaking at the Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said people working at special schools and school and college staff who were at risk would soon be vaccinated. \nCardiff University has also confirmed that a phased return to in-person teaching has been cancelled, with learning continuing online for most students until 22 February.\nStudents currently have to have had two lateral flow tests confirming they are negative for Covid-19 before they return to Welsh campuses - and face to face teaching is only resuming for medical students and those who have practical parts of their courses on campus.\nMr Drakeford said: \"Universities have worked hard to make sure that when students do return it is done in a careful and controlled way, with the safety of those young people and their communities at the forefront of their planning.\"\nThe announcement affecting showrooms means any retailers which allow people to browse and then order for a future date - such as kitchens, bathrooms, furniture and car sales - must close.\nClick and collect will still be allowed.\nConfirming alert level four restrictions would continue for at least three more weeks, Mr Drakeford told Radio Wales the lockdown measures were already leading to cases falling, but the rate remained high.\n\"There are some positive signs that the huge collective effort we are making is making a difference, but the numbers are stubbornly high,\" he said.\n\"We have not yet seen an impact of those falls feeding into the number of people being admitted to hospital and becoming, sometimes, so ill they need intensive care.\n\"We need to see the numbers come down as well so that our NHS is genuinely able to cope with the enormous pressure it is currently facing.\"\nMr Drakeford said huge efforts were being made to rollout the Covid-19 vaccines, and with the \"end being in sight\" it was more important than ever for people to follow the rules and stay home.\n\"We have made so many sacrifices together and we mustn't stop now,\" he said.\nEducation Minister Kirsty Williams said: \"Schools and colleges have been safe and secure environments throughout the pandemic and that continues to be the case.\n\"However, the latest TAC report is clear on education's contribution. We know that school and college settings can contribute to wider social mixing outside the education environment and, right now, we all have to play our part in supressing this virus.\"\nMs Williams said the government would use the period until the next review date to \"look at all the possibilities for a phased and safe return of some pupils, such as those studying for qualifications, or the youngest children who find distance learning the most difficult\".\nFollowing the announcement, exams regulator Qualifications Wales cancelled the spring \"internal assessment window\" for GCSE, AS and A-level pupils, which was scheduled for 22 February - 23 April.\nThis was introduced following the decision that exams would be cancelled in 2021.\nChief executive Philip Blaker said: \"We know that learners need clarity about how they will be assessed and there will be clarity on revised arrangements soon.\"\nMr Drakeford said discussions were under way between teachers and education officials over ways children could catch up after missing time in school. \nSpeaking at Friday's Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said police and local authorities would continue to crack down on people who break lockdown rules. \nSince the start of the pandemic, 3,585 fines have been handed out by police forces in Wales. \n\"Of course I want to thank everyone for following the rules and helping to keep Wales safe. It's always frustrating when a small minority act as though those rules do not apply to them,\" he added.\n\"I want everybody to know that where people knowingly and persistently break the rules, action will be taken. Too many lives have been lost to this awful virus to allow anybody to believe that they do not share in the responsibility that binds us all.\"\nUnions welcomed the news saying the health and safety of pupils and staff \"had to be a priority\", but said teachers must now be given the vaccine as a priority, and pupils and staff must be protected before talks about reopening schools began.\nCurrently teachers are not on the priority list for immunisation, and have to wait to get the jab dependent on their age and if they have a medical condition.\nLaura Doel, director of The National Association of Headteachers Cymru, said a \"properly organised\" testing regime needed to be put in place for schools, and special schools and pupil referral units needed support to remain open.\n\"Any plan that sees school staff return to face-to-face learning should be afforded as much protection as possible against the virus,\" she said.\"Once these issues have been addressed, then we can discuss the orderly return to school we all want.\"\nMeanwhile, Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru said: \"I think we would be happier if we had clarity about what that date looks like, it would give confidence in the system.\"\nOpposition parties called for clear plans on how schools would return and for support to make sure pupils from poorer backgrounds did not fall behind due to a \"digital divide\".\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said: \"The Welsh Government must plan now for the gradual and safe reopening of schools, putting in place safety measures, and should lay out plans for a vaccination programme for schools staff.\"\nWelsh Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies called for the Welsh Government to publish evidence on its reasons for closing schools, bring forward vaccines for teachers, and that money must be made available for all pupils to access laptops for online learning.\n\"This is another bleak day for education in Wales,\" she said.\n\"Decisions aren't easy to make and I urge everyone involved in the journeys to and from school to consider how they might help schools open again and stay open.\"\nShe tweeted: \"Get a grip on consistent online quality. Give my vaccination to a younger teacher.\""

      "text": "Marion Ramsey, best known for her acting in the American film series Police Academy, has died at the age of 73, her agent has announced.\nHer management at Roger Paul Inc told the BBC she died at her Los Angeles home on Thursday morning.\nThe agency said Ramsey had recently fallen ill, but did not give a cause of death.\nRamsey was adored by fans for her portrayal of the squeaky-voiced Officer Laverne Hooks in Police Academy.\nShe also had an illustrious career on Broadway, starring in the 1978 production Eubie!, a biographical musical about celebrated jazz pianist Eubie Blake.\n\"Her passion for performing and sharing her heart with the world was immense,\" Roger Paul Inc said in a statement.\n\"Marion carried with her a kindness and permeating light that instantly filled a room upon her arrival. \n\"The dimming of her light is already felt by those who knew her well. We will miss her, and always love her.\"\nBorn in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1947, Ramsey started her career in the theatre, appearing in both the original Broadway and subsequent touring productions of Hello, Dolly!.\nShe was prolific on Broadway, co-starring in many shows, including Harold Prince's Grind with Ben Vereen, and Eubie! with Gregory and Maurice Hines.\nHer agent said Ramsey was \"particularly proud\" about Broadway's Dreamgirls finally becoming a major motion picture in 2006, because she was one of the singers that the original Broadway show's producer, Tom Eyen, based the three main characters on.\nRamsey's career in TV and film career took off after she appeared as a guest on the hit sitcom The Jeffersons in 1976.\nFollowing that, she was a regular on Cos, Bill Cosby's sketch show. \nShe starred in six Police Academy films in total, making her a familiar face to fans of the franchise.\nAmerican actor Michael Winslow wrote in a tweet that he had \"no words to say or explain the pain\" of losing Ramsey.\n\"In the 80s the Police Academy films cast a long shadow over the comedy genre - they were everywhere & everyone watched them,\" British producer Jonathan Sothcott wrote. \"#MarionRamsey was hilarious as Hooks - a fine comedic actress.\"\nA message on the Twitter account for the movie When I Sing read: \"It is with great sadness that I share our loss of my friend, and one of the shining stars of When I Sing (her final role), the beautiful, kind, hilarious, #MarionRamsey.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland's hospitals have more Covid patients than ever before - with the number of deaths also \"distressingly high\", the first minister has said.\nThe latest figures showed that the deaths of 93 people who had tested positive for the virus have been recorded in the past 24 hours. \nBut the figure includes some people who died over Christmas and New Year.\nThere were also 1,530 people in hospital with the virus, higher than the peak of 1,520 last April. \nOf these, 102 patients were in intensive care - with Ms Sturgeon saying the statistics showed the \"severity of the pressure\" that hospitals are facing. \nThe 93 deaths recorded on Friday is the highest daily figure since the outbreak began - with the previous high being 84 on 15 April.\nBut Ms Sturgeon said the figure will \"undoubtedly include some people who died over the Christmas and New Year period and the delay in registration because of the bank holidays means that their deaths are only being reported today.\"\nShe added: \"To be clear, that is not more than 90 people who died yesterday. It will be people who have died over a period of time. \n\"That does not change the fact they are all individuals who have died and have died of Covid.\"\nA further 2,309 people have tested positive for Covid-19, which was 8.1% of the tests carried out on Thursday and takes the total number of cases in Scotland to 146,024. \nThe figures mean that the total number of people in Scotland who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus now stands at 4,872.\nThe Scottish government has said it is concerned that too many people have not been following the \"stay at home\" rules that are in place across the whole of the mainland and some islands. \nIt believes that more people are using the country's road and public transport networks than during the lockdown last spring.\nAnd it has warned that tougher restrictions could be needed to increase compliance with the travel restrictions.\nMs Sturgeon told her daily briefing that the areas being looked at included non-essential click and collect shopping, further restrictions on takeaway food, non-essential construction and whether more people should be working from home. \nThe first minister also confirmed that universities and colleges will not resume in-person teaching until at least the end of February.\nThis means that students should stay at home rather than travelling back to their campus or accommodation. \nThere will be exceptions for cases where remote study is not possible - for example for a student nurse or a doctor on a practical placement.\nAnd Ms Sturgeon said any students who have remained on campus will be \"fully supported\" by their institution. \nAll of mainland Scotland was placed into level four restrictions from 26 December before additional measures, including closing schools to most pupils until at least the end of the month, was introduced on Tuesday.\nScotland's interim chief medical officer, Dr Dave Caesar, insisted on Friday morning that coronavirus case numbers in January \"could have been worse\".\nHe said the restrictions that were introduced on Boxing Day had helped to \"blunt the spike\" but warned that the country was \"not out of the woods yet\". \nDr Caesar told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"Our case numbers are high, but they're not as high as they could have been if we hadn't taken the measures that we undertook from Boxing Day.\n\"Our health system is under serious pressure but is coping.\n\"I hate to say it, but it could have been worse by this time in January. We're not out of the woods yet by any stretch of the imagination, but I suppose we're holding our own in very significantly challenging circumstances.\"\nNew plans to make international passengers test negative for Covid-19 before travelling to Scotland and England have also been unveiled, with Ms Sturgeon saying she hoped the scheme could start by the end of next week. \nIt will mean people arriving by plane, train or boat - including UK nationals - will have to take a test up to 72 hours before leaving the country they are travelling from.\nProf Linda Bauld of Edinburgh University said the move was long overdue as the UK had \"really struggled from the beginning\" with limiting the impact of international travel on the pandemic. \nBut she said the country should also consider introducing supervised quarantine for people arriving from overseas.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,State schools",
      "text": "Heads are calling for limits to the number of pupils in school during lockdown in England, with attendance rates surging to 50% in some places.\nThe two head teachers' unions, NAHT and ASCL, say the high numbers attending could hamper the fight against the virus.\nThe Department for Education has widened the categories of vulnerable and key worker pupils who can attend.\nIt is insisting that schools ensure all children who qualify can attend.\nThe widened categories not only include vulnerable pupils and children of workers in critical occupations but also those who cannot access remote learning either because they do not have devices or space to study. \nChildren of parents working on the Brexit arrangements are also included.\nTeachers have described streets around schools being packed with parents dropping off their children and almost all staff having to come in and work despite the lockdown.\nHeads say they fear schools could be overwhelmed by children who do not have access to lap tops to learn remotely.\nJessica Jane, a learning assistant at a school in Hampshire, told the BBC: \"I work in a primary school where we are having to bring in every single member of staff as the list of key-workers is vast in our area and over 50% of our children are attending.\n\"Our community school is not closed and streets are packed with parents morning and afternoon collecting their children from open schools.\"\nShe added: \"My colleagues and I are still being put at risk every single day as are our families.\"\nA teacher from the Midlands who did not wish to be named said the number had risen from 10 pupils a day in the first lockdown to about 90 a day this week. \n\"We're talking just under to just over a third of the usual amount of pupils for our school here.  \n\"The vast majority are key worker children, not vulnerable. \n\"I also know that other primary schools in our area have similar amounts of children in school - one neighbouring school in particular, which is only slightly larger than us, is estimating/averaging 100 to 160 children in school every day.\"\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, called the lack of limits \"bizarre... in a week when the prime minister has told the nation that it is necessary to move schools to remote education in order to suppress coronavirus transmission\".\n\"We are hearing reports that attendance in some primary schools is in excess of 50% because of demand from critical workers and families with children classed as vulnerable under criteria which has been significantly widened,\" he said.\n\"We are urgently seeking clarification about the maximum number who should be in school while protecting public health.\n\"This seems completely illogical given the fact that the government has taken the drastic action of a full national lockdown precisely in order to limit contacts.\"\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of National Association of Head Teachers, said schools could not \"meet the demand created by government and reduce social mixing in the way the prime minister announced\".\n\"The government acknowledges that schools do play a role in the transmission of the virus. Therefore, there comes a point when occupancy levels might be so high that they work against the efforts to bring down infection rates in communities, as is the national aim. \n\"This could result in prolonging the amount of time pupils are away from the classroom, which we are all anxious to avoid.\"\nA Department for Education spokesman said: \"Schools are open for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers. We expect schools to work with families to ensure all critical worker children are given access to a place if this is required. \n\"If critical workers can work from home and look after their children at the same time then they should do so, but otherwise this provision is in place to enable them to provide vital services.\n\"The protective measures that schools have been following throughout the autumn term remain in place to help protect staff and students, while the national lockdown helps reduce transmission in the wider community.\"\nBut Emma Knights, chief executive of the National Governance Association, reflected head teachers' concerns, saying between 40 and 60% of pupils were attending schools across England.\n\"The real problem is we have got two different national narratives going on,\" she said - with the prime minister saying \"stay at home\" but the DfE telling schools to take all eligible children who turn up.\nDr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the government seemed unable to decide whether schools were safe or unsafe.\nCommenting on the latest Coronavirus Infection Survey from the Office for National Statistics, Dr Bousted, said: \"Let this data end their confusion. Schools are clearly driving infection amongst children, and then onto the wider community. \n\"This peaked on Christmas Day with one in every 27 secondary-age children and one in 40 primary-age children infected. \n\"In London this rises to one in 18 secondary pupils and one in 23 primary pupils. These figures are truly shocking and entirely the result of government negligence.\""

He was given oxygen when they arrived - but that was eight hours after the ambulance was called.\nIncidents such as these are \"dangerous\" and the service is \"on its knees\", the paramedic added.\nThe figures also show that at one point on Monday this week more than 700 patients were left waiting for an ambulance to arrive in London when none was available. \nDifferent statistics obtained by BBC News highlight the number of hours spent waiting to offload patients at hospitals half an hour after ambulances arrived at hospitals in the South East.  \nSouth East Coast Ambulance service lost 7,803 hours queuing outside hospitals, an increase on 5,732 hours in 2019.\nKent saw the greatest rise in this period. One of its hospitals, Medway Maritime Hospital, saw a doubling in ambulance waiting times.\nThese figures are \"off the scale\", according to Royal College of Emergency Medicine Vice President Adrian Boyle.\n\"It is not because more ambulances are being called, it's because the amount of time they're spending outside a hospital has increased,\" he said.\nDr Boyle says ambulances left queuing outside hospitals meant crews were not available to respond to other emergencies.\nHe says services are facing a \"crisis\" unlike any other he has seen.\n\"People may feel they have a winter crisis every year but this is a different order of magnitude\", he added. \n\"This is the worst winter crisis I've been through in my 25 years of practising as a doctor.\"\nAmbulance services say they are are doing everything they can to meet the demand.\nA London Ambulance Service Trust spokesperson said: \"We are continuing to prioritise the most seriously ill and injured patients, and our team of trained clinicians in our control rooms are working hard to monitor and maintain contact with many other patients as needed while they are waiting for ambulance crews to arrive.\"\nA South East Coast Ambulance Service Trust spokesperson said: \"We are doing everything we can to increase the number of staff available to meet this demand, including increasing overtime, to ensure crews are as available as possible to respond to patients in the community.\"\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

      "text": "The Stormont minister whose officials are responsible for the new Irish Sea border has said some food will be unavailable if changes are not made. \nDUP Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots has also said jobs could be at risk.\nHe said problems at the ports were being caused by new rules applied on imports of food and other products from Britain to Northern Ireland.\nEarlier Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said trade from GB to NI \"will get worse before it gets better\".\nMr Gove said that \"work is ongoing\" and it is \"all part of the process of leaving the European Union\".\nHe added that he had spoken to ministers from all parties in the Northern Ireland Executive. \nAfter speaking with hauliers, supermarkets and processors this week, Mr Poots predicted the loss of jobs and rising costs.\n\"A wide range of frozen and chilled foods will be unavailable after the temporary exemption period ends,\" he tweeted.\nThat exemption period applies to supermarkets and other food importers and runs out in April.\nAfter that they will have to comply with all the paperwork required to ship food in, or find suppliers on the island of Ireland or elsewhere in the EU.\nNew rules - called the Northern Ireland Protocol - were introduced because while the UK has left the EU, Northern Ireland has remained in the Single Market for goods and is continuing to apply EU customs rules.\nThe arrangement was agreed between the UK and the EU to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\nMr Poots said he had spoken to senior UK government figures to ask them to consider unilaterally revoking the protocol as it was \"damaging Northern Ireland at the economic and societal level\".\nAnd he hit out at members of Sinn Fein, the SDLP, and Alliance Party who he claimed had supported it.\nMembers of those parties have countered similar claims from other DUP politicians in recent days.\nThey said DUP MPs had voted against alternative arrangements that would have been simpler to manage before the government pushed ahead with the protocol plan.\nResponding to Mr Poot's tweet on Friday evening, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood wrote: \"You broke it, you own it.\" \nSinn F\u00e9in MLA Martina Anderson accused Mr Poots of being \"asleep at the wheel\".\nThe Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) has called for the assembly to be recalled to discuss difficulties over trading between Great Britain and Northern Ireland due to Brexit.\nThe party has submitted a recall petition.\nUUP MLA Roy Beggs said: \"The impact of the Irish Sea border is causing horrendous difficulties for hauliers and this is being seen in shops and businesses across Northern Ireland.\n\"It is damaging the Northern Ireland economy and the situation is escalating.\"\nEarlier on Friday, Michael Gove said it had been expected that there would be \"some initial disruption\" to trade between GB and NI, but that the government is \"ironing\" issues out.\nHe said discussions with the executive in Northern Ireland were \"in order to make sure that the [Northern Ireland] protocol works\". \n\"[To make sure] that businesses in Northern Ireland can continue to have access to the rest of the UK market, and that Northern Ireland businesses can have the goods that they need on the shelves, that they have access to at the moment,\" he said. \nNorthern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left.\nThis means food products from Great Britain are subject to checks when they enter Northern Ireland.\nSimilar processes and checks also apply when moving food products from Great Britain into the Republic of Ireland.\nMeanwhile, an organisation representing haulage firms has called on the UK and Irish government to relax some of the new Irish Sea trade border rules.\nThe Road Haulage Association (RHA) said there is serious disruption to freight movements into the island of Ireland.\nThe RHA said relaxing the controls on food products and customs declarations \"would help traders to ship goods that have struggled to move over recent days.\"\n\"The problems have led to gaps in supermarket shelves and lorries delayed at ports because of problems with red-tape and the situation is worsening,\" the organisation added.\n\"We are facing an inflexible, cumbersome and time consuming process just to move goods.\"\nThe UK government said the flow of goods \"between GB and NI has been smooth overall and arrivals of freight have continued to increase substantially over this week\".\n\"There are no significant queues at NI ports and supermarkets are reporting healthy supplies into their Northern Ireland stores,\" a spokesperson added.\n\"We recognise the need to provide as much support to the haulage sector as possible as industry adapts to new processes. That's why hauliers can benefit from the Trader Support Service, which provides free advice and support to businesses of all sizes moving goods under the Northern Ireland Protocol. \n\"We have been engaging intensively with the Irish authorities and hauliers on the issues that have been encountered for goods transiting through Dublin port.\"\nOn Thursday customs authorities in the Republic of Ireland announced a temporary relaxation of one customs process.\nHauliers will be able to use an override code to complete a piece of administration known as ENS.\nThe letters ENS refer to an entry summary declaration, an online form which goods carriers are now legally obliged to submit to Irish customs when transporting goods from Great Britain into Ireland.\nOn Thursday night the Irish Revenue Commissioners said it recognised that \"some businesses are experiencing difficulties on lodging their safety and security ENS declarations\".\nIt said that in response it was providing a \"temporary easement\" which would allow an ENS to be produced without all the normally required information.\nAn Irish government spokesperson said it is \"absolutely essential that Ireland fulfils its obligations as a member of the EU and that we protect the integrity of the single market and the customs union\".\n\"We appreciate that the new requirements and customs formalities present significant challenges and impose additional burdens on businesses.\"\nMeanwhile Stena, the ferry company, said it was cancelling a dozen sailings between Wales and Ireland next week due to \"a decline in freight volumes during the first week of Brexit.\""

      "text": "A nurse felt \"overwhelming fear\" as 13 ambulances queued at her hospital's A&E department - in the Welsh region currently hardest hit by Covid deaths.\nTo date Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board, which runs Royal Glamorgan Hospital, has reported 1,091 deaths of patients with coronavirus.\nBBC Wales was granted access to A&E at the hospital in Rhondda Cynon Taf.\nSenior doctor Amanda Farrow said the whole hospital had faced \"unrelenting\" pressure last Saturday.\nSenior A&E nurse Sarah Fogarasy, who was on shift as the ambulances arrived, said there was no capacity at the unit - a situation that left her wanting \"to leave\".\n\"We had to escalate it to our site manager and deputy head of nursing who were liaising with the executive team on call,\" she said.\n\"And then it got to 13 patients outside - I had no capacity in this unit, no resuscitation capacity, no capacity to put a patient on CPAP [continuous positive airway pressure] should they require that and no physical areas to put a patient in. \n\"It was overwhelming.\"\nShe said she found it hard to keep going.\n\"This bit makes me quite emotional\u2026 for the first time I was sat trying to coordinate this department and I had that overwhelming fear that I just wanted to leave,\" Ms Fogarasy continued. \n\"I was just - 'I'm done. I'm done with this'... and it's scary, it fills you full of fear when you have got 13 ambulances outside, queuing around the carpark. Where do you go from that?\"\nShe said it was the team that kept her going: \"I started looking around to all the staff working tirelessly and just trying to remember what we're here for and why I became a nurse. \n\"I know it sounds soppy but it's literally the humanitarian effort that has gone into [fighting] this pandemic that has kept people going.\n\"It's the sheer determination and guts of the staff working in these times that is so powerful, that keeps the shift going.\"\nDr Farrow, emergency medicine consultant, said staffing and bed numbers were of particular concern.\n\"In the emergency department the challenge we have is with regards to flow, so that is our daily challenge,\" she explained. \n\"And we say it's like playing a game of Tetris trying to work out which patient you can put where.\"\nShe said the second wave of the virus had also seen more staff off sick with Covid and isolating - with some becoming very ill. \n\"We've had staff in as patients and one of my colleagues - I saw them when they were critically ill and ended up going to intensive care,\" continued Dr Farrow. \n\"So it's very emotional time for everyone as well you know, looking after the sick patients and looking after your colleagues.\n\"There's a level of anxiety still around -  will you be the next person to get this disease?\"\nShe said although fewer people were attending A&E, they were seeing more people arriving by ambulance and presenting with more complex needs.\n\"The group of patients we are seeing this time I think is different, we're definitely having more younger people with Covid that are becoming sick, the volume is very high in the community.\n\"I think people are afraid of come into the hospital as well, so there are still quite a lot of patients who leave it maybe a bit too late before they're seeking hospital attention.\"\nHelen Whatmore, 45, from Beddau, has been hospital since early December after developing Covid symptoms. \nSpeaking from her intensive care bed, she said she had been unwell in February so assumed she had already caught the virus.\n\"I honestly didn't believe it was as bad until I caught [Covid] this time,\" she said. \n\"This time it's absolutely knocked the socks off me. It's nearly killed me. \n\"A friend of mine passed away as I came into hospital and I came down very rapidly with Covid, kidney problems and pneumonia.\"\nShe said she was grateful for the care she had received: \"The nurses are coming in [working] all shifts, they're fighting for your loved ones, from the time they enter right until the time they leave, then they're changing over and doing the same again.\n\"People are passing away\u2026 how much more have they got to do? We're asking them to protect our children and our families. Why are we not protecting them ourselves? Saving our families and our own children.\""

      "tags": "NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Two more life-saving drugs have been found that can cut deaths by a quarter in patients who are sickest with Covid. \nThe anti-inflammatory medications, given via a drip, save an extra life for every 12 treated, say researchers who have carried out a trial in NHS intensive care units. \nSupplies are already available across the UK so they can be used immediately to save hundreds of lives, say experts. \nThere are over 30,000 Covid patients in UK hospitals - 39% more than in April.\nThe UK government is working closely with the manufacturer, to ensure the drugs - tocilizumab and sarilumab - continue to be available to UK patients.\nAs well as saving more lives, the treatments speed up patients' recovery and reduce the length of time that critically-ill patients need to spend in intensive care by about a week. \nBoth appear to work equally well and add to the benefit already found with a cheap steroid drug called dexamethasone. \nAlthough the drugs are not cheap, costing around \u00a3500 per patient, on top of the \u00a35 course of dexamethasone, the advantage of using them is clear - and less than the cost per day of an intensive care bed of around \u00a32,000, say experts.\nLead researcher Prof Anthony Gordon, from Imperial College London, said: \"For every 12 patients you treat with these drugs you would expect to save a life. It's a big effect.\"\nIn the REMAP-CAP trial carried out in six different countries, including the UK, with around 800 intensive care patients:\nProf Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: \"The fact there is now another drug that can help to reduce mortality for patients with Covid-19 is hugely welcome news and another positive development in the continued fight against the virus.\"\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:  \"The UK has proven time and time again it is at the very forefront of identifying and providing the most promising, innovative treatments for its patients.  \n\"Today's results are yet another landmark development in finding a way out of this pandemic and, when added to the armoury of vaccines and treatments already being rolled out, will play a significant role in defeating this virus.\" \nThe drugs dampen down inflammation, which can go into overdrive in Covid patients and cause damage to the lungs and other organs. \nDoctors are being advised to give them to any Covid patient who, despite receiving dexamethasone, is deteriorating and needs intensive care.\nTocilizumab and sarilumab have already been added to the government's export restriction list, which bans companies from buying medicines meant for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country. \nThe research findings have not yet been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal.

      "tags": "Washington DC,US Capitol stormed,Donald Trump",
      "text": "With the country still reeling from Wednesday's violence in Washington, serious questions are being asked about how such a massive security breach was able to happen at the heart of US government.\nCrowds of pro-Trump supporters were able to force their way inside one of the country's most historically and politically significant buildings while elected lawmakers were inside moving to certify Joe Biden's election victory.\nThe world watched as a mob of rioters seemed to roam free around inside -  looting and vandalising symbols of US democracy as they went.\nPresident-Elect Joe Biden has been scathing of the \"unacceptable\" handling of the rioters and compared it to the heavy-handed militarised response to last year's Black Lives Matter protests.\nLindsey Graham, a Republican Senator, also railed against the security failures. \"They could have blown the building up. They could have killed us all. They could've destroyed the government,\" he said.\nCriticism centres on preparation by police and their failure to anticipate possible violence, despite evidence that radical pro-Trump supporters and other groups were openly discussing their plans online.\nThe Washington Post, citing sources close to the matter, says that Capitol Police charged with guarding the building and its grounds did not make early requests for help from the city's main police force or the National Guard nor set-up a multiagency command centre to coordinate response to any violence.\nAnd without an adequate security perimeter in place, their sparse police lines were quickly overwhelmed by thousands descending on the Capitol. \nDozens of officers were injured, and one later died, in the effort to retake control -  including some with armour, weapons and chemical spray agents.\nTo many, the optics were a sharp contrast to last year's protests following the death of George Floyd, when rows of National Guard Troops guarded and enforced order in the capital.\nEven hours into Wednesday's violence, protesters were filmed being escorted or guided out of the building without arrest - even appearing to be helped down the Capitol stairs and having doors held open for them to exit. Another viral clip appeared to show a police officer posing for a selfie with a man inside.\nMany rioters photographed and even live-streamed their crimes. One was pictured, his face uncovered, with his feet up on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's desk, and then showing off a letter he appeared to have stolen from her office. A Confederate flag was paraded by another unmasked man and a well-known conspiracy theorist - wearing horns, fur and facepaint - was seen posing by a Senate chair that had been occupied by Vice President Mike Pence just hours earlier. \nNick Ochs, a known member of the Proud Boys far-right group, tweeted a selfie of himself inside and later told CNN: \"There were thousands of people in there - [the police] had no control of the situation. I didn't get stopped or questioned.\" \nBut despite the severity and scale of the chaos, relatively few arrests had been made by nightfall Wednesday. \nSupporters of BLM and others on the left have voiced their outrage at the perceived double-standard of policing the events. The incoming vice-president, Kamala Harris, said the disconnect was \"unacceptable\".\nFormer First Lady Michelle Obama also released a lengthy statement.\n\"I cannot think about moving on or turning the page until we reckon with the reality of what we saw yesterday,\" she wrote. \"True progress will be possible only once we acknowledge that this disconnect exists and take steps to repair it.\"\nTop congressional Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi were damning in their criticism of security failures - helping to force the departures of top officials.\nThe chief of the US Capitol Police, Steven Sund, had initially defended his force in a statement on Thursday - describing the actions of law enforcement as \"heroic\" and their plan robust.\nBut within hours his resignation was announced, alongside the departures of the sergeant-at-arms for both the House and Senate. \nAside from the clear lack of preparation, confusion mounted during the violence about when and if other security forces were being deployed to help.\nAccording to the Washington Post, Pentagon officials had placed strict operational limits on the DC National Guard ahead of protests and remained concerned about the \"optics\" of armed military personnel at the Capitol.\nDefence officials on Thursday sought to defend the speed in which they authorised and mobilised Guardsmen to respond to the violence. \nMultiple US media outlets, citing senior sources, have suggested that President Donald Trump allegedly showed reluctance for the National Guard to be used to quell the unrest.\nIf true, this is a complete contrast to the highly visible show of force the president has repeatedly called for against left-wing and BLM protesters. Gordon Corera, the BBC's security correspondent, says this emphasises how security decisions appear to have become politicised under the Trump administration.\nProfessor Clifford Stott, a specialist in the policing of crowds who advises the UK government, has been analysing the police response to BLM protests in Seattle. He told the BBC there would be \"powerful and important\" questions to be asked about how officials failed to prepared for the escalation by Trump supporters. \n\"It was the failure to predict that that led them to be inadequately prepared when it did happen and led them to be reactive and have to mobilise more resources,\" he said.  \"It's not just about the complexities of the police response, it's also about what appears to be a poor level of risk assessments around how they understand whether resources might be necessary in the first place.\"  \nThe gathering of the president's supporters, while Congress was certifying the election result, was not spontaneous. The protest was pre-planned and followed months of escalating rhetoric from President Trump and some of his Republican allies seeking to undermine the result.\nIn the days (and indeed weeks and months) before the attack, people monitoring online platforms used by extreme pro-Trump supporters and far-right groups had warned of rhetoric encouraging violence at the Capitol, including toward lawmakers, over the election result. Some were even pictured wearing clothing that said \"MAGA: CIVIL WAR\" printed alongside the 6 January 2021 date.\nProf Stott, who researches the psychology of group violence and hooliganism, told the BBC he found the overarching mood of \"joy\" among rioters openly committing crimes particularly interesting. \n\"There was a very clear purpose to that crowd and that was driven by the idea their actions were legitimate, given their perception that their president - as their commander in chief - had sanctioned them to go and do this,\" he says. \"And that sense that Capitol Hill itself had been over taken by corruption.\" \nSome appeared confused and angry at why officers had used force against them. One Yahoo News video, viewed more than 25m times on TikTok, shows a woman visibly upset that she had been maced by police, despite declaring: \"We're storming the capitol - it's a revolution!\"\nSome radical supporters have responded with disbelief and frustration at the concession video shared by President Trump on Thursday following the violence.\nThe U-turn came only a day after he told supporters: \"We will never give up, we will never concede\" and openly pressured his vice-president to overturn the election result. \nVice-President Mike Pence is among those who have called for those involved in the breach to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and given the brazen behaviour of many involved, prosecutors surely have no shortage of evidence to draw from.\nAs Facebook moved to remove videos seen to incite or encourage the events, some open-source investigators called for people to archive evidence to help with crowdsourced identification.\nMeanwhile, many seen in viral images from inside are already known figures within far-right groups and QAnon and related conspiracy networks. \nDozens of people are already facing charges - including one man officials say had a semi-automatic rifle and 11 Molotov cocktails - and police have also appealed for help identifying offenders not yet in custody.\nMichael Sherwin, the acting US Attorney for DC, said on Thursday that prosecutors would bring \"the most maximum charges we can\", when asked if crimes such as seditious conspiracy and insurrection could be tabled.\nHe also refused to rule out investigating anyone deemed to have incited the violence, including President Trump.\n\"We're trying to deal with the closest alligators to the boat right now,\" he said. \n\"Those are the people who obviously breached the Capitol, created violence and mayhem there and then exited. But yes, we are looking at all actors here, not only the people that went into the building.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it is \"excellent news\" that a third coronavirus vaccine has been approved for use in the UK. \nIt is made by US company Moderna and works in a similar way to the Pfizer one already being offered on the NHS. \nThe UK has pre-ordered 17 million doses of the Moderna vaccine - 10 million more than planned - but supplies are not expected to arrive until spring.\nIt is the last Covid vaccine with final trial data published. \nThere are hundreds still in development, with some expected to report findings in the near future. \nAround 1.5 million people in the UK have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine so far, with either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines already approved by UK regulators.\nThat figure includes almost a quarter of those aged over 80 in England - people at highest risk of severe illness or death from the virus.\nVaccines are being given to the most vulnerable first, as set out in a list of nine high-priority groups, covering around 30 million people in the UK. \nThe prime minister has said the aim is to vaccinate 15 million people in the UK by mid-February, including care homes residents and staff, frontline NHS staff, everyone over 70 and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. \nHealth and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"This is further great news and another weapon in our arsenal to tame this awful disease.\"\nThe UK had originally ordered 7 million doses of the Moderna jab, but has increased this to get even more people immunised as quickly as possible. \nIn total, the UK has now ordered 367 million doses of vaccines to protect against Covid-19.\nNadhim Zahawi, vaccine deployment minister, said: \"The NHS is pulling out all the stops to vaccinate those most at risk as quickly as possible, with over 1,000 vaccination sites live across the UK by the end of the week to provide easy access to everyone, regardless of where they live.\n\"The Moderna vaccine will be a vital boost to these efforts and will help us return to normal faster.\"\nThe Moderna vaccine, an RNA vaccine like Pfizer's, injects part of the virus's genetic code in order to provoke an immune response.\nIt requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a normal freezer. \nIn comparison, the Pfizer/BioNTech one requires temperatures closer to -75C, making transport logistics much more difficult.\nThe AstraZeneca jab is easier to store and distribute, as it can be kept at normal fridge temperature.\nAll of these vaccines require a second booster shot, but a first dose is likely to be given to as many people as possible.\nIn trials with more than 30,000, the Moderna vaccine offered nearly 95% protection from severe Covid. \nNo vaccine is 100% effective and it takes time for protection to build. For all of the Covid vaccines, we still do not know how long immunity will last. \nPeople who have received a coronavirus vaccine should continue to follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others. \nEU and US regulators have already approved the Moderna vaccine."

      "text": "Schools and colleges in Wales will stay closed to most pupils until the February half term unless there is a \"significant\" fall in Covid cases.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford also confirmed current lockdown restrictions would be extended and \"strengthened\".\nThis means non-essential retail, hospitality venues, licensed premises and leisure facilities remain closed and showrooms must now shut as well.\nMr Drakeford said: \"The pandemic has reached a significant point.\"\nHe told BBC Radio Wales the announcement was the \"best certainty\" he could offer parents, pupils and teachers, \"in a world which is highly uncertain and where things change almost every single day\".\nThe phased return to face-to-face learning at some Welsh universities has also been postponed, while internal GCSE, A-level and AS-level assessments have been cancelled.\nThe announcement follows a similar move in England, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already said schools would not open before half term.\nSpring half term in Wales is scheduled to take place the week beginning Monday 15 February. \nWales has been in an alert level four lockdown since 20 December in an attempt to reduce the transmission of coronavirus.\nOn Thursday, 63 further deaths from coronavirus were reported by Public Health Wales.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Wales, Mr Drakeford said the new variant was more easily spread and stricter lockdown measures were now needed to keep people safe.\nMinisters are in talks with employers and unions and changes are set to be announced for workplaces - to protect workers - early next week.\nMr Drakeford said he wanted to see the way supermarkets were policed return to the way they were during the first lockdown, with strict number limits in stores and social distancing measures abided to.\nBut he said a curfew, meaning people would have to be in their homes by a certain time, similar to that seen in Northern Ireland, was not currently being considered. \nSchools and colleges had already been told they would have to teach online until 18 January at the earliest, however this will now continue if cases of the virus do not fall \"materially\" before the next review date on 29 January.\nIf cases do not drop, that would mean schools would reopen on 22 February at the earliest, and internal exams have also been cancelled.\nBut teaching unions have warned that more uniformed lateral flow testing needs to be in place and teachers must be vaccinated before talks on how to reopen schools can begin.\nSpeaking at the Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said people working at special schools and school and college staff who were at risk would soon be vaccinated. \nCardiff University has also confirmed that a phased return to in-person teaching has been cancelled, with learning continuing online for most students until 22 February.\nStudents currently have to have had two lateral flow tests confirming they are negative for Covid-19 before they return to Welsh campuses - and face to face teaching is only resuming for medical students and those who have practical parts of their courses on campus.\nMr Drakeford said: \"Universities have worked hard to make sure that when students do return it is done in a careful and controlled way, with the safety of those young people and their communities at the forefront of their planning.\"\nThe announcement affecting showrooms means any retailers which allow people to browse and then order for a future date - such as kitchens, bathrooms, furniture and car sales - must close.\nClick and collect will still be allowed.\nConfirming alert level four restrictions would continue for at least three more weeks, Mr Drakeford told Radio Wales the lockdown measures were already leading to cases falling, but the rate remained high.\n\"There are some positive signs that the huge collective effort we are making is making a difference, but the numbers are stubbornly high,\" he said.\n\"We have not yet seen an impact of those falls feeding into the number of people being admitted to hospital and becoming, sometimes, so ill they need intensive care.\n\"We need to see the numbers come down as well so that our NHS is genuinely able to cope with the enormous pressure it is currently facing.\"\nMr Drakeford said huge efforts were being made to rollout the Covid-19 vaccines, and with the \"end being in sight\" it was more important than ever for people to follow the rules and stay home.\n\"We have made so many sacrifices together and we mustn't stop now,\" he said.\nEducation Minister Kirsty Williams said: \"Schools and colleges have been safe and secure environments throughout the pandemic and that continues to be the case.\n\"However, the latest TAC report is clear on education's contribution. We know that school and college settings can contribute to wider social mixing outside the education environment and, right now, we all have to play our part in supressing this virus.\"\nMs Williams said the government would use the period until the next review date to \"look at all the possibilities for a phased and safe return of some pupils, such as those studying for qualifications, or the youngest children who find distance learning the most difficult\".\nFollowing the announcement, exams regulator Qualifications Wales cancelled the spring \"internal assessment window\" for GCSE, AS and A-level pupils, which was scheduled for 22 February - 23 April.\nThis was introduced following the decision that exams would be cancelled in 2021.\nChief executive Philip Blaker said: \"We know that learners need clarity about how they will be assessed and there will be clarity on revised arrangements soon.\"\nMr Drakeford said discussions were under way between teachers and education officials over ways children could catch up after missing time in school. \nSpeaking at Friday's Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said police and local authorities would continue to crack down on people who break lockdown rules. \nSince the start of the pandemic, 3,585 fines have been handed out by police forces in Wales. \n\"Of course I want to thank everyone for following the rules and helping to keep Wales safe. It's always frustrating when a small minority act as though those rules do not apply to them,\" he added.\n\"I want everybody to know that where people knowingly and persistently break the rules, action will be taken. Too many lives have been lost to this awful virus to allow anybody to believe that they do not share in the responsibility that binds us all.\"\nUnions welcomed the news saying the health and safety of pupils and staff \"had to be a priority\", but said teachers must now be given the vaccine as a priority, and pupils and staff must be protected before talks about reopening schools began.\nCurrently teachers are not on the priority list for immunisation, and have to wait to get the jab dependent on their age and if they have a medical condition.\nLaura Doel, director of The National Association of Headteachers Cymru, said a \"properly organised\" testing regime needed to be put in place for schools, and special schools and pupil referral units needed support to remain open.\n\"Any plan that sees school staff return to face-to-face learning should be afforded as much protection as possible against the virus,\" she said.\"Once these issues have been addressed, then we can discuss the orderly return to school we all want.\"\nMeanwhile, Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru said: \"I think we would be happier if we had clarity about what that date looks like, it would give confidence in the system.\"\nOpposition parties called for clear plans on how schools would return and for support to make sure pupils from poorer backgrounds did not fall behind due to a \"digital divide\".\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said: \"The Welsh Government must plan now for the gradual and safe reopening of schools, putting in place safety measures, and should lay out plans for a vaccination programme for schools staff.\"\nWelsh Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies called for the Welsh Government to publish evidence on its reasons for closing schools, bring forward vaccines for teachers, and that money must be made available for all pupils to access laptops for online learning.\n\"This is another bleak day for education in Wales,\" she said.\n\"Decisions aren't easy to make and I urge everyone involved in the journeys to and from school to consider how they might help schools open again and stay open.\"\nShe tweeted: \"Get a grip on consistent online quality. Give my vaccination to a younger teacher.\""

      "tags": "US Capitol stormed,Nancy Pelosi,Donald Trump,Mike Pence,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US President Donald Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration of his successor, Joe Biden, on 20 January.\n\"To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th,\" the president tweeted.\nThe president-elect welcomed the news, calling Mr Trump's absence \"a good thing\".\nMr Trump is facing calls for his removal from office after five people died when a mob of his supporters invaded Congress.\nThe president was not fit to serve in the White House, Mr Biden said. But he said he would happy for Vice-President Mike Pence to attend the inauguration.\nThe latest death is that of US Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who succumbed to his injuries in hospital.\nThe FBI and Washington police will jointly investigate his death, although they have not yet said whether it will be treated as murder. \nWednesday's violence came hours after Mr Trump encouraged his supporters to fight against the election results as Congress was certifying Mr Biden's victory in the November vote.\nUnder pressure, Mr Trump released a recorded statement late on Thursday condemning the storming of the US Capitol as a \"heinous attack\". \nIt is highly unusual but not unprecedented: the last president to skip the inauguration of his successor was Andrew Johnson, in 1869. \nMr Trump has now admitted defeat in the 3 November election and has promised a peaceful transfer of power. However, he has repeated baseless claims of widespread voter fraud. \nMeanwhile, House Democrats plan to introduce articles of impeachment next Monday accusing the outgoing president of incitement of insurrection.\nNearly 160 House Democrats have signed on to the bill, which was drafted by congressmen Ted Lieu of California and David Cicilline of Rhode Island while they were sheltering in place during Wednesday's chaos at the Capitol.\nIf the House votes to pass an impeachment, proceedings would move to the Senate. But there is so far no sign that the two-thirds of votes required to convict the president can be found in the Republican-controlled upper chamber.\nThe White House responded in a statement: \"A politically motivated impeachment against a President with 12 days remaining in his term will only serve to further divide our great country.\"\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi previously said her preference was for Mr Trump to be removed using the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness.\nBut there is no sign of the support from the vice-president and cabinet members needed to trigger this constitutional process.\nTime is tight, with just 12 days remaining in Mr Trump's presidential term. \nOn Friday, Mrs Pelosi said she had spoken to the top US military official, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to prevent Mr Trump from accessing US nuclear codes. \nSeparately, one of Mrs Pelosi's staff members revealed that a laptop had been stolen from her office during the mob invasion of Congress. \nTrump's announcement that he will not attend Joe Biden's inauguration, breaking with a long American tradition, should not come as a huge surprise. He only recently, and reluctantly, acknowledged his presidential defeat, after months of unfounded allegations that a landslide electoral victory had been stolen from him.\nThe terse message, posted on Twitter, will undercut the president's call for \"healing and reconciliation\" made in the White House video he released last night. It suggests Trump, far from being at peace with his defeat, still harbours the kind of anger and resentment he has displayed in recent days.\nHe will not graciously welcome the Bidens to Washington as part of his promised \"smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power\". He may not even be anywhere near Washington when they arrive.\nInstead, scripted Trump and Twitter Trump reveal two very different attitudes.\nAlready, Trump has tweeted about the \"giant voice\" his supporters will continue to have. The question is whether Trump is writing a coda to his presidency or just clearing his throat."

      "tags": "Scottish government,Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "Alex Salmond has accused Nicola Sturgeon of misleading parliament, calling evidence she gave to an inquiry into the handling of sexual harassment claims against him \"simply untrue\". \nMr Salmond's comments emerged in a written submission to a separate investigation into whether the first minister breached the ministerial code.\nThe submission has been shared with the Holyrood committee.\nMs Sturgeon says she \"entirely rejects Mr Salmond's claims\".\nIn the submission, the former first minister said that Ms Sturgeon had misled parliament and broken the ministerial code with breaches including failing to inform the civil service in good time of her meetings with him.\nHe claimed she allowed the Scottish government to contest a civil court case against him despite having had legal advice that it was likely to collapse.\nMs Sturgeon told the Holyrood inquiry she had become aware of allegations at a meeting with Mr Salmond at her home.\nIt since emerged she met his former chief of staff in the days before, but she said she had forgotten about that meeting.\nMr Salmond said that claim was untenable.\nHis submission said that she misled parliament, and that amounted to a breach of the code. He also said she breached the code by failing to to inform civil servants of the nature of the meetings that took place between the two of them at her home where the allegations were discussed.\nMr Salmond's statement read: \"The pre-arranged meeting in the Scottish Parliament of 29 March 2018 was \"forgotten\" about because acknowledging it would have rendered ridiculous the claim made by the first minister in parliament that it had been believed that the meeting on 2 April was on SNP Party business and thus held at her private residence.\"\nBoth Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon are expected to give evidence to the committee in the coming weeks.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross responded to the claims, saying: \"Nobody ever bought Nicola Sturgeon's tall tales to have suddenly turned forgetful, especially about the devastating moment she found out of sexual harassment allegations against her friend and mentor of 30 years. \n\"What has been revealed are allegations of shocking, deliberate and corrupt actions at the heart of government. There is now clear evidence of Nicola Sturgeon abusing her power to deceive the Scottish public.\n\"If this proves to be correct, it is a resignation matter. No first minister, at any time, can be allowed to get away with repeatedly and blatantly lying to the Scottish Parliament and breaking the ministerial code.\"\nScottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie said Alex Salmond's explosive allegations demanded answers from the first minister to the committee.\nShe said: \"The bombshell accusation that Nicola Sturgeon has broken the ministerial code has the potential to end her political career and demands a robust and honest answer from the first minister.\n\"This committee demands truthfulness and honesty from every witness it calls - it is vital that the first minister tells the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth when she appears.\"\nMs Sturgeon has repeatedly dismissed any notion of a conspiracy against Mr Salmond.\nHer spokeswoman said: \"The first minister entirely rejects Mr Salmond's claims about the ministerial code. \n\"We should always remember that the roots of this issue lie in complaints made by women about Alex Salmond's behaviour whilst he was first minister, aspects of which he has conceded. It is not surprising therefore that he continues to try to divert focus from that by seeking to malign the reputation of the first minister and by spinning false conspiracy theories.  \n\"The first minister is concentrating on fighting the pandemic, stands by what she has said, and will address these matters in full when she appears at committee.\" \nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions on Friday evening, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford MP said he did not believe the accusations about the first minister were correct.\nHe said: \"I believe that the first minister has acted in an honourable way, she's someone that I've every faith and trust in. \n\"I can tell you that the approval ratings for the first minister, the respect that she has right up and down the country of Scotland is enormous and this is something that will pass, when she appears in front of the committee these matters will be dealt with.\"\nAlex Salmond has just turned up the heat on his successor with a submission that presents a direct and serious challenge to the reputation of Nicola Sturgeon - who was once his closest political ally. \nWhat he no doubt considers as an attempt to secure justice, some others will see as a case of deflection and revenge. \nAllegations of breaking the ministerial code of conduct and misleading parliament are serious and, if upheld, potentially career threatening.\nYet even some of Ms Sturgeon's fiercest critics at Holyrood do not expect the inquiries into the Scottish government's mishandling of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond to force her from office.\nMr Salmond seems to expect the review of the first minister's actions under the ministerial code of conduct to remain narrow enough that it could not possibly find against her. \nThe first minister herself appears confident of persuading all comers, including a cross-party committee of MSPs (before which both she and Mr Salmond are due to appear in the coming weeks) that she has acted properly throughout."

      "tags": "US Capitol stormed,US election 2020,Donald Trump,US Congress",
      "text": "A US Capitol police officer has died from injuries sustained in the attack on Congress by a pro-Trump mob as top Democrats have called for the president to be removed for \"inciting\" the riot.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th amendment to the Constitution to declare the president unfit for office.\nAlternatively, she vowed to initiate the process to impeach the president.\nUnder pressure, Donald Trump finally condemned the \"heinous attack\".\nWednesday's violence came hours after Mr Trump encouraged his supporters to fight against the election results as Congress was certifying President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the November vote.\nFive people have died in relation to the riot, including Brian Sicknick, an officer at the US Capitol Police (USCP) who was \"injured while physically engaging with protesters\", the police said.\nMeanwhile, the top congressional Democrats - Speaker Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer - have urged Vice-President Pence and Mr Trump's cabinet to remove the president for \"his incitement of insurrection\".\n\"The President's dangerous and seditious acts necessitate his immediate removal from office,\" they said in a joint statement.\nThe duo called for Mr Trump to be ousted using the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness.\nBut it would require Mr Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment, something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. Mr Trump is due to leave office on 20 January, when Mr Biden will be sworn in.\nMrs Pelosi indicated that if the vice-president failed to act, she would convene the House to launch their second impeachment proceedings against Mr Trump.\nHowever, to succeed in convicting and removing the president, Democrats would need a two-thirds majority in the Senate, and there is no indication they would get those numbers. And it was not clear whether enough time remained to carry out the process.\nMrs Pelosi's deputy, Katherine Clark, told CNN the House could move on impeachment next week. \nMedia reports, quoting unnamed sources, said Mr Trump had suggested to aides he was considering granting a pardon to himself in the final days of his presidency. The legality of such a move is untested. \nIt wasn't until Thursday night, more than 24 hours after the US Capitol had been ransacked by his supporters, that Donald Trump released a recorded statement calling for \"healing and reconciliation\" in a wounded nation.\nThat was the very least that could be expected from a US president in a time of crises, and it probably will not be enough to silence calls for his removal, impeachment or resignation. Those demands have been coming from the political left, of course, but also from parts of the right  - longtime critics, from former allies and, remarkably, even the conservative editorial page of Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal.\nEver since November's election, when Trump chose to attack the results rather than admit defeat, a reckoning was coming. The pressure, like a malfunctioning steam engine, was building toward a catastrophic ending.\nOn Thursday night, the president began trying to pick up the pieces.\nTeleprompter Trump had spoken. In past crises, unscripted Trump has quickly returned, with words and actions that reveal his earlier comments were insincere. \nWith 12 days left in his presidency, the question is whether, or more likely when, that Trump will return - and what happens when he does.\nPresident Trump returned to Twitter on Thursday following a 12-hour freeze of his account. His message was the closest he has come to a formal acceptance of his defeat after weeks of falsely insisting he actually won the election in a \"landslide\". \n\"Now Congress has certified the results a new administration will be inaugurated on January 20th,\" the Republican said in a video, without mentioning Mr Biden by name. \n\"My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation.\" \nMr Trump said he had \"immediately deployed\" the National Guard to expel the intruders, though some US media reported he had hesitated to send in the troops, leaving his vice-president to give the order.\nHe also praised his \"wonderful supporters\" and promised \"our incredible journey is only just beginning\".\nLaw enforcement have been heavily criticised after they were overrun by the protesters. Mr Biden said: \"Nobody could tell me that if it was a group of Black Lives Matter protesters yesterday they wouldn't have been treated very differently than the thugs that stormed the Capitol.\"\nImages captured inside the Capitol building showed protesters roaming through some of the corridors unimpeded. \nThe FBI is seeking to identify those involved in the rampage, and the Washington DC police have released pictures of \"persons of interest\" for their involvement in the riot. The Department of Justice says people could face charges of seditious conspiracy, as well as rioting and insurrection. \nWashington police say 68 people have so far been arrested. One of those detained at the Capitol had a \"military-style automatic weapon and 11 Molotov cocktails (petrol bombs)\", according to the federal attorney for Washington DC. \nThe official responsible for security in the House of Representatives, the sergeant at arms, has resigned. Mr Schumer has called for his counterpart in the Senate to be sacked. USCP chief Steven Sund is also resigning, effective 16 January, following calls from Mrs Pelosi. \nOn Thursday, crews began installing a non-scalable 7ft (2m) fence around the Capitol which will remain in place for at least 30 days. \nAshli Babbitt, a 35-year-old US Air Force veteran from San Diego, California, was named as the woman fatally shot by a police officer who has now been placed on leave. Law enforcement told US media the victim was unarmed.\nThree others died after suffering\u00a0unspecified medical emergencies on Capitol grounds: Benjamin Philips, 50, from Pennsylvania; Kevin Greeson, 55, from Alabama; and Rosanne Boyland, 34, from Georgia. Mr Greeson's family said he died of a heart attack. \nPolice said that 14 officers had been injured in the riot. \nOn Thursday evening, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos - one of the longest serving members of the president's administration - became the second cabinet member to quit following the Capitol riot.\nIn her resignation letter, Ms DeVos accused the president of fomenting Wednesday's disorder. \"There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me.\" \nEarlier in the day, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao stepped down, saying she had been \"deeply troubled\" by the rampage.\nOther aides to quit include special envoy Mick Mulvaney, a senior national security official, and the chief of staff to First Lady Melania Trump. A state department adviser was also sacked after calling Mr Trump \"unfit for office\" in a tweet."

      "text": "Heads are calling for limits to the number of pupils in school during lockdown in England, with attendance rates surging to 50% in some places.\nThe two head teachers' unions, NAHT and ASCL, say the high numbers attending could hamper the fight against the virus.\nThe Department for Education has widened the categories of vulnerable and key worker pupils who can attend.\nIt is insisting that schools ensure all children who qualify can attend.\nThe widened categories not only include vulnerable pupils and children of workers in critical occupations but also those who cannot access remote learning either because they do not have devices or space to study. \nChildren of parents working on the Brexit arrangements are also included.\nTeachers have described streets around schools being packed with parents dropping off their children and almost all staff having to come in and work despite the lockdown.\nHeads say they fear schools could be overwhelmed by children who do not have access to lap tops to learn remotely.\nJessica Jane, a learning assistant at a school in Hampshire, told the BBC: \"I work in a primary school where we are having to bring in every single member of staff as the list of key-workers is vast in our area and over 50% of our children are attending.\n\"Our community school is not closed and streets are packed with parents morning and afternoon collecting their children from open schools.\"\nShe added: \"My colleagues and I are still being put at risk every single day as are our families.\"\nA teacher from the Midlands who did not wish to be named said the number had risen from 10 pupils a day in the first lockdown to about 90 a day this week. \n\"We're talking just under to just over a third of the usual amount of pupils for our school here.  \n\"The vast majority are key worker children, not vulnerable. \n\"I also know that other primary schools in our area have similar amounts of children in school - one neighbouring school in particular, which is only slightly larger than us, is estimating/averaging 100 to 160 children in school every day.\"\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, called the lack of limits \"bizarre... in a week when the prime minister has told the nation that it is necessary to move schools to remote education in order to suppress coronavirus transmission\".\n\"We are hearing reports that attendance in some primary schools is in excess of 50% because of demand from critical workers and families with children classed as vulnerable under criteria which has been significantly widened,\" he said.\n\"We are urgently seeking clarification about the maximum number who should be in school while protecting public health.\n\"This seems completely illogical given the fact that the government has taken the drastic action of a full national lockdown precisely in order to limit contacts.\"\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of National Association of Head Teachers, said schools could not \"meet the demand created by government and reduce social mixing in the way the prime minister announced\".\n\"The government acknowledges that schools do play a role in the transmission of the virus. Therefore, there comes a point when occupancy levels might be so high that they work against the efforts to bring down infection rates in communities, as is the national aim. \n\"This could result in prolonging the amount of time pupils are away from the classroom, which we are all anxious to avoid.\"\nA Department for Education spokesman said: \"Schools are open for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers. We expect schools to work with families to ensure all critical worker children are given access to a place if this is required. \n\"If critical workers can work from home and look after their children at the same time then they should do so, but otherwise this provision is in place to enable them to provide vital services.\n\"The protective measures that schools have been following throughout the autumn term remain in place to help protect staff and students, while the national lockdown helps reduce transmission in the wider community.\"\nBut Emma Knights, chief executive of the National Governance Association, reflected head teachers' concerns, saying between 40 and 60% of pupils were attending schools across England.\n\"The real problem is we have got two different national narratives going on,\" she said - with the prime minister saying \"stay at home\" but the DfE telling schools to take all eligible children who turn up.\nDr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the government seemed unable to decide whether schools were safe or unsafe.\nCommenting on the latest Coronavirus Infection Survey from the Office for National Statistics, Dr Bousted, said: \"Let this data end their confusion. Schools are clearly driving infection amongst children, and then onto the wider community. \n\"This peaked on Christmas Day with one in every 27 secondary-age children and one in 40 primary-age children infected. \n\"In London this rises to one in 18 secondary pupils and one in 23 primary pupils. These figures are truly shocking and entirely the result of government negligence.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A further 1,325 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began.\nIt means there have been just short of 80,000 deaths by that measure - as another 68,053 new cases were recorded.\nPublic Health England (PHE) said the number of deaths would \"continue to rise until we stop the spread\".\nIt comes as the government launches a new campaign in England urging people to \"act like you've got\" the virus.\nThe campaign, including an advert fronted by England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, is intended to remind the public Covid is spreading fast, with large numbers showing no symptoms.\nIn the advert, Prof Whitty says: \"Covid-19, especially the new variant, is spreading quickly across the country. \n\"This puts many people at risk of serious disease and is placing a lot of pressure on our NHS. \n\"Once more, we must all stay home. If it is essential to go out remember, wash your hands, cover your face indoors and keep your distance from others.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"Our hospitals are under more pressure than at any other time since the start of the pandemic, and infection rates across the entire country continue to soar at an alarming rate.\"\nHospital leaders have warned of stretched staffing with 31,624 coronavirus patients in UK hospitals on Wednesday - 46% above the peak during the first wave last year.\nDr Ian Higginson, vice president of Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the situation in London and south-east England was \"pretty dire\" and would get worse in the rest of the country before long.\n\"We're heading for some really dark times, I fear, in this phase of the pandemic,\" he said.\nRichard Mitchell, chief executive of Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Trust, said the increase in patients seen in London was now affecting his area in Nottinghamshire.\nHe said: \"Critical care is exceptionally busy and the colleagues who work here are tired, they're fatigued and they're worn out.\"\nMeanwhile, a third Covid vaccine received emergency approval for use in the UK with 17 million doses of the jab, made by US firm Moderna, pre-ordered by the UK.\nThe vaccine joins the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca jabs in being approved, with close to 1.5 million people now vaccinated in the UK.\nDr William Welfare, Covid-19 response director at PHE, said: \"Each life lost to this virus is a tragedy, but sadly we can expect the death toll to continue to rise until we stop the spread.\n\"Approximately one in three people who have coronavirus have no symptoms and could be spreading it without realising it.\n\"To protect our loved ones it is essential we all stay at home where possible. This will reduce new infections, ease the pressure on the NHS and save lives.\"\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said the spread of Covid in the capital was now \"out of control\", as he declared a \"major incident\". \nThis means the emergency services and hospitals cannot guarantee their normal level of response, and allows special arrangements to be implemented.\nThe previous highest daily death toll - 1,224 - was recorded on 21 April 2020 during the UK's first lockdown. Daily deaths were in the single figures as recently as September.\nThe UK has recorded the fifth-highest number of deaths behind the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico, according to Johns Hopkins University.\nWe are now seeing the record numbers of cases over the Christmas period translate into record numbers of deaths. \nAnd with new infections rising rapidly - more than 1.1 million people in England estimated to be infected with Covid-19 last week - these tragic numbers are set to continue for some time.\nAnd that is mainly because of the new variant form of the virus which is thought to be between 30-70% more transmissible. \nThe administration of the vaccines to at-risk groups should see a reduction in the numbers dying by the end of the month and the numbers having to go into hospital going down sometime after that.\nThat is the other way around from what you normally hear - but that it because a successful vaccine programme will initially remove those most likely to die from the path of the virus. \nFitter or younger people - who are less likely to die but could still end up occupying hospital beds - won't be getting their jabs for some time yet.\nThe advent of spring's better weather should also help cases to fall, but ministers will have to decide what level of risk - and deaths - society is prepared to tolerate.\nFriday saw 619,941 tests conducted in the 24 hours to 09:00 GMT - also a new record.\nEngland, much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland continue to be under strict national measures, with stay-at-home orders in place for most people.\nThe R number - the rate at which an infected person passes on the virus to someone else - is now estimated to be between 1.0 to 1.4, meaning the epidemic is growing between 0% and 6% per day.\nCovid infections rose by almost a third between Boxing Day and 3 January, reaching 70,000 new cases a day according to a major study.\nIn a different piece of research, an estimated 1.2 million people in total had Covid over a similar time period, the Office for National Statistics said.\nBoris Johnson pledged on Thursday to use England's lockdown to implement an \"unprecedented national effort\" to offer vaccination to those at the highest risk from Covid by 15 February.\nHe said the Army would be drafted in to use \"battle preparation techniques\" to achieve the goal, which could see up to 15 million people offered a vaccine by the middle of next month.\nIn another development, from next week all travellers to the UK will need to show a recent negative test result before they arrive.\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

      "tags": "Bali,Indonesia",
      "text": "A radical Muslim cleric linked to the 2002 Bali bombings has been freed amid concerns over his ongoing influence on extremists.\nAbu Bakar Ba'asyir was picked up by his family from a jail outside Indonesia's capital Jakarta early on Friday.\nThe 82-year-old is the former head of Jemaah Islamiah, an al-Qaeda-inspired group behind the attack that killed 202 people.\nAuthorities say he will enter a deradicalisation programme.\nPeople from 21 nations died in the blasts on 12 October 2002 on the popular holiday island of Bali. The two bombs had ripped through Paddy's Irish Bar and the nearby Sari Club in the Kuta tourist district. \nIt remains to this day Indonesia's deadliest terrorist attack.\nThe release has drawn mixed reactions in Indonesia as well as Australia, where most of the victims were from. Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was \"distressing\" for victims' families and that \"it's sometimes not a fair world\".\nThe firebrand preacher was freed after completing a jail term for a conviction unrelated to the bombings.\nHe had been sentenced to 15 years in jail in 2011 for supporting militant training in conservative Aceh province, but the term was later cut due to sentence reductions. Officials reportedly said he had \"served his punishment well\".\nPreviously Ba'asyir had been jailed in 2005 for conspiracy over the Bali bombings, but this conviction was overturned on appeal.\nHe has always denied any involvement in terrorism.\nBa'asyir was commander of Jemaah Islamiah (JI), the militant Islamist group, at the time of the Bali bombings.\nSome described the cleric as the \"mastermind\" behind the blasts but his exact role remains unclear.\nSidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict in Jakarta, said operational decisions were headed by someone else in JI but Ba'asyir would have given a \"de-facto green light\".\n\"He didn't plan it. But he is the person who could have stopped it if he said no.\"\nBa'asyir later broke off with JI, going on to found another extremist group, Jamaah Anshorut Tauhid.\nAhead of the cleric's release Garil Arnandha, whose father was among the bombing victims, told the BBC: \"I don't agree with Abu Bakar Ba'asyir being released because in my opinion he is still very dangerous and has the potential to revive terrorism in Indonesia.\"\nEndang, his mother, had a different view.\n\"As a bomb victim I have forgiven him,\" she told the BBC.\n\"He has served time in jail for his crimes and I really hope he will return to the right path. I am worried but I am trying to have positive thinking because the trauma of losing my husband in the bombing has been horrific.\" \nIn Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Ba'asyir's release was \"very distressing\" for relatives of those killed, but added it was \"a matter for the Indonesian justice system\".\n\"That doesn't make it any easier for any Australian to accept that, ultimately. That those who are responsible for the murder of Australians would now be free,\" he said. \nEighty-eight Australians were among those who died in Bali.\nAlbert Talarico, a spokesman for the Coogee Dolphins rugby league club in Sydney that lost six members in the nightclub bombings, said it was \"very frustrating for the families\" who had to \"live through the same painful memories again\".\n\"I don't believe he should be released, but that's their rules,\" added Mr Talarico, speaking to the BBC earlier this week. \"It doesn't seem to be fair to the families.\"\nThe club honours the six members who lost their lives each day - through the Coogee Dolphins emblem that was changed to reflect their position numbers, and during matches when these numbers are proudly displayed on the team jerseys.\n\"We carry their numbers on our chests in every match. They were young men in the prime of their lives. We make sure their stories are not forgotten,\" Mr Talarico said.\nDr Jones told the BBC she didn't think Ba'asyir's release would have a major impact on the risk of violence in Indonesia.\n\"I think he will be treated as an elder statesman by conservative Muslim groups that would like to see greater Islamic law in Indonesia. But I don't think he is likely to inspire a new round of violent extremism,\" she said.\nThat's partly down to his waning influence but also the change in how extremists operate today, she added.\n\"We're seeing less influence of individual clerics and more inspiration and instruction taken from the internet,\" Dr Jones explained. \"We're also seeing the proliferation of very small autonomous cells, not large hierarchical organisations that look to a single leader.\"\nAfter the Bali attacks, Indonesia - backed by Australia and the United States - set up an elite anti-terrorist unit that weakened JI.\nIn 2008 three men were executed for their role in the bombings, and several others have either been jailed or killed by the security forces.  \nBa'asyir is reported to have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2014 while in jail.\nThe head of Indonesia's anti-terrorism agency Eddy Hartono has said the octogenarian would undergo a deradicalisation programme.\n\"We're hoping Abu Bakar Bashir after he's free can give peaceful, soothing preachings,\" he said in a statement, according to Reuters news agency.\nAdditional reporting by BBC News Indonesia."

      "text": "UK house prices rose by 6% last year, according to the Halifax, but the lender is predicting \"downward pressure\" on values in 2021.\nThe mortgage lender, part of Lloyds Banking Group, said that prices \"soared\" in the second half of 2020.\nPent-up demand, a clamour for more space, and stamp duty holidays led to higher prices. \nBut the Halifax said the economic realities of 2021 meant activity would slow as the year progressed.\n\"With the pace of the UK's economic recovery expected to be constrained by the renewed national lockdown, and unemployment widely predicted to rise in the coming months, downward pressure on house prices remains likely as we move through 2021,\" said Russell Galley, managing director at the Halifax.\nHe said that last year was a market of two halves - starting with slow growth, and stalling when the market was closed during the first national lockdown, but then booming when it reopened.\nThis meant that overall, demand and price growth were relatively high.\nThe conclusion mirrors the findings of rival lender, the Nationwide, which said that UK house prices climbed 7.5% in 2020, the highest growth rate for six years.\nBoth mortgage lenders base their findings on their customer data.\nLucy Pendleton, from estate agents James Pendleton, said: \"The simple truth is that extra space has become non-negotiable for legions of homeowners with families, and the usual winter slowdown has met the immovable force that is hundreds of thousands of people all trying to jump to larger properties at the same time.\"\nThe Halifax said there were already signs of the market slowing, with prices rising by 0.2% in December compared with the previous month.\nThat was the slowest monthly rise of the last six months.\nThe lender said the average home was valued at \u00a3253,374."

      "text": " The FBI will join an investigation into the death of a police officer from injuries sustained during the pro-Trump siege of the US Capitol, authorities say.\nBrian Sicknick, 42, was injured while \"physically engaging with protesters\", police said.\nActing Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said no resources would be spared to hold those responsible to account.\nFlags over the Capitol were lowered in the officer's honour on Friday.\nSicknick's death was the fifth linked to Wednesday's riots, which have led to calls for President Donald Trump to be removed from office.\nAir Force veteran Ashli Babbitt was shot by a police officer, while three others died after suffering unspecified medical emergencies.\nThe chief of the US Capitol Police (USCP) said more than 50 law enforcement officers had been injured during the siege.\nThe details surrounding Sicknick's death are still unclear.\nIn a statement, the USCP said Sicknick died at approximately 21:30 local time (02:30 GMT) on Thursday \"due to injuries sustained while on duty\".\nHe was responding to the riots at the US Capitol when he was injured, the force said. \n\"He returned to his division office and collapsed. He was taken to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries,\" it said.\nCiting two law enforcement officials, the New York Times reported that Sicknick was struck with a fire extinguisher at some point during the breach of Congress. However, reports of an attack haven't been confirmed.\nOn Friday, Mr Rosen said the FBI and Washington police would jointly investigate Sicknick's death, although he did not say if it would be treated as suspected murder.\nUS broadcaster CNN, citing a law enforcement official, reported that federal prosecutors were planning to open a murder investigation.\nSicknick was born the youngest of three brothers in South River, New Jersey. \nHe \"wanted to be a police officer his entire life\", his brother, Ken Sicknick, said in a statement. \n\"Brian is a hero and that is what we would like people to remember,\" his brother said.\nSicknick joined the Capitol Police in July 2008 and most recently served in the department's First Responder's Unit.\nPrior to that, he served in the New Jersey Air National Guard, which he joined in 1997. He was deployed to Saudi Arabia in 1999 in support of Operation Southern Watch, and in Kyrgyzstan in 2003 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the Iraq War.\nHe was honourably discharged in 2003. \n\"Staff Sgt Sicknick's commitment to service and protect his community, state, and nation will never be forgotten,\" the New Jersey National Guard said.\nThe White House and senior politicians, both Democratic and Republican, have been paying their respects to Sicknick.\nDemocratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered the flags at the Capitol building to be lowered to half-mast.\n\"The violent and deadly act of insurrection targeting the Capitol, our temple of American democracy, and its workers was a profound tragedy and stain on our nation's history,\" she said in a statement.\nA spokesman for President Trump said that he and his \"entire administration extend our prayers to Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick's family as we all grieve the loss of this American hero\".\nVirginia Democrat Don Beyer has called for Sicknick to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda, saying \"he made the ultimate sacrifice\" to protect lawmakers.\nRepublican Senator Marsha Blackburn said she was \"truly devastated\" by the news.\nMuriel Bowser, the Democratic mayor of the district of Columbia, paid tribute to Sicknick in a tweet.\nMeanwhile, Senator Ted Cruz has faced a backlash after tweeting that Sicknick was \"a true hero\".\nMr Cruz, a loyal ally of the president, led the campaign in the Senate against certifying President-elect Joe Biden's election win.\nSerious questions are being asked about how such a massive security breach was able to happen at the heart of US government.\nThe chief of the US Capitol Police, Steven Sund, initially defended his force, but resigned soon after.

The risk here is whether such brands might cannibalise M&S branded products,\" he added.\nEmily Salter, retail analyst at GlobalData, said M&S was \"paying the cost for its inability to adapt fast enough to changing shopping habits\". \n\"M&S's recovery is slow versus other apparel players, as it continues to be hurt by an online platform unable to make up for lost store sales,\" she added.\nShe saw little point in a potential purchase of Jaeger, as it would be \"costly to turn around and do little to boost the retailer's fortunes\". \nHowever, she said M&S's focus on value in food had \"started to pay off, with decent sales growth, especially considering dampened footfall on High Streets\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The coronavirus vaccine rollout is a national challenge requiring an unprecedented effort - involving the armed forces - Boris Johnson says.\nThe PM confirmed almost 1.5 million people in the UK have now received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine.\nMore than 1,000 GP-led sites in England will be able to offer a total of \"hundreds of thousands\" of jabs each day by 15 January, he said.\nThe Army will use \"battle preparation techniques\" to help achieve that goal.\nIt came as a further 1,162 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported on Thursday - the second consecutive day of more than 1,000 recorded fatalities - and 52,618 new cases.\nAnd as Simon Stevens, head of the NHS in England, warned 10,000 patients with Covid had been admitted to hospital since Christmas Day.\nSpeaking at a Downing Street news conference, Mr Johnson said there would likely be \"lumpiness and bumpiness\" in the rollout of vaccines.\nHe said: \"Let's be clear, this is a national challenge on a scale like nothing we've seen before and it will require an unprecedented national effort.\n\"Of course, there will be difficulties, appointments will be changed but... the Army is working hand in glove with the NHS and local councils to set up our vaccine network and using battle preparation techniques to help us keep up the pace.\" \nAlongside GPs, there will be 223 hospital sites and seven \"giant vaccination centres\" - as well as an initial 200 community pharmacies - offering jabs, Mr Johnson said.\nEveryone will have a vaccination centre within 10 miles of their home, he added, with a \"full vaccination deployment plan\" to be published on Monday.\nHe also said there would be a national booking system for vaccinations - but did not give any more details.\nBrigadier Phil Prosser, commander of military support to the vaccine delivery programme, told the news conference his team was \"embedded\" with the NHS.\nHe said his \"day job\" is to deliver combat supplies to UK forces in time of war, \"at speed in the most arduous and challenging conditions\".\nThe government has set a target to offer vaccination slots to 15 million in the top four priority groups - including all over-80s - by 15 February.\nAnd Mr Johnson said that, with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine available, he could pledge one of those groups - care home residents - would all receive their jab by the end of January.\nThe widespread rollout of the vaccine has begun in earnest with the first doses delivered during the day to family doctors for distribution.\nBut there were concerns from some GPs over supplies, as Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the levels of vaccine supply was the \"rate-limiting\" factor as jabs would be delivered as quickly as stock is available.\nIt comes as some hospitals in England are at risk of becoming Covid-only sites, with rising admissions for the virus forcing trusts to cut back on other services.\nThe latest NHS statistics also show that there were 30,370 patients with Covid in UK hospitals on Tuesday, a much higher figure than the first peak in the spring of 2020.\nHospital leaders have warned medics are becoming increasingly stretched with \"untrained staff\" used to fill gaps.\nAt 20:00 GMT, people in some streets stepped out onto doorsteps to clap for the heroes of the pandemic, following a weekly initiative which gained popularity during the UK's first lockdown.\nHowever, Thursday's clap for heroes was more muted than those seen last year, perhaps reflecting criticism the initiative had become politicised.\nLots of detail has been given about how the NHS - working hand-in-hand with the military - will be able to deliver the vaccines.\nThere will be more local vaccination centres, hospital hubs and even mass vaccination at sports stadiums.\nThousands of extra vaccinators have already been trained - and thousands more are waiting in the wings.\nBut the biggest hurdle the UK faces is vaccine supply.\nIf it is not available, it cannot be put in arms no matter how good the vaccination network is.\nIn the long-term, supply is not likely to be a problem - but in the coming weeks it could be tight.\nThere is enough vaccine in the country to offer all those at highest risk a jab by mid-February.\nBut it is not yet all ready for the NHS to use, either because the final safety checks have not been done or the vaccine has not been put into vials.\nThe former depends on lab work by the medicines regulator, while the latter is the job of a plant in Wrexham.\nEach stage takes some time. The target is achievable, but a lot has to go right.\nSir Simon Stevens said there were 50% more coronavirus patients in England's hospitals now compared to the peak last April, affecting every region across the country.\nHe said: \"That number is accelerating very, very rapidly... the pressures are real and they are growing.\"\nIn Northern Ireland, the Belfast Health Trust has said it has no other option but to cancel all of its urgent cancer surgery amid \"highly significant\" demand for bed space.\nThe cancelled operations will affect those patients for whom surgery could impact recovery and even survival, the trust said.\nIn one positive development for hospitals, two more life-saving drugs that can cut deaths by a quarter in patients who are sickest with Covid have been cleared for widespread use, with immediate effect.\nThe anti-inflammatory medications, given via a drip, save an extra life for every 12 treated, researchers said, following NHS trials.\nElsewhere, the UK has implemented restrictions on travellers to England from countries near South Africa to stop the spread of the South African Covid variant.\nMeanwhile, Mr Johnson and Sir Simon were asked about persistent social media claims that coronavirus does not exist - and that reports of packed hospital wards of people being treated are just a myth. \nSir Simon said that such misinformation was an \"insult\" to hard-working critical care staff.\n\"There is nothing more demoralising than having that kind of nonsense spouted when it is most obviously untrue,\" he said."

      "text": "The son of a man with pancreatic cancer has said the last-minute cancellation of his surgery has been \"devastating\".\nJodie Kane said his father Vincent was due to have his operation on Friday.\nHowever, that procedure was cancelled by the Belfast Health Trust on Tuesday as the worsening coronavirus crisis increases the pressure on hospitals.\nThe trust apologised, saying it had faced an 80% rise in the number of patients with Covid-19 admitted to hospitals since Christmas Day.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show, Jodie said that there was now \"no guarantee\" his 68-year-old father would get the treatment.\n\"To be told we had the chance of a very successful surgery on offer and then to have it taken away at the last minute is pretty devastating,\" he said.\n\"Even the surgeon himself said they would be concerned if it was to go on more than four weeks.\n\"There is an uncertainty hanging over us now that we don't know when he'll actually get that surgery or what the impact on his health is going to be.\"\nVincent, from Newtownards, County Down, did not receive treatment for some of his other symptoms as it was planned that the surgery would help with those.\n\"Because they were hoping to get him straight into surgery he hasn't had the blockage in his gall bladder addressed so he's jaundiced, he's covered in a rash, can't sleep, he's lost a lot of weight,\" Jodie said.\n\"Undoubtedly there are people worse off than us out there but it is still a critical illness that he has got and it is one that we don't have an end in sight for, in terms of treatment.\n\"There must be a way of helping all those in need, or I suppose if you were being really honest about it those who stand the best chance of surviving - making the decisions for the benefit of them.\n\"There's no guarantee that in six weeks' time surgery is going to be an option because who knows what's going to happen with Covid?\"\nJodie called on those who were breaking Covid-19 regulations to think about the the \"direct and indirect impacts\" of their actions.\n\"We've every sympathy for anyone who has a loved one who needs [intensive] care because of Covid but cancer and Covid are both life-and-death situations.\n\"We can minimise the risks of one of them as a collective society just by taking the necessary precautions.\n\"It could be someone they love or their neighbour or someone in their community that's in the same situation as us in the very near future.\"\nFlo McClements, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in December, found out on Tuesday that her surgery - scheduled for Thursday - had been cancelled by the Belfast Health Trust.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Foyle, her son Gregg said the pressure was \"mounting day by day\" on the the 72-year-old from Ballymoney, County Antrim.\n\"She had waited all through Christmas for the date and due to the Covid-19 restrictions we as a family had stayed away from her,\" he added.\n\"We left her on her own with my dad just to make sure she didn't catch Covid and risk the operation.\n\"When you get the date you like to think it's the next step to recovery but unfortunately that didn't happen.\"\nGregg said his mother was \"putting on a brave face\" but it was difficult for the family to not be with her in person during what was a difficult time.\n\"That's actually the hardest part that we can't go up and have a cup of tea with her or give her a hug to make her feel a bit better even for a few minutes.\"\nThe Belfast Health Trust said it \"would like to sincerely apologise\" to those affected by the postponement of surgeries.\nIt said the decision was taken to reduce the number of ill patients on wards that would be more at risk from the virus than others.\n\"This was an incredibly difficult decision to make and we did not take it without considering all the information available to us,\" said the trust.\n\"We do not underestimate the anxiety and distress this causes the patients and families affected and we deeply regret this.\nIt said it would do \"everything in our power\" to reschedule their operations \"as soon as possible\"."

      "tags": "Washington DC,US Capitol stormed,US election 2020,Donald Trump,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US President Donald Trump's opponents in the two houses of Congress have called for him to be removed from office after the violent invasion of the Capitol by a mob of his supporters.\nDemocratic Senator Chuck Schumer said Mr Trump should be removed immediately. If he is not, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says he could be impeached. \nRemoval would need Republican support and only a few have so far backed it.\nIn a video speech, Mr Trump said he was committed to an \"orderly\" transition.\nThe president said a new administration would be inaugurated on 20 January, and called for \"healing and reconciliation\". \nHe also said he was \"outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem\" on Wednesday and that \"tempers must be cooled and calm restored\". The video was shared on his Twitter account, which was reactivated on Thursday after being suspended following the Capitol riot.\nAt least four people died during the unrest, and 68 have now been arrested.\nThe actions of the police have come under scrutiny, with officers facing criticism for failing to stop the rioters breaking in.\nThe official responsible for security in the House of Representatives, the sergeant at arms, has resigned. Reports say US Capitol Police (USCP) chief Steven Sund is also resigning, effective 16 January, following calls from Ms Pelosi. \nMr Schumer has called for his counterpart in the Senate to be sacked.\nTransport Secretary Elaine Chao is the latest member of the Trump administration to quit in protest over the riots. Several lower-level officials have also resigned. \nPresident-elect Joe Biden said: \"Nobody could tell me that if it was a group of Black Lives Matter protesters yesterday they wouldn't have been treated very differently than the thugs that stormed the Capitol.\"\nA growing number have called for Mr Trump to be removed as president. Most of them are from Mr Biden's Democratic Party but a few Republicans have joined in.\n\"This president should not hold office one day longer,\" said Mr Schumer, who will lead the Democratic majority in the Senate when it begins its new session later this month. \nHe urged Mr Trump's cabinet to remove him from office using the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness.\nIt would require Vice-President Mike Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment - something they have so far seemed unlikely to do.\nMs Pelosi described Mr Trump as \"a very dangerous person\" and said: \"This is an emergency of the highest magnitude.\"\nShe left open the option of impeachment if Mr Trump's colleagues did not start 25th Amendment proceedings. \nHowever, the Democrats would need to rely on the support of Republicans to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict Mr Trump under the articles of impeachment in the constitution, and would be unlikely to get those numbers.\nCongressman Adam Kinzinger from Illinois was one of the first Republicans to call for use of the 25th Amendment, saying: \"Fires stoked by the president finally leapt out of the pan.\"\nThe Republican governors of Maryland and Vermont have also called for Mr Trump to be removed from office. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee have said that Mr Trump's actions meet the amendment's requirements.\nSeparately, both the House and the Senate have adjourned until after Mr Biden is sworn in on 20 January. \nBoth houses would have to be recalled in order to start impeachment proceedings.\nSeveral Trump administration officials have now resigned over the riots - Elaine Chao is the most high-profile.\nMs Chao, who has served through the whole presidency and is married to the top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, said the events had \"deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside\".\nOthers to quit include special envoy Mick Mulvaney, a senior national security official, and the chief of staff to First Lady Melania Trump. A State Department adviser was also sacked after calling Mr Trump \"unfit for office\" in a tweet.\nThe president is also facing new restrictions on his use of social media. Facebook, which owns Instagram, has suspended him from both platforms at least until he leaves office and possibly indefinitely.\nTwitter suspended his account for 12 hours. \nThe 25th Amendment, enacted in 1967, was designed to provide a more detailed process for the succession of presidential power. The writers envisioned national catastrophes or a medically incapacitated president as situations the amendment could address.\nIt was not contemplated, at least initially, as a means to drag a president who is viewed as a threat to the nation from office.\nThat, however, is exactly what many Democrats - including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - are suggesting should happen to Donald Trump. It's what one current Republican congressman, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, is calling for and what one of Trump's former White House chiefs of staff, John Kelly, said he supported.\nWith just 13 days left in the Trump presidency, the unprecedented step of stripping an unwilling president of power, which requires the consent of the vice-president and a majority of the 15-member presidential cabinet, seems unlikely. But the report that such steps are being contemplated underline the gravity of the current situation.\nDemocrats are also once again talking about impeachment and conviction by the Senate, a process that would take more time but would, as an additional benefit in their minds, prohibit Mr Trump from running for office in the future.\nPolice have been heavily criticised for their response to the violence. \nImages captured inside the Capitol building showed rioters strolling through some of the corridors unimpeded. One man occupied Ms Pelosi's office, putting his feet up on her desk, while another was photographed walking out carrying a lectern.\nWashington police say 68 people have so far been arrested, only one of them from the DC area. \nOne USCP officer has been placed on leave after a woman was shot dead on the floor of the House of Representatives. The woman, who has been named as air force veteran Ashli Babbitt, 35, was part of a group that forced its way into the chamber while it was still in session. \nPolice said three other people - 50-year-old Benjamin Philips from Pennsylvania; 55-year-old Kevin Greeson from Alabama; and 34-year-old Rosanne Boyland from Georgia - died of unspecified \"medical emergencies\". Mr Greeson's family said he died of a heart attack. \nThe FBI is seeking to identify those involved in the rampage. \nThe Department of Justice says those arrested could face charges of seditious conspiracy, as well as rioting and insurrection. \nOne of those detained at the Capitol had a \"military-style automatic weapon and 11 Molotov cocktails (petrol bombs)\", according to the federal attorney for Washington DC. \nOn Thursday, crews began installing a non-scalable 7ft (2m) fence around the Capitol. It will remain in place for at least 30 days. \nMichelle Obama, wife of Mr Trump's presidential predecessor, Barack Obama, released a statement calling attention to the racial disparity in the way different protests were policed.\nShe described Mr Trump as \"an infantile and unpatriotic president\", and said it would be impossible to move on until there was a reckoning with Wednesday's events.\n\"Yesterday made it painfully clear that certain Americans are, in fact, allowed to denigrate the flag and symbols of our nation. They've just got to look the right way,\" she wrote.\nThe New York Times reported, quoting unnamed sources, that Mr Trump was considering granting a pardon to himself in the final days of his presidency. \nThe legality of such a move is untested.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Fully jabbed travellers arriving in the UK from France have to quarantine, because of the Beta variant. \nThe government is concerned jabs may not work as well against the variant. \nFrench authorities say most cases are from the overseas territories of La Reunion and Mayotte, rather than mainland France.\nBeta, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, has some significant genetic changes that experts are studying. It was first identified in South Africa.\nAll viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, constantly mutate into new versions or variants.\nThese tiny genetic changes happen as the virus makes new copies of itself to spread and thrive. \nMost are inconsequential, and a few can even be harmful to the virus's survival, but some variants can make the virus more infectious or threatening to the host - humans. \nSome of the changes Beta has undergone involve the virus's spike protein - the part that gains the virus entry into human cells. It is also the bit that vaccines are designed around, which is why experts are concerned about these particular mutations.\nBeta, along with a few other variants of coronavirus, such as Delta and Alpha, have been labelled \"variants of concern\". These have some worrying changes experts want to keep a very close eye on.\nBeta carries a mutation, called N501Y, which appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread. \nAnother mutation, called E484K, could help the virus dodge a person's immune system, and may affect how well vaccines work. \nThere is no evidence that the South Africa variant causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people.\nAs with the original version, the risk is still highest for elderly people and those with significant underlying health conditions.\nVaccines are designed around original Covid, rather than new variants. \nThere is some evidence they are less effective at stopping Beta infections.\nBut experts say they should still work to stop severe illness. \nEven in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked to provide a better match in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary.\nA trial of a new version of the AstraZeneca vaccine, designed against Beta, has begun in the UK.\nSome of the other Covid vaccines are also being updated. \nThe Beta variant has been identified in more than 50 countries around the world. \nSo far, the UK has recorded just over 1,000 cases of Beta. That's a tiny fraction of all Covid cases. Another variant, called Delta, currently makes up more than 99% of Covid seen in the UK. \nSouth Africa has reported higher cases of Beta.\nWhen it was first identified in the UK, the government recommended surge testing in the community in some regions to help stop the spread. \nA system of foreign travel restrictions has also been introduced to minimise the chance of UK travellers spreading Beta as well as other variants of concern. \nAlthough adults who were fully jabbed in the UK now no longer need to quarantine on return from amber list countries, double vaccinated travellers returning to England and Wales from France will still have to self-isolate for ten days. \nThey will also have to take two PCR tests to ensure they are not infectious. \nUK scientists are tracking variants, including Beta, to learn more and are providing genomic sequencing help to other countries so that they can do the same.

      "tags": "Social media,US Capitol stormed,Twitter,Donald Trump",
      "text": "US President Donald Trump's Twitter account is \"permanently suspended... due to the risk of further incitement of violence\", the company says. \nTwitter said the decision was made \"after close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account\".\nIt comes amid a Big Tech purge of the online platforms used by Mr Trump and his supporters.\nSome lawmakers and celebrities have been calling for years on Twitter to ban Mr Trump.\u00a0\nFormer First Lady Michelle Obama tweeted on Thursday that the Silicon Valley giants should stop enabling Mr Trump's \"monstrous behaviour\" and permanently expel him.\nMr Trump was locked out of his account for 12 hours on Wednesday after he called the people who stormed the US Capitol \"patriots\".\nHundreds of his supporters entered the complex as the US Congress attempted to certify Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election. The ensuing violence led to the deaths of four civilians and a police officer.\nTwitter warned then that it would ban Mr Trump \"permanently\" if he breached the platform's rules again.\nAfter being allowed back on Twitter, Mr Trump posted two tweets on Friday that the company cited as the final straws.\nIn one, he wrote: \"The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!\"\nTwitter said this tweet \"is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an 'orderly transition'\".\nIn the next, the president tweeted: \"To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.\"\nTwitter said this was \"being received by a number of his supporters as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate\".\nTwitter said both of these tweets were \"in violation of the Glorification of Violence Policy\".\nAfter Twitter had banned his @realDonaldTrump account, Mr Trump tweeted from the US president's official @Potus account suggesting he would \"look at the possibilities of building out our own platform in the future\" and railing against Twitter. \nBut the tweets were removed from the platform as soon as they were posted.\nReacting to the ban, Trump 2020 campaign adviser Jason Miller tweeted: \"Disgusting... if you don't think they're coming for you next, you're wrong.\" \nEarlier on Friday, Twitter permanently banned the accounts of two Trump loyalists: former national security adviser Michael Flynn and attorney Sidney Powell.\nMeanwhile, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh deactivated his Twitter account shortly after they were banned.\nLater in the day, Google suspended Parler - a self-styled \"free speech\" rival to Twitter that is increasingly popular with Trump supporters - from its online store. \n\"We're aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the US,\" said Google.\nOn Thursday, Facebook said it had suspended Mr Trump \"indefinitely\". The popular gaming platform Twitch also placed an indefinite ban on the outgoing president's channel, which he has used for rally broadcasts. So has Snapchat.\nTwo online Trump memorabilia stores were closed this week by e-commerce company Shopify. On Friday, Reddit banned its \"donaldtrump\" forum for the president's supporters.\nMr Trump used Twitter to insult adversaries, cheer allies, fire officials, deny \"fake news\" and vent grievances, often using all capital letters and exclamation marks to underline his point.\nThough critics said the posts were a torrent of misinformation, the medium helped him get around media filters and instantly connect with nearly 89 million followers.\nHis tweets were also known for the occasional spelling error, and he sometimes left followers guessing with apparent mis-types, such as when he posted, \"Despite the constant negative press covfefe\".\nThe Department of Justice said in 2017 that Mr Trump's tweets were \"official statements of the President of the United States\".\nDonald Trump loves being on Twitter, it's his primary way of getting his message out. \nHe likes the short format, he likes his ability to reach tens of millions of people at the click of a button - bypassing the media. \nThe fact that Twitter's decision was made 48 hours after the rioting at the Capitol on Wednesday shows that this was not an easy move for the social media giant. \nThe platform has benefited hugely from Mr Trump's participation, it has been the place to go to hear the latest from the most powerful man in the world. \nBut Twitter has acted for a number of reasons. It says it's because of the likelihood of him inciting violence in the future. \nBut it's also because his power is very quickly slipping away. He is now being treated like an ordinary member of the public. \nAnd as mere mortal, repeatedly spreading disinformation, fake news and inciting violence will get you thrown off mainstream social media platforms. \nFor those who say this violates free speech enshrined in the First Amendment of the US Constitution? Big Tech's argument is that they are private companies, not state actors. So, they are free to moderate their platforms as they see fit.\nThe big question now is, can Trumpism survive without the backing of mainstream media? Or will it simply slip into the shadows of the internet?\nRead more from James\nTwitter wrote in a blog post on Friday: \"In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result in this very course of action. \n\"Our public interest framework exists to enable the public to hear from elected officials and world leaders directly. It is built on a principle that the people have a right to hold power to account in the open.\"\nIt added: \"However, we made it clear going back years that these accounts are not above our rules and cannot use Twitter to incite violence. We will continue to be transparent around our policies and their enforcement.\"\nSome 350 Twitter employees had signed a letter this week to the company chief executive, Jack Dorsey, asking him to ban the president in the wake of the Capitol riot.\nThe letter said: \"Despite our efforts to serve the public conversation, as Trump's megaphone, we helped fuel the deadly events of January 6th.\"\nTwitter first took action against Mr Trump\u00a0in May 2020 appending fact-checks to tweets he sent claiming postal votes were fraudulent.\nLater that same week it posted a warning label when the president threatened to send in the military to quell Black Lives Matter protests as he added, \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts\".\nTwitter used these fact-checks and warning labels increasingly throughout the year for Trump tweets about coronavirus and the presidential election, culminating in Friday's ban."

      "tags": "Alok Sharma,COP26,Climate change,Kwasi Kwarteng",
      "text": "Alok Sharma is to leave his position as business secretary to focus full-time on his role as president of the UN COP26 climate conference in November.\nThe Glasgow event is expected to be the biggest summit the UK has ever hosted.\nMr Sharma, who will remain in the cabinet, said he was \"delighted to have been asked by the PM to dedicate all my energies\" to the position.\nKwasi Kwarteng replaces him as business secretary while Anne-Marie Trevelyan becomes the new energy minister.\nThe government says a successful summit will be critical if the UK wants to meet the objectives set out by the Paris Agreement and reduce global emissions.\nThe event had originally been scheduled for November 2020 but was delayed by a year due to Covid-19.\nThe BBC's political correspondent Jessica Parker said the decision to move Alok Sharma wasn't a surprise and would be seen as a recognition of the need to free him up to do more of the crucial diplomatic leg-work required.\nSome MPs had previously warned that Mr Sharma lacked the \"bandwidth\" to head the conference alongside his cabinet job, especially given the strains on business due to the pandemic. \nIn his new role, which is based in the Cabinet Office, Mr Sharma's will remain a member of Boris Johnson's top team but be focused solely on coordinating global action to tackle climate change\nBoris Johnson chose Mr Sharma to head the event after ex-minister Claire O'Neill was ousted from the position in the summer of 2019. \nShe later condemned what she called broken promises and backsliding on climate commitments.\nFormer Conservative PM David Cameron turned down the chance to head the conference and ex-Foreign Secretary Lord Hague was also involved in discussions. \nMr Sharma's move will be welcomed by climate campaigners, who worried he was over-stretched running a frantically busy department while also orchestrating the most important climate meeting on Earth.\nMany of these summits - known as COPs - yielded little because the leadership was poor. \nThe French produced a triumphant agreement in the 2015 Paris COP after mustering the mighty force of French diplomacy.\nMr Sharma is reported to accept that he now needs to concentrate full time on the challenge.\nHe will need subtle diplomatic skills, a mastery of detail and the stamina of an ox as he attempts to corral world leaders into agreement on curbing emissions faster. He'll also need 100% support from the PM.\nThe greatest obstacle to action - Donald Trump - will soon disappear from the scene, and with China making bold promises, the COP has potential. \nBut politicians have been so slow to act that some key tipping points in the climate might already have been breached.\nReflecting on his new role, Mr Sharma said: \"The biggest challenge of our time is climate change and we need to work together to deliver a cleaner, greener world and build back better for present and future generations.\n\"Through the UK's Presidency of COP26 we have a unique opportunity, working with friends and partners around the world, to deliver on this goal.\"\nRichard Black, senior associate at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) said: \"Allowing Alok Sharma to focus full-time on his COP26 role is a sensible decision, not least as it signals the government's commitment to ensuring that the summit is a success.\n\"With the election of Joe Biden as the next US President and China's recent carbon neutrality pledge, the diplomatic opportunities have opened up for more ambitious action on climate change. Mr Sharma's job will be to seize them.\" \nAnd ex-cabinet minister Amber Rudd, who led the UK delegation at the Paris climate change conference, said the move showed the government \"recognises the importance and opportunity for a global agreement this year\".\nResponding to his new appointment, Mr Kwarteng said he was \"thrilled\" and pledged to help businesses through this period of \"extremely challenging circumstances\". \nThe Spelthorne MP, who entered Parliament in 2010, has been energy minister since July 2019. \nLabour's shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said Mr Kwarteng had \"a massive task\" in providing business with \"a plan to help them through this year, not the inadequate sticking plaster measures we have seen\". \nHe welcomed the decision to make Mr Sharma's COP role full time.\n\"It's absolutely crucial that the full political, diplomatic and strategic resources of government are now directed to the most ambitious outcome at Glasgow, which is a 1.5 degree deal.\""

Exams are the fairest way of assessing what learners know and understand and we would like to see as many pupils as possible take a form of exam in the summer,\" said Dr Hyde.\nIndependent schools often offer a mix of IGCSEs and GCSEs for different subjects, although IGCSEs do not count towards school league tables.\nThe qualifications - International GCSEs - are offered by Cambridge Assessment and Pearson and are taken in other countries as well as the UK. Both boards say they are planning to go ahead with exam papers for UK schools this summer.\nIGCSEs were not included in the cancellation of exams announced by England's Department for Education and it will be up to individual schools to decide whether to continue with them.\nJulie McCullloch of the ASCL head teachers' union said: \"It creates another inconsistency, but none of this is easy.\"\nShe said it created an \"odd situation\" when GCSEs were cancelled but IGCSEs were going ahead, but she recognised that an international qualification could need a common approach across different countries.\nWith the latest lockdown and most pupils studying at home, GCSEs and A-levels have been cancelled in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIn England, the exams watchdog Ofqual will launch a consultation next week on a replacement way of deciding grades - but Ofqual does not regulate IGCSEs and they will not be part of the watchdog's proposals."

      "text": "Stormont ministers have clashed over the planned school transfer test scheduled for next month.\nSinn F\u00e9in, SDLP and Alliance ministers argued the test run by the Association for Quality Education (AQE) should not go ahead due to the Covid-19 crisis.\nDUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster, who chaired the meeting, rejected a call to put it to a vote.\nIt was agreed that Education Minister Peter Weir would present a paper on the issue at a future meeting.\nThe exchanges at the executive have been described as \"tense\" by some observers.\nSpeaking on Friday evening, Mrs Foster said it was \"about parental choice\" and if parents wished to pursue academic selection, it was \"a legal route\". \nShe said \"using Covid as an excuse\" to try and get rid of academic selection, was \"very, very wrong\". \nMrs Foster said it was important to prevent the misuse of the executive's any-other-business function, and \"that is why today's vote could not happen\". \n\"Other parties wanted it to happen,\" she said.\n\"If you allowed that to happen, then any majority of ministers could come along, and raise any sort of issue without having looked at the policy implications, or the procedures.\"\nThe attempt during the meeting at Stormont to halt the test was opposed by DUP ministers, who accused others of using the coronavirus crisis to attack grammar schools which use it.\nThe ministers who wanted the test to be cancelled insisted their position was not linked to the wider debate about academic selection in Northern Ireland.\nThe issue was raised during the any-other-business section of the meeting and First Minister Mrs Foster said that Stormont rules prevented a vote on substantive matters discussed during that time.\nLater Sinn F\u00e9in minister Deirdre Hargey said: \"Unfortunately there was a decision taken today by some not to allow a vote to take place on this issue. \n\"I feel there would have been parties that would have clearly backed my position and understand the concerns around this.  \n\"I do see that some of the grammar schools under AQE have moved, in not going ahead with academic selection. I commend the leadership that they have shown. I hope that others can follow in that leadership.\"\nMeanwhile, four grammar schools, Royal School Dungannon, Belfast Royal Academy, Victoria College and Campbell College have said they will not be using the AQE test to admit pupils this year. \nHowever Campbell College said it is obliged to host an AQE test if it goes ahead.\nStrabane Academy had already announced on Wednesday that it would not facilitate the additional test and would instead apply contingency criteria.\nThere has been controversy throughout this week about whether the transfer test should go ahead as lockdown restrictions tightened in Northern Ireland.\nIt is used by the majority of Northern Ireland grammar schools to select pupils.\nThe first in a series of tests was due to take place on Saturday but on Tuesday the exam providers said that would not happen.\nOne provider cancelled its test while another - the AQE - said it was moving its test to a single sitting in February.\nOn Friday, three of the 34 schools that normally use the test said they would not be proceeding with it this year.\nRoyal School Dungannon (RSD) in County Tyrone, one of Northern Ireland's oldest grammar schools, told parents of primary seven pupils in the area that its governers had \"unanimously decided\" against using the test.\nThe school was established in 1614 and has about 650 pupils.\nIn its letter to parents, the school said it still supported the principle of academic selection but would use its \"contingency admissions criteria\" for admitting pupils to year eight in September.\n\"Our most important consideration was giving certainty to P7 pupils and families during the Covid-19 public health crisis,\" said the school.\n\"The AQE test will therefore not take place at RSD on 27 February.\"\nIt added: \"We realise that the children have worked hard in preparing for the tests and that this is not how any of us would have wanted the transfer process to have worked this year.\"\nIt said its decision was \"in the best interests of the children's immediate welfare and their longer term prospects of success\".\nThe school said its contingency admissions criteria would soon be available on its website.\nSome grammar schools have already published criteria for how they would admit pupils if the transfer test does not take place.\nTwo Belfast schools have also pulled out of using the test.\nVictoria College said it \"did not consider it appropriate\" to run academic selection this year in the interests of the \"safety, health and wellbeing of parents, pupils and staff\".\n\"We understand fully that this is an emotive and divisive issue and that whilst this news will be welcomed by some it will cause anxiety for others,\" a letter from the school board read.\nThe school said it would review its contingency admissions criteria and publish it \"in due course\".\nBelfast Royal Academy has also decided against using the test this year, saying it hoped the move would \"alleviate any further anxiety\" for children and their parents.\nThe school said it would publish its contingency admissions criteria on Monday."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A revived initiative to applaud the heroes of the pandemic has returned - but much more quietly than last year.\nIt comes after the founder of Clap for Carers distanced herself from its return after facing online abuse.\nAnnemarie Plas wanted to bring back the weekly applause under a new name of Clap for Heroes to lift spirits in the new lockdown but it fell a little flat.\nSome health workers have said they would rather people stay at home and wear a mask than clap for them.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he participated at 20:00 GMT on Thursday, but clapping \"isn't enough\".\n\"They need to be paid properly and given the respect they deserve,\" he tweeted., of the health workers.\nThe idea of clapping and banging pots from doorsteps originally began as a one-off to support NHS staff on 26 March - three days after the UK went into lockdown for the first time.\nAfter proving popular it was expanded to cover all key workers and continued every Thursday for 10 weeks last year, with millions of people across the UK taking part.\nMembers of the Royal Family and politicians including Prime Minister Boris Johnson also joined in with the show of support.\nHowever, the event faced criticism for becoming politicised, with some suggesting the NHS would benefit more from extra funding than applause. \nThursday's newly-revived event drew fewer supporters than previously. \nPeople in some streets stood on doorsteps and leaned out windows to clap for the pandemic's heroes, and landmarks in London were illuminated blue for the occasion - but reports suggested the applause was noticeably quieter than last year.\nOn Wednesday, Ms Plas, a 36-year-old mother-of-one, announced the return of the initiative, saying she hoped to \"lift the spirit of all of us\" including \"all who are pushing through this difficult time\".\nBut some NHS workers were less than enthusiastic. Ami Jones, an intensive care consultant from Wales, tweeted: \"No thanks. I'd rather you obey the rules, stay at home, wear masks and wash your hands.\"\nAnd palliative care doctor Rachel Clarke said: \"Please don't clap us. Just wear a mask, wash your hands and respect lockdown.\"\nIn a tweet posted hours before the weekly clap was due to return, Ms Plas, a Dutch national living in south London, said she had been targeted with personal abuse and threats against her and her family by \"a hateful few\" on social media.\n\"I have no political agenda, I am not employed by the government, I do not work in PR, I am just an average mum at home trying to cope with the lockdown situation,\" she said, in a statement.\nShe said the newly revived clap could and should still happen at 20:00 GMT.\n\"It's up to each person to decide how relevant or worthwhile they feel it is to participate,\" she said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The spread of Covid in London is \"out of control\" according to Sadiq Khan, who has declared a \"major incident\". \nThe coronavirus infection rate in London has exceeded 1,000 per 100,000 people, based on the latest figures from Public Health England.\nHowever, the Office for National Statistics recently estimated as many as one in 30 Londoners has coronavirus.\nMr Khan told BBC political reporter Karl Mercer that the figure is as high as one in 20 in some parts of London.\nMajor incidents have previously been called for the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017 and the terror attacks at Westminster Bridge and London Bridge.\nA major incident is any emergency that requires the implementation of special arrangements by one or all of the emergency services, the NHS or the local authority.\nIt means the emergency services and hospitals cannot guarantee their normal level of response.\nCurrently, there are more than 7,000 people in hospital with Covid-19, the mayor said.\nThis is a 35% increase compared to last April's peak of the pandemic, he added.\nDr Samantha Batt-Rawden, an ICU registrar and President of the Doctors' Association UK, tweeted: \"We tried. We really tried. NHS staff pleaded with people that Christmas is not worth it. Now one in 30 people in London have Covid and ICUs are overwhelmed. My heart is broken.\"\nAn analysis of Public Health England figures show in the week to 3 January, the number of cases rose across all of the London's boroughs compared with the previous week, with 17 individually recording more than 1,000 cases per 100,000 people.\nTesting increased in parts of the city after a drop over the Christmas period but positivity was high among people taking lab-based tests - suggesting more testing is needed to find undiagnosed cases in the community.\nIn the past week, many parts of the capital saw a rise in deaths where a person had tested positive for coronavirus in the previous 28 days - with some areas recording more than double the number of deaths compared with the previous week. \nHowever, reporting over the Christmas period may have affected this.\nOut of the 18 acute hospital trusts in London providing figures to the government, all of them recorded having more beds being filled by coronavirus patients than in the previous week.\nBarts NHS Health, one of London's largest trusts, saw a 30% increase in coronavirus patients between 29 December and 5 January, to 830.\nThe mayor of London's announcement comes after the counties of Sussex and Surrey declared similar major incidents on Thursday.\nHe said the London Ambulance Service was currently taking up to 8,000 emergency calls a day, compared to 5,500 on a typical busy day.\nThe London Fire Brigade said more than 100 firefighters had been drafted in to drive ambulances to help cope with the demand.\nEvery frontline agency involved in protecting the public has a legal duty to prepare for emergencies by devising and testing major incident plans.\nThese public bodies declare a major incident when the situation they're confronting is so big or terrible that it's not only likely to cause serious harm, but it will also compromise their ability to respond effectively. \nIn general terms, that means public bodies can legally stop delivering some everyday services, so that their personnel, attention and resources can be diverted to the emergency confronting them. \nAt other times, the plans will lead to the military sending soldiers to aid the civilian effort, as we have seen already during the pandemic. \nPrevious major incidents include the Grenfell Tower disaster in London, the Salisbury Novichok poisonings and the 2017 terrorism attacks.\nLondon's regional director for Public Health England Kevin Fenton said the current wave of coronavirus was \"the biggest threat\" the capital has faced in this pandemic to date.\nProf Fenton urged Londoners to \"cut contacts\" and \"reduce movements\".\nHe added: \"The emergence of the new variant means we are setting record case rates at almost double the national average, with at least one in 30 people now thought to be carrying the virus.\n\"We know this will sadly lead to large numbers of deaths, so strong and immediate action is needed.\"\nMr Khan is warning that London is \"at crisis point\".\n\"If we do not take immediate action now, our NHS could be overwhelmed and more people will die,\" he said.\n\"Londoners continue to make huge sacrifices and I am today imploring them to please stay at home unless it is absolutely necessary for you to leave. Stay at home to protect yourself, your family, friends and other Londoners and to protect our NHS.\"\nHe said he had written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking for more financial support for Londoners who need to self-isolate and are unable to work, and for daily vaccination data.\nMr Khan also called for the closure of places of worship and for face masks to be worn routinely outside the home, including in crowded places and supermarket queues, in a bid to curb case numbers.\nBBC London political correspondent Karl Mercer\nThe mayor of London was in a sombre mood when I spoke to him earlier this afternoon. One in 20 Londoners in some areas now has Covid, and there is a real fear that hospitals will simply be overwhelmed in the next two weeks. \nDeclaring a major incident is a real indication of the levels of concern felt not just at City Hall but across London's emergency services and the NHS. \nMore Londoners are now in hospital with coronavirus than at the peak of the first wave last April - and those numbers are growing by more than 800 every day.\nIt's believed the last mayor to declare a London-wide major incident was Boris Johnson in response to the 2011 riots. \nThe coming days will be some of the most challenging in the city's recent history.\nKatie Sanderson, a junior doctor working in London, said she is worried how long medical staff can cope with the surge of patients. \n\"[Staff] are working on wards and spending long amounts of time with patients who need high-intensive oxygen therapy,\" she said.\n\"It is technically challenging and the emotional burden is enormous. I see it in a flatness in their demeanour, like we've all got used to doing things which before were totally inconceivable.\"\nGeorgia Gould, chair of London Councils, described London's rising coronavirus rate as \"dangerous\".\nShe added: \"One in 30 Londoners now has Covid. This is why public services across London are urging all Londoners to please stay at home except for absolutely essential shopping and exercise.\n\"This is a dark and difficult time for our city but there is light at end of the tunnel with the vaccine rollout. We are asking Londoners to come together one last time to stop the spread - lives really do depend on it.\"\nEarlier this week as the prime minister introduced an England-wide lockdown, the Met Police said officers were going to be \"more inquisitive\" towards Londoners seen outside.\nThe Met handed out 1,761 fines for breaches of coronavirus laws between 27 March and 20 December.\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said the major incident was a \"stark reminder\" of the point London is at in the pandemic.\nHe said: \"These rule-breakers cannot continue to feign ignorance of the risk that this virus poses or listen to the false information and lies that some promote downplaying the dangers. \n\"Every time the virus spreads it increases the risk of someone needlessly losing their life.\"\nIn response to Mr Khan's announcement the government said the NHS is continuing to \"face a huge challenge\"\nA spokeswoman added: \"It is absolutely paramount people in London, and the rest of the country, follow the rules and stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives.\n\"We are working closely with NHS England to support hospitals in the capital, including additional bed capacity at the London Nightingale. \n\"Financial support is in place for workers who need to self-isolate - including a \u00a3500 payment for those on the lowest incomes who have been contacted by NHS Test and Trace.\"\nFor more London news follow on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel.\nHave any of the issues raised in this article had an impact on you?

      "tags": "Teaching,Wales education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All schools and colleges will move to online learning until 18 January in Wales.\nSome schools had been due to open on Wednesday and others by 11 January with decisions made by local authorities.\nEducation Minister Kirsty Williams said the decision had been taken jointly with the Welsh Local Government Association and Colegau Cymru.\nTeaching unions had called for a delayed start to term amid concerns about the coronavirus variant.\nHowever, the timing of the decision has been criticised, with some claiming it left little time for parents and schools to make plans.\nMs Williams said: \"As a government we will use the next two weeks to continue to work with local authorities, schools and colleges to best plan for the rest of term.\n\"This is the best way to ensure that parents, staff and learners can be confident in the return to face to face learning, based on the latest evidence and information.\"\nThe announcement comes as the UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre increased the Covid threat level to five - its highest level.\nLevel five warns of a \"material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed\", according to the UK government's website.\nWales has been under \"stay-at-home\" lockdown restrictions since 20 December after a rise in Covid-19 cases, with more than 31,000 cases in the two weeks over the Christmas period.\nA \"flexible\" agreement on reopening schools had been put in place before Christmas with the decision in the hands of local authorities.\nHowever, that decision has changed following the latest announcement.\nChildren's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said: \"It continues to be a difficult situation for children and young people.\n\"Children certainly would rather be in school, and are concerned about uncertainty, but it is clear we are living in difficult times,\" she said.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford tweeted to say moving classes online was the \"best way to help reduce the spread of this deadly virus\".\nEithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru, said the decision made sense but the plan to resume face-to-face education after 18 January should be kept under review and \"not set in stone\".\nLaura Doel, director of the head teachers' union, NAHT Cymru, said the decision brought \"much-needed clarity\". \n\"The Welsh Government has repeatedly said it wants to prioritise education, in that case it must also prioritise safety in schools and the communities schools serve,\" she said.\n\"Work should be undertaken with school leaders and Public Health Wales to establish and agree new Covid-related safety measures in schools during the temporary restriction for implementation in good time prior to lifting restrictions.\"\nClaire Jones, deputy head teacher at Crickhowell High School, Powys, said she was \"really optimistic that blended learning is a way forward\" although \"it's not the ideal\".\nConservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said: \"With many children having been due to begin a staggered return to school from Wednesday onwards, this news has come late for them and for their parents.\"\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said the decision had left \"little or no time for parents and teachers to adapt to the changing circumstances\".\n\"It is unclear what the Welsh Government expects will change in just two weeks' time and so we risk being in the same position yet again with yet more confusion in a fortnight,\" she said.\nWales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas, and nine of the UK's ten most infected counties.\nIt went into a level four national lockdown on 20 December.\nHowever, the latest available data shows England's Covid case rate has risen above Wales for the first time in about a month - with Gwynedd having the lowest infection rate in the UK.\nThis delay until 18 January is something the unions had been calling for but to decide on the Monday before some schools are about to go back on the Wednesday is quite late in the day.\nAnd that's something the opposition parties have picked up on.\nWith all the uncertainty that we are facing over how this new variant will play out and the condition, and the pressure that's on the NHS, I wouldn't put any money necessarily on face-to-face learning resuming on the 18th.\nI'm told that is something that will be kept very much under review.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced a set of new national restrictions for England, as head teachers over the border warned of a \"confusing picture\" with thousands of pupils unable to start primary school as expected.\nSchools and colleges will be closed until the end of February half term and pupils will be taught online.\nScotland has announced a legal requirement to stay at home from midnight, with schools to be closed.\nMost pupils in Northern Ireland were not expected to return to school this week as had been planned.\nEarlier on Monday, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said closing schools in Wales would be a \"last resort\"."

      "text": "Hyundai has sparked confusion over a possible electric car tie-up with Apple.\nThe South Korean car company initially said it was in the \"early stage\" of talks with the iPhone maker about a possible electric car partnership.\nBut hours later it backtracked and said it was talking with a number of potential partners without naming Apple.\nHyundai's share price rose more than 20% when the tie-up was announced.\n\"Apple and Hyundai are in discussions but they are at an early stage and nothing has been decided,\" it said in a statement which was later revised. Hyundai's value shot up $9bn (\u00a36.5bn) after the Apple announcement.\nWhile an updated statement said it was talking to a number of companies about a possible electric car tie-up including Apple, a later version omitted the US tech firm. \nApple is known for its secretiveness when it comes to new products and partnerships. \n\"I'm not surprised to see a big jump in the valuation of Hyundai. The stock market loves car companies who are tech firms as seen with Tesla rise,\" said Sarwant Singh, managing partner at consultants Frost & Sullivan. \"This partnership helps Hyundai be seen as a tech innovator.\"\nLast month, news emerged that Apple was moving forward with self-driving car technology with a 2024 launch date.\nThe electric vehicle (EV) market is becoming increasingly competitive, with companies such as Tesla grabbing the headlines with its rapidly-increasing valuation. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk is now the richest man in the world, displacing Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.\nExperts say an electric vehicle from Apple is still at least five years away. \nThey say pandemic-related delays could push the start of production into 2025 or beyond.\nHyundai has already been pushing into new technologies such as electric, driverless and flying cars.\nLast month, it took a controlling stake in Boston Dynamics in a deal that valued the mobile robot firm at $1.1bn.\nThe company is also setting up a $4bn autonomous-driving joint venture with auto parts supplier Aptiv. \nBoth partners will invest $2bn, while Ireland-based Aptiv will contribute about 700 engineers and transfer patents and intellectual property to the venture.\n\"Apple could certainly jumpstart that project and Hyundai brings the vehicle development and manufacturing expertise,\" said Jeff Schuster at automobile data firm LMC Automotive\nApple's efforts to produce an electric car, known as Project Titan, have been on and off ever since plans were revealed in 2014. \nThere have been rumours over who would assemble an Apple-branded car as it may be difficult for the tech giant to manufacture them on its own.\nIts rival Alphabet's Waymo chose a factory in Detroit to mass produce its own self-driving cars."
