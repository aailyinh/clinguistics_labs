      "text": "Canada Goose, the maker of luxury-priced winter coats, has announced it will no longer use animal fur on its clothing.\nThe firm said it will cease buying fur by the end of this year and stop using it on its products by the end of 2022.\nHumane Society International said the decision was a \"momentous step in the demise of cruel fur fashion\".\nCanada Goose has long been criticised by campaigners for using coyote fur on its parkas.\nClaire Bass, executive director of the Humane Society, said: \"For years, Canada Goose's trademark parka jackets with coyote fur trim have been synonymous with fur cruelty but their announcement today is another major blow to the global fur trade.\"\nThe move is part of Canada Goose's strategy to become more environmentally conscious and extend the use of sustainable materials as well as low carbon methods of making its coats. \nA spokesperson for the British Fur Trade Association said: \"The animals that would have been used by Canada Goose will still have to be culled to control numbers as part of managed conservation programmes.\n\"The fur sector operates under stringent national and international laws and regulations.\" \nA number of luxury fashion brands have stopped using fur in their clothing in recent years. Nordstrom, the upmarket US department store, said it would stop selling products made with fur or exotic animal skin by the end of this year.\nUnder its then new chief creative officer, Riccardo Tisci, Burberry announced back in 2018 it would stop using rabbit, fox, mink and raccoon fur in its collections. Italy's Prada also committed to end the use of fur. \nMs Bass said fur was a \"dying industry on its knees from the punches of so many top designers and retailers walking away from the PR-nightmare of fur\".\n\"Canada Goose's fur-free policy will spare untold thousands of coyotes from being maimed and killed in cruel metal leg-hold traps,\" she said."

      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he expects to stop wearing a mask \"as soon as possible\" after it is no longer legally required in England.\nHe told the Times that the situation was \"looking good\" for an end to lockdown restrictions by 19 July.\nMr Sunak also said it was his \"strong expectation\" that society could then \"get back to normal\".\nThe final easing of Covid-19 restrictions is set to be reviewed over the next few weeks.\nPart of this will involve deciding whether to end social distancing and the need to wear a mask in indoor public settings.\nCoronavirus infection rates have increased since the last easing of restrictions in May - which saw the indoor reopening of pubs, cafes and restaurants - with the more contagious Delta variant, which originated in India, being blamed.\nThis delayed the planned final stage from 21 June to 19 July, subject to review.\nBut hospitalisations and deaths have not risen at anything like the same rate, while more than 43 million UK adults have had a first dose of Covid vaccine.\nSpeaking to the Times's CEO summit, Mr Sunak was asked if he expected to stop wearing a mask when it became legal not do so.\n\"Yes, as soon as possible,\" he replied. \"Things are looking good for 19 July... and my strong expectation is we can lift these major restrictions then and get back to normal.\"\nEarlier, Environment Secretary George Eustice said the \"plan\" was to remove the legal requirements for mask wearing on that date.\nHe told Sky News that there were \"some people who might choose to wear masks or whether it may be advisory in some settings\", adding: \"That's a separate matter.\"\nBut tourism minister Nigel Huddleston said he \"wouldn't be surprised\" if he kept wearing a mask on the London underground after restrictions end.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Sussex, he said: \"No matter what happens in terms of legal requirements, some people will want to be cautious.\"\nFace coverings - when worn over the nose and mouth - reduce the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and speaking.\nThey currently have to be worn on public transport across the UK, unless people have a medical exemption.\nWearing coverings in shops was made compulsory in England last July.\nThey same thing happened in Scotland a few days earlier, with Northern Ireland following suit in August and Wales in September.

      "text": "Leap Year Day 2020 - in the early hours of the morning a fatal crash occurs near Junction 20 of the N1, the border stretch of the main Belfast to Dublin road.\nThree people died in the two-vehicle crash - mother and son Mary, 82, and 58-year-old Kevin Faxton, from Bessbrook in County Armagh, and 25-year-old Bryan Magill, from Newry.\nThe man responsible was 20-year-old Keith Lennon from Dromintee in County Armagh.\nA short time before the crash he had recorded and shared a social media video of himself driving at 140mph (225km/h).\nThe car he was driving had no MoT, no insurance and had three defective tyres.\nAfter driving into the back of the Faxtons' car, Lennon fled the scene on foot leaving Bryan Magill, who he had met for the first time that evening, dying in the back seat of his car.\nIn 2020 more than 200 people lost their lives on roads in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nEach death a passing news story, sympathies offered to the families and the world moves on.\nBut for many of those families, there is no moving on.\nYvonne Campbell's mother and brother died in the crash.\n\"Around about half-six in the morning my brother Malcolm rang and said Daddy was very distressed,\" she said.\n\"Mummy and Kevin went out for a spin and hadn't come home. So of course we all arrived over at Daddy's - he only lives a minute away.\n\"We knew there was something wrong. We rang their mobiles.\n\"At around eight, my brother-in-law rang to say there had been a bad accident up by the Carrickdale and we just sort of knew then.\n\"Daddy's health just deteriorated. He just couldn't live without them. It just broke his heart every day. He cried every day.\n\"It's just sad that in the last year of his life\u2026 he's only dead six or seven weeks now. He just wanted to be with them.\"\nFrancis Harte, the partner of Bryan Magill's mother Yvonne Magee, also recalls the horror of the morning of the crash.\n\"I made a phone call to Drogheda hospital and got speaking to a garda (Irish police officer).\n\"I had the phone on speaker. The whole house was full of the family. The brothers, sisters, mum and dad.\n\"Basically we got a live commentary of Bryan in the morgue and him getting identified.\n\"The garda started describing Bryan's features - his clothes, his hair.\n\"Every sentence that he uttered we knew and then he said they found a bank card in his pocket and after that it was bedlam. Nobody knew what to do.\"\nLennon handed himself into police in Dundalk the following day.\nIn December 2020 he pleaded guilty to three counts of manslaughter and in February 2021 he was sentenced to nine years in prison with another 12 months suspended.\nHe also received a 20-year driving ban.\nSentencing for serious crime remains a difficult process, both for the courts and for victims.\nIn handing down her sentence, the judge said this was one of the worst cases she had ever heard.\nDespite that, the families were disappointed with the sentence handed down.\n\"There is no sentence ever going to bring them back,\" said Yvonne Campbell.\n\"But I honestly believe that he should have got 10 years for every life that he took.\"\nFrancis Harte feels the same.\n\"She did hand down a 20-year driving ban but people like that should not be able to get on the road again ever,\" he said.\nThe Republic of Ireland's court service has confirmed Lennon is appealing his sentence.\nNo date has been set for that hearing."

      "tags": "US Capitol stormed,United States",
      "text": "Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced the creation of a committee to investigate the Capitol Hill riot in January this year.\nMrs Pelosi said the Democratic-led committee would aim to \"establish the truth of that day and ensure that an attack of that kind cannot happen\".\nThe move comes after Senate Republicans blocked a bill to establish a bipartisan commission into the attack.\nAllies of former President Donald Trump said a commission was not necessary.\nHis supporters stormed Congress in Washington DC on 6 January in a failed bid to overturn the certification of Democratic President Joe Biden's election victory in November.\nThe riot left five dead, including a Capitol police officer.\nThe assault led to the political impeachment and acquittal of Republican Mr Trump, who was accused by lawmakers of inciting the riot.\nIt will \"investigate and report on the facts and the causes of the attack and it will report recommendations for the prevention of any future attack,\" Mrs Pelosi said at a news conference on Thursday.\n\"The timetable will be as long as it takes,\" Mrs Pelosi said.\nThe structure, powers and members of the committee will be announced at a later date, she said.\nThe committee will be controlled by Democratic lawmakers in the House of Representatives, the lower legislative chamber of Congress.\nMrs Pelosi said she and her Democratic colleagues \"see this as complementary, not instead of\" an independent commission into the events of 6 January.\nShe had hoped to avoid forming a committee that put Democrats in charge of the investigation.\nIt is not clear how much support the investigation will receive among House Republicans, who may see it as an overtly political process.\nEarlier this week, Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said whatever decision Mrs Pelosi made about a committee would be \"political\".\nThis charge of partisanship is why Democratic lawmakers had sought to legislate for an independent investigation modelled on the commission into the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US.\nDemocrats argued that forming a commission would prevent any repeat of a similar invasion on the Capitol. \nFor weeks Nancy Pelosi has been telegraphing that she would create a special congressional committee to investigate the attack. \nAfter Senate Republicans banded together to block an independent commission, a \"select committee\" was her most obvious play.\nIt will allow her to hand pick the participants of the investigating body, rather than rely on an existing congressional committee whose membership is already determined. It will also, of course, permit the Republican leadership to pick its members - virtually guaranteeing the presence of some of the more pugnacious conservatives, such as Jim Jordan of Ohio.\nRepublicans are already accusing Democrats of making this investigation a partisan affair - a criticism that could have been defused under an independent commission. Instead, this may more resemble the committee investigating the 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, which held days of hearings.\nThat investigation was also dismissed as a partisan inquisition, but it did unearth the existence of the private email server Hillary Clinton used as secretary of state - a revelation that would eventually take a political toll.\nMany Republicans fear an investigation could be used to damage them politically before important 2022 congressional elections, known as the midterms.\nIn the Senate last month, six Republicans broke ranks and voted with Democrats to launch the commission, but it was four short of the number needed to advance the bill.\nThe vote to reject the bipartisan commission was seen as a test of Republican loyalty to Mr Trump. \nHe still wields significant influence among Republican lawmakers and is widely tipped to run for the next presidential election in 2024.\nA Senate report released earlier this month touched on security and intelligence failures surrounding the attack but, notably, did not discuss the role of Mr Trump."

      "title": "Dalian Atkinson: Living at speed on and off the pitch",
      "tags": "Telford,Ipswich",
      "text": "PC Benjamin Monk has been found guilty of the manslaughter of ex-footballer Dalian Atkinson, who died outside his father's home in Telford in 2016, aged 48. The striker had an illustrious career with clubs including Aston Villa and Sheffield Wednesday after starting out at Ipswich Town, where his time on and off the pitch is still fondly remembered.\n\"It was all about his blistering pace,\" said Jason Dozzell, a local boy who was already on Ipswich's books when the teenager first came to the club in 1983.\nThe 14-year-old Atkinson would travel along with other young talent from around the country to train at Portman Road during the school holidays.\nThis influx was a strange sight for Dozzell, who, like Atkinson, would go on to have a successful career.\nSpeaking to the BBC shortly after Atkinson's death, Dozzell recalled: \"We had loads of people from up north come down in those days - lots from Newcastle.\n\"Their accents were intriguing; you couldn't understand them.\n\"Dalian was a bit like that. He had a little bit of a lisp when he talked - it was quite hard to understand.\"\nDozzell said that back then Atkinson, from Telford in Shropshire, was \"very skinny\" and would play as a right-winger - with exceptional pace. \n\"He made all my balls look good. You put it in front of him and he'd reach it,\" Dozzell said.\nMemories of Ipswich's most successful era were quickly fading - they had won the FA Cup in 1978 and the Uefa Cup in 1981 - as the club tried to get used to life without Bobby Robson, who became England manager in 1982.\nAtkinson and Dozzell were to be a key part of the club's revitalisation.\n\"We had a good understanding going after a while,\" Dozzell said. \"I knew where he wanted it and he knew I was going to put it there - he was on his bike as soon as that ball came in to me.\"\nAlong with Michael Cole, Dozzell and Atkinson were referred to in a newspaper report as \"The Three Degrees\" - the world of 1980s football was not renowned for political correctness.\nAlso speaking in 2016, fellow forward Cole remembered Atkinson as \"raw, pacey, and unpredictable - in a good way\" by the time they both became apprentices at Portman Road.\n\"Dalian was young, exuberant, fun to be around and had a raw talent - if and when he applied himself, he had an abundance of ability,\" Cole said.\nAfter becoming apprentices, the two teenagers were put up with Maurice and Shirley Crawford, who lived a few miles out of Ipswich in the village of Bramford.\nMrs Crawford recalled how she had applied to the club to house a footballer, as it was a way of \"earning good money\", and ended up taking both Atkinson and Cole.\n\"I applied to have one footballer and when (the man from the club) came round to assess us, he said 'can you not put up another one?'\" Mrs Crawford said. \n\"He said 'how do you feel about him being black?' I said it didn't bother me.\n\"He said 'well could you take another one?' There were a lot of people who wouldn't take them on. I said 'it's going to be a bit squashed, but he said 'oh, you could take two single beds in that room'.\"\nMrs Crawford has mostly fond memories of her lodgers, who were with her for about five years.\n\"They went through a stage - I think it was Dalian - where I'd go to the cupboard to get a biscuit and they were gone. We had to tighten up on that - 'you don't take, you ask'.\"\nThe fact that they had to be available for Boxing Day fixtures meant the pair would be with the Crawfords on Christmas Day.\n\"One year I had 26 people for Christmas dinner and I told them they had to come down and join in - they went up to their bedroom afterwards but they did join in. They were quite sociable.\n\"I looked after them how a mum would look after them. It was the first time they'd left home so I'd cook for them, wash for them, iron for them - did everything else for them.\"\nMrs Crawford's prevailing memory of Atkinson is of his love for the opposite sex.\n\"Dale, as we called him, liked the girls,\" she said. \"He was on the phone every Friday evening. He must have got a book of girls' names and if he didn't get one girl he went right down the list.\"\nCole said he would always appreciate the time they spent together in Bramford.\n\"We were two young black kids, in an area that didn't have many black kids near us.... growing up together, enjoying playing football, wanting to progress. \n\"I don't think we would have made it through if we weren't there together. We helped each other get through the early stage.\"\nCole has similar memories to those of his old landlady about his room-mate's extra-curricular activities. \n\"As a young person, cars and the fairer sex were the way Dalian looked at things off the pitch,\" he said. \n\"He loved a fast car. \n\"One of the first cars he bought was an Alfasud. We went out to Woodford or somewhere and there was a mechanic working on this car, making additions. It became apparent to me it wasn't a normal road car - there were roll bars and it had a souped-up engine.\n\"We spent time with him going to places like Norwich on a weekend after a match, hanging on to dear life. It was like rally car driving - but he was a really good driver.\n\"It was like a reflection of how he was on the pitch - it was fast and pacey.\"\n\"He was an absolute lunatic driver,\" agreed Dozzell.\n\"He was good fun but you couldn't tell him anything to slow down - he'd just give you a look, 'be quiet'. Everything was fast. Everything was an experience when you were hanging around him.\"\nBy now, Atkinson was also beginning to have success on as well as off the pitch.\nHaving lacked power and confidence in the early stages of his career, he returned to Ipswich one summer for pre-season training with a beefed-up appearance.\n\"He'd been on a weight programme and had bulked up,\" Cole said. \"He'd grown physically. Now he had not only the pace he had before, he now had power.\n\"There was something about him when he came back - he had intent. He wanted to be on that team-sheet as a first-team player.\"\nAtkinson made his first-team debut for Ipswich in March 1986, as a substitute in a 3-1 away defeat at Newcastle.\nBy this time Dozzell was already a regular starter.\n\"Dalian got so much abuse warming up, and in those days a lot of it was racial,\" he said. \"He took so much stick he was thinking 'what's all this about?' But he came on and terrorised them.\"\nAs his success on the pitch led to better contracts, Atkinson was able to exert his independence.\nDozzell said his team-mate bought a house in Ipswich - but spent most of his free time out and about.\n\"He loved socialising, I'll give him that,\" said Dozzell. \"I was always with him, so I can't say anything. We liked travelling as well - we used to go to Norwich, Romford, everywhere. \n\"There were no mobile phones or anything in those days to get you in trouble.\"\nAtkinson left Ipswich in July 1989 to join top-flight Sheffield Wednesday.\n\"Ipswich were in the old Second Division and Sheffield Wednesday at the time were a big club,\" Dozzell said. \"I was pleased for him. He felt he had to move on to progress, to a bigger club, and at the time Sheffield Wednesday were.\n\"I don't think he was a football supporter, someone who went to watch a team or anything. He just wanted to make it really quick at the best club he could.\"\nHe would go on to enjoy even greater success at Aston Villa, scoring in the final of the 1994 League Cup as the Birmingham club beat Manchester United - and of course netted that goal against Wimbledon, which was named the best strike of the 1992-93 season.\nBut his career would peter out in the late 1990s and Atkinson found it hard to adjust to life after football, something Dozzell can relate to.\n\"The money was decent, but it's not enough for when you come out of the game,\" he said. \n\"There are a lot of people in Dalian's position who you don't hear about - they don't talk to people.\n\"There was no-one to talk to in those days and it was a bit of an embarrassment you going to talk to someone if you thought you had any problems. I heard he was depressed. I've had hard times, coming out of the game, what the hell do you do?\"\nDozzell said he was \"devastated\" about his friend's death.\n\"He's died on the street that he probably used to play football on as a kid,\" said Dozzell. \"It's a tragic story. I'd heard he hadn't been well prior to this and hadn't got round to ringing him, which I'm disappointed in myself for.\n\"I'd heard he was quite ill, that he was in hospital. So I was disappointed in myself, and then this happens.\n\"We'd carry on where we'd left off the last time we saw each other, we didn't have to ring. That's just how we were.\n\"What's unfolded is tragic. He's the same age as me. It's so sad.\"\nThis article has been updated since it was first published on 21 November 2016."

      "tags": "Universities,Students,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children",
      "text": "Only about a quarter of students in the UK thought they got good value for money from university in the pandemic.\nAn annual survey found students felt their fees and living costs were not justified by the disrupted teaching they received this academic year.\nStudents were particularly aggrieved by a lack of in-person teaching, found the survey of 10,000 students from the Higher Education Policy Institute.\nUniversities UK said the results were \"disappointing, albeit not surprising\".\nOne comment was: \"Fees have not changed even considering the changes made with Covid.\" Others included: \"Everything seems too high a price for what we are receiving\" and: \"Because of Covid I haven't met any of my classmates or tutor.\"\nThese were the lowest-ever satisfaction ratings in the survey going back to 2006, in a report produced by the higher education think tank and Advance HE.\nThere were 27% who thought they had good or very good value, down from 39% last year - with the pandemic putting much teaching online and students unable to socialise on campus for much of the year.\nStudents felt they had missed out on learning alongside other students and talking to staff face-to-face - and more than 40% wished they had either deferred a year or taken another course or gone to another university.\nThe worries about poor value included:\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson, responding at a Higher Education Policy Institute conference, suggested universities in England should have minimum entry grades - related to GCSEs - and this would be part of a consultation.\n\"Is it really in anyone's interest if entry requirements relax so much that an 18 year old who has not yet passed their English or maths GCSE should progress straight to an honours degree?\"\nA number of universities already have such an English and maths GCSE requirement for applicants - as well as the A-level or equivalent grades needed for specific courses.\nMr Williamson also promised to back efforts to tackle the \"scourge\" of essay mills, where students buy essays from online firms.\n\"It's definitely not been value for money,\" says Beth Stevens, a student at Lancaster University.\nShe only went to one in-person class in a first year so disrupted by the pandemic that she's decided to take this year again.\n\"I felt like I had imposter syndrome,\" she says, about the university year that \"didn't feel real\" - at home or online for much of the time and following a previous year in which she didn't take her cancelled A-levels.\n\"It was really hard to meet people,\" she says, and she would have much preferred to be taught in-person rather than online, where she found the teaching less effective. She also wanted to get involved in sports and that was difficult too.\nBeth says universities had promised a blend of online and face-to-face teaching, but in practice, for her geography course, it turned out to be much more online.\n\"They wanted us on campus - so they said there would be a blend,\" she says.\nOther students had many more lessons in class and she says that it was unfair to charge the same fees - students should receive a significant rebate on fees and rent, she says.\nShe's annoyed at what she sees as unfair treatment: \"I feel we've been shoved to one side. They just want us to shut up really.\"\nStudents in England, who pay the highest tuition fees in the UK of \u00a39,250, were the least likely to say they had good or very good value, at 24%.\nIn Wales, where fees are \u00a39,000, 29% said they had value for money and in Northern Ireland, where fees are \u00a34,530, 27% said it was good or very good value.\nHowever in Scotland, without tuition fees but with costs such as rent, 50% thought they were getting good or very good value from their courses.\nThere were also concerns about well-being. More than a quarter of students had considered leaving their course - and the biggest cause for this was worries about mental health.\nThe survey revealed differences in perceptions over racism - with white students much more likely to believe that their university was committed to tackling racism, while black students were less likely to be so convinced.\nNick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said it was important to \"capture students' real views in a year when students and staff have faced unprecedented challenges\".\nBut he said it was not all negative - with much high-quality teaching and learning, despite the disruptions that universities faced.\nNext year the amount of face-to-face teaching should increase, said Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK.\n\"It is valuable to hear student views on the past year which has been far from the 'usual' university experience,\" he said.\n\"This has been a very difficult time for students, which is why we recently made an additional \u00a385m available for those students most in need, on top of an existing \u00a3256m that universities can draw on,\" said Universities Minister Michelle Donelan.

      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus vaccines,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A paper-based vaccine \"passport\" could be available in Northern Ireland as early as 5 July, the Department of Health has said.  \nAccording to a statement, the initial specialised hard copy format will go live by 19 July at the latest.  \nThe department says this will provide alignment with processes in the Republic of Ireland.  \nIt has also been announced that 16 areas have been added to Northern Ireland's green list for travel.\nMalta, the Balearic Islands - including Majorca and Ibiza - and Barbados are among the areas that will come on to the list from the early hours of Wednesday, 30 June, meaning people can travel to and from those places without having to quarantine as long as they provide proof of negative Covid-19 tests.\nThe department's vaccine passport announcement is aimed towards the goal of having an internationally-recognised form of proof that a person has had both vaccine doses.  \nIt is expected the process of applying and receiving the hard copy certification will take 10 days.  \nThe certificate will incorporate counterfeit protection measures, requiring a specialised printing process.  \nDan West, the Department of Health's chief digital information officer, said the certificate would \"complement the UK's existing traffic light system for international travel\".\n\"While final decisions have still to be taken on how and when these vaccine certificates will be used, they are expected to make foreign travel easier for people who have had both doses.\n\"Governments and businesses may also decide to use them in other circumstances, such as access to events and activities. \n\"Such decisions have still to be made here in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.\"\nA digital format is expected to be available by mid-August. It will support evidence of negative PCR tests, as an alternative to proof of vaccination.  \nMr West said Northern Ireland's lack of a pre-existing health service app meant the department was \"building our system from scratch\".\nNo part of the health service in Northern Ireland, including GPs and vaccination centres, could provide proof of vaccine to the required standard for travel purposes.  \nThe travel news comes after it emerged earlier that anyone over the age of 18 could now book a Covid-19 jab at any of Northern Ireland's vaccine centres.\nThe centres had been focused on vaccinating those aged between 18 and 39, with over 40s only able to get the jab at community pharmacies.\nThe centres are using the Pfizer vaccine for first doses. A scheduled increase in Northern Ireland's Pfizer supply has allowed for more appointment availability\nDr Patricia Donnelly, head of Northern Ireland's Covid vaccination programme, said that while 80% of the adult population had received their first dose and 60% their second dose \"there's more to do and the elta variant identifies what we have to do\".\n\"We're trying to pick up the pace for that, because, while it's reassuring to hear there's no rise in serious illness, we should not take any of this for granted,\" she added.\nShe said while 50% of under 30s had been vaccinated \"it has very definitely slowed\".\n\"Every Thursday we'll release over 20,000 slots. In the first couple of weeks a lot of those were booked out in a day or two and then last week a bit slower than that and we're concerned that we're getting fewer people coming forward,\" Dr Donnelly said.\n\"Each trust is looking at where they could have opportunities to set up a mobile clinic and vaccinate these younger people.\"\nShe said there was also concern that some people in the 40-49 age group had still not come forward for their vaccine.\nIn a separate development, enhanced testing sites are to be set up in areas of Castlewellan, County Down, and in Londonderry after \"a number of probable cases of the Delta variant were identified\", the Public Health Agency (PHA) has said. \nThe PHA's Dr Br\u00edd Farrell said it was a \"precautionary measure\" and asymptomatic people aged 18-40, from selected targeted neighbourhoods, would be asked to come forward for testing. \n\"By slowing the spread of the virus, this allows us to get more people in the community vaccinated and get protected against Covid-19 which is effective against the Delta variant,\" Dr Farrell said.\nTwo mobile testing units are located at Derry's Templemore Sports Complex and at Glendermott Church of Ireland. \nA drive-through testing facility is also available at the Lycra company car park and a walk-in facility has been set up at Ulster University's Magee Campus on the Northland Road. \nThose being asked to come forward for testing will be contacted, by post, from Friday. \nMeanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann said he has been contacted by people over the age of 40 who wanted to book their jab in a vaccine centre.\n\"The vaccination programme has already reached about 80% of 40-49-year-olds,\" said Mr Swann.\n\"I believe today's announcement will help push that figure up even higher.\"\nThe minister urged everyone to come forward for their jab as soon as possible, adding: \"The emergence and spread of the Covid-19 Delta variant demonstrates that the virus remains a serious threat.\"\nNorthern Ireland has seven trust-run vaccination centres, located in Belfast, Londonderry, Omagh, Enniskillen, Craigavon and Ballymena."

      "tags": "UK government,Boris Johnson,Climate change",
      "text": "The UK public should be urged by the government to protect the climate by eating less meat and dairy produce, advisers say.\nCattle are a major source of planet-heating gases, but ministers fear a backlash if they ask people to cut down on steak.\nBut the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says people should reduce meat-eating for their health, as well as for the planet.\nIt says the issue's one of many failings of a government which is delivering only a fifth of its pledges on climate change.\nPeople should be asked to eat 20% less meat and dairy produce by 2030, and 35% less by 2050, the CCC insists.\nThe CCC says Boris Johnson must devise evidence-based policies to encourage healthier diets and set clear targets.\nIts report says the PM's \"remarkable\" climate leadership is undermined by inadequate policies and poor implementation in many areas of policy.\nA government spokesman said its net zero strategy, due in the Autumn, would show where carbon cuts would be imposed across the economy. \nNet zero refers to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases as much as possible and then balancing out any remaining releases by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere - by, for example, planting trees.\nBut the committee complains that the public hasn't been engaged to make changes essential for protecting the climate. In addition to meat and dairy, they are:\nSales of new gas boilers should be stopped by 2033. People will mostly convert to heat pumps instead. This will involve disruption - and the CCC says ministers will have to subsidise the installation cost.\nCommittee members want to see taxes taken off clean electricity - and maybe shifted on to more polluting gas - although power bills for poor households should not rise.\nFrequent fliers will need to be curbed, the CCC believes. Even if low-carbon planes are developed, the UK still cannot let demand for aviation grow unconstrained.\nPeople will need to be consulted over changes ahead - perhaps by groups such as the UK climate assembly.\nThe report says the government currently lacks policies on these issues and many others. Waste and low-carbon heat networks are said to need policies too.\nThe committee chairman Lord Deben said the prime minister's commitments on the international stage to cut emissions 78% by 2035 are \"remarkable decisions\".\nHe added that the objective of achieving near zero emissions by 2050 sets a major example to other nations.\n\"The trouble,\" he said, is that the delivery has not been there. Almost all things that should have happened have either been delayed or not hit the mark. They need to step up very rapidly.\"\nThe CCC's chief executive Chris Stark said he was \"very concerned by the gulf between promises and actions\".\nHis report laid down some fundamental principles for the journey towards a near zero-carbon economy.\nIt urges the Treasury to protect the poorest from the cost of climate policies. It says: \"The net zero strategy must be underpinned by an approach that distributes the costs, savings and wider benefits of decarbonisation fairly.\n\"It must encourage action across society, while protecting vulnerable people and companies at risk of adverse impacts.\"\nA government spokesman said: \"Any suggestion we have been slow to deliver climate action is widely off the mark. Over the past three decades, we have driven down emissions by 44% - the fastest reduction of any G7 country.\n\"We have set some of the most ambitious targets in the world for the future.\n\"In recent months, we've made clear with record investment in wind power, a new UK Emissions Trading Scheme, \u00a35.2bn investment in flood and sea defences, clear plans to decarbonise heavy industry and North Sea oil, and businesses pledging to become net zero by 2050 or earlier.\n\"Our strategies this year will set out more of the very policies the Climate Change Committee is calling for as we redouble our efforts to end the UK's contribution to climate change.\"\nBut environmental group Friends of the Earth said: \"The committee's criticisms are spot on. Without a detailed strategy for combating the climate crisis, government promises to decarbonise the economy are simply more hot air.\n\"With no climate action plan and his government's support for more roads, runways and an overseas gas project, Boris Johnson risks being a laughing stock at the UN climate summit [which the UK is hosting].\"\nThe CCC insists ministers must commit all policies to a \"net zero test\" to ensure that decisions are compatible with the emissions targets.\nBut there is a Whitehall logjam of decarbonisation initiatives in the pipeline. They include the Environment Bill and several strategies for different sectors, such as a transport decarbonisation plan and a net zero aviation strategy.\nMr Stark says the environment Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is lagging with policies, and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government is failing to integrate climate change into the Planning Bill. \nAll these policies, though, are over-shadowed by the delayed Treasury net zero review, which will determine how much cash is invested into the projected zero-carbon economy.\nSome key policies are being delayed by the Treasury, and environmentalists fear that the Chancellor Rishi Sunak may be jockeying for influence with the climate sceptic wing of the Conservative Party by withholding funds needed for the PM's \"green revolution\". \nIt is a huge challenge for the Treasury, which will also need to take into account another recent CCC report warning that the nation unprepared for the inevitable impact of a heating climate on the UK. \nFollow Roger on Twitter."

      "tags": "Saskatchewan,Indigenous Canadians,Canada",
      "text": "An indigenous nation in Canada says it has found 751 unmarked graves at the site of a former residential school in Saskatchewan. \nThe Cowessess First Nation said the discovery was \"the most significantly substantial to date in Canada\". \nIt comes weeks after the remains of 215 children were found at a similar residential school in British Columbia. \n\"This is not a mass grave site. These are unmarked graves,\" said Cowessess Chief Cadmus Delorme. \nThe Marieval Indian Residential School was operated by the Roman Catholic Church from 1899 to the 1980s, when the First Nation took over operations, in the area where Cowessess is now located in southeastern Saskatchewan. It is not yet clear if all of the remains are linked to the school.\nIt was one of more than 130 compulsory boarding schools funded by the Canadian government and run by religious authorities during the 19th and 20th Centuries with the aim of assimilating indigenous youth. \nAn estimated 6,000 children died while attending these schools, according to former Truth and Reconciliation Commission chair Murray Sinclair.  Students were often housed in poorly built, poorly heated, and unsanitary facilities.\nPhysical and sexual abuse at the hands of school authorities led others to run away. \nLast month, the Cowessess began to use ground-penetrating radar to locate unmarked graves at the cemetery of the Marieval Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan. Thursday's announcement marked the first phase of the search efforts. \nChief Delorme said there may have been markers for the graves at one point but that the Roman Catholic church, which oversaw the cemetery, may have removed them. Cowessess First Nation is \"optimistic\" that the church will work with them in investigating further, he said. \nIt has not yet been determined if all the unmarked graves belong to children, Chief Delorme said. Technical teams will now work to provide a verified number and identify the remains, he said. \nIn a statement, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was \"terribly saddened\" by the discovery in Saskatchewan. He said it was \"a shameful reminder of the systemic racism, discrimination, and injustice that Indigenous peoples have faced\".  \nBetween 1863 and 1998, more than 150,000 indigenous children were taken from their families and placed in these schools throughout Canada. \nThe children were often not allowed to speak their language or to practice their culture, and many were mistreated and abused. \n\"They made us believe we didn't have souls,\" said former residential school student Florence Sparvier at a press conference on Thursday. \"They were putting us down as people, so we learned to not like who we were.\"  \nA commission launched in 2008 to document the impacts of this system found that large numbers of indigenous children never returned to their home communities. The commission's landmark report said the practice amounted to cultural genocide. \nIn 2008, the Canadian government formally apologised for the system.\nThe Roman Catholic church - which was responsible for the operations of up to 70% of residential schools - has not yet issued a formal apology. \nThe May discovery of 215 children's remains at the site of a former residential school in Kamloops has thrown a spotlight Canada's past policies of forced assimilation.\nIndigenous leaders expect similar findings as the search for grave sites continues, aided by new funding from federal and provincial governments. \nCities in the provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick have cancelled upcoming celebrations for Canada Day on 1 July in protest, and statues of figures involved with residential schools, including Canada's first Prime Minister John A Macdonald, have been vandalised or removed throughout the country.

      "text": "Wales fans have been turned away from Amsterdam ahead of Saturday's Euro 2020 tie against Denmark.\nThe Netherlands currently bars non-essential visitors from the UK.\nBut Wales supporters said they had been treated unfairly after travelling to Amsterdam from Azerbaijan.\nJamie Shipp, 30, of Pontypridd said: \"Surely our Covid risk should be based on having spent the previous 15 days in Baku, not because we are British nationals.\"\nDanish fans can enter the Netherlands if they stay in the country for less than 12 hours as part of an exemption to the entry rules for EU and Schengen area residents. \nThe exception does not apply to Wales fans, following Brexit.\nMr Shipp and his friend James Lewis spent just over a fortnight in Azerbaijan to watch Wales' opening two games of the European Championships.\nThey did not travel to Rome for the final group game, but remained in Baku before heading for the last-16 tie in Amsterdam, via Moscow.\nHowever, they said they faced an \"interrogation\" upon their arrival at Schiphol Airport and were made to feel like \"criminals\".\n\"As soon as we landed we were taken to one side and questioned by border control about why we were there,\" said Mr Lewis, 30, of Gilfach Goch.\n\"Then we were taken into a room individually, which felt like an interrogation. They treated us like criminals as if we were doing something wrong.\n\"We told them we had come from Azerbaijan and Russia, which weren't on their list of high-risk countries, but after three hours they just decided they weren't going to let us in because we were on holiday.\"\nThe UK is not included on an EU safe list, while watching football is not classified as essential travel.\nThe pair said they set off before the warning from Dutch police to Welsh fans not to travel and said they did not receive any guidance from the FAW or either the Welsh or UK governments.\nIn May, First Minister Mark Drakeford advised against foreign travel, followed by the Football Association of Wales saying the UK Foreign Office had issued advice, warning fans \"not to travel\".\n\"We did the research before we left about what countries were on Holland's red list,\" said Mr Shipp.\n\"We had been out of the country [UK] for 15 days so we thought we would be treated the same as those coming from Azerbaijan or Russia. \n\"Everyone else on that plane was allowed straight in, but as soon as border control saw our British passports, they had a think for a few hours and then said we couldn't come in.\n\"We were already in the country when the advice was issued. But surely our Covid risk shouldn't be based on our passport?\"\nWhile England and Scotland supporters have been able to watch their teams play in the UK, Wales fans had to travel to Baku and Rome and now are banned from entering Amsterdam - with some left hundreds of pounds out of pocket.\nMr Lewis said: \"Wales fans have been treated harshly in this tournament. We had to travel 3,000 miles to Baku, now we're not allowed into Holland but the Danish fans are.\"\nMr Shipp added: \"My only regret is not staying out in Baku and taking a risk on gamble on the quarter-final. But the positive is that we've still been able to watch Wales at a major tournament when many fans didn't have the chance.\"\nThe Welsh government has repeated an appeal for fans to stay in Wales amid the Covid pandemic.\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan said restrictions were in place to prevent the spread of the virus, particularly amid concerns over the Delta variant.\n\"We wish Wales the best of luck and would urge fans to enjoy the football at home,\" she said.\n\"We advise everyone - not just football fans - against travelling overseas this summer and although Wales getting to the next round of the Euros is really important- travelling there is not essential.\"\nMeanwhile, three Denmark fans were infected with the Delta coronavirus variant by attending the Euro 2020 match against Belgium, according to the Danish Agency for Patient Safety.\nThe agency also said there have been 29 cases of infection in connection with three Euro 2020 matches in Copenhagen.\nEuro 2020 chief medical officer Dr Zoran Bahtijarevic, said previously: \"There isn't any situation in life where you are 100% safe, but watching in a stadium is safe because you are watching in a controlled surrounding in which UEFA and the local organisers have invested a lot of efforts to make it safer.\""

      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "About 50% of Northern Ireland's coronavirus cases are now linked to the Delta variant, BBC News NI understands.\nScientists believe it will become the dominant strain in Northern Ireland by the end of the month.\nApproximately 75% of cases are expected to be linked to the strain, which was first discovered in India.\nSources say there are far too many Covid-19 clusters across Northern Ireland and the Delta variant can only be held back for so long.  \nThe race is on between variant and vaccine.\nThere have been 612 confirmed or probable cases of the Delta variant in Northern Ireland, according to the Public Health Agency (PHA).\nLike elsewhere in the UK, the increase in the variant was widely anticipated.\nTo tackle the rise in cases, BBC News NI understands mobile vaccine units are expected to be deployed to try and make access to vaccines easier for some groups, especially those aged between 18 and 30.\nThat may include drop in centres where an appointment is not required.\nMobile units may also be dispatched to large open spaces or university areas where younger people tend are more likely to gather.\nWithin the past few weeks, mobile vaccination units have opened in Glasgow in Scotland and in Harrogate in England to increase the pace of vaccination, especially in Covid-19 hotspots.\nHospitals in Northern Ireland have yet to be affected.\nLatest official figures show there are 13 hospital in-patients being treated for Covid-19, with no cases being treated in intensive care units (ICU).\nHowever, that picture could change over the next couple of months.   \nThe Department of Health reported 188 new cases on Wednesday - the highest daily total in more than 100 days.\nHealth officials believe fewer people are developing serious symptoms because they have been vaccinated.\n\"The case numbers are going up and we're seeing that pattern right across the UK but we're not seeing the rise in serious illness - yet,\" said Dr Alan Stout, chair of the Northern Ireland General Practitioners' Committee (NIGPC).\n\"We're not seeing the hospital admissions and we're not seeing the deaths, so that has shown us that the vaccine is immensely successful in terms of protecting against serious illness.\n\"We're hoping - and this is where we need to buy that time over the next week to two weeks and into the early summer - to make sure that those patterns remain.\"\nDr Stout added: \"We want to force the infect numbers down as well because that has other implications but it is showing us at the moment that the vaccines are working for this particular variant.\"\nDr Gerry Waldron of the PHA said the spread of the Delta variant \"underpins the need for continued vigilance and adherence to the public health guidance\".\nHe said the PHA has also activated \"enhanced testing in areas where we have identified a number of probable cases of the Delta variant\".\nThat includes Omagh, County Tyrone and Ballymoney, County Antrim - a total of 31 people have tested positive after the \"enhanced testing\" of 1,138 people in those towns.\nSlightly more people in the over-60s age group are testing positive but the biggest concern is among those aged between 18 and 40.\nOfficial information is not being released about the number of people testing positive after having received two doses of the vaccine but it is understood a small number are affected.\nThe vaccine does not offer 100% protection against the virus.\nBut as the Delta variant is causing a spike in cases and increasingly becomes the dominant strain across the UK, experts believe more people who have been fully vaccinated will develop symptoms.\nJudging by the numbers in ICUs across England and Scotland, it is hoped Northern Ireland's ICUs will also not become swamped by seriously-ill people.\nHowever that could change in the autumn and winter months when hospitals will also have to deal with the flu virus and more people experiencing respiratory problems.\nThe Northern Ireland executive is due to review lifting further restrictions on 1 July with an indicative date of easing on 5 July.\nFrom a health perspective, officials will want to buy more time in order to get more people vaccinated.\nWith the Twelfth of July holidays also looming, the preference would be to leave things as they are for another few weeks. \nBut that could be difficult for some politicians to accept.\nAllowing large get-togethers while also keeping people safe will be really tough and an even tougher one to police.\nMeanwhile, it has emerged that the Stormont executive went against the advice of the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser when it decided to relax self-isolation guidance for people entering Northern Ireland from the Common Travel Area (CTA).\nThe CTA is made up of the UK, the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and Isle of Man.\nMinisters agreed to the change last month after pressure from the tourism industry.\nIn a response to a question in the Stormont assembly, Health Minister Robin Swann said it was his view and that of the expert advisers that the self-isolation guidance should have remained in place.\nThat would have \"allowed time for greater vaccination roll-out and minimising any potential for community transmission\" of coronavirus.\nMr Swann said the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser told the executive last month that removing the guidance would \"accelerate the introduction of the [Delta] variant into Northern Ireland\"."

Saga and P&O have said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. \nThere is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes in England, Scotland or Wales. \nHowever people are still advised to meet others outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces wherever possible. \nThere are still some restrictions in place in Northern Ireland:\nThe Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September.\nFace coverings are no longer required by law in England, although the government \"expects and recommends\" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. \nHowever, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets.\nWearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. \nMuseums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. \nHowever, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. \nYou may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. \nBusinesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed. \nIndoor hospitality venues in Scotland must continue to collect customer contact details. Organisers of outdoor events for more than 5,000 people and indoor events for more than 2,000 have to apply for permission to go ahead. \nNightclubs are still closed in Northern Ireland.\nThe Common Travel Area (CTA) is a term which covers the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. \nTravel within the CTA is not considered international travel. \nFully vaccinated adults or under-18s travelling from the UK to other CTA destinations may not need to do any travel-related testing or quarantine on arrival, but the rules do vary, so you need to check before arranging a trip. \nAs long as you've not been outside the CTA in the previous 10 days, you do not have to complete a passenger locator form, take any Covid tests or quarantine on your return to the UK.\nForeign travel is allowed, but people must follow different rules about testing and quarantine according to the traffic light status of their destination country. \nVisitors to green-list countries do not need to isolate on their return home. Under-18s and fully vaccinated people returning to the UK from amber-list countries also no longer have to self-isolate on arrival."

There's a lot of politics to play for here and it would be a good opportunity to park some of those politics together get on the same agenda, make things happen that really make a difference for jobs for people living in Wales, living in Pembrokeshire.\"\nPatch, a hardship charity based in Milford Haven, knows from the people it helps how an economy based on low wages affects families.\nManager Tracy Olin said simple changes, such as more frequent buses to help people get work and improve their incomes, would make a real difference and wants the two governments to work together to make that happen.  \n\"I've always hated politicians that just fight all the time, they are there to represent people, and they need to represent people and find out what people really need,\" she said. \n\"If they put the energy of their hatred of the other party to positive then, I think that, oh it would just be wondrous if they could work together and support each other.\"\nMr Price said the speed of decision-making shown by both governments during the pandemic was needed now if new, skilled jobs were to be created in Wales.    \n\"We need to continue that, the danger is that we may revert after all this is over and go back to how we used to do things and wrap things in process and get bogged down in the detail of things.\"\nCBI Wales also wants skills to be linked to what businesses need - such as helping firms adapt from being in the oil sector to hydrogen or developing new opportunities.\nIt also wants more emphasis on the importance of well-being in the workplace.  \nThe UK government said: \"People and businesses across Wales want to see politicians working together. That is why we have provided the Welsh government with an additional \u00a38.6bn since the start of the pandemic to help them respond to the challenges they have faced.\"\nThe Welsh government said: \"We work closely with the UK government on a range of issues of importance to Wales. However, the UK government needs to respect devolution and the Welsh government's role in making decisions for Wales.\""

      "text": "Cathay Pacific has told its aircrew that they must get a Covid vaccination by 31 August or risk losing their jobs.\nThe airline said staff rostering has become \"difficult and complicated\" because of a need to segregate vaccinated and non-vaccinated crew.\nCathay Pacific said it could, in the \"short-term\", accommodate those employees not able to take the vaccine.\nBut it said: \"We will review the future employment of those who are unable to become vaccinated.\"\nThe carrier added that it would \"assess whether they can continue to be employed as aircrew\".\nThe Hong Kong-based airline said that 90% of its pilots and 65% of its cabin crew have been vaccinated or have appointments to receive the injection.\nBut it said it was \"becoming clear that only fully vaccinated aircrew will be able to return without quarantine from most places\".\nIt said that in order for Cathay Pacific and the global airline industry to recover, \"vaccination is a critical component\". \n\"After very careful consideration, we have now made the decision that all Hong Kong-based crewmembers must be vaccinated against Covid-19 by 31 August 2021,\" it said.\nIt comes as Hong Kong prepares to relax some Covid travel restrictions as early as the end of this month. \nHong Kong residents will have to quarantine for seven days, instead of the current two-week period, if they are fully vaccinated and take a test at the airport to show they are negative for Covid and positive for antibodies.\nAccording to the South China Morning Post, it is hoped the arrangement could then be extended to Hong Kong residents currently overseas as well as other travellers. \nVaccination rates in Hong Kong are relatively low, with 27% of the population receiving the first jab and 17.6% of the population fully vaccinated. That compares with 65% of people in the UK who have had the first dose and 47% who have had both.\nAirlines have taken differing approaches to cabin crew vaccinations. Earlier this week, US carrier United Airlines said that from August only fully vaccinated pilots and cabin crew would be allowed to work on flights to high risk destinations. \nIt would apply to flights operating in countries such as India, Brazil and Chile. \nUnited Airlines, as well as US rival Delta, are requiring that all new recruits joining from 15 June are fully vaccinated against Covid.

      "text": "Life-saving oxygen is at risk of not getting to patients in hospital because of problems with how it is piped around wards, a safety watchdog is warning.\nA Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) review said a number of hospitals in England faced difficulties during the winter Covid wave.\nIt said outdated systems used to pump oxygen around wards could not always cope with the surges in demand.\nThis is the case even if there is excess supply on site.\nInvestigators said it was vital that hospitals made adjustments to cope with future outbreaks. \nHSIB director of investigations, Dr Stephen Drage, said the supply of oxygen was clearly a \"critical\" issue, adding: \"If it fails the impact is significant.\"\nThe problem particularly affects hospitals that use an older piping system, known as a radial system, which just pumps the oxygen one way. \nNewer systems pump oxygen into the piping system at both ends - but the majority of hospitals are thought to use a radial system.\nThe HSIB was set up to investigate safety issues in the NHS in England. It carried out an in-depth investigation into problems reported at one hospital where a major incident was declared when the oxygen supply to wards, including the high dependency unit, dropped. \nThe trust ended up diverting patients to nearby hospitals and cancelling non-emergency surgery. \nThe HSIB said the problems were not unique to this trust, which was not named, as it was aware of similar issues in at least a dozen hospitals.\nIt said long-term investment was needed to upgrade the supply systems - with experts who gave evidence describing the equipment being used in many parts of the NHS as \"unbelievably old\".\nBut there were also steps that could be taken immediately, including getting doctors and engineers to work more closely to try to even out demand across the hospital site, as well as using cylinders to pump oxygen into the pipes at points where pressure is at risk of dropping."

      "tags": "Astronomy,Stars,Cosmology,The Universe,Galaxies,Space exploration",
      "text": "Astronomers have worked out when the first stars began shining.\nThey say that this period, known as the \"cosmic dawn,\" occurred between 250 to 350 million years after the Big Bang.\nThe results indicate that the first galaxies will be bright enough to be seen by Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope, which is set to be launched later this year.\nThe study is published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\nDiscovering when the cosmic dawn began has been the life's work of Prof Richard Ellis, from University College London, UK.\nHe told BBC News: \"The Holy Grail has been to look back far enough that you would be able to see the very first generation of stars and galaxies. And now we have the first convincing evidence of when the Universe was first bathed in starlight.\"\nThe team analysed six of the most distant galaxies. They were so far away that even with the world's most powerful telescopes they appeared as just a few pixels on the computer screen. \nThey are also among the earliest to have emerged in the Universe and so, by the time their images are captured by telescopes on Earth, they are seen not long after the Big Bang.\nBy working out their age, the team calculated the start of the cosmic dawn - when the first stars formed. Dr Nicolas Laporte, from the Kavli Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge led the analysis.\n\"This is one of the biggest questions in modern cosmology. This is the first time we have been able to predict from observations when this crucial moment in the history of the Universe occurred.\"\nDr Laporte said that obtaining the result was a dream come true.\n\"It is fantastic to think that particles of light have been travelling through space for over 13 billion years and then entered a telescope. The wonderful thing about being an astrophysicist is the ability to time travel and witness the distant past,\" he explained.\nThe Universe came into being 13.8 billion years ago in the Big Bang. After an initial flash, it went through a period known as the cosmic dark ages. According to the new study, 250 to 350 million years after the Big Bang, the first stars emerged, bringing light to the cosmos.\nCritically, the new analysis also indicates that the first galaxies are bright enough and within the range where they can be seen by the James Webb Space Telescope - the successor to the venerable Hubble Space Telescope.  Astronomers may then be able to witness this crucial moment in the evolution of the Universe directly. \nScotland's Astronomer Royal, Prof Catherine Heymans, said she was \"so excited\" by this prospect.\nShe told BBC News: \"Isn't it just so fantastic that, as humanity, a tiny civilisation on Panet Earth, we can create a telescope that we can send up into space and we can peer back to the Universe as it was just a couple of hundred million years after the Big Bang!\"\nMany of the first stars were quite different to our own Sun. They were more massive and burned only hydrogen. But these objects created the next generation of stars that led to the formation of heavier periodic table elements. \nEverything except for hydrogen, helium and lithium, is created inside stars when they explode at the end of their lives. \nWe are, therefore, ultimately made from the stars that were born close to the dawn of the cosmos.\n\"Because we are ourselves the produce of stellar evolution, we are looking back at our own origin,\" said Prof Ellis.\nThe researchers analysed starlight from the galaxies using both Hubble and the Spitzer Space Telescope. They estimated the age of the galaxies by examining the proportion of hydrogen atoms in the atmosphere of their stars. The older the stars, the greater the proportion of hydrogen atoms.\nThe team then calculated how far away the galaxies were. Because light from these galaxies takes time to reach us, the further away they are, the further back in time astronomers are observing them. \nBecause the six galaxies the team studied are at the limits of objects that can be observed by telescopes, they are also among the earliest known. \nThe team needed 70 hours of observing time, using four of the largest ground-based telescopes to estimate their distances. These were the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (Alma), the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the Gemini South Telescope - all located in Chile - as well as the twin Keck telescopes in Hawaii.\nThese measurements enabled the team to confirm that they were observing these galaxies when the Universe was 550 million years old. Knowing the age of the galaxies and when they existed enabled the team to calculate when the first stars were born.\nSimilar estimates have been made using just single galaxies, but this is the first meaningful estimate based on a representative group of them.\nFollow Pallab on Twitter."

      "tags": "Royal Navy,Russia,Crimea,Ukraine",
      "text": "More than 20 Russian aircraft and two coastguard ships have shadowed a British warship sailing near Crimea.\nMoscow's defence ministry said a patrol ship fired warning shots and a jet dropped bombs in the path of HMS Defender as it sailed some 12 miles (19km) off Crimea's coast.\nThe UK government rejected Russia's account of the incident and denied that any warning shots had been fired.\nA BBC correspondent on the warship said it was harassed by Russia's military.\nAircraft could be heard overhead as BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale filed a report from the deck of HMS Defender in the Black Sea as it sailed to Georgia. He described hostile warnings over the radio as the warship's crew prepared for a possible confrontation.\nOur correspondent, who had been invited on board the ship before the incident happened, saw more than 20 aircraft overhead and two Russian coastguard boats which at times were just 100m (328ft) away.\nThis is at odds with statements from both the British prime minister's office and defence ministry, which denied any confrontation.\nHMS Defender was sailing from Odessa in southern Ukraine to Georgia. To get there, it passed south of the Crimea peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 in a move that has not been recognised internationally. \nWhile Moscow claims the peninsula and its waters are Russian territory, the UK says HMS Defender was passing through Ukrainian waters in a commonly used and internationally recognised transit route.\nA source told BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale that the Defender was not there to pick a fight but to make a point - to assert its right to freedom of navigation in international waters.\nRussia's defence ministry said the \"dangerous actions\" of the navy ship entering its waters were a \"gross violation\" of the UN Convention's sea laws, and called for the crew to be investigated.\nA later tweet from the Russian embassy in the UK said: \"HMS Defender turns HMS Provocateur and violates Russian border. Not exactly a 'routine' transit, is it?\"\nBut a UK government spokesman played down any notion of hostilities, insisting that Russia was doing \"gunnery exercises\" in the Black Sea.\nUK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace added: \"As is routine, Russian vessels shadowed [the ship's] passage and she was made aware of training exercises in her wider vicinity.\" \nThe British ambassador was summoned to the Russian foreign ministry in Moscow, and met officials on Wednesday afternoon.\nJonathan Beale, Defence Correspondent\nI am on board the warship in the Black Sea. \nThe crew were already at action stations as they approached the southern tip of Russian-occupied Crimea. Weapons systems on board the Royal Navy destroyer had already been loaded. \nThis would be a deliberate move to make a point to Russia. HMS Defender was going to sail within the 12 mile (19km) limit of Crimea's territorial waters. The captain insisted he was only seeking safe passage through an internationally recognised shipping lane.\nTwo Russian coastguard ships that were shadowing the Royal Navy warship, tried to force it to alter its course. At one stage, one of the Russian vessels closed in to about 100m.\nIncreasingly hostile warnings were issued over the radio - including one that said \"if you don't change course I'll fire\". We did hear some firing in the distance but they were believed to be well out of range. \nAs HMS Defender sailed through the shipping lane it was buzzed by Russian jets. The Captain, Vincent Owen, said the ship detected more than 20 military aircraft nearby. Commander Owen said his mission was confident but non-confrontational.\nRussia said the incident happened just after midday local time (09:00 GMT) in the Black Sea near Cape Fiolent in the south of Crimea.\nAccording to the Russian military, HMS Defender was told to change course, and when it failed to do so, a Russian border patrol ship sent several warning shots. About ten minutes later, a military jet dropped warning bombs in the path of the destroyer.\nThis case is reminiscent of a similar incident in November 2020, when Russia accused a US warship of travelling 2km into its waters in the Sea of Japan.\nRussia's defence ministry said it had warned the USS John S McCain that it would be rammed if it continued sailing in the territorial waters, before chasing off the warship. However the US Navy said those claims were false, and that its ship had not been \"expelled\" from the area.\nHMS Defender is a Type 45 destroyer that is part of the UK's Carrier Strike Group. It is carrying out missions in the Black Sea, according to the Royal Navy's website.\nThe warship was in the southern Ukrainian port of Odessa earlier this week, according to the British embassy in Ukraine. It said the UK and Ukraine had signed an agreement to jointly build warships and construct two naval bases. "

      "text": "Microsoft has unveiled Windows 11, its \"next generation\" operating system, at a virtual event. \nThe new software will let Android apps run on the Windows desktop.\nProduct manager Panos Panay promised smaller, faster security updates - a common complaint for Windows users - and said they would happen in the background.\nWindows 11 will also let users configure multiple desktops for work, home, and gaming, like on a Mac.\nMicrosoft says there are currently about 1.3 billion devices running Windows 10.\nAn early preview version of the new system will be released for app developers next week.\nWindows 11 will be available as a free update to existing Windows 10 users - although some devices will not have the right specifications. These include a minimum of 64 gigabytes of storage and 4 gigabytes of RAM.\nOne cosmetic change is putting the \"Start\" button at the bottom-centre of the screen rather than left-hand side.\nIn addition, Windows 11 will feature tighter integration with Microsoft's communications platform Teams. Xbox Games Pass, a subscription service offering access to hundreds of games, will also be pre-installed.\nThe tech giant said it would share more profits from its app store with creators and developers - as rival Apple continues to face challenges over its business model.\nWhen Windows 10 launched in 2015, Microsoft said it would be the final version of the operating system. It has since announced Windows 10 will be retired in 2025.\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella described the launch as \"a major milestone in the history of Windows\", but analyst Geoff Blaber from CCS Insight said he did not consider it to be  \"a revolutionary step\".\n\"Windows 11 is an iterative release that pinpoints where Windows needs greater ambition, rather than introducing the sweeping changes seen with its predecessor,\" he said.\n\"The end game for Microsoft is ensuring that the step up from Windows 10 to Windows 11 provides significant enough improvements to offset any complaints.\"\nForrester's principal analyst JP Gownder noted that the new operating system was based on the code of Windows 10, which should prevent upgrade glitches such as those seen in the past with Windows Vista.\n\"These user-friendly nods to the past are a double-edged sword, though,\" he added. \n\"They're great for continuity of experience, but they make you wonder what the 11 really stands for. Is this really more of an admittedly feature-rich Windows 10 update than a full-version release?\""

      "text": "At least one person has died and dozens are missing after the collapse of a 12-storey residential building north of Miami, Florida, officials say. \nThe number of people who have been located now stands at 102, while 99 are still unaccounted for, according to Miami-Dade Mayor Danielle Levine-Cava.\nIt is unclear how many people were in the building at the time. \nThe cause of the collapse - affecting about half of the 130 units in the complex - remains unclear. \nThe block in the town of Surfside was built in 1980. \nA number of Latin American migrants have been reported missing by their consulates. \nRelatives of the first lady of Paraguay are also among the missing, Paraguayan officials said. Rescuers were unable to contact the sister and brother-in-law of first lady Silvana L\u00f3pez Moreira, along with their three children and a domestic worker. \nRescuers pulled 35 people from the wreckage, officials said. Ten were assessed and treated, of whom two were sent to hospital. \nSearch and rescue teams are working from a parking garage underneath the wreckage as they explore the rubble for survivors.  \nA small fire broke out during the search but was extinguished within 20 minutes, said Miami-Dade fire chief Raide Jadallah.\nHe said they had been using sonar and search cameras as well as specially trained dogs, but it was a \"slow and methodical\" process because of the risk of shifting rubble. \n\"The back of the building, probably a third or more, is totally pancaked,\" Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett told a news conference. \nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis, who visited the site on Thursday afternoon, said the fire and rescue service was still in \"search and rescue mode\".\n\"The TV doesn't do it justice. It is really, really traumatic to see the collapse of a massive structure like that,\" he said. \nThe BBC's Will Grant, at the scene, said relatives of the missing have been huddled around a community centre a few blocks from the collapsed building, waiting for information and fearing the worst.\nPresident Joe Biden said he was waiting for Mr DeSantis to declare an emergency and officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) were already at the scene.\n\"I say to the people of Florida, whatever help you want, what the federal government can provide, we're waiting, just ask us. We'll be there,\" Mr Biden said. \nPolice gave the building's location as 8777 Collins Avenue, the address of the 12-storey Champlain Towers. The city of Surfside runs along Collins Avenue, north of Miami Beach city limits.\nRescuers could be seen using a crane to reach residents in nearby apartments in order to help them evacuate.\nOne man who was out with his brothers walking their dog described hearing the building come down.\n\"Basically we heard a really big rumble and we thought it was a motorcycle, you know, and we turned around and saw a cloud of dust just coming our way,\" he told CBS Miami.\n\"We were like - 'what is going on?' We went rushing toward it with shirts over our faces and the security guard came out and we were, like, 'what happened?' and she said the building collapsed.\"\nA man who witnessed the aftermath of the collapse told CNN, \"It looked like something from 9/11,\" referring to the attacks that brought down the Twin Towers in New York in 2001.\nSanto Mejil, 50, was woken when his wife called from a unit on the ninth floor of one of the three buildings that make up Champlain Towers. She is an overnight caretaker for an elderly disabled woman.\n\"She said she heard a big explosion,\" Mr Mejil told the Miami Herald. \"It felt like an earthquake.\" His wife was among those rescued.\nA man who lives in a neighbouring building described what happened for CBS: \"The building shook and then I looked out the window and you couldn't see, I thought it was like a storm or something coming in. \n\"When the dust cleared, the back two-thirds of the building was gone, it was down to the ground.\"\nAre you in the area?

      "tags": "Obesity,Boris Johnson,Advertising",
      "text": "The government is to impose a UK-wide pre-9pm ban on TV adverts for food high in sugar, salt and fat.\nProducts affected include chocolate, burgers, soft drinks, cakes, sweets, ice cream, biscuits, sweetened juices, crisps, chips and pizzas.\nThere will also be new rules on online promotion, but firms selling junk food will still be able to run websites.\nA total ban on online adverts was proposed last year, but this has been scaled back after consultation.\nThe TV restrictions come after Boris Johnson made tackling obesity, which affects more than a quarter of UK adults, a priority for the government.\nFood companies have said outlawing any form of junk food advertising - worth hundreds of millions of pounds a year - is disproportionate.  \nFrom the end of next year, TV adverts for junk food - also including breakfast cereals, yoghurts, ready meals, chicken nuggets and battered fish - will be allowed only between 9pm and 5.30am.\nCommercials for \"less healthy\" meals out will also not be shown outside this period.\nThe rules will apply during live and on-demand programmes and will not affect companies with fewer than 250 employees, such as local curry houses, pizzerias and sweet-makers.\nAn around-the-clock ban on online junk food advertising will be limited to paid-for content, meaning companies can continue to promote goods using their own blogs, websites, apps or social media pages.\nA senior advertising industry source told the BBC the TV and online bans would apply to products, rather than wider brands.\nSo, for instance, Gary Lineker could still appear in adverts for Walker Crisps if they featured items which were deemed to be healthy, they added.\nThe Department of Health said the restrictions would not affect some foods high in sugar, salt or fat - such as honey, olive oil, avocados and Marmite - as these were not seen as contributing significantly to childhood obesity.\nSpeaking on a visit to a military base in Aldershot, the prime minister said: \"I'm afraid we do have a national struggle with obesity, and we need to deal with it...\n\"Let's get a grip on it. Sending out a signal in the way we treat advertising is entirely right.\"\nThe UK population's weight has risen since the early 1990s, with more than 60% of the adult population now overweight or obese, according to NHS Digital. \nProblems often begin in childhood and those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds are most likely to suffer, research suggests.\nThe government says it is keen to prevent young people consuming too many unhealthy products and since 2018 manufacturers have had to pay extra tax on high-sugar drinks.\nIn 2006, Mr Johnson defended mothers who - in spite of efforts by TV chef Jamie Oliver to improve school meals - were reportedly pushing fatty foods through school railings to their children,\n\"I say let people eat what they like,\" he said. \"Why shouldn't they push pies through the railings?\"\nBut his views have changed, particularly since he was hospitalised with Covid-19 last year.\nMr Johnson said obesity was one of the \"real co-morbidity factors\" associated with the disease, adding: \"Losing weight, frankly, is one of the ways you can reduce your own risk from coronavirus.\"\nBut the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising - which represents the large ad agencies - has said the government's own impact assessment shows a watershed ban on high-fat, sugar and salt food and drinks would only remove around 1.7 calories per day from a child's diet - the equivalent of half a Smartie.\nSue Eustace, public affairs director of the Advertising Association, said her industry was \"dismayed\" and that jobs would be lost in broadcasting and online publishers.\nHowever, Charmaine Griffiths, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, called the advertising ban \"a bold and very positive step\", adding that it was \"one important part in building a more healthy environment where the healthy option is the easy option\".\nFor Labour, shadow health minister Alex Norris said: \"This ban alone will not be enough. We need a radical obesity strategy in this country that goes further, ensuring families are able to access healthy food, supporting local leisure facilities and tackling child poverty.\"\nThe NHS says most adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 are overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 to 39.9 are classed as obese."

Those going to Italy have to self-isolate for five days then take a test, while fully-vaccinated UK visitors to France can enter without quarantining.\nBy contrast, when returning to the UK from most holiday hotspots on the amber list, travellers have to self-isolate for 10 days, as well as pay for tests.\nAsked about Mrs Merkel's remarks on the Delta variant meaning more restrictions on British travellers going abroad, Mr Johnson said: \"The most important thing is that we think double jabs do offer a good way forward, we think they offer the hope of travel this summer.\n\"More than 60% of our population have now had two jabs, I think 83% have had one jab, we're really getting through it now. The crucial thing is, come forward and get your second jab,\" he said.\nHe added that he wasn't going to claim the summer would be like any other. \"I don't want to cast a pall over things but, as I said the other day, it will be different.\"\nTom Singleton, from Derby, is on a family holiday with his wife and four-year-old daughter on the very quiet Greek island of Kos.\nThey had originally planned to go to Cyprus but had to cancel three times. \nDetermined to get away before their daughter starts school in September, the family flew to Kos - on the amber list - on a virtually empty plane to stay in a deserted hotel.\n\"Until yesterday we were the only British people in our hotel,\" he told the BBC.\nTom and his wife are both fully-vaccinated and hopeful - if a little doubtful - Kos might be moved on to the safer green list which would save them from quarantining.\n\"Cases are very minimal here and it's safer here than at home - it makes no sense why it can't be green,\" he said.\nHe highlighted some of the apparent contradictions in the travel rules, asking how Uefa VIPs, sponsors, staff and guests could come into the UK \"from wherever\" without quarantining.\n\"It begs the question why one rule for the few and another for everyone else.\"\nJust 11 destinations are on the green list - including Israel and Australia - although neither has opened up its borders to tourists. Travellers do not need to quarantine when they get back from green-list countries, but they do have to pay for tests.\nCountries on the red list are considered the highest risk, and travel from those nations is more strictly limited.\nThe UK government reviews which countries are on which list every three weeks, and the last update - when Portugal was stripped from the green list - was three weeks ago on 3 June. \nAs well as today's review, the government has also said there will be a \"checkpoint\" review of the rules for each category on Monday 28 June. That could be when ministers decide whether to relax quarantine for fully-vaccinated travellers. \nOn Wednesday, Mr Shapps told the BBC: \"If you've been double vaccinated then of course we need to look at what the science says. We've said that Monday is the point to review that data, so we are coming up to having a look at it.\n\"We're looking at it in the next few days and I'll have more to say.\"\nThe UK government's traffic light system applies to England, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland able to make their own rules. However, the rules are broadly the same and previous changes to the lists have been adopted by all four nations.\nThe issues around international travel in Europe are tricky, complex and ever-changing.\nIn the spring the UK had one of the lowest infection rates in Europe - so it was perhaps understandable that ministers did not want Britons going abroad where there would be a greater risk of infection.\nThe opposite is true now following the rise of the Delta variant. So in theory a Briton in France, Germany, Spain or Italy is less likely to get infected than they are here.\nBut that means there is a stronger argument for countries in continental Europe to restrict access for Britons. \nIndeed, a number of countries have already started, citing concern about the Delta variant.\nAlthough with clusters of it found across Europe it's probably only a matter of time before it takes off.\nThe fact remains holidaying in continental Europe could still be very difficult regardless of what ministers decide here.\nEarlier this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ministers were \"working on\" plans for fully-vaccinated people to be exempt from quarantine if they returned from amber-list countries.\nMore than 60% of UK adults have now been fully vaccinated, while 82.9% have had their first jab.\nOn Wednesday, workers in the travel industry including cabin crew, pilots, travel agents and airport staff held a series of protests against the rules.\nThey called on the government to offer the industry more financial support and increase the number of countries on the UK's green list.\nAnd industry body Abta, representing travel agents and tour operators, estimated 195,000 travel jobs have been lost during the pandemic or are at risk.\nThe government said its international travel policy was guided by \"one overwhelming priority - protecting public health\".\nIt said a range of factors were considered when making decisions about countries - including how capable a country is at genomic sequencing, the risk of transmission and the risk from any variants of concern.\nThe government added it was keeping all possible travel measures under review, and that economic support for the sector included the furlough scheme."

      "text": "The Prince of Wales continued to support the Duke and Duchess of Sussex with a \"substantial sum\" in the months after they stood down as senior royals, Clarence House has said. \nPrince Harry told Oprah Winfrey his family \"cut me off financially\" in the first quarter of 2020. \nA Clarence House spokesman said Prince Charles continued to fund the Sussexes until that summer.\nThe Sussexes deny there is a difference in timelines. \nA spokesperson for them said Prince Harry was referring in his Oprah interview to the first quarter of the fiscal reporting period - the period from April to the start of July.\nThe comments by Clarence House - the office of Prince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall - were made as the annual royal accounts were published.\nAccounts for the Sovereign Grant show the monarchy cost \u00a387.5m during 2020-21, an increase of \u00a318.1m on the previous financial year.\nMeanwhile, Buckingham Palace has revealed its proportion of ethnic minority staff (8.5%) for the first time. \nFunding for both of Prince Charles's sons - the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex - and their families contributed to a \u00a34.5m bill for the prince, his Clarence House financial accounts showed.\nHarry and Meghan were still listed as receiving money from Charles's Duchy of Cornwall income, despite quitting the monarchy at the end of March last year.\nThe funding bill - plus other expenditure, including Prince Charles's capital expenditure and transfer to reserves - dropped by around \u00a31.2m in the financial year after the Sussexes stopped being senior royals.\nA senior Clarence House spokesperson said: \"As we'll all remember in January 2020 when the duke and duchess announced that they were going to move away from the working royal family, the duke said that they would work towards becoming financially independent.\n\"The Prince of Wales allocated a substantial sum to support them with this transition.\n\"That funding ceased in the summer of last year. The couple are now financially independent.\"\nDuring the couple's interview with Winfrey in March, Harry said \"my family literally cut me off financially\" in \"the first quarter of 2020\".\nQuizzed about the timeframes, the Clarence House spokesperson said: \"I wouldn't acknowledge that they are dramatically different. All I can tell you are the facts.\"\nA spokeperson for the Sussexes told reporters: \"You are conflating two different timelines and it's inaccurate to suggest that there's a contradiction.\n\"The duke's comments during the Oprah interview were in reference to the first quarter of the fiscal reporting period in the UK, which starts annually in April.\"\nHarry and Meghan signed multimillion-pound deals with Netflix and Spotify, with the duke telling Winfrey he secured these to pay for his security.\nHe said he had what Diana left him - \u00a37m at the time - and \"without that we would not have been able to do this\".\nMeanwhile, Buckingham Palace has said it \"must do more\" and is \"not where it would like to be\" in terms of diversity.\nThe Royal Household has revealed in its annual financial accounts for 2020-2021 that its proportion of ethnic minority employees stands at 8.5%, with a target of 10% for 2022.\nIn the UK, around 13% of the UK population is from a minority ethnic background, according to the latest 2011 Census data.\nA total of 8.5% of Buckingham Palace staff are drawn from ethnic minorities. That compares to 13% of the UK's population at the time of the 2011 census and just under 40% of the population of London, where the majority of staff are based. \n\"Could do better\" is Palace's own verdict. \"We recognise we are not where we want to be\", said a senior Palace source; next year's target is 10%.\nBut change may be hard to achieve. While public funding has remained steady, the extra money the monarch made from things like paid visits to the palaces fell by half. \nA \u00a310m shortfall was covered by cutting back on some events like garden parties and by a recruitment freeze. \nWithout new faces it is difficult to change the profile of household staff; and the Palace reckons that Covid restrictions will hit its supplementary income for some time to come. \nThe Sovereign Grant is funded by profits from the Crown Estate - a multibillion-pound property portfolio that ranges from London's Regent Street to Ascot Racecourse.\nThe estate is managed by an independent organisation, with any profit paid to the Treasury for the benefit of all UK taxpayers."

The stolen files were then released on the internet. \nThe public body restored the majority of its key services, such as flooding forecasting, but is now building new IT systems to run them from. \nMr A'Hearn told BBC Scotland: \"I think this a process that will take a year or two. \n\"We had reform aims anyway, we were going to build a new IT system progressively over five or six years. \n\"This is an opportunity we didn't want provided by criminals, but we've decided to fast-track that and will build that in one or two years.\"\nMr A'Hearn said there was never any question of paying the ransom, adding that \"If we had paid then we would have increased the risk for everyone else\". \nIn April BBC Scotland asked Sepa if it had offline backups of every data set that it was responsible for. The watchdog said the question would be dealt with under freedom of information laws. \nA response to this FOI request is still outstanding but Mr A'Hearn said Sepa was making good progress in recovering its environmental datasets from offline storage.  \nHe said: \"Like all organisations we had a variety of ways of backing up, we have recovered the vast majority of our environmental data sets - we're now working on them again on a priority basis.\" \nPart of Sepa's \u00a3800,000 outlay on recovering from the cyber attack has involved the hiring of data recovery specialists.\nPolice Scotland is still investigating the cyber attack and has previously indicated the likely involvement of international serious and organised crime.\nJen Miller Osborn, of cyber security firm Palo Alto Networks, told BBC Scotland that the Conti group, who claimed the attack, stands out as \"one of the more greedy and aggressive groups\" in the ransomware world.\nShe said that Conti is \"aggressive in their targeting and researching of victims beforehand\" and has hit other public organisations before. \nShe added: \"This attack really shows it is becoming increasingly difficult to protect yourself against these accounts. \n\"Once they are in it does not take time much time before you have a massive incident on your hands. \""

      "tags": "Fertility,Population growth,Ageing population,Pregnancy",
      "text": "Last year more deaths than births were registered in the UK for the first time since 1976. \nIn total, just over 683,000 births were registered compared with nearly 690,000 deaths. \nThis was only the second time deaths have outnumbered births since the late 1890s. \nThe coronavirus epidemic led to a sharp rise in deaths last year but birth rates have also been falling for the last decade. \nThe number of deaths in the UK has been rising in recent years, but part of that increase is due to the UK population increasing and getting older. \nLast year's 13% rise in that figure is attributed by statisticians to the coronavirus pandemic.\nIt was the largest jump in a single year seen since World War Two, bringing death rates, the chances of any single person dying, back to levels seen in 2008. \nFigures published this morning by the Office for National Statistics suggest the first lockdown had not led to a baby boom.\nBirth rates in December and January, nine months after lockdown started, were sharply down on the same months one year before. \nBut the pandemic has affected register offices, leading to problems with birth registrations, so the ONS \"urges caution\" when reading meaning into these figures. \nIt is perhaps unsurprising - and it should be a one off - but the provisional finding that the UK natural population shrank is stark all the same. \nThe spike in deaths above the number of births puts pandemic mortality into some sort of context. \nBut it also shines a light on the significant falls in the fertility rate in the past few years. \nIn 2012, the total fertility rate was 1.92 - close to the level where a population replaces itself. \nIn just eight years that has fallen below 1.6, much closer now to societies considered to be \"ageing\" such as Germany and Japan. \nThere are many questions to ask about whether this is linked to a significant squeeze on younger families.\nThese figures need not necessarily be a problem. However, if confirmed in the final figures, they do point to significant changes for British society and its economy too.\nPart of the reason that deaths have outstripped births is that births have been falling steadily in every nation of the UK since at least 2015. \nThe Office for National Statistics says this is because we are having children later in life and fewer of them. \nThis trend has been happening for decades but it wasn't apparent in the noughties as another trend was masking it. \nBack then, younger migrants tended to have more children than UK-born mothers and so they propped up British birth rates.\nBut this is no longer the case and birth rates have been falling since 2011, feeding through into a lower total number of births by the middle of the decade. \nThe last time deaths outnumbered births was in 1976. \nIn that year, there were just under 681,000 deaths and about 5,000 fewer births. \nThe main driver was falling birth rates: the late 1960s and 1970s saw sharp falls in the number of live births in the UK. \nThere has been some relationship between the state of the economy and the number of births and the low levels in the 70s coincided with a faltering economy. \nBut the biggest reason for the sharp change was the widespread availability of contraception and the legalisation of abortion in the UK in the late 60s. \nIt is likely that more Britons died than were born during some years of the World Wars, with the smallest gap between the two in 1940, the year of the Blitz. \nBut deaths of military personnel who died abroad are not included in the UK death registration figures charted above.

      "text": "The Bank of England has shrugged off concerns over a pick-up in inflation as the economy recovers from the pandemic.\nConsumer price inflation hit a two-year high of 2.1% in the year to May, exceeding the Bank's 2% target.\nIn its latest statement, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it expected inflation to go above 3% \"for a temporary period\".\nThe MPC voted 9-0 to keep interest rates steady at the historic low of 0.1%.\nRates have been unchanged since March last year, when they were reduced to help contain the economic shock of Covid-19.\n\"Financial market measures of inflation expectations suggest that the near-term strength in inflation is expected to be transitory,\" the Bank said.\nHigh inflation is \"transitory\" and has not yet affected the need for ongoing stimulus of the economy - that is the judgement of the Bank of England's key interest rate-setting committee.\nThe recovery around the world has been stronger than expected and the UK's growth prospects this year have been upgraded. House prices are strongly up in the year. However, uncertainty over the impact on the economy of the withdrawal of furlough support, the new pandemic variant and other factors means they are keeping their foot on the accelerator pedal. \nOnly departing chief economist Andy Haldane sounded a note of caution, saying the Bank should buy \u00a350bn less in government bonds. He was again outvoted 8-1.\nThe bounce back is certainly real, but there is a statistical fog about what actually happens in this unprecedented situation. The Bank's decision-makers have decided to wait and see what actually happens to jobs and growth, rather than act now on inflation. The reopening bounce back is not a boom. Not yet.\nThe Bank said it now expected the UK economy to recover faster than it had previously predicted.\nIt said output in June was now expected to be about 2.5% below its pre-Covid level.\n\"Output in a number of sectors is now around pre-Covid levels, although it remains materially below in others.  The housing market remains strong, and indicators of consumer confidence have increased,\" it said. \nThe MPC said the direct economic implications of delaying the final relaxation of Covid restrictions to 19 July were likely to be \"relatively small\" compared with the impact of previous stages.\n\"The Committee's central expectation is that the economy will experience a temporary period of strong GDP growth and above-target CPI inflation, after which growth and inflation will fall back,\" it added. \n\"There are two-sided risks around this central path, and it is possible that near-term upward pressure on prices could prove somewhat larger than expected.  \n\"Taking together the evidence from financial market measures and surveys of households, businesses and professional forecasters, the Committee judges that UK inflation expectations remain well anchored.\"\nMPC members also voted 8-1 to continue with the Bank's existing asset purchase scheme, maintaining its bond-buying target at \u00a3895bn.\nLuke Bartholomew, senior economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, highlighted the fact that departing chief economist Andy Haldane was once again the dissenting voice on the Bank's quantitative easing programme, voting for a reduction in bond purchases.\n\"It will be extremely interesting to see who replaces [Mr] Haldane in the chief economist role following his imminent departure,\" he said.\n\"It is likely the Bank will drift back into a more relaxed tone on the transitory nature of any inflation pressure once [Mr] Haldane's voice and vote has moved on.\" "

      "text": "A paper-based vaccine \"passport\" could be available in Northern Ireland as early as 5 July, the Department of Health has said.  \nAccording to a statement, the initial specialised hard copy format will go live by 19 July at the latest.  \nThe department says this will provide alignment with processes in the Republic of Ireland.  \nIt has also been announced that 16 areas have been added to Northern Ireland's green list for travel.\nMalta, the Balearic Islands - including Majorca and Ibiza - and Barbados are among the areas that will come on to the list from the early hours of Wednesday, 30 June, meaning people can travel to and from those places without having to quarantine as long as they provide proof of negative Covid-19 tests.\nThe department's vaccine passport announcement is aimed towards the goal of having an internationally-recognised form of proof that a person has had both vaccine doses.  \nIt is expected the process of applying and receiving the hard copy certification will take 10 days.  \nThe certificate will incorporate counterfeit protection measures, requiring a specialised printing process.  \nDan West, the Department of Health's chief digital information officer, said the certificate would \"complement the UK's existing traffic light system for international travel\".\n\"While final decisions have still to be taken on how and when these vaccine certificates will be used, they are expected to make foreign travel easier for people who have had both doses.\n\"Governments and businesses may also decide to use them in other circumstances, such as access to events and activities. \n\"Such decisions have still to be made here in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.\"\nA digital format is expected to be available by mid-August. It will support evidence of negative PCR tests, as an alternative to proof of vaccination.  \nMr West said Northern Ireland's lack of a pre-existing health service app meant the department was \"building our system from scratch\".\nNo part of the health service in Northern Ireland, including GPs and vaccination centres, could provide proof of vaccine to the required standard for travel purposes.  \nThe travel news comes after it emerged earlier that anyone over the age of 18 could now book a Covid-19 jab at any of Northern Ireland's vaccine centres.\nThe centres had been focused on vaccinating those aged between 18 and 39, with over 40s only able to get the jab at community pharmacies.\nThe centres are using the Pfizer vaccine for first doses. A scheduled increase in Northern Ireland's Pfizer supply has allowed for more appointment availability\nDr Patricia Donnelly, head of Northern Ireland's Covid vaccination programme, said that while 80% of the adult population had received their first dose and 60% their second dose \"there's more to do and the elta variant identifies what we have to do\".\n\"We're trying to pick up the pace for that, because, while it's reassuring to hear there's no rise in serious illness, we should not take any of this for granted,\" she added.\nShe said while 50% of under 30s had been vaccinated \"it has very definitely slowed\".\n\"Every Thursday we'll release over 20,000 slots. In the first couple of weeks a lot of those were booked out in a day or two and then last week a bit slower than that and we're concerned that we're getting fewer people coming forward,\" Dr Donnelly said.\n\"Each trust is looking at where they could have opportunities to set up a mobile clinic and vaccinate these younger people.\"\nShe said there was also concern that some people in the 40-49 age group had still not come forward for their vaccine.\nIn a separate development, enhanced testing sites are to be set up in areas of Castlewellan, County Down, and in Londonderry after \"a number of probable cases of the Delta variant were identified\", the Public Health Agency (PHA) has said. \nThe PHA's Dr Br\u00edd Farrell said it was a \"precautionary measure\" and asymptomatic people aged 18-40, from selected targeted neighbourhoods, would be asked to come forward for testing. \n\"By slowing the spread of the virus, this allows us to get more people in the community vaccinated and get protected against Covid-19 which is effective against the Delta variant,\" Dr Farrell said.\nTwo mobile testing units are located at Derry's Templemore Sports Complex and at Glendermott Church of Ireland. \nA drive-through testing facility is also available at the Lycra company car park and a walk-in facility has been set up at Ulster University's Magee Campus on the Northland Road. \nThose being asked to come forward for testing will be contacted, by post, from Friday. \nMeanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann said he has been contacted by people over the age of 40 who wanted to book their jab in a vaccine centre.\n\"The vaccination programme has already reached about 80% of 40-49-year-olds,\" said Mr Swann.\n\"I believe today's announcement will help push that figure up even higher.\"\nThe minister urged everyone to come forward for their jab as soon as possible, adding: \"The emergence and spread of the Covid-19 Delta variant demonstrates that the virus remains a serious threat.\"\nNorthern Ireland has seven trust-run vaccination centres, located in Belfast, Londonderry, Omagh, Enniskillen, Craigavon and Ballymena."

      "tags": "Disability,Capita,Mental health",
      "text": "Too many people in Northern Ireland have had claims for their Personal Independence Payment (PIP) \"unfairly rejected\", an investigation has found.\nThe damning report conducted by the Public Services Ombudsman Margaret Kelly was published on Thursday.\nIt found that applicants were kept \"in the dark\" by the Department for Communities and Capita, which carries out PIP assessments.  \nThe communities minister said she was \"committed\" to \"positive change\".\nCapita said it will review the findings of the report. \nPIP replaced Disability Living Allowance (DLA) in 2016. \nMs Kelly's office carried out a 20-month investigation into complaints about the new system, which provides benefits to some of the most vulnerable in society. \nIn her report, she stated that \"repeated opportunities were missed to make the right payment as early as possible in the process\".\nIt found that both the department and Capita often failed to seek and use further evidence, including that from medical professionals, in its assessments.\nThis meant claimants had to \"continually challenge the decision, often all the way to appeal, before the correct decision was made\", the report stated. \nIt said the repeated nature of these failings constituted \"systemic maladministration\". \nLondonderry woman Sinead Quinn, who lives with both physical and mental health conditions, said she was not surprised by the findings of the report.\nShe first applied for PIP in 2018 at a time when her health was \"particularly fragile\". \nIn the years since, her experience of the system has been \"absolutely horrific\". \n\"Every step of the way it is, in my opinion, set up to put people off,\" she told BBC Radio Foyle.\nIt is a process that is \"distressing and terrifying\", she said.\nThree years ago she was awarded PIP after being assessed twice - after assessors lost her first assessment, she was called back three weeks later to undergo the process again.\nEarlier this year, she was reassessed during a one-hour phone call. It led to her payment being slashed.\nIt was \"intrusive, cold and calculated\", she said.\nMs Quinn added: \"To be able to go on the telephone with someone you don't know, as someone who struggles with mental health problems, is a massive challenge.\"\nShe said that the process involved \"very personal questions about how your disabilities affect you\" and that the people were \"not actually taking into consideration what you are saying\". \nShe recalled breaking down three times during the assessment.\n\"But my mental health was absolutely fine according to the assessor,\" Ms Quinn said.\n\"How the decision was reached was completely inadequate. \n\"They didn't even ask for any medical history from my GP. I have no idea how a one-hour conversation can give you a window into someone's health for the last three years, or into the next three years,\" she said.\nThe ombudsman advised Capita and the department to \"shift their focus to ensure that they get more of the PIP benefit decisions right the first time, so that the most vulnerable people in our society get access to the support that they need, when they need it\". \nMs Kelly said this would also safeguard public resources by reducing both the time and costs associated with examining the same claim on multiple occasions.\nAmong the investigation's findings were: \nFoyle MLA Mark H Durkan, of the SDLP, described the report as \"unequivocal proof of systemic maladministration\". \nA persistent critic of the PIP system, Mr Durkan said the \"the system is plagued by a litany of failures, inherent deficiencies and is not fit for purpose\". \n\"The report is scathing on Capita's performance and questions really now need to be asked of Minister [Deidre] Hargey as to why she has extended their contract for a further two years,\" Mr Durkan said. \n\"Ultimately, people are not getting the support or dignity they deserve,\" he added.\nIn a statement, Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said she was \"firmly committed to enacting positive change in PIP delivery\".\nMs Hargey said her department has \"consistently demonstrated that commitment by taking forward recommendations from statutory reviews previously carried out by Walter Rader and Marie Cavanagh\". \n\"I remain open to scrutiny and welcome the opportunity to drive further improvements in the service to ensure it is delivered in a compassionate and empathetic manner,\" she added.\nIn a statement, Capita said: \"We strive to continuously improve the PIP assessment process that we deliver on behalf of the department. \n\"We are committed to delivering a professional, efficient and kind service for every PIP applicant we assess.\"\nSamantha Gallagher, who helps claimants with PIP issues, said she was not shocked by the report's findings as she finds the claims process very difficult.\nMs Gallagher, who works at Community Advice in Fermanagh, said medical evidence was being \"disregarded by assessors\" and she cited an example of one claimant whose PIP award was substantially increased on appeal.\n\"It beggars belief that weight wasn't given to letters coming from consultants and neurologists and GPs - there are no words at times,\" she told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\nMs Gallagher said she believed the claims process was designed to be difficult to discourage fraudulent claims, but added that the majority of claimants were in genuine need and were suffering as a result. \n\"What we need to remember here is this is a health-related benefit - so it's about people who have ill health.  They need respect, they need to be treated with dignity,\" she said.\n\"So far from what we can see, especially from the outcomes of this report, that has not been happening.   We just need to remember we're dealing with people, not numbers.\" "

      "text": "\"I don't look in the mirror. I prefer to hide the whole thing from myself.\"\nJanet Harris, 64, has been waiting a year for breast reconstruction surgery after her breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent mastectomy.\nThe Covid pandemic meant many procedures have been prioritised or restricted since March 2020 and Ms Harris said people needed more reconstructions to resume.\nSwansea Bay University Health Board said it apologised for the delay.\nJanet, from Llanmaes, Vale of Glamorgan, has been on the surgery waiting list since January 2020 and said not having the procedure has knocked her confidence.\n\"It's part of one's innate femininity. It's different for different women, but it's actually difficult to feel complete, to feel whole,\" she said.\nShe has made her plea on behalf of all the women needing what is known as a microvascular reconstruction.\nJanet described her breast cancer diagnosis as her \"worst nightmare\" and said being offered a reconstruction \"sort of sweetened the situation\". \nShe was advised of the different options available, which are tailored to each persons' individual needs, but she needs more complex surgery due to the radiotherapy and chemotherapy she had during treatment.\nShe will have a delayed microvascular reconstruction - after initially being told the wait would be a year, she has now been waiting 17 months and does not know when she will get the operation. \nThe procedure will be done at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, the only hospital in Wales offering the specialist reconstruction surgery.\nJanet said, while she understands the challenges the pandemic has brought, she was desperate for answers. \nShe said: \"I think we all knew with the Covid situation, that had to take priority, that everything else had to take a back seat. But now that things are different, I do think that it should start again.\"\nThe British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons said this type of microvascular surgery has restarted in some areas of England, although the picture varied widely.  \nImplant-based breast reconstruction is being done in Wales.  \nJanet said: \"It was two years ago that I had a mastectomy and all that time my goal was that this would be the end point. \n\"I'd get my body back and then be able to move on in life, so I think that's what makes it difficult. Just waiting.\n\"My plea is that they start doing it again and it's not just for me. \n\"There are lots of other women on that list and some of them obviously have waited longer than I have and their stories... they may have gone through a lot more than I have so it's for everybody who's in that situation, that the people who have the power to actually restart it, do so.\"\nSwansea Bay health board said: \"Covid has meant we are not only dealing with a backlog of patients from the past 15 months, we are also experiencing higher numbers of patients with urgent and emergency surgical problems.\n\"This has resulted in a much-reduced operating theatre capacity for planned operations. The number of operations we can do each day is also impacted by the measures required to protect these areas from Covid.\n\"We are prioritising those who need surgery most urgently to prevent loss of life or limb.\n\"However, we completely understand that everyone who is waiting for surgery is anxious to know when this might take place, and everyone has a compelling reason why they need it.\n\"We also fully recognise the special significance that reconstructive surgery has for women and the distress the wait is causing.\"\nThe Welsh government said breast reconstruction surgery had continued throughout the pandemic, with patients being treated in order of clinical priority, based on Royal College guidelines.\nIt said \u00a3100m had been allocated to health boards to \"increase capacity and cut waiting times across primary, community and hospital care\"."

      "text": "A Royal Navy warship was \"sticking up for our values\" in an incident with Russian forces in disputed waters around Crimea, Boris Johnson has said.\nThe prime minister said the UK does not recognise Russia's annexation of Crimea and was pursuing freedom of navigation in international waters. \nMr Johnson denied UK relations with Russia were at an all-time low.\nHe refused to be drawn on whether he had personally authorised the HMS Defender voyage.\nBut the prime minister said it was \"wholly appropriate to use international waters\" to \"take the shortest route between two points and that's what we did\".\nIt was \"very important\" countries around the world continue to carry out manoeuvres \"sticking up for our values, sticking up for what we believe in,\" he said on a visit to an Army barracks in Aldershot, Hampshire.\nThis would include \"democracy, human rights, equalities and the rule of law, and freedom of navigation,\" Mr Johnson added.\nOn Wednesday more than 20 Russian aircraft and two coastguard ships shadowed HMS Defender as it was sailing off the coast of Crimea. \nMoscow's defence ministry said a patrol ship fired warning shots and a jet dropped bombs in the Royal Naval ship's path. \nBut the UK government rejected Russia's account of the incident and denied that any warning shots had been fired.\n Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has set out the UK's version of what happened in a written statement to MPs:\n\"At no point were warning shots fired at HMS Defender, nor bombs dropped in her path as has been asserted by the Russian authorities,\" said the defence secretary.\nThe UK's defence attache was \"invited to a meeting in the Russian Ministry of Defence\" in response to the incident, he added, but HMS Defender would continue with her planned deployment and programme of visits.\n\"The Royal Navy will always uphold international law and will not accept unlawful interference with innocent passage,\" said Mr Wallace in his statement, adding that the UK and Nato allies had \"enjoyed a routine maritime presence in the Black Sea for many years\". \nThe dramatic scenes were captured by members of the British media, who had been invited on to HMS Defender, leading some to question if it was part of deliberate effort to win the so-called \"information warfare\" between the East and the West. \nThe BBC's defence correspondent, Jonathan Beale, who is on board, said that just days before Defender set sail towards Crimea, an agreement was signed on the ship for the UK to help build warships for neighbouring Ukraine.\nBut he said the trip was also about \"information operations\" for the UK, with \"journalists on board here with large audiences who can reach a lot of people\".\nAnd speaking on BBC Breakfast, former Nato Commander Rear Admiral Chris Parry said the incident was reminiscent of the \"huffing and puffing that used to take place\" in the past and amounted to \"bully boy tactics\" by Russia. \nHe said Moscow simply does not like Royal Naval ships like HMS Defender in the Black Sea going about their business near Russian naval bases and defending allies.\nThey are \"jealous\" and this is about \"real political power play\", he added. \nSpeaking on Radio 4's Today programme, chair of the defence select committee, Tobias Ellwood, said that while it was important not to get \"spooked\" by Russia's actions, threats have to be addressed.\nThe senior Conservative  said the incident illustrates the importance of upholding international standards, otherwise other \"errant states\" like China would exploit the situation to assert their might.\nAnd speaking in the Commons, Mr Ellwood said while it was right to defend and protect international waters, Britain will need a bigger navy in order to do so. \nHe said the Ministry of Defence had been right to send HMS Defender from Odessa to Georgia and told MPs he was \"picking up that perhaps not everybody in Whitehall was of a view that this was the path HMS Defender should have taken\". \nBut he said the events of this week have been \" a good warm up\" and he called on the MoD to \"continue in this vein\" and not be \"shied away by any other voices in government that might want us to take a more subservient route\".

That compares with 65% of people in the UK who have had the first dose and 47% who have had both.\nAirlines have taken differing approaches to cabin crew vaccinations. Earlier this week, US carrier United Airlines said that from August only fully vaccinated pilots and cabin crew would be allowed to work on flights to high risk destinations. \nIt would apply to flights operating in countries such as India, Brazil and Chile. \nUnited Airlines, as well as US rival Delta, are requiring that all new recruits joining from 15 June are fully vaccinated against Covid.

      "text": "A police officer has been found guilty of the manslaughter of ex-footballer Dalian Atkinson.\nThe former Aston Villa striker died after a stand-off with West Mercia police officers outside his father's home in Telford, Shropshire in 2016.\nPC Benjamin Monk, 43, was cleared at Birmingham Crown Court of an alternative charge of murder.\nMr Atkinson's family said justice had been done and hoped he would be remembered for his life, not his death.\nMonk was granted bail until his sentencing hearing at the same court on Monday, after being told a custodial sentence in his case was inevitable.\nHis trial had heard he tasered Mr Atkinson for 33 seconds and kicked him twice in the head.\nHe denied any wrongdoing and said he believed there was a danger to life for him and his colleague.\nMr Atkinson began his career at Ipswich Town before moving to Sheffield Wednesday, Real Sociedad and Aston Villa.\nFollowing a six-week-trial, jurors took 18 hours and 48 minutes to reach unanimous verdicts on Monk, who has 14 years' service.\nIn a statement, Mr Atkinson's family said he was \"much missed\" by his family and friends and the footballing communities of the clubs he played for.\n\"The past five years have been an ordeal for Dalian's family,\" they said.\n\"We are hugely relieved that the whole country now knows the truth about how Dalian died.\n\"While it has been hard for us not to be able to talk about the details of Dalian's death, it has been even harder to sit through this trial and to hear PC Monk try to justify the force he used.\"\nThey said his footballing talent \"led him to achieve great things in his life\".\n\"Our sincere hope is that now that the truth about his death is known, and justice has been done, we can start to remember him not for the manner in which he died, but for the way in which he lived,\" the statement added.\nFollowing the verdict, West Mercia Police Assistant Chief Constable Rachel Jones, said: \"Words alone cannot express the deep regret and shock I feel that I must stand here today because a West Mercia officer has been found to be criminally responsible for Dalian's death.\n\"I am sincerely sorry and extend my apologies and deep condolences to Dalian's family and friends.\"\nMr Atkinson's death, she said, has \"sent shock and sadness\" through the police service.\n\"Police officers come to work to serve their communities and keep the public safe,\" ACC Jones added. \n\"Our uniform should represent justice, public safety and the observance of the law.\n\"Those who wear it, as individuals, are also subject to those laws and should be held to the very highest standards of conduct and behaviour.\"\nShe said the force does not \"underestimate the impact of the case\" and will \"work hard to build and maintain the trust and confidence\" of the communities it serves.\nA \"fast-track misconduct process\" will be carried out following Monk's conviction, ACC Jones said.\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct, she said, had made a number of recommendations following Mr Atkinson's death, which have have been implemented.\nJurors are deliberating on an assault charge relating to Monk's colleague and former girlfriend, PC Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith, 31. \nThey were sent home for the day at about 15:30 BST and will resume deliberations at 10:00 on Thursday.\nThe trial heard how the two officers were called to Mr Atkinson's father's house in Meadow Close in the early hours of 15 August, where the the sportsman had been acting erratically.\nMonk told the court he ran in fear after Mr Atkinson, who appeared to be having a mental health crisis, made death threats and smashed a glass door pane.\nThe trial heard Monk had discharged his Taser three times at Mr Atkinson, twice unsuccessfully, but on the third time he overrode the system, holding down the trigger for 33 seconds - more than six times the standard deployment.\nDuring the trial, jurors were told Monk had not discharged a Taser during 2016 before firing it at Mr Atkinson's father's home.\nThe court was told although he had drawn a Taser four times that year, subjects had been compliant before the weapon was fired.\nThe officer claimed to have no recollection of placing his foot on Mr Atkinson's head as colleagues arrived at the scene.\nHowever he conceded he must have kicked the ex-footballer twice in the forehead, because bootlace prints proved he had.\nMonk maintained his actions were lawful self-defence, made necessary when the former Premier League star tried to get up.  \nMr Atkinson, who had a number of underlying health conditions, went into cardiac arrest after being taken from the scene in an ambulance, and was pronounced dead in hospital at 02:45 - about an hour after he was tasered. \nAccording to the charity Inquest, no police officer has been found guilty of murder or manslaughter over a death in custody or following police contact in England and Wales since the 1980s. \nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "US gun violence,Crime,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "President Joe Biden has unveiled a plan that includes funding more police to combat a nationwide surge in homicides, which he blamed on lax gun control.\nHe said officials in high crime areas can hire more law-enforcement personnel using coronavirus relief funding.\nMr Biden's crime-fighting strategy calls for curtailing rogue gun dealers and firearms trafficking.\nRepublicans are depicting Mr Biden's Democrats as weak on crime, amid calls by left-wingers to defund the police.\nAnnouncing his five-point strategy at the White House on Wednesday, the president urged cities and states to use $350bn (\u00a3250bn) of funding from a Covid-19 relief bill on public safety efforts, including adding more police officers, even beyond pre-pandemic levels.\n\"It means more police officers, more nurses, more counsellors, more social workers or community violence interrupters to help resolve issues before they escalate into crimes,\" the president said.\nSome members of Mr Biden's party have amplified calls by Black Lives Matter activists to defund the police, though the president himself has resisted the slogan, which is unpopular with most voters. \nMr Biden - who as a senator wrote a 1994 crime bill widely blamed for mass incarceration of black people - said on Wednesday: \"This is not a time to turn our backs on law enforcement or our communities.\"\nUnless tamed, the crime wave is likely to become a major issue ahead of next year's congressional mid-term elections.\nDuring his remarks at the White House, the president also took aim at armed insurrectionists, saying they would \"need F-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons\" to take on the US government.\nThe Biden administration has proposed gun control as a remedy for violent crime, although Democratic bills in Congress to limit Americans' access to firearms have been blocked by Republicans.\nThe administration's strategy also proposes investing in community violence intervention programmes, employment opportunities and summer activities for teenagers and young adults, and support for formerly incarcerated Americans re-entering their communities. \nThe president recently hosted several big city mayors at the White House for a discussion on crime prevention.\nIn March, the FBI released preliminary 2020 statistics showing a significant jump - 25% - in murders from the year before. So far, the upward trend has continued into 2021. \nThe bureau will release its official numbers in September. If early projections bear out, it will be one of the largest homicide increases ever reported.\n\"This was a large scale national increase in violence,\" Jeff Asher, co-founder of AH Datalytics and a former analyst for the CIA and Department of Defense, told the BBC.\nSome analysts have blamed the wave of homicides on the Covid-19 pandemic, although research indicates that global crime rates outside the US fell or were stable amid all the lockdowns.\nOther analysts see the cause as low police morale after the murder of George Floyd last year in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the ensuing civil unrest that swept US cities.\nA University of Utah study pinpointed the spike in US homicides to late May 2020, when Mr Floyd was killed by an officer.\nBut even with this steep rise, the murder rate is still far lower than in the early 1990s, when it was almost double the current figure.\nAnd crime overall - including rapes, robbery and other property crime - dropped by about 6% in 2020, among the largest decreases on record. \nThere are a few political issues that, when they reach a boiling point, crowd out just about every other subject in national discussion.\nThe economy is one. Crime is another.\nAnd while things seem to be looking fairly good for Joe Biden on the former, an uptick in violent crime could be a serious challenge for Democrats ahead of next year's mid-term elections.\nCriminal statisticians will point out that the current murder rates are still low compared to previous decades, including the 1990s, when Biden - then a senator - made \"getting tough on crime\" one of his top issues. \nThe general public, however, typically doesn't have such long-term perspective. \nRepublicans have offered an explanation - that the anti-law-enforcement rhetoric and \"defund the police\" efforts from last year's Black Lives Matters demonstrations have led to the current situation. \nOn Wednesday, Biden offered a counter-argument, that lax gun regulations are to blame, creating an environment where even minor arguments can turn deadly.\nHe also promised to boost funding for the police - a move that may anger some on the left. \nWith an eye on 2022, however, the White House may be calculating that inoculating itself from Republican attacks is worth the risk of intra-party unrest.\nGun sales increased last year, as did reports of domestic violence. According to Mr Asher, there was also evidence that Americans carried firearms more frequently in 2020. \nData on the causes of murders in 2020 is not yet widely available, Mr Asher said, but in 2019, 74% of homicides were gun-related.\nOn the eve of Mr Biden's speech, the Department of Justice announced a new team aimed at tackling gun trafficking in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington DC and San Francisco. \nIn New York City, Democratic politicians vying to become the next mayor have largely focused on the issue of law and order, which was widely condemned as a racial dog whistle when it was the theme of Republican former President Donald Trump's election campaign. Ex-police officer Eric Adams is currently in the lead as results are being tallied."

      "text": "The UK public should be urged by the government to protect the climate by eating less meat and dairy produce, advisers say.\nCattle are a major source of planet-heating gases, but ministers fear a backlash if they ask people to cut down on steak.\nBut the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says people should reduce meat-eating for their health, as well as for the planet.\nIt says the issue's one of many failings of a government which is delivering only a fifth of its pledges on climate change.\nPeople should be asked to eat 20% less meat and dairy produce by 2030, and 35% less by 2050, the CCC insists.\nThe CCC says Boris Johnson must devise evidence-based policies to encourage healthier diets and set clear targets.\nIts report says the PM's \"remarkable\" climate leadership is undermined by inadequate policies and poor implementation in many areas of policy.\nA government spokesman said its net zero strategy, due in the Autumn, would show where carbon cuts would be imposed across the economy. \nNet zero refers to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases as much as possible and then balancing out any remaining releases by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere - by, for example, planting trees.\nBut the committee complains that the public hasn't been engaged to make changes essential for protecting the climate. In addition to meat and dairy, they are:\nSales of new gas boilers should be stopped by 2033. People will mostly convert to heat pumps instead. This will involve disruption - and the CCC says ministers will have to subsidise the installation cost.\nCommittee members want to see taxes taken off clean electricity - and maybe shifted on to more polluting gas - although power bills for poor households should not rise.\nFrequent fliers will need to be curbed, the CCC believes. Even if low-carbon planes are developed, the UK still cannot let demand for aviation grow unconstrained.\nPeople will need to be consulted over changes ahead - perhaps by groups such as the UK climate assembly.\nThe report says the government currently lacks policies on these issues and many others. Waste and low-carbon heat networks are said to need policies too.\nThe committee chairman Lord Deben said the prime minister's commitments on the international stage to cut emissions 78% by 2035 are \"remarkable decisions\".\nHe added that the objective of achieving near zero emissions by 2050 sets a major example to other nations.\n\"The trouble,\" he said, is that the delivery has not been there. Almost all things that should have happened have either been delayed or not hit the mark. They need to step up very rapidly.\"\nThe CCC's chief executive Chris Stark said he was \"very concerned by the gulf between promises and actions\".\nHis report laid down some fundamental principles for the journey towards a near zero-carbon economy.\nIt urges the Treasury to protect the poorest from the cost of climate policies. It says: \"The net zero strategy must be underpinned by an approach that distributes the costs, savings and wider benefits of decarbonisation fairly.\n\"It must encourage action across society, while protecting vulnerable people and companies at risk of adverse impacts.\"\nA government spokesman said: \"Any suggestion we have been slow to deliver climate action is widely off the mark. Over the past three decades, we have driven down emissions by 44% - the fastest reduction of any G7 country.\n\"We have set some of the most ambitious targets in the world for the future.\n\"In recent months, we've made clear with record investment in wind power, a new UK Emissions Trading Scheme, \u00a35.2bn investment in flood and sea defences, clear plans to decarbonise heavy industry and North Sea oil, and businesses pledging to become net zero by 2050 or earlier.\n\"Our strategies this year will set out more of the very policies the Climate Change Committee is calling for as we redouble our efforts to end the UK's contribution to climate change.\"\nBut environmental group Friends of the Earth said: \"The committee's criticisms are spot on. Without a detailed strategy for combating the climate crisis, government promises to decarbonise the economy are simply more hot air.\n\"With no climate action plan and his government's support for more roads, runways and an overseas gas project, Boris Johnson risks being a laughing stock at the UN climate summit [which the UK is hosting].\"\nThe CCC insists ministers must commit all policies to a \"net zero test\" to ensure that decisions are compatible with the emissions targets.\nBut there is a Whitehall logjam of decarbonisation initiatives in the pipeline. They include the Environment Bill and several strategies for different sectors, such as a transport decarbonisation plan and a net zero aviation strategy.\nMr Stark says the environment Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is lagging with policies, and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government is failing to integrate climate change into the Planning Bill. \nAll these policies, though, are over-shadowed by the delayed Treasury net zero review, which will determine how much cash is invested into the projected zero-carbon economy.\nSome key policies are being delayed by the Treasury, and environmentalists fear that the Chancellor Rishi Sunak may be jockeying for influence with the climate sceptic wing of the Conservative Party by withholding funds needed for the PM's \"green revolution\". \nIt is a huge challenge for the Treasury, which will also need to take into account another recent CCC report warning that the nation unprepared for the inevitable impact of a heating climate on the UK. \nFollow Roger on Twitter."

      "title": "Covid in Scotland: Can we stop worrying about high case numbers?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,NHS Scotland,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Vaccination is offering Scotland the \"route out\" of the pandemic, according to Nicola Sturgeon. The first minister told MSPs this week that the link between new cases and the serious health harms caused by the virus hasn't gone away - but it is weakening significantly.\nScotland recorded 2999 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday - a record high. What do recent figures show us about this link? And does this mean we no longer have to worry about case numbers?\nCases are rising fast - and there are no signs yet that the rate of new infections is slowing.\nScotland had been enjoying a sustained decline in the number of new Covid-19 cases, but that all changed on 5 May.\nSince then, the number of new Covid cases per day has mainly been rising, and at an increasing pace in recent days.\nOn 5 May, the number of cases detected over the previous seven days was 1,046. By 23 June, this figure had gone up to 11,067 - a 10-fold increase.\nScotland also has the highest case rate among all of the UK nations, reaching almost 203 cases per 100,000 people on Wednesday.\nThe sharp rise is being driven by the more infectious Delta variant, first identified in India, which accounts for more than 90% of new cases in the UK, according to the UK government.\nHowever, the Scottish government says fewer people are being treated in hospital for Covid illness now and fewer people are dying, despite this increase.\nIn short, yes.\nBut according to the government's analysis, only about 5% of people who are infected end up in hospital, rather than the 10% we were seeing before vaccination started to offer us protection.\nPeople are also staying hospital for shorter periods after being admitted.\nThe easiest way to see this is in a graph which shows the link between new cases and the number of people in hospital being treated for Covid.\nDuring the outbreaks in the autumn and over the winter, the daily figure on hospital occupancy has closely tracked the daily cases figure, but it's different this time.\nThe number of people in hospital is trending upwards, but the gap between the two lines is obvious.\nTo draw a comparison with the end of 2020, when the average number of new cases being recorded a day was similar to now, there were 1,174 Covid patients in hospital. On 23 June, there were 170.\nPublic Health Scotland publishes data on daily hospital admissions of people with a positive test for Covid, and again there appears to be a different pattern this time.\nOn 28 August, as the second wave took hold in Scotland, an average of seven people were being admitted a day. It was a similar figure on 5 May 2021, as the Delta variant began to drive a new wave of cases.\nThis next chart compares hospital admissions from those dates.\nFor the first three weeks there is not much difference at all between the two lines, but then the rate of new admissions in the autumn begins to rise at a much faster rate.\nThere is generally a lag of several weeks between new cases and Covid-related deaths, which means it is harder to draw firm conclusions on whether the link between the two figures is weakening.\nCertainly, the number of new death certificates mentioning Covid-19 in Scotland has been reasonably stable over the last few weeks.\nHowever, the rate of new deaths in the autumn did not begin to rise fast until the latter half of October - six to eight weeks after case numbers began going up.\nIn the seven days up to 6 September just two death certificates mentioned Covid-19, the lowest figure in any week since the pandemic began in Scotland.\nAfter that, weekly deaths began to rise, with 76 recorded in the seven days up to 18 October.\nLast week, there were 13 death certificates mentioning Covid-19, according to the National Records of Scotland - three weeks after this spring's low of four deaths in the middle of May.\nWhat happens to this rate in the next few weeks will give a clearer indication on how much the link with deaths has weakened.\nLinda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland she was expecting the number of deaths to go up.\n\"We will see more deaths if cases continue to increase and we're going to see those deaths in two groups - the unprotected by full vaccination and, in a small number of cases, people who have had both doses, because the vaccines are not 100% protective,\" she said. \n\"So I think it will go up, but I'm hoping that it won't go anywhere near where we were before.\"\nIn the first minister's statement to Holyrood on Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon announced a \"revised strategic framework\" for tackling Covid, which took into account the protection being offered by vaccination against Covid sickness.\nShe said that previously the Scottish government was intent on suppressing the virus to the \"lowest possible level\", but this has been replaced with an aim of suppressing the virus \"to a level consistent with alleviating its harms\".\nThis essentially means that higher numbers of cases will be tolerated than in past waves of the pandemic.\nThe Scottish government's new strategy reflects the latest guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) on public health and social measures to tackle Covid.\nIn this document, the WHO says the focus can shift from case numbers to hospital admissions and intensive care rates in countries where the most vulnerable are fully vaccinated - a position Scotland will be in by next week, according to the first minister.\nBut there is a balance to be struck here.\nIf case rates are allowed to get completely out of control, then pressure will inevitably increase on the NHS and more will die, Prof Bauld said.\n\"If we really see these numbers continue to increase, it's still going to translate into some hospital admissions and people becoming very unwell.\n\"So we've just got to hold the course for a few more weeks and try and send the behavioural message that this is not a free-for-all - we all need to do our bit.\"\nA high case rate also increases the risk of new variants of concern emerging - ones that are more infectious, more deadly or which are resistant to current vaccines.\nThe WHO's document says that some form of Covid restrictions - for example isolating after a positive test - will need to be used \"for the foreseeable future\".\n\"Things are improving but it's not going away,\" Prof Bauld said.\n\"Into the winter months we're still going to have to have some mitigations... there may be [restrictions] that are put in place again, rather than everything just continuing open indefinitely.\"\nAnd Prof Bauld also cautioned against governments coming up with an acceptable death rate for Covid-19.\n\"I think there's pressure on politicians to come up with a number of tolerable deaths from this disease in the future and quite rightly they're resisting that,\" she said.\n\"There are also these constant comparisons with flu which is unfortunate, because its much more deadly than influenza - and more transmissible.\"\nThe vaccination programme has been operating for more than six months and has been made possible thanks to the hundreds of people who give the jabs. If you are one of those vaccinators, we'd like to hear from you.

      "tags": "Universities,Students,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children",
      "text": "Only about a quarter of students in the UK thought they got good value for money from university in the pandemic.\nAn annual survey found students felt their fees and living costs were not justified by the disrupted teaching they received this academic year.\nStudents were particularly aggrieved by a lack of in-person teaching, found the survey of 10,000 students from the Higher Education Policy Institute.\nUniversities UK said the results were \"disappointing, albeit not surprising\".\nOne comment was: \"Fees have not changed even considering the changes made with Covid.\" Others included: \"Everything seems too high a price for what we are receiving\" and: \"Because of Covid I haven't met any of my classmates or tutor.\"\nThese were the lowest-ever satisfaction ratings in the survey going back to 2006, in a report produced by the higher education think tank and Advance HE.\nThere were 27% who thought they had good or very good value, down from 39% last year - with the pandemic putting much teaching online and students unable to socialise on campus for much of the year.\nStudents felt they had missed out on learning alongside other students and talking to staff face-to-face - and more than 40% wished they had either deferred a year or taken another course or gone to another university.\nThe worries about poor value included:\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson, responding at a Higher Education Policy Institute conference, suggested universities in England should have minimum entry grades - related to GCSEs - and this would be part of a consultation.\n\"Is it really in anyone's interest if entry requirements relax so much that an 18 year old who has not yet passed their English or maths GCSE should progress straight to an honours degree?\"\nA number of universities already have such an English and maths GCSE requirement for applicants - as well as the A-level or equivalent grades needed for specific courses.\nMr Williamson also promised to back efforts to tackle the \"scourge\" of essay mills, where students buy essays from online firms.\n\"It's definitely not been value for money,\" says Beth Stevens, a student at Lancaster University.\nShe only went to one in-person class in a first year so disrupted by the pandemic that she's decided to take this year again.\n\"I felt like I had imposter syndrome,\" she says, about the university year that \"didn't feel real\" - at home or online for much of the time and following a previous year in which she didn't take her cancelled A-levels.\n\"It was really hard to meet people,\" she says, and she would have much preferred to be taught in-person rather than online, where she found the teaching less effective. She also wanted to get involved in sports and that was difficult too.\nBeth says universities had promised a blend of online and face-to-face teaching, but in practice, for her geography course, it turned out to be much more online.\n\"They wanted us on campus - so they said there would be a blend,\" she says.\nOther students had many more lessons in class and she says that it was unfair to charge the same fees - students should receive a significant rebate on fees and rent, she says.\nShe's annoyed at what she sees as unfair treatment: \"I feel we've been shoved to one side. They just want us to shut up really.\"\nStudents in England, who pay the highest tuition fees in the UK of \u00a39,250, were the least likely to say they had good or very good value, at 24%.\nIn Wales, where fees are \u00a39,000, 29% said they had value for money and in Northern Ireland, where fees are \u00a34,530, 27% said it was good or very good value.\nHowever in Scotland, without tuition fees but with costs such as rent, 50% thought they were getting good or very good value from their courses.\nThere were also concerns about well-being. More than a quarter of students had considered leaving their course - and the biggest cause for this was worries about mental health.\nThe survey revealed differences in perceptions over racism - with white students much more likely to believe that their university was committed to tackling racism, while black students were less likely to be so convinced.\nNick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said it was important to \"capture students' real views in a year when students and staff have faced unprecedented challenges\".\nBut he said it was not all negative - with much high-quality teaching and learning, despite the disruptions that universities faced.\nNext year the amount of face-to-face teaching should increase, said Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK.\n\"It is valuable to hear student views on the past year which has been far from the 'usual' university experience,\" he said.\n\"This has been a very difficult time for students, which is why we recently made an additional \u00a385m available for those students most in need, on top of an existing \u00a3256m that universities can draw on,\" said Universities Minister Michelle Donelan.

      "tags": "Tornadoes,Czech Republic",
      "text": "A tornado has swept through several villages in the Czech Republic, killing five people and leaving more than 150 others injured.\nThursday night's storm blew the roofs off buildings in the south-eastern Breclav and Hodonin districts, uprooting trees and overturning cars.\nWinds of at least 219km/h (136 mph) were recorded and the worst-hit areas were said to look like a war zone.\n\"It's living hell,\" said South Moravia regional governor Jan Grolich.\nHail stones the size of tennis balls were reported, and local officials said a string of villages had suffered considerable damage along a 25km (15-mile) stretch of road heading from Breclav to Hodonin, to the north-east. \nIn the village of Valtice, on the other side of Breclav, Mayor Pavel Trojan said almost every building had been damaged by a bombardment of hail.\nThe government said around 1,000 homes had been affected and local authorities were working to provide accommodation for people whose roofs had been destroyed.\nMichaela Bothov\u00e1, a spokeswoman for the South Moravian rescue service, told Czech TV that dozens of people had been taken to hospital by medical services. Initial reports spoke of three deaths but Czech police said later the number had risen to five.\nThe images of devastation in villages in the Hodonin area are simply jaw-dropping. \nIn one video, the camera pans across an apocalyptic landscape; cars are dumped like toys on piles of twisted steel. Planks of wood have been sprinkled on the ground like matchsticks. \n\"My lovely little car is in there, somewhere,\" says one man, filming on his phone in a car park in front of what had been some sort of factory. \n\"If it's mine. You can't really tell to be honest\" - the singsong Moravian cadence in his voice giving away the location of this disaster. \nThe indistinct voices around him are punctuated by the repetitive beep-beep-beep of an alarm. Black smoke billows from something burning a short distance away. \nThis is South Moravia, land of undulating hills and vineyards. But not as we know it.\nRescue teams from across the country, as well as from neighbouring Austria and Slovakia, have been deployed and tens of thousands of people have been left without power.\nPrime Minister Andrej Babis, who is in Brussels for an EU summit, described what had happened as an apocalypse.\nAt least a third of the houses in the village of Hrusky, with a population of 1,600 people, were destroyed by the tornado. Only 15% of buildings had been untouched, said deputy mayor Marek Babisz.\n\"The church is without the tower, the elementary school has no roof and insulation any more, only walls remained from what were houses,\" he told Czech public radio.\nThe tornado and hailstones struck the border town of Hodonin, damaging an old people's home and destroying the local zoo. Vineyards in the area were also damaged.\nThe situation looked like a battlefield, said Antonin Tesarik, the director of Hodonin's hospital, where many of the injured were treated.\n\"It was an apocalypse. There was blood everywhere and helpless people in tears. They saved their lives and lost the roofs over their heads,\" CTK news agency quoted him as saying.\nThe tornado also caused severe traffic disruptions and power outages, blocking entire motorways and leaving more than 100,000 homes without electricity overnight.\nIn a tweet, Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamacek described the situation as very serious, saying that all available rescue units were being sent to the scene.\nThe minister, who has arrived in the disaster-hit region, said a state of emergency had been declared.\nBBC Weather forecaster Ben Rich explains\nTornadoes aren't as rare as you might imagine in Europe - it's thought a few hundred touch down across the continent every year. Exact estimates vary, though, and some almost certainly go unreported as they hit in sparsely populated rural areas.\nTornadoes have been reported in every continent on Earth except Antarctica - and even there they are theoretically possible.\nBut the US sees the most tornadoes of all, with more than 1,000 per year on average. The country also records more of the most violent twisters than anywhere else in the world.\nIts mountainous landscape and proximity to the warm, moist Gulf of Mexico give the perfect conditions for violent supercell thunderstorms to form. And these are the storms that give birth to tornadoes."

Climate, or eco anxiety as some people call it, is a very normal response to a real situation.\"\n\"The government should not see this as something that is just a problem for young people - the other way of actually tackling climate anxiety is to do something about climate change.\"\nRegular surveys by Cardiff University's school of psychology have shown a big shift in people's attitude to climate change in recent years - with 40% of those polled across the UK now saying they are \"very or extremely worried\" about it.\nA third said it triggered feelings of anxiety, fear or outrage.\nPlaid Cymru's spokeswoman on climate change, Delyth Jewell, said she wanted to see more guidance for teachers to recognise signs of climate anxiety and a more solution-focused curriculum with funding allocated to \"collective action projects\".\n\"Unless we do something to halt this sense of anxiety and unease and powerlessness [in our young people] it's only going to grow,\" she said.\nThe Welsh government said it had strengthened the key concepts of the new school curriculum \"to enable better teaching and learning about the climate emergency\".\nA spokesman said the government had supported Eco Schools and Size of Wales - two \"well-established, pupil-led climate and environmental educational programmes for schools across Wales\" for several years.\n\"These programmes go further than just classroom activity, supporting children and young people to take climate action, engage with policy development and have their voices heard.\"\nClimate change and the environment are on the agenda more than ever in Wales. \nAll road schemes in Wales are set to be reviewed and a new law to tackle air pollution will be introduced in this term of the Welsh Parliament.\nBut, while Wales is also aiming to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, question marks have been raised over whether the nation is on track for this target. \nSo what would you ask Wales' Climate Change Minister, Julie James? \nUse this form to send us your suggestions: \nIf you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of the BBC website to submit your question on this topic.

      "title": "Buckingham Palace reveals 8.5% ethnic minority staff",
      "tags": "UK Royal Family,BAME communities,Queen Elizabeth II",
      "text": "Buckingham Palace has said it \"must do more\" as it revealed its levels of ethnic minority staff for the first time.\nThe Royal Household's annual financial accounts for 2020-21 show 8.5% of its staff are from an ethnic minority background. Its 2022 target is 10%.\nThis compares with around 13% of the UK population, according to the latest 2011 census.\nThe Palace said it was \"not where it would like to be\" on staff diversity.\n\"It is not that we have not been progressing diversity and inclusion initiatives during this period, it is that simply the results have not been what we would like,\" a Palace source said.\nThey said the household had published the figures so there could be \"no place to hide\", and so they would be held accountable if no progress was made in the future.\nThe source added: \"Her Majesty and other members of the Royal Family have actively promoted and embraced the diversity of our nation and that of the Commonwealth, and we take our lead from that.\"\nIn London, where the majority of royal workers are based, just under 40% of the population is from an ethnic minority - but 8.5% of the royal staff are.\n\"Could do better\" is the Palace's own verdict. \"We recognise we are not where we want to be and we want to improve,\" a senior Palace source said.\nNext year's target is 10%.\nBut change may be hard to achieve. \nWhile public funding has remained steady, the extra money the monarch made from things like paid visits to the palaces fell by half. A \u00a310m shortfall was covered by cutting back on some events like garden parties and by a recruitment freeze. \nWithout new faces it is difficult to change the profile of household staff; and the Palace reckons that Covid restrictions will hit its supplementary income for some time to come. \nRaj Tulsiani, co-founder of Race Equality Matters, said the Palace did not \"deserve a pat on the back\" for saying it hopes to improve.\n\"Amplifying aspirations for future inclusion, it's nothing. It's just words,\" he said.\nPointing out that there was no breakdown of the 8.5% figure, he suggested there could be a \"vastly higher percentage of people in lower paid jobs than there are in positions of power and influence\".\nGraham Smith, chief executive officer of campaign group Republic, which calls for an elected head of state, welcomed the publication of the data but said staff were \"not protected from race discrimination\".\n\"There is no justification why anyone should be given an exemption from workplace discrimination laws, particularly our head of state,\" he said.\nThe release of the data comes more than three months after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex made allegations of racism within the Royal Family.\nPrince Harry and Meghan's interview with Oprah Winfrey in March included claims they had been asked how dark their son's skin would be before his birth.\nThe duchess said there had been \"concerns and conversations about how dark [Archie's] skin might be when he was born\".\nBoth Prince Harry and Meghan refused to say who made the comment - but Harry later clarified to Oprah that it was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh.\nIn response, Buckingham Palace described those issues as particularly \"concerning\", saying they would be \"taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately\".\nThe Duke of Cambridge later said the royals were \"very much not a racist family\" in response to questions about the interview.\nBuckingham Palace introduced a change to its Diversity Strategy in early 2020, before the interview, to emphasise inclusion.\nAfter the Winfrey interview, sources said Buckingham Palace was reviewing diversity policies across all royal households.\nThe work is looking at improving diversity at Buckingham Palace, Clarence House - the Prince of Wales's household - and Kensington Palace - Prince William's household. \nA Clarence House senior spokesperson said its proportion of ethnic minority staff was also 8%, adding: \"It isn't good enough and we are determined to do better.\"\nKensington Palace has not released its staff diversity figures.\nRoyal sources have previously stressed that the Palace already has policies, procedures and programmes in place - but possible changes being considered include the appointment of a \"diversity chief\".\nThe royal accounts are published annually to detail how the yearly payment the Queen receives from the government, known as the Sovereign Grant, is spent.\nLast year the grant was \u00a385.9m - the equivalent of \u00a31.29 per person in the UK.\nThe money pays for official royal duties and property maintenance.\nThe payment is based on the profits of the Crown Estate, an independent property business that includes much of London's West End.\nNormally the Queen receives 15% of the profits. However, that has been increased to 25% until 2027 to help pay for a \u00a3369m refurbishment of Buckingham Palace."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Progress is being made to \"close the gap\" in the uptake of Covid vaccines, with more people from ethnic minority backgrounds booking jabs, the medical director of primary care for NHS England has said.\nBut Dr Nikki Kanani - who is also a working GP - said the government was not \"tackling all of the hesitancy\". \nShe said NHS staff were now preparing a \"weekend of walk-ins\" to get jabs done.\nMore than 60% of the adult population in the UK has now had both doses.\nSpeaking during a Downing Street briefing, Dr Kanani said that between mid-March and mid-June, uptake rose from 75% to 86% among Asian people and from 55% to 68%  for black people.\nShe said the vaccine programme was \"overwhelmingly positive\", but added: \"We know some people are still anxious about coming forward for their vaccine.\"\n\"It's never too late to come forward and take up your vaccine,\" she said.\n\"Your vaccine has a name on it, it's for you and it's an evergreen offer.\"\nWalk-in appointments over the weekend would make it \"easier than ever\" to get a jab, she added - and the NHS was contacting over-40s to tell them they can bring their second appointments forward to eight weeks.\nVaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told the briefing the government was \"intensifying\" efforts and was on a \"mission\" to \"get as many people protected\" as \"quickly as we can\".\n\"We're honing in on areas where uptake is lower,\" he said, citing London as an example. \nMr Zahawi said the delay to the further easing of restrictions in England until 19 July was saving lives and \"allowing us to get more second jabs into arms.\"\nThe UK has reported a further 19 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard - and a further 16,135 cases, an increase of nearly 5,000 on Tuesday's reported figure.\nAnd the number of people in hospital with Covid has reached 1,508 on the most recent count, taken on Monday.\nThe message is clear - come forward for the jab.\nWith cases rising - the 16,135 new cases on Wednesday is the highest since early February - the race is on to get as many people double-dosed as possible.\nIt has been clear for a number of weeks that infection levels are on the upwards trajectory - and that is resulting in increasing hospital admissions, albeit at a slower rate than in previous waves.\nDuring the winter, around 10% of positive cases ended up in hospital 10 days later.\nAt the moment this looks to be around 3%, showing the impact vaccines are having.\nBut if cases keep rising as they are, it's possible we will see in excess of 1,000 admissions a day later in the summer - what the NHS would see for all types of respiratory illness in the middle of a bad winter.\nThe hope is the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme will start to flatten the wave soon. \nThe more people that are vaccinated, the greater the chance of that happening quickly.\nPublic Health England's head of immunisation Dr Mary Ramsay, also speaking at the briefing, said case numbers had been increasing since early June \"in line with the increased transmission\" of the Delta variant - which was first identified in India - but were much lower than they were during the second wave.\nShe said the higher number of daily cases reported on Wednesday was \"largely contributed by\" surge testing taking place in Scotland. \nAnd it was confirmed that the number of new Scottish cases of Covid reported in the latest figures is the highest daily total for the nation at any stage of the pandemic.\nOn Wednesday, 2,969 cases were reported compared to a previous high of 2,649 on 7 January. \nThe new cabinet secretary for health, Humza Yousuf, told BBC Scotland that the data showed that case numbers were in a period of \"exponential growth\", but that the government needed to focus on monitoring the link to levels of hospitalisation.\nEarlier, Downing Street said the government and Public Health England were monitoring the so-called Delta plus variant of Covid-19.\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said there had been 41 cases of the mutation, with extra measures in place where it had been found.\nAsked by the BBC's Adina Campbell whether official guidance should be updated to reflect reports of symptoms including headaches and runny noses with this variant, Dr Ramsay said she was not \"convinced yet\".\n\"I don't think any evidence that we are missing cases,\" she said.\nDr Ramsay also said there had been a fall in the uptake of other vaccines during the pandemic.\nShe urged those who needed meningitis and shingles jabs to book appointments and said some babies were behind on their six-in-one and MMR vaccines. \nSchool immunisation programmes, such as the one to protect against HPV, had \"struggled\" following school closures during lockdown, she added."

We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nSpain's Balearic Islands, Malta, Madeira and Barbados are among the places being added to the UK's green travel list - meaning people can return from those countries without needing to quarantine. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced that the destinations will be added to the green list from 04:00 BST on 30 June. All the additions, with the exception of Malta, have also been added to the green watchlist - along with Israel and Jerusalem. This means they are in danger of going from green to amber.\nWhile UK nations are updating their travel lists Europe is bracing itself for a surge from the Delta variant - thought to be between 40% and 60% more transmissible. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned the continent is \"on thin ice\" and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has said the variant, first identified in India, would account for 90% of EU cases by late August. Mrs Merkel said the rest of the EU should follow Germany's lead by quarantining arrivals from the UK.\nRishi Sunak has said the situation is looking good for the end of restrictions in England on 19 July, adding that it was his \"strong expectation\" that society could then \"get back to normal\". The chancellor told the Times he expects to stop wearing a face mask \"as soon as possible\" after it is no longer legally required in England. A decision is set to be made over the next few weeks about the final easing of restrictions. \nAndrew Lloyd Webber and other members of the live music industry are taking legal action to force the government to hand over the results of its live event pilot scheme. Test audiences have attended events like the FA Cup final and Download Festival as part of the Events and Research Programme. Organisers had expected the findings to be made public last week but publication was delayed. Lord Lloyd-Webber said the government's actions were \"forcing theatre and music companies off a cliff\".\nA 74-year-old man dubbed the skipping Sikh for starring in exercise videos during lockdown has been made an MBE. Rajinder Singh launched his fitness videos after becoming concerned that members of his community could become isolated due to the Sikh temples closing during the pandemic. He helped raise more than \u00a314,000 for NHS charities and was honoured at St James's Palace on Wednesday.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nAnd with the UK's green travel list being updated, here is a reminder of what you need to know when travelling to some of Europe's biggest holiday destinations.\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

Some people have kept that second job and given up the job they were furloughed from.\"\nDi Rusling, who runs about 30 self-catering properties around the village, is also experiencing staff shortages.\nShe says: \"We would usually try and do some lets for three or four nights, but this year can only do seven night lets or longer due to the changeovers. \n\"There just isn't the staff to be able to manage that part of the business.\"\nLast year, post-lockdown, some tourism hotspots became crowded and communities spoke out about a lack of facilities to cope with the demand.\nWill describes the popularity of Wester Ross as a \"mixed blessing\".\nHe says: \"There was definitely elevated pressure [last year], but on the other hand I think the community has been fairly shut down for over a year now and it's really good to have a bit of business back and a little bit more activity.\"\nDi says there was \"a lot of negativity\" last year around tourism, though agrees some concerns about excessive numbers of visitors remain. \nBut she says: \"The village really needs to have visitors to survive.\"\nRobert is also keen to find the positives in the area's popularity.\nHe says it is \"shining a light\" on a part of the country which had been forgotten until recently. \n\"I think very much the positives outweigh the negatives,\" he adds."

All but one have been dismissed by US courts, or withdrawn by prosecutors.\nLawyers for Mr Giuliani said they were disappointed with the New York ruling.\n\"Our client does not pose a present danger to the public interest,\" they said in a joint statement. \"We believe that once the issues are fully explored at a hearing Mr Giuliani will be reinstated as a valued member of the legal profession that he has served so well in his many capacities for so many years.\"\nIn their decision, the judges said Mr Giuliani had made several false statements about voting in the states of Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania - including claims that hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots and other votes had been improperly counted.\nThe court rejected Mr Giuliani's argument that investigations into his conduct violated his right to free speech. It also suggested the suspension may eventually be permanent.\nThe suspension itself marks a big change in fortunes for Mr Giuliani, who once had a prominent legal and political career in New York.\nHe was admitted to the state bar in 1969 and eventually served as US Attorney for the Southern District of New York under the Ronald Reagan administration.\nHe became the city's mayor in 1994 and later earned widespread national praise for his response to the 11 September 2001 attacks.\nThursday's development comes only months after Mr Giuliani's home and office were raided by the FBI as part of an unrelated investigation into his alleged dealings with Ukraine."

      "title": "Covid gender gap widens as cases surge in Scotland",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A Covid cases gender gap has opened up as the total number testing positive in the past 24 hours hit nearly 3,000.\nOn Wednesday five new deaths were reported, and 2,969 cases recorded - the highest daily number since the start of mass testing.\nIn recent days about two thirds of cases in the 15 to 44 age range have been male.\nBehaviour expert Prof Stephen Reicher has suggested that men meeting up to watch Euro 2020 is behind the rise.\nNational Clinical Director Prof Jason Leitch said he believed indoor socialising was the main factor, though not necessarily linked to football. \nPublic health expert Prof Linda Bauld said it was too early to link the spike in male cases to one particular activity - but she said the trend was \"striking\" and should be investigated further.\nThe figure for new cases, which in part reflects a high level of testing, is higher than the previous record from early January, at the height of the second wave. \nA total of 42,310 people were tested in the previous 24 hours, the highest number carried out in Scotland in a single day, with 7.3% of tests coming back positive.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the figures should be viewed in the context of increased testing and vaccination, but must also be taken seriously if the planned easing of restrictions is to go ahead. \nIn a series of tweets, she said about 5% of cases would end up in hospital - about half the proportion seen in January - but that could still put serious pressure on the NHS. \nData from Public Health Scotland shows that throughout the pandemic as a whole there have been no dramatic differences between the sexes in infection rates, but this appears to have changed in recent days. \nThe following chart shows the total number of infections among 15 to 44 year olds since 1 May. \nThe current wave of Covid-19, linked to the Delta variant first identified in India, is spreading mainly among under 45s, with older age groups accounting for a relatively small number of new infections. \nAmong children under the age of 15, the gender balance in cases continues to be fairly even.  \nHowever, a widening gender gap is particularly evident in recent days among people aged between 20 and 24. In the latest figures, males made up more than three quarters of people testing positive in that age group.\nProf Leitch told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime with John Beattie programme he did not not believe football was directly to blame, but he did express concerns about large gatherings of football fans.  \nHe said about a third of people recently infected had been in some type of hospitality venue, while another third had been in some kind of retail premises.\nHe explained: \"As soon as you bring people together the virus moves.\"\nAsked specifically about case rates among young men he said: \"It's socialising. It's mainly indoor socialising, not outdoor socialising.\"\nProf Leitch said there would be patterns in behaviour over time, leading to \"lumps and bumps along the way\" and warned that dates given for further lockdown easing were dependent on people acting responsibly.\n\"The 19th of July and the 9th of August are not in pen in the calendar. They are in pencil in the calendar. They can be changed if the numbers don't continue to help us on the way and vaccination doesn't help us,\" he added.\nProf Reicher, an expert on behavioural psychology at the University of St Andrews and an adviser to both the Scottish and UK governments, believes indoor socialising linked to football is likely to be creating gender differences. \nHe told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"A few weeks ago it was about 50:50, men and women got infected at the same rate. Yesterday the data showed that young men - men under 45 - were about three times more likely to get infected. \n\"We can't be sure why that is, but the obvious explanation is that people were getting together for the football and not taking precautions.\" \nPublic health expert Prof Linda Bauld, from the University of Edinburgh, said she \"would not rush\" to blame the increase on any particular activity without more evidence, but suggested that males may be less averse to risky behaviour. \nShe said: \"Males are more likely to takes risks and as the environment changes they may be more willing to engage in behaviours that maybe women are a little bit less likely to, or maybe a little bit more cautious - or maybe have fewer opportunities to.\n\"So we just don't know - but it looks like a trend to me and it definitely needs investigated.\"\nInfection control expert Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, also of Edinburgh University, said it was possible that people planning to meet up to watch football were taking lateral flow tests as a precaution. \nIf they had a positive result, they would then seek a PCR test - and this would show up in the daily case number figures.

      "tags": "Obesity,Boris Johnson,Advertising",
      "text": "The government is to impose a UK-wide pre-9pm ban on TV adverts for food high in sugar, salt and fat.\nProducts affected include chocolate, burgers, soft drinks, cakes, sweets, ice cream, biscuits, sweetened juices, crisps, chips and pizzas.\nThere will also be new rules on online promotion, but firms selling junk food will still be able to run websites.\nA total ban on online adverts was proposed last year, but this has been scaled back after consultation.\nThe TV restrictions come after Boris Johnson made tackling obesity, which affects more than a quarter of UK adults, a priority for the government.\nFood companies have said outlawing any form of junk food advertising - worth hundreds of millions of pounds a year - is disproportionate.  \nFrom the end of next year, TV adverts for junk food - also including breakfast cereals, yoghurts, ready meals, chicken nuggets and battered fish - will be allowed only between 9pm and 5.30am.\nCommercials for \"less healthy\" meals out will also not be shown outside this period.\nThe rules will apply during live and on-demand programmes and will not affect companies with fewer than 250 employees, such as local curry houses, pizzerias and sweet-makers.\nAn around-the-clock ban on online junk food advertising will be limited to paid-for content, meaning companies can continue to promote goods using their own blogs, websites, apps or social media pages.\nA senior advertising industry source told the BBC the TV and online bans would apply to products, rather than wider brands.\nSo, for instance, Gary Lineker could still appear in adverts for Walker Crisps if they featured items which were deemed to be healthy, they added.\nThe Department of Health said the restrictions would not affect some foods high in sugar, salt or fat - such as honey, olive oil, avocados and Marmite - as these were not seen as contributing significantly to childhood obesity.\nSpeaking on a visit to a military base in Aldershot, the prime minister said: \"I'm afraid we do have a national struggle with obesity, and we need to deal with it...\n\"Let's get a grip on it. Sending out a signal in the way we treat advertising is entirely right.\"\nThe UK population's weight has risen since the early 1990s, with more than 60% of the adult population now overweight or obese, according to NHS Digital. \nProblems often begin in childhood and those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds are most likely to suffer, research suggests.\nThe government says it is keen to prevent young people consuming too many unhealthy products and since 2018 manufacturers have had to pay extra tax on high-sugar drinks.\nIn 2006, Mr Johnson defended mothers who - in spite of efforts by TV chef Jamie Oliver to improve school meals - were reportedly pushing fatty foods through school railings to their children,\n\"I say let people eat what they like,\" he said. \"Why shouldn't they push pies through the railings?\"\nBut his views have changed, particularly since he was hospitalised with Covid-19 last year.\nMr Johnson said obesity was one of the \"real co-morbidity factors\" associated with the disease, adding: \"Losing weight, frankly, is one of the ways you can reduce your own risk from coronavirus.\"\nBut the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising - which represents the large ad agencies - has said the government's own impact assessment shows a watershed ban on high-fat, sugar and salt food and drinks would only remove around 1.7 calories per day from a child's diet - the equivalent of half a Smartie.\nSue Eustace, public affairs director of the Advertising Association, said her industry was \"dismayed\" and that jobs would be lost in broadcasting and online publishers.\nHowever, Charmaine Griffiths, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, called the advertising ban \"a bold and very positive step\", adding that it was \"one important part in building a more healthy environment where the healthy option is the easy option\".\nFor Labour, shadow health minister Alex Norris said: \"This ban alone will not be enough. We need a radical obesity strategy in this country that goes further, ensuring families are able to access healthy food, supporting local leisure facilities and tackling child poverty.\"\nThe NHS says most adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 are overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 to 39.9 are classed as obese."

      "text": "MSPs have agreed to extend emergency measures prompted by the Covid-19 pandemic until March 2022.\nThe move covers temporary rules around court hearings, evictions, care homes and bankruptcy and debt arrangements.\nSome opposition parties argued against extending the powers beyond September, with the government aiming to drop most legal restrictions from early August.\nBut Deputy First Minister John Swinney said some \"essential\" measures would have to continue beyond that date.\nLegislation making the change of dates was pushed through Holyrood in three days under emergency procedures, with the parliament now going into recess until September.\nMSPs have already been told that they will be recalled in July and August when decisions are made about easing restrictions further.\nThe number of Covid-19 cases in Scotland has increased sharply in recent days, with 2,999 positive tests recorded on Wednesday - a higher daily figure than at any point during the \"second wave\" in January.\nHowever with the vaccine programme continuing to roll out the government aims to move the whole country to the lowest level of restrictions from 19 July, before lifting most legal curbs from 9 August.\nMany of the most stringent coronavirus restrictions, such as the travel ban and stay at home orders, were underpinned by UK legislation.\nHowever MSPs also passed emergency bills in April and May 2020 making provisions about issues within Holyrood's remit, including a block on evictions and changes to the courts system to allow trails to take place over video links.\nThese measures - which the government said would \"only last as long as is required\" - were due to expire on 30 September, but this has now been extended for six months, to 31 March 2022. \nMSPs could then make a further extension of six months, to September 2022, without passing a new law.\nMr Swinney told MSPs that further legislation would be drawn up after recess to \"look at longer-term issues\" and deal with the legacy of the pandemic - saying that some temporary provisions may be made permanent.\nThe new legislation rolls back some seldom-used provisions, such as an extension to the time limit for people to complete Community Payback Orders and for delays in responding to Freedom of Information requests.\nHowever many others are to be extended, including rules allowing court and tribunal hearings to be held remotely, emergency directions for care homes, and an extended notice period for tenants facing eviction.\nSome of these are measures which are still in regular use, while others - like the provision allowing the government to release prisoners in the event of major Covid outbreaks among prison staff - are being kept on in case they may be needed later.\nThe Scottish Conservatives argued that \"excellent progress\" had been made in tackling the pandemic via the vaccine programme, and that Covid was \"no longer the serious threat to health that it was this time last year\".\nMSP Murdo Fraser said it was \"right to ask how long the extraordinary, unprecedented powers that have been given to ministers should continue\", pointing out that Holyrood is sitting in September and could consider the bill then after further scrutiny and consultation.\nHowever Mr Swinney said waiting months to decide on the bill would \"leave a note of uncertainty in the minds of a whole range of organisations\" about the future, saying it was sensible to settle \"deeply practical and operational issues concerning the running of public services\".\nThe Lib Dems joined the Conservatives in opposing the bill, saying powers would be in place \"far longer\" than were needed and would give the government \"unprecedented rights\" to push through legislation without scrutiny.\nHowever with Labour and the Greens joining the SNP in supporting the legislation, it passed by a vote of 90 to 32."

      "tags": "Press freedom,China,Hong Kong national security law,Hong Kong",
      "text": "Thousands across Hong Kong rushed to snap up the final edition of the pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, which closed its doors after 26 years. \nOvernight, hundreds braved heavy rain, gathering outside its offices where a million copies were being printed. \nThe publication decided to shut down after its reports were accused of breaching a national security law, leading to a freeze on company assets.\nThe closure is seen as a blow to press freedom under the pressure of Beijing.\nIn the early hours of the morning, news stands across the city saw long snaking queues with people eagerly hoping to pick up the very last copy of the paper. By 10:00 local time, multiple vendors had sold out, according to social media posts. \nThe final edition was a tribute to its readers with the headline: \"Hong Kongers bid a painful farewell in the rain\". \n\"I think it's the end of an era,\" supporter San Tsang told news agency Reuters as she was waiting in line. \"I don't understand why [Hong Kong] can't even tolerate a newspaper.\"\n\"I want to support it till the end,\" Amma Yeung said. \"The newspaper has accompanied society for so many years. After this, we will weather the storm.\"\nOn Wednesday night, just hours after the company announced its closure, supporters of the tabloid had gathered outside its office, even as heavy rain fell. \nThey lit their phone flashlights as a show of solidarity and shouted support slogans like \"add oil\" - a popular phrase of encouragement in Hong Kong, which can sometimes be translated to mean \"go for it\" or \"don't give up\". \nIn response, Apple Daily staff ducked out of their offices to stand at balconies and windows, waving flashlights and shouting \"Thank you Hong Kong\" to the crowds outside. Some were seen handing out free copies of the final copy to the supporters on the street. \nReports from within the newsroom on its very last days showed emotional scenes of defiant applause as well as tears and confusion.\nApple Daily was Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy paper and had been a thorn in the side of Beijing's attempts to stamp out dissent.  \nThe paper's offices were raided by police last week over allegations that several reports had breached a new national security law which makes undermining the government a criminal offence.\nOfficials said the paper had published some 30 articles calling on countries to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and mainland China since 2019.\nAs a result, company-linked assets were frozen and several senior staff were arrested. The paper's founder Jimmy Lai is already in detention facing charges under the security law.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the paper announced it was shutting down. Its online outlet also stopped publishing at midnight on Wednesday. \nFor its final edition on Thursday, Apple Daily printed one million copies, more than 10 times its usual print run.\nRonson Chan, head of the Hong Kong Journalists' Association, said there was \"a huge worry for the city's freedom of speech\".\n\"We will be very worried if there are consequences for writing an article. I'm afraid that it will make society feel, or how I feel now, that people can be put in prison because of what they write.\"\nHong Kong authorities have dismissed accusations that they're stifling press freedom, saying they had not forced the paper to shut down. \nChinese officials from Beijing have repeatedly said media freedoms in Hong Kong are respected, but are not absolute.\nChina introduced the national security law in Hong Kong last year in response to massive pro-democracy protests that swept through the administrative region over the past years. \nThe law essentially reduced Hong Kong's judicial autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators and activists. It criminalises secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces with the maximum sentence being life in prison.\nA former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997 but with an agreement that certain rights and freedoms should be safeguarded. Critics say the law has fundamentally undermined that agreement. \nSince the law was enacted in June 2020, more than 100 people have been arrested under its provisions."

      "title": "Henriett and Mihrican: The missed chances to identify a killer",
      "tags": "Domestic abuse,Metropolitan Police Service,London violence",
      "text": "A series of police failings before the murders of two vulnerable women, who were found dead in a freezer, can be revealed for the first time. \nViolent sex offender Zahid Younis, 36, from east London, was jailed last year for the murders of Henriett Szucs and Mihrican Mustafa.\nBBC Newsnight has found how officers \"lost\" one of the victims and missed chances to identify the killer. \nThe Metropolitan Police said it had treated the case \"very seriously\". \nThe bodies of Henriett and Mihrican were discovered in a freezer in the east London flat of Younis in April 2019. A sadistic sex offender with a history of violence, he was jailed for life last year.\nBut a BBC investigation has examined whether the two murders were preventable, uncovering a series of missed chances to protect the women or locate them after they vanished. The family of Mihrican, the second of the women to die, told the programme she could have been saved.\nThe 32-year-old, a Hungarian national and mother-of-three, came to Britain in 2014, but was abandoned by the man she arrived with. She said the man was a pimp and she had her passport stolen. She found herself homeless on the streets of east London and was treated as a trafficking victim. \nHenriett was highly vulnerable and known to the Met Police, which received reports of her being assaulted. She told police a local man, David Dallison, had raped her. He was charged, denied the offence, and was remanded in custody before trial. \nWhat followed was a major missed opportunity to protect Henriett and then later detect her murder. Newsnight has obtained transcripts of the proceedings, which were so disastrous - due to late paperwork and abandoned hearings - that a judge described the Crown Prosecution Service's handling of the case as \"deplorable\" and \"disgraceful\". \nIn January 2016, prosecutors told Snaresbrook Crown Court that Henriett had been \"lost\" by police. The defendant was released and the rape charge left to lie on file.\nHowever, unlike the police, Dallison found Henriett and within four days she was in his flat. She was later discovered seriously injured outside the block of flats, saying she had been pushed out of his fifth-floor window.\nWhile in hospital, Henriett met Younis, a convicted sex offender with a long record of imprisoning, torturing and sexually abusing women and girls. The Met Police judged him as a \"medium risk\" and officers monitoring him visited his flat and collected intelligence on his relationships.\nYounis and Henriett stayed in touch after she moved to a safe house for trafficking victims outside London, but she left and headed for Younis's flat in spring 2016, without telling staff the address. Evidence from the later murder trial showed how she was then coercively controlled and eventually falsely imprisoned by Younis in the flat. She spent weeks severely injured prior to her death.\nIn June 2016, a fateful hearing took place in the rape prosecution involving Henriett. It was at this hearing - attended by police and prosecutors - that she went off the radar of key authorities.\nProsecutors again came to court to say she had been \"lost\". The court was told police could not find her and that officers had earlier suggested to her that it might be in her \"best interests\" to leave the country. The judge said that Henriett might have followed the advice, despite not having a passport.\nThe defendant David Dallison was cleared of all charges and walked free. There was no evidence Henriett had left Britain. No-one reported her missing.\nDays after the rape case was dropped, a Met detective received a text, apparently from Henriett, saying she was too unwell to attend court. The number was not traced. But Newsnight has established the message came from a phone attributable to Younis. Scotland Yard says it has no record of whether officers informed the CPS or the judge about the text.\nWeeks later, when Younis was stopped in the local area by officers, he was with a thin woman whose face was covered by a scarf. The woman's name triggered no alert. This was the last sighting of Henriett.\nKnown as Jan by her family, the 37-year-old, vanished from her native east London in 2018 - long after Henriett had been killed in autumn 2016. \nNewsnight has seen the internal Scotland Yard report into the year-long missing person inquiry for Jan, who was first reported missing in May 2018. In it:\nOfficers refused to class Jan as a high-risk missing person and, just weeks before she was found dead, wrote it was not a \"working hypothesis\" that she'd been harmed by someone else. \nHowever, Newsnight has established that police knew she was at grave risk of male violence and a local drug support group had anticipated the danger she was in.\nBefore going missing, she had been referred to the care of a local multi-agency panel, which included the Met Police, for high risk victims of domestic violence.\nFour months before she disappeared, a letter from a local drug support agency said Jan had \"a history of domestic violence\" from various partners and was \"very vulnerable\" to it happening again. The Met's internal report exonerated the force, saying Younis was being \"appropriately managed\" by officers.\nSeparate reviews into both deaths are currently underway, but Jan's family was not even informed a review had been launched, first finding out through the Newsnight investigation.\nHer family has since received an official apology. They believe Jan would still be alive if Henriett's case had been dealt with properly.\nThere was a series of earlier chances to deal with the threat Younis posed.\nHe had raped, tortured and imprisoned various girls and young women. He was never held fully accountable even when prosecuted, with offences dropped and victims disbelieved by judges and juries.\nOne victim he was convicted of abusing gave evidence in the murder trial.\nSpeaking publicly for the first time, she told Newsnight that if Younis had been dealt with by police earlier the two murder victims \"would still be alive today.\" \"They didn't take the victims seriously,\" she said.\nShe is from a non-Muslim background, and was groomed by Younis from the age of 12. She approached police after the bodies were discovered and was a key witness in the murder trial.\nBut she says the Met has still not investigated a central issue, namely that Younis \"married\" her in a mosque against her will when she was underage.\nShe says officers failed to investigate it because she was unable to provide full details to a detective who rang after she had given a statement to the homicide inquiry. She adds: \"I feel like if they allowed me to get married under age, how many more children has this happened to? Is it still happening now?\"\nThe victim became pregnant by Younis as a child, bringing up her child alone. Her daughter, who also spoke to Newsnight, says even as a child she understood the threat he posed. \"When people found out [about the murders] they were shocked and surprised,\" she says, \"I knew what he was like.\"\nScotland Yard says the passage of time meant it was not in the public interest to pursue the forced marriage complaint any further. The Met Police says its officers took Jan's disappearance very seriously and conducted a full investigation with hundreds of actions taken by officers. The force said Jan had lived a transient lifestyle and had been identified as medium risk.\nRegarding Henriett, the force says it is not policy to report people as missing if they fail to turn up to trial - and that officers had conducted extensive enquiries to locate her. The CPS says there is no causal link between the court case involving Henriett being discontinued and her murder.\nBut Nicole Jacobs, the domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales, said the evidence had revealed a \"systemic failure\". She said domestic violence needed to be elevated to the same priority as other crimes, with changes needed in how serial perpetrators are managed."

They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

It's vital that this situation is learned from and never repeated.\"\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story? Email: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk."

      "text": "Anti-virus software entrepreneur John McAfee has been found dead in a Barcelona prison cell hours after a Spanish court agreed to extradite him to the US to face tax evasion charges. \nThe Catalan justice department said medics had tried to resuscitate the 75-year-old, but were not successful.\nIt added that \"everything indicates\" McAfee had taken his own life.\nA controversial figure in the tech world, his company released the first commercial anti-virus software.\nMcAfee VirusScan helped to spark a multi-billion dollar industry in the computer world, and was eventually sold to technology giant Intel for more than $7.6bn (\u00a34.7bn).\nIn October 2020, John McAfee was arrested in Spain when he was about to board a plane to Turkey, and accused of failing to file tax returns for four years, despite earning millions from consulting work, speaking engagements, crypto-currencies and selling the rights to his life story.\nThe US justice department alleged that McAfee evaded tax liability by having his income paid into bank accounts and cryptocurrency exchange accounts in the names of nominees.\nHe was also accused of concealing assets, including a yacht and real estate property, also in other people's names.\nSpain's National Court authorised his extradition to the US to face the charges on Wednesday morning.\nIn recent years, McAfee had repeatedly claimed that there was a plot to get him - however the court said there was \"no revealing evidence\" that he was being prosecuted for political or ideological reasons, Spanish newspaper El Pais reported.\nHe had argued in a hearing earlier this month that the charges against him were politically motivated and that he would spend the rest of his life in prison if returned to the US.\nBut Nishay Sanan, McAfee's lawyer, said he had intended to fight all the charges.\n\"This is again the US government trying to erase John McAfee,\" Mr Sanan told NPR on Wednesday. \"This man was a fighter. And in the minds of everyone who knew him, he will always be a fighter.\"\nThe entrepreneur, who was born in Gloucestershire, England first came to prominence in the 1980s when he founded his tech company and released McAfee VirusScan. \nAlthough a pioneer of computer security, he once admitted to the BBC that he never actually used the software on his own computers - or any anti-virus software for that matter.\n\"I protect myself by constantly changing my IP [internet protocol] address, by not attaching my name to any device I use, and by not going on to sites where you might pick up a virus,\" he told the BBC's technology reporter Leo Kelion in 2013.\n\"Porn sites, for example, I just don't go there.\"\nHe also launched unsuccessful bids to become the Libertarian Party's candidate for the presidential elections in 2016 and 2020.\nIn 2019 McAfee expressed his disdain for taxes, tweeting that he had not filed tax returns for eight years because \"taxation is illegal.\"\nIn the same year he was briefly detained in the Dominican Republic for allegedly bringing weapons into the country.\nMcAfee never fitted into the mould of what a tech entrepreneur might look like. He was brash, reckless and never far away from the next scandal. \nMcAfee himself is best known for the company he founded and named. \nIt was wildly successful and made him a rich man. He also helped to create a multi-billon-dollar computer security software industry in the process.\nMcAfee was a visionary, but also hot headed. It was his temperament that got him into trouble throughout his life. \nIn 2012 he was arrested in Guatemala, having been on the run in Belize where police were investigating the death of his neighbour.\nHe always denied any involvement in the murder.\nA prominent libertarian, engaging speaker and crypto enthusiast, McAfee still had the ability to make money. His latest brush with law enforcement was due to alleged tax evasion on his recent earnings. \nHe will be remembered, rightly, as an important figure in the development of the technology scene of the 1980s and 1990s. But he will also be remembered as a deeply controversial figure, who at times seemed intent in taking a path in life that might lead to trouble."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nThe UK's foreign travel rules will be reviewed by the government later amid a desperate plea from the industry, which estimates 195,000 travel jobs have been lost during the pandemic or are at risk. Under the government's traffic light system countries are classed as green, amber or red. The travel industry is calling for the green list to be widened and for an exemption to quarantine for fully-vaccinated people visiting amber countries such as Spain and Portugal. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is facing MPs later this morning, and says ministers \"need to look at what the science says\". There could be another hurdle, however, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested all EU countries should make British travellers quarantine due to the Delta variant - as Germany has done.\nAround two million people may have had long Covid, according to a survey. The emerging phenomenon, which is not yet fully understood and does not have universally-agreed definition, covers a broad range of symptoms. After the initial coronavirus infection, long-lasting symptoms include fatigue, headaches and muscle pain. The React study, involving\u00a0half a million adults in England, found a third of people felt unwell for 12 weeks or more, and tiredness was one of the most common symptoms. The NHS has opened more than 80 long Covid assessment services across England and the government has provided \u00a350m for research.\n\"Fees have not changed even considering the changes made with Covid,\" \"everything seems too high a price for what we are receiving\" and \"because of Covid I haven't met any of my classmates or tutor\". These are some of the comments from the Higher Education Policy Institute's annual survey. It found about a quarter of students in the UK think they got good value for money from university during the pandemic. Students also felt their fees and living costs were not justified by the disrupted teaching they received this academic year. The results were \"disappointing, albeit not surprising\", Universities UK said.\nIndia is beginning to reopen after a second wave of Covid-19 infections devastated the country in April and May. But now experts warn that a third wave could strike in the next few months. Can India prevent it?\nWhen coronavirus turned the world upside down many businesses started diversifying to survive.

He has since been discharged from hospital.\nThe BBC said the stadium coverage was controlled by Uefa but apologised for any upset caused to viewers.\n\"Everyone at the BBC is hoping Christian Eriksen makes a full recovery,\" the corporation said in a statement at the time.\n\"We apologise to anyone who was upset by the images broadcast. In stadium coverage is controlled by Uefa as the host broadcaster, and as soon as the match was suspended, we took our coverage off air as quickly as possible.\"\nThe Denmark player dropped to the ground at the Parken Stadium in Copenhagen just before half-time, to the distress of the players on the pitch. Medics were seen trying to stabilise the former Tottenham player, while his teammates stood in a circle around them to shield them from the cameras.\nEriksen's wife was also seen on the pitch, visibly upset.\nPresenter Gary Lineker described the incident as \"the most difficult, distressing and emotional broadcast I've ever been involved with\".\nHe later tweeted: \"I understand some of you would have been upset with some of the images shown (we were too). Obviously these were the host pictures and out of our control. They should have stayed on a wide of the stadium. Apologies.\"\nUefa (the Union of European Football Associations) said at the time: \"In relation to the TV pictures, we would like to inform that all TV stations have had the opportunity to cut back to their studios - there were many who did. It is their editorial choice to stay on live images or not.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer was among those suggesting the BBC should have cut away from the stadium coverage sooner.\nCommentator and former footballer Ian Wright, former heavyweight boxer Frank Bruno, and former Premier League player Jermaine Beckford also criticised the BBC's handing of the situation.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "The Bank of England has shrugged off concerns over a pick-up in inflation as the economy recovers from the pandemic.\nConsumer price inflation hit a two-year high of 2.1% in the year to May, exceeding the Bank's 2% target.\nIn its latest statement, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it expected inflation to go above 3% \"for a temporary period\".\nThe MPC voted 9-0 to keep interest rates steady at the historic low of 0.1%.\nRates have been unchanged since March last year, when they were reduced to help contain the economic shock of Covid-19.\n\"Financial market measures of inflation expectations suggest that the near-term strength in inflation is expected to be transitory,\" the Bank said.\nHigh inflation is \"transitory\" and has not yet affected the need for ongoing stimulus of the economy - that is the judgement of the Bank of England's key interest rate-setting committee.\nThe recovery around the world has been stronger than expected and the UK's growth prospects this year have been upgraded. House prices are strongly up in the year. However, uncertainty over the impact on the economy of the withdrawal of furlough support, the new pandemic variant and other factors means they are keeping their foot on the accelerator pedal. \nOnly departing chief economist Andy Haldane sounded a note of caution, saying the Bank should buy \u00a350bn less in government bonds. He was again outvoted 8-1.\nThe bounce back is certainly real, but there is a statistical fog about what actually happens in this unprecedented situation. The Bank's decision-makers have decided to wait and see what actually happens to jobs and growth, rather than act now on inflation. The reopening bounce back is not a boom. Not yet.\nThe Bank said it now expected the UK economy to recover faster than it had previously predicted.\nIt said output in June was now expected to be about 2.5% below its pre-Covid level.\n\"Output in a number of sectors is now around pre-Covid levels, although it remains materially below in others.  The housing market remains strong, and indicators of consumer confidence have increased,\" it said. \nThe MPC said the direct economic implications of delaying the final relaxation of Covid restrictions to 19 July were likely to be \"relatively small\" compared with the impact of previous stages.\n\"The Committee's central expectation is that the economy will experience a temporary period of strong GDP growth and above-target CPI inflation, after which growth and inflation will fall back,\" it added. \n\"There are two-sided risks around this central path, and it is possible that near-term upward pressure on prices could prove somewhat larger than expected.  \n\"Taking together the evidence from financial market measures and surveys of households, businesses and professional forecasters, the Committee judges that UK inflation expectations remain well anchored.\"\nMPC members also voted 8-1 to continue with the Bank's existing asset purchase scheme, maintaining its bond-buying target at \u00a3895bn.\nLuke Bartholomew, senior economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, highlighted the fact that departing chief economist Andy Haldane was once again the dissenting voice on the Bank's quantitative easing programme, voting for a reduction in bond purchases.\n\"It will be extremely interesting to see who replaces [Mr] Haldane in the chief economist role following his imminent departure,\" he said.\n\"It is likely the Bank will drift back into a more relaxed tone on the transitory nature of any inflation pressure once [Mr] Haldane's voice and vote has moved on.\" "

      "text": "The Stormont Executive is to divert funding of more than \u00a330m in a bid to tackle Northern Ireland's growing waiting lists.\nThe move is part of a reallocation exercise known as a monitoring round.\nIt will also see extra funding of \u00a310.7m diverted to the Department of Health to cope with pharmaceutical pressures linked to Brexit.\nFinance Minister Conor Murphy presented details of his proposed June monitoring round at Thursday's executive meeting.\nOther reallocations include \u00a319m to the Executive Office to pay first-year costs of the Troubles compensation scheme, in which money will go to eligible victims and survivors of the conflict. \nMr Murphy said long-term funding for the scheme would continue to be discussed with the Treasury.\nThe Department of Education is also in line for almost \u00a336m to provide additional support for children with special educational needs (SEN).\nOther allocations include:\nMr Murphy said the detail of what areas in elective care the funding will be allocated to \"is a matter for the health department\".\nHe said a long-term strategy for investment will require \"very substantial intervention over a long number of years\".\nHe added that the Troubles compensation scheme is due to open in July after a slight delay.\n\"We haven't yet resolved the issue of who's responsible for the scheme, who pays for the scheme, that dialogue is ongoing and I hope to resolve that in the not-so-distant future,\" he said.\nHe said the money would go directly to those applying for the scheme \"so victims won't have to wait further\".\n\"It was never our desire to get into a financial wrangle over this but the British government changed the scheme substantially and handed the cost over to the executive and we've been having dialogue ever since.\"\nIn recent weeks, it has emerged that some people are waiting seven years for medical procedures in Northern Ireland.\nThe latest waiting list figures, from January to March 2021, indicated that:\nThe departmental target is that at least half of all patients should wait no longer than nine weeks for a first appointment and no-one should wait longer than 52 weeks.\nIt prompted Health Minister Robin Swann to suggest the size of Northern Ireland's waiting lists was \"undermining\" the principle of a free health service.\nHe had previously said it could take up to 10 years to tackle the issue and that many people were waiting \"too long for treatment\".\nNorthern Ireland has the worst waiting times of any UK region, with problems exacerbated by the restructuring of the health service to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.\nMr Swann said the additional waiting list funding will go towards areas including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and psychological therapies.\n\"This will be in addition to our ongoing investment in elective care for the highest priority cases in terms of clinical need,\" Mr Swann said.\n\"While additional one-off allocations will always be welcome, a long-term solution to waiting lists requires sustained and guaranteed funding over a number of years.\"\nOther health allocations also include \u00a34.5m for Muckamore Abbey Hospital support costs, including funding for the alternative location of patients who might previously have been treated at Muckamore, \u00a31m for cyber security and \u00a311.5m capital funding.\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said \"\u00a331.5m is welcome but it is a far cry from what is needed.\n\"The truth is that this is not simply a waiting list issue; it represents a serious collapse in health services for far too many people who have been told that they have to wait for years for elective care that will improve their quality of life.\"\n\"What we need is a longer-term strategic resource plan to deal with this crisis.\n\"The Department of Health and Royal College of Surgeons have identified \u00a31bn is needed over the next five years to address waiting times alone.\n\"That critical resource needs to be accompanied by a strong political agreement to transform our health service so that patients can access treatment at the point of need.\"\nEducation Minister Michelle McIlveen welcomed the funding for children with special educational needs \"after an extremely challenging year for the education sector\".\nShe said the money will be used \"to deal with the pressures caused by Covid-19\".\nMs McIlveen said the funding will \"support pressures relating to special schools and specialist support in mainstream schools, SEN support services and SEN transport\" and includes a further \u00a38m to support implementation of the new special educational needs framework."

      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "About 50% of Northern Ireland's coronavirus cases are now linked to the Delta variant, BBC News NI understands.\nScientists believe it will become the dominant strain in Northern Ireland by the end of the month.\nApproximately 75% of cases are expected to be linked to the strain, which was first discovered in India.\nSources say there are far too many Covid-19 clusters across Northern Ireland and the Delta variant can only be held back for so long.  \nThe race is on between variant and vaccine.\nThere have been 612 confirmed or probable cases of the Delta variant in Northern Ireland, according to the Public Health Agency (PHA).\nLike elsewhere in the UK, the increase in the variant was widely anticipated.\nTo tackle the rise in cases, BBC News NI understands mobile vaccine units are expected to be deployed to try and make access to vaccines easier for some groups, especially those aged between 18 and 30.\nThat may include drop in centres where an appointment is not required.\nMobile units may also be dispatched to large open spaces or university areas where younger people tend are more likely to gather.\nWithin the past few weeks, mobile vaccination units have opened in Glasgow in Scotland and in Harrogate in England to increase the pace of vaccination, especially in Covid-19 hotspots.\nHospitals in Northern Ireland have yet to be affected.\nLatest official figures show there are 13 hospital in-patients being treated for Covid-19, with no cases being treated in intensive care units (ICU).\nHowever, that picture could change over the next couple of months.   \nThe Department of Health reported 188 new cases on Wednesday - the highest daily total in more than 100 days.\nHealth officials believe fewer people are developing serious symptoms because they have been vaccinated.\n\"The case numbers are going up and we're seeing that pattern right across the UK but we're not seeing the rise in serious illness - yet,\" said Dr Alan Stout, chair of the Northern Ireland General Practitioners' Committee (NIGPC).\n\"We're not seeing the hospital admissions and we're not seeing the deaths, so that has shown us that the vaccine is immensely successful in terms of protecting against serious illness.\n\"We're hoping - and this is where we need to buy that time over the next week to two weeks and into the early summer - to make sure that those patterns remain.\"\nDr Stout added: \"We want to force the infect numbers down as well because that has other implications but it is showing us at the moment that the vaccines are working for this particular variant.\"\nDr Gerry Waldron of the PHA said the spread of the Delta variant \"underpins the need for continued vigilance and adherence to the public health guidance\".\nHe said the PHA has also activated \"enhanced testing in areas where we have identified a number of probable cases of the Delta variant\".\nThat includes Omagh, County Tyrone and Ballymoney, County Antrim - a total of 31 people have tested positive after the \"enhanced testing\" of 1,138 people in those towns.\nSlightly more people in the over-60s age group are testing positive but the biggest concern is among those aged between 18 and 40.\nOfficial information is not being released about the number of people testing positive after having received two doses of the vaccine but it is understood a small number are affected.\nThe vaccine does not offer 100% protection against the virus.\nBut as the Delta variant is causing a spike in cases and increasingly becomes the dominant strain across the UK, experts believe more people who have been fully vaccinated will develop symptoms.\nJudging by the numbers in ICUs across England and Scotland, it is hoped Northern Ireland's ICUs will also not become swamped by seriously-ill people.\nHowever that could change in the autumn and winter months when hospitals will also have to deal with the flu virus and more people experiencing respiratory problems.\nThe Northern Ireland executive is due to review lifting further restrictions on 1 July with an indicative date of easing on 5 July.\nFrom a health perspective, officials will want to buy more time in order to get more people vaccinated.\nWith the Twelfth of July holidays also looming, the preference would be to leave things as they are for another few weeks. \nBut that could be difficult for some politicians to accept.\nAllowing large get-togethers while also keeping people safe will be really tough and an even tougher one to police.\nMeanwhile, it has emerged that the Stormont executive went against the advice of the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser when it decided to relax self-isolation guidance for people entering Northern Ireland from the Common Travel Area (CTA).\nThe CTA is made up of the UK, the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and Isle of Man.\nMinisters agreed to the change last month after pressure from the tourism industry.\nIn a response to a question in the Stormont assembly, Health Minister Robin Swann said it was his view and that of the expert advisers that the self-isolation guidance should have remained in place.\nThat would have \"allowed time for greater vaccination roll-out and minimising any potential for community transmission\" of coronavirus.\nMr Swann said the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser told the executive last month that removing the guidance would \"accelerate the introduction of the [Delta] variant into Northern Ireland\"."

      "text": "Spain's Balearic Islands, Madeira, Malta and Barbados are among the places being added to the UK's green travel list, the transport secretary has said.\nPeople entering the UK from 16 places will not have to quarantine from 04:00 on 30 June, Grant Shapps confirmed.\nHe also said the government intended to drop quarantine for fully vaccinated people returning from amber list countries \"later in the summer\".\nSix destinations have also been added to the government's red list. \nThe travel industry welcomed the additions to the green list, but urged the government to go further.\nThe destinations added to the green list from 04:00 BST on 30 June are:\nThe places added to the red lists for the same time are:\nDominican Republic, Eritrea, Haiti, Mongolia, Tunisia and Uganda.\nAre you planning to travel to a green list country soon? Email: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nMr Shapps cautioned that all the additions to the green list, with the exception of Malta, had also been added to the green watch list, signalling that they are at risk of moving back to amber. Israel and Jerusalem have also been put on the watch list.\nThe Department for Transport said the plan to allow fully-vaccinated people to arrive from amber list countries without having to quarantine was expected to take place in phases, starting with UK residents. \nThe department also said it intended to remove the guidance that people should not travel to amber countries, and it would take clinical advice on whether regular testing could provide a safe alternative to quarantine for children accompanied by vaccinated adults.\nA spokesman said further detail will be set out next month, including the rules for children and those unable to be vaccinated and the dates the changes will come into effect. \nMr Shapps added: \"We're moving forward with efforts to safely reopen international travel this summer, and thanks to the success of our vaccination programme, we're now able to consider removing the quarantine period for fully-vaccinated UK arrivals from amber countries - showing a real sign of progress.\n\"It's right that we continue with this cautious approach, to protect public health and the vaccine rollout as our top priority, while ensuring that our route out of the international travel restrictions is sustainable.\" \nBut Eluned Morgan, Wales' minister for health and social services, said: \"Our message is clear - this is the year to holiday at home. We're calling on people to only travel overseas for essential reasons.\"\nOn Thursday, the UK reported 16,703 cases and 21 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. \nThe prospect of European holidays also faces another hurdle after German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested all EU countries should make British travellers quarantine on arrival to slow the spread of the Delta variant.\nMrs Merkel told Germany's parliament: \"In our country, if you come from Great Britain, you have to go into quarantine - and that's not the case in every European country, and that's what I would like to see.\"\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also spoke of his concern at the spread of the variant.\n\"We should all be vigilant because the Delta variant is coming,\" he said on Thursday. \n\"We see that it affects people who have not yet been vaccinated or who have only had one dose, which means we have to be even faster in this vaccination campaign.\"\nCurrently, people travelling from the UK to Greece, Spain and Portugal are not required to quarantine. \nThose going to Italy have to self-isolate for five days then take a test, while fully-vaccinated UK visitors to France can enter without quarantining.\nMost holiday hotspots are currently on the amber list, including France, Italy and mainland Spain, meaning travellers returning to the UK have to self-isolate for 10 days, as well as pay for tests.\nThe expanded green list is the longest it has been since the government set up the traffic light system for travel. \nBut BBC transport correspondent Caroline Davies pointed out that most of Europe and other key transport destinations are still not on the green list. \nThere is also no set date for when fully vaccinated travellers will no longer have to quarantine, with the government still having to resolve questions about how the policy will work.\nOur correspondent added that it was potentially a small step in the right direction for the industry, \"but maybe a bit of a shaky one\". \nThe travel industry welcomed the expansion of the green list but warned it was not enough to help the sector recover from the pandemic. \nSean Doyle, chief executive officer of British Airways said: \"We cannot afford another missed summer. There are jobs at stake, Britons separated from family members and we cannot afford to allow the success of our vaccine programme to be wasted.\"\nHe added that plans to allow vaccinated people to travel more freely this summer were \"critical\" and urged the government to work with the aviation industry to set this up.\nMatthew Fell, the Confederation of British Industry's chief UK policy director, said the additions to the green list \"won't be enough to salvage the summer season for the international travel sector\".\nHe said: \"The UK's successful vaccine rollout means we should be in the vanguard of safely restarting international travel. Other countries are already pressing ahead with enabling travel for the fully vaccinated.\"\nShai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, said the expanded travel green list \"fails to go far enough\", adding that the US should have been added to it.\nHe said quarantine should be removed for fully vaccinated passengers arriving from amber and green countries \"no later\" than 19 July.\nBut Rory Boland, travel editor of consumer magazine Which?, said travellers still needed to be \"extremely cautious\" about booking trips abroad with the rules on international travel changing regularly.\n\"Most providers will not pay refunds if a country is moved from green to amber, and 'free' amendments are often anything but, with many companies requiring significant notice of any changes and bookings for new dates usually costing hundreds of pounds,\" he said. \nEarlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a \"real opportunity\" to open travel this summer for those who have had two jabs.\nAsked about the prospect of a change to travel rules, Mr Johnson said: \"The most important thing is that we think double jabs do offer a good way forward, we think they offer the hope of travel this summer.\n\"More than 60% of our population have now had two jabs, I think 83% have had one jab, we're really getting through it now. The crucial thing is, come forward and get your second jab,\" he said.\nThe UK government reviews which countries are on which list every three weeks.\nThere will also be a \"checkpoint\" review of the rules for each category on Monday 28 June. \nOn Wednesday, workers in the industry, including cabin crew, pilots, travel agents and airport staff, held a series of protests against the rules.\nIndustry body Abta, representing travel agents and tour operators, estimated 195,000 travel jobs have been lost during the pandemic or are at risk."

      "tags": "NI Health,Organ donation,Robin Swann",
      "text": "Long-awaited laws on opt-out organ donation in Northern Ireland have been given approval to proceed after talks at Stormont.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan announced the decision on social media on Thursday.\nIt followed talks between Mr Givan, Health Minister Robin Swann, who proposed the legislation, and campaigners.\nMr Givan said the legislation can now proceed by way of urgent procedure to the Northern Ireland Assembly. \nIt will be up to Speaker Alex Maskey to decide on Friday when the bill can be introduced in the assembly, before the summer recess begins next week.\nMr Swann said he was pleased that the organ donation bill had been signed off by Mr Givan and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill.\nEarlier, he had accused the DUP of blocking the bill on a \"point of principle\" and described the delay as very frustrating.\nHis proposed bill would mean people automatically become donors, unless they specifically say otherwise.\nIt needed approval from the executive before it can go to the assembly.\nNorthern Ireland is the only part of the UK without a soft opt-out system, after the law in England changed last year.\nMr Givan is expected to meet campaigners at Stormont on Friday to discuss the bill's approval.\nThey have hailed the decision and said there was no time to waste in order to get the legislation through the Northern Ireland Assembly before its mandate ends.\nM\u00e1irt\u00edn MacGabhann, whose four-year-old son D\u00e1ith\u00ed has been waiting on a new heart for three years, said it was an emotional night.\n\"It's so important because time is running out on this mandate and we had until the end of this week to get this approval.\n\"So this is a massive victory but, in some ways, it's a small victory too because time is still running out. \n\"But this news tonight gives it a lot better chance of going through, so we are proud of the work we've done and the work others in the British Heart Foundation have done along with us.\"\nFollowing the announcement, the head of the British Heart Foundation Northern Ireland, Fearghal McKinney, said his organisation \"very much welcomes the decision\". \n\"Our elected representatives will now have the opportunity to consider, scrutinise and debate the issue. But we must not get complacent, this is just the start of the process,\" he said. \nJust when it looked like this legislation would become a casualty of Stormont stalling, along came another late-night surprise.\nThere had been hesitancy from some in the DUP to progress the bill, but Robin Swann and other parties had argued that the place to debate the rights and wrongs of the proposals was in the assembly - not around the executive table.\nThe DUP had also been warned that if a decision was not taken tonight, the bill would have been past the point of no return.\nThe breakthrough is significant - Stormont has been talking about amending its organ donation laws for the better part of a decade.\nHowever this is far from the end of the road for campaigners.\nThey will be anxious to make sure the bill completes its lengthy legislative journey without any further delay.\nMr Swann had said he had tried a number of times in recent weeks to bring the bill to the executive, but it had not made it onto the agenda. \nAhead of the announcement, it is understood some DUP ministers had expressed concerns about the wording of the bill.\nOthers in the DUP previously said they supported an opt-in system, rather than presumed consent for organ donation.\nCurrently donation will only proceed in Northern Ireland if a person has given their express consent, usually by signing on to the NHS Organ Donor Register or by speaking to their family.\nIn the absence of this, the family is asked to make a decision on behalf of the patient.\nThe Department of Health drew up legislation and held a public consultation aimed at changing the law.\nAll the main executive parties apart from the DUP have said they support the minister's bill.\nA similar piece of legislation to introduce an opt-out system was tabled in 2016, but rejected by the Stormont health committee.\nAt that time, some of Northern Ireland's most senior clinicians warned that Northern Ireland was not ready for such a system and described that bill as unhelpful.\nMr Swann's bill is not the only piece of legislation that has faced delay due to disagreement in the executive.\nEarlier this week, Justice Minister Naomi Long said her proposals to tackle upskirting and strengthen protections for victims of sexual abuse were being blocked.\nShe said the DUP had opposed her bill as it was too wide-ranging.\nHowever Thursday's executive meeting saw ministers agree to allow it to be introduced before the assembly's summer break, after Ms Long agreed to make some changes to the bill.\nShe criticised the DUP for what she said was its \"reckless disregard for some of the most vulnerable victims and witnesses in the justice system\".\n\"The DUP's conduct in respect of this bill has been both unacceptable and unsustainable in a five party coalition; however, I could not in good conscience, allow 75% of the bill content which included vital legislation to protect victims of serious sexual offences, child sexual exploitation and human trafficking, to be lost. \n\"It is far too important.\""

      "text": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that Europe is \"on thin ice\" as the Delta variant of Covid spreads on the continent.\nHer warning came as EU health officials said the variant would account for 90% of the bloc's cases by late August.\nThe spread could disrupt plans for lifting restrictions during the summer.\nThe Alpha variant, first discovered in the UK, hit Europe hard early this year and Delta, now dominant in the UK, is thought 40%-60% more transmissible.\nAndrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), said on Wednesday that the spread of the Delta variant showed the importance of speeding up vaccinations in Europe, as \"preliminary data shows that it can also infect individuals that have received only one dose of the currently available vaccines\". \nTwo doses offered \"high protection\" against the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, she added.\nDelta, first identified in India, now accounts for almost all new infections in the UK.\nOn Wednesday Mrs Merkel called for a more co-ordinated EU response and said all member states should quarantine arrivals from the UK considering the dangers of the spread of Delta.\nThe UK is not on the EU's list of safe countries, due to the spread of Delta, but that list is not binding on member states.\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that while fully vaccinating people offered \"a good way forward\" for resuming travel, this summer would not be \"like every other. This is going to be a more difficult summer to take a holiday\".\nHere is how different parts of Europe are dealing with the threat of Delta.\nAlthough cases in France have been falling, Delta is causing concern in an area in the south-west of the country.\nOn Thursday, Prime Minister Jean Castex and the country's health minister visited Les Landes, where the variant accounts for 70% of infections. Across France, it is believed to be behind 10% of cases. \nMr Castex described the situation in Les Landes as \"difficult but not catastrophic\", before stressing the importance of testing and vaccinations. \nHe said 20 million people in France - or around 30% of the population -had been fully vaccinated, but argued that the number was still not high enough. \"Be afraid of the virus, don't be afraid of the vaccine,\" he said.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron also spoke of his concern at the spread of the variant.\n\"We should all be vigilant because the Delta variant is coming,\" he said on Thursday. \"We see that it affects people who have not yet been vaccinated or who have only had one dose, which means we have to be even faster in this vaccination campaign.\" \nAlthough most lockdown rules have been lifted in France, a resurgence in cases could lead to a return of restrictions.\nOn Thursday, Russia recorded more than 20,000 new cases and 569 deaths - the highest figures since January.\nIn the capital Moscow - which has seen its highest number of daily deaths since the pandemic began - the Delta variant is responsible for 90% of new infections, according to the city's mayor.\nThe spread of the variant has been complicated by low vaccination uptake across the country.\nAlthough Russia was one of the first countries to develop a vaccine, only 12.8% of Russians had received a single dose and 9.9% were fully vaccinated by 16 June.\nPortugal has announced new restrictions for the Lisbon region and two other areas due to rising case numbers.\nCabinet Minister Mariana Vieira da Silva said on Thursday that the new rules were \"an attempt to contain\" the Delta variant, which now accounts for more the half of new cases in the capital and the Tagus Valley. \nThe rules include a weekend travel ban for the Lisbon area, with residents only allowed to leave for essential journeys. Plans to ease restrictions elsewhere in the country have also been dropped.\nEarlier this week, the country's health minister admitted the country could have \"acted differently\" to prevent the spread of the variant. Her comments came after Angela Merkel said the situation in Portugal could have been avoided with EU-wide travel rules. Portugal had allowed travellers from the UK to enter with a negative test.\nSeparately, the head of Portugal's vaccination programme has said the country may miss its target of providing at least a first dose to 70% of the population by early August if shortages continue.\nThe German head of the World Medical Association has urged people not to travel to London for Euro 2020 matches over concerns about the Delta variant.\nAhead of Germany's match against England in London next Tuesday, Frank Ulrich Montgomery said that those travelling to the UK \"run the risk of getting infected with the Delta variant\".\n\"I consider it irresponsible for even vaccinated people to travel to London in this situation,\" he told Germany's RND news network.\nThe stadium at Wembley will allow 60,000 fans to watch the tournament's semi-finals and final. It means the stadium will be at 75% capacity for those games.\nHealth officials in Denmark, meanwhile, have asked 4,000 fans to get tested after three people who attended last Thursday's Denmark v Belgium match contracted the Delta variant.\nAll three are thought to have been infected at the game."

      "text": "The Queen referred to Health Secretary Matt Hancock as \"poor man\" at a meeting with Boris Johnson.\n\"I've just been talking to your secretary of state for health, poor man. He came for Privy Council,\" she told the prime minister.\n\"He's full of...\", she added. \"Full of beans?\", offered Mr Johnson.\nTheir weekly meetings are usually private but cameras were invited in to record the start of the first face-to-face one since lockdown began.\nThe Queen then told the prime minister that the health secretary \"thinks things are getting better,\" in remarks caught on microphone.\nThe PM usually meets the monarch on Wednesday at Buckingham Palace.\nTheir last in-person audience took place on 11 March, 2020.\nHowever, since 18 March 2020, after the government introduced restrictions to slow the spread of Covid, the pair have instead spoken over the phone. \nThe Privy Council  - where the Queen spoke to Mr Hancock - is a body made up of senior politicians including former prime ministers which advises the monarch. It meets around once a month.\nMr Hancock has had a difficult month, with the prime minister's former aide Dominic Cummings accusing him of lying about testing people going from hospitals to care homes at the start of the pandemic - claims Mr Hancock has denied.\nAnd earlier this month, Mr Cummings published messages from the PM in which he describes Mr Hancock as \"hopeless\". \nWeekly meetings between the prime minister and the Queen have been taking place since 1952. No advisers attend and there is no official record of what is said.\nEx-PM David Cameron said he found the meetings \"very valuable\" adding that the monarch was \"always up to speed\" with political events. \nAnother former Prime Minister, John Major, said he could discuss \"absolutely anything\" with the Queen and Labour PM Harold Wilson said it was the only meeting the details of which he could guarantee would not be leaked.\nIn a 1992 documentary, the Queen said prime ministers \"unburden themselves or tell me what is going on or if they have any problems, and sometimes I can help in some way as well\".\n\"They know I can be impartial and it is rather nice to feel one is a sponge.\n\"Occasionally one can put one's point of view and perhaps they have not seen it from that angle.\"\nThe Queen spent much of the pandemic in her Berkshire home Windsor Castle. \nIn April 2020, she made a rare televised addresses in which she said: \"We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.\"\nA year later, her husband of 73 years, Prince Philip Duke of Edinburgh died at the age of 99 leaving what the Queen called \"a huge void\" in her life.

      "tags": "Iran",
      "text": "The BBC has complained to the UN about Iran's harassment of staff at the BBC Persian service.\nIt says Iranian intelligence agents have threatened to kidnap London staff and take them to Iran.\nThis is not the first time the BBC has taken the rare step of appealing to the UN for their safety. \nIran has previously denied the allegations, and accused BBC Persian of spreading false information to encourage its government's overthrow.\nThe BBC's legal representatives have urged the UN's Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to take action on the issue.\nAn estimated 18 million Iranians - almost a quarter of Iran's population - regularly use the BBC's Persian service online, on radio or via satellite television.\nBut the Farsi language service is banned in Iran, and authorities there have previously detained people for alleged links to the BBC outlet.\nIn an internal survey of 102 BBC Persian staff, carried out in March 2020, 71 said they had experienced harassment. A third have also had one or both parents harassed or called in for questioning by Iranian authorities, and over half say they feel under pressure to leave their jobs.\nOn Thursday, the BBC hosted a virtual side event, coinciding with a UNHRC meeting, to raise concern about what it says is an escalating campaign of harassment by Iran towards BBC Persian journalists and other Farsi-language media. \nAmong those speaking at the event was BBC Persian reporter Kasra Naji, who spoke about the threats and cyberbullying, which he, his colleagues and their families had endured.\nMr Naji said that, over the 2020 Christmas period, six staff had family members called in for questioning by Iranian intelligence agents. All were allegedly told to pass on death threats to their London-based relatives. \nDuring every interrogation, officials made reference to Ruhollah Zam - a Paris-based opposition journalist who was enticed to travel to Baghdad in 2019, where he was kidnapped and taken to Iran. Mr Zam was executed last year for allegedly fomenting unrest with his writing.\n\"Perhaps the most shocking thing is the intelligence officers who made these threats against our lives were so comfortable that they handed over their phone numbers for us to contact them - acting with total impunity on behalf of the state,\" said Mr Naji.\n\"We ask you to help shine a light on what's happening to us. It's the only way to safeguard us,\" he added. \"It's a matter of life and death for us - and our families - to speak out.\"\nThe BBC says Iran began targeting its Persian service after the country's 2009 presidential elections, when millions of Iranian took to the streets claiming their votes had been stolen.\nAllegations of fraud led to months of unrest, which Iranian authorities blamed on Western governments and international media - including the BBC.\nSince then, the BBC says staff have been subjected to a campaign of harassment and death threats, which has escalated in recent years, warranting UK police protection in a number of cases. \nIn one instance, a reporter received threats to her life via Skype, and was told to quit - or to spy on her colleagues - in return for the freedom of her 27-year-old sister, who had been arrested in Iran.\nBack in 2017, Iran's judiciary also issued a freeze on all assets of BBC Persian staff. Then in 2018, Iran accused 152 current and former staff and contributors of \"conspiracy against national security\", and initiated criminal investigations.\nThat year, the BBC made its first complaint to the UN, and in March 2019 a group of UN experts condemned Iran's treatment of the broadcaster, saying that its actions violated international law and \"ultimately [constituted] serious threats to global security\"."

      "tags": "Britney Spears,Mental health,United States,Music",
      "text": "US pop star Britney Spears has launched a blistering attack on the \"abusive\" conservatorship that has controlled her life for 13 years.\nShe said she was traumatised and cried every day, telling a judge in Los Angeles: \"I just want my life back\".\nSpears, 39, also said she had been denied the right to have more children and was put on the psychiatric drug lithium against her wishes.\nHer father was granted control over her affairs by court order in 2008.\nThe order was granted after the star was put in hospital amid concerns over her mental health, and it has been extended for more than a decade since. \nThe special hearing on Wednesday was the first time Spears has spoken in open court about her case. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny thanked Spears for her \"courageous\" words during the proceedings.\nIt followed much speculation about the pop star's situation, with fans eagerly combing her social media output for clues. A fan-led movement, known as #FreeBritney, has campaigned for her legal freedom for years.\nBut a long legal process is likely before any decision is made on ending the conservatorship, the Associated Press reports.\nSpears delivered an impassioned address which lasted for more than 20 minutes. After launching into her speech, she was asked by the judge to slow down and later said she wished she could stay on the phone \"forever\" to avoid returning to her life where she was surrounded by people who said no to her.\nSpears told the court she wanted the conservatorship to end and described the arrangement as \"embarrassing and humiliating\". \nReferring to past Instagram posts, the singer said: \"I've lied and told the whole world I'm okay and I'm happy.\n\"I've been in denial. I've been in shock. I am traumatised,\" she said. \"I'm not happy. I can't sleep. I'm so angry it's insane. And I'm depressed. I cry every day.\"\nSpears, a mother of two, said she wanted to marry her boyfriend and have another baby, but the conservatorship would not allow her to. She accused her conservator of stopping her from having a contraceptive intrauterine device (IUD) removed so she could get pregnant.\n\"I feel ganged up on and I feel bullied and I feel left out and alone,\" she told the court. \"I deserve to have the same rights as anybody does, by having a child, a family, any of those things.\"\nSpears said she felt \"forced\" to tour by her management. She said she spoke out against going straight onto a Las Vegas residency, and her therapist was falsely told she was not co-operating or taking her medication. \nShe alleged she was then put on the drug lithium - a common medicine for bipolar disorder - against her wishes and it had made her feel drunk and unable to converse.\nSpears said it was her belief that the conservatorship was doing her \"way more harm than good\" and said she \"honestly didn't know\" she could petition for the arrangement to end. \nThe full extent of why the court order was extended has never been made public. But Spears has maintained a public career, including a Las Vegas residency and a stint as an X-Factor judge, leading many to question the validity of the arrangement.\nA lawyer for her father, Jamie Spears, said he had been troubled by the singer's allegations in court.\n\"He is sorry to see his daughter suffering and in so much pain,\" the lawyer said in a statement read out in court. \"Mr Spears loves his daughter, and he misses her very much.\"\nA conservatorship is granted by a court for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions, such as those with dementia or other mental illnesses.\nSpears' conservatorship is split into two parts - one is for her estate and financial affairs, the other is for her as a person.\nUnder the agreement, the pop star has not controlled her finances since 2008. That is around the time she began to behave erratically amid her divorce from Kevin Federline and a custody battle over their children.\nThe star made headlines in a series of public incidents, including shaving her head, and she was twice admitted to hospital.\nJamie Spears stepped down temporarily as his daughter's personal conservator in 2019 due to health reasons. She sought to permanently install Jodi Montgomery, a care professional, into the role instead of reinstating her father - but on Wednesday she said Ms Montgomery was \"even starting to take it too far\".\nHer father remains co-conservator of her estate, along with the financial firm the Bessemer Trust.\nMr Spears's legal team has insisted he has done a good job of managing his daughter's finances. But a court-appointed lawyer for the pop star said she is afraid of him and will not return to the stage as long as he remains in control of her career.\nSpears said Wednesday that she believed her father \"he loved the control to hurt his own daughter 100,000%\".\nDozens of fans gathered outside court on Wednesday, holding signs that read \"Free Britney now!\" and \"Get out of Britney's life!\"\n\"Everything she said was absolutely heartbreaking and it was actually even worse than I really thought it was,\" Megan Radford, one of the movement's founders, told the BBC.\nDavid Willis, BBC News, Los Angeles \nBritney Spears unleashed on a stunned courtroom the equivalent of 13 years of pent-up frustration - a torrent of accusation, anger and regret, all delivered in such a breathless monologue that at times the judge had to ask her to slow down.\nShe came across as isolated, lost and lonely; a superstar that has been relentlessly manipulated. We knew that she had asked to put her case directly to the judge, but few could have predicted such a tirade. \nIt amounted to a withering critique of the conservatorship process and the motives of many - members of her family chief among them - who were supposed to have been caring for her.\nBoth the #FreeBritney movement and the recent release of a New York Times documentary about the singer have renewed public interest in the case.\nThe pop star has never commented directly on her conservatorship battle, with her online persona remaining upbeat.\nCourt records from 2019, the last time she spoke in court, have never been made public. But earlier this week the New York Times said it had obtained confidential court documents that showed the singer had opposed the restrictions since 2014.\nThe newspaper also reported that the singer felt she was forced to stay at a mental health facility in 2019 on exaggerated grounds which she viewed as punishment for standing up for herself.\nIn April, the pop star asked to address the court through her court-appointed attorney.\nA number of celebrities have posted messages of support.\nPop star Justin Timberlake, her boyfriend in the 1990s, posted a thread of tweets calling for people to stand by her: \"We should all be supporting Britney at this time. Regardless of our past, good and bad, and no matter how long ago it was\u2026 what's happening to her is just not right.\"\nTimberlake made a public apology to Spears earlier this year after the New York Times documentary suggested he had treated her disrespectfully by discussing their sex life on the radio. \nSpears's current boyfriend, the personal trainer and actor Sam Asghari, posted a picture on Instagram of himself in Free Britney T-Shirt.\nSinger Mariah Carey tweeted: \"We love you Britney!!! Stay strong.\"\nRose McGowan, the actor and MeToo activist, said Spears had every right to be angry, adding: \"How would you feel if your life was stolen, dissected, mocked? STOP CONTROLLING WOMEN.\""

      "text": "A claim that South African woman Gosiame Sithole gave birth to 10 babies earlier this month is not true, an official inquiry has found.\nNo hospitals in Gauteng province have a record of decuplets being born, the provincial government says.\nMedical tests show that Ms Sithole had not even been pregnant recently, it said.\nThe 37-year-old is now being held under the mental health act for observation and will be provided with support.\nThe statement did not elaborate on the reasons behind the fabrication of the story. \nIndependent Online (IOL), the media group which owns the Pretoria News that first reported the story, had stood by its reporting.\nIt went on to allege that Ms Sithole delivered the children on 7 June at Steve Biko Academic Hospital (SBAH) in the capital, Pretoria, saying staff were ill prepared.\nIt accused the hospital and the provincial health authorities of trying to cover up medical negligence.\n\"These allegations are false, unsubstantiated and only serve to tarnish the  good reputation of Steve Biko Academic Hospital and the Gauteng Provincial Government,\" the latest statement said.\nLegal action would be taken against the editor-in-chief of Pretoria News, Piet Rampedi, and IOL, it said.\nMs Sithole, who has six-year-old twins, and her partner Teboho Tsotetsi lived in Thembisa, a township with many working-class residents in Gauteng province near Johannesburg.\nAccording to IOL, they attended the same church as Rampedi where he was introduced to them in December. In May it is alleged he interviewed the couple who said they were expecting eight babies - a photoshoot shows Ms Sithole looking heavily pregnant.\nThe birth of a surprise 10 babies was announced by Pretoria News on 8 June quoting Mr Tsotetsi as the source. He later said he had received text messages from his partner telling him about it, adding he was not allowed at the hospital because of coronavirus restrictions.\nRampedi also relied on WhatsApp messages - and did not get independent confirmation from the hospital of the story.\nTheir local mayor then confirmed the births - which is when other outlets, including the BBC, published the story - but a government spokesman later said the politician only had the family's word and no-one had yet seen the babies. \nDonations began flooding in for the couple and their reported babies, dubbed the \"Thembisa 10\", including 1m rand ($70,000; \u00a350,000) from IOL chairman Iqbal Surv\u00e9.\nBut the story drew suspicion after Pretoria News initially failed to disclose the hospital where the babies were born and a series of hospitals in Gauteng came out to deny their involvement.\nTen days after the alleged births, IOL made the accusations against SBAH. \nThe couple seemed to fall out in the aftermath with Mr Tsotetsi reporting her missing and asking people to stop donations a week later, while Ms Sithole accused him of wanting to benefit financially from the babies, the Pretoria News reported.\nMeanwhile social workers managed to track down Ms Sithole and she was admitted to hospital for tests last Friday, the Gauteng provincial authorities say. \nA leaked memo seen by News24 alleges that Rampedi has recently apologised to IOL for \"the reputational damage\" the story has caused the group, saying he should have treated it more like an investigative piece rather than a \"feel-good story\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,NHS Scotland,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Vaccination is offering Scotland the \"route out\" of the pandemic, according to Nicola Sturgeon. The first minister told MSPs this week that the link between new cases and the serious health harms caused by the virus hasn't gone away - but it is weakening significantly.\nScotland recorded 2999 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday - a record high. What do recent figures show us about this link? And does this mean we no longer have to worry about case numbers?\nCases are rising fast - and there are no signs yet that the rate of new infections is slowing.\nScotland had been enjoying a sustained decline in the number of new Covid-19 cases, but that all changed on 5 May.\nSince then, the number of new Covid cases per day has mainly been rising, and at an increasing pace in recent days.\nOn 5 May, the number of cases detected over the previous seven days was 1,046. By 23 June, this figure had gone up to 11,067 - a 10-fold increase.\nScotland also has the highest case rate among all of the UK nations, reaching almost 203 cases per 100,000 people on Wednesday.\nThe sharp rise is being driven by the more infectious Delta variant, first identified in India, which accounts for more than 90% of new cases in the UK, according to the UK government.\nHowever, the Scottish government says fewer people are being treated in hospital for Covid illness now and fewer people are dying, despite this increase.\nIn short, yes.\nBut according to the government's analysis, only about 5% of people who are infected end up in hospital, rather than the 10% we were seeing before vaccination started to offer us protection.\nPeople are also staying hospital for shorter periods after being admitted.\nThe easiest way to see this is in a graph which shows the link between new cases and the number of people in hospital being treated for Covid.\nDuring the outbreaks in the autumn and over the winter, the daily figure on hospital occupancy has closely tracked the daily cases figure, but it's different this time.\nThe number of people in hospital is trending upwards, but the gap between the two lines is obvious.\nTo draw a comparison with the end of 2020, when the average number of new cases being recorded a day was similar to now, there were 1,174 Covid patients in hospital. On 23 June, there were 170.\nPublic Health Scotland publishes data on daily hospital admissions of people with a positive test for Covid, and again there appears to be a different pattern this time.\nOn 28 August, as the second wave took hold in Scotland, an average of seven people were being admitted a day. It was a similar figure on 5 May 2021, as the Delta variant began to drive a new wave of cases.\nThis next chart compares hospital admissions from those dates.\nFor the first three weeks there is not much difference at all between the two lines, but then the rate of new admissions in the autumn begins to rise at a much faster rate.\nThere is generally a lag of several weeks between new cases and Covid-related deaths, which means it is harder to draw firm conclusions on whether the link between the two figures is weakening.\nCertainly, the number of new death certificates mentioning Covid-19 in Scotland has been reasonably stable over the last few weeks.\nHowever, the rate of new deaths in the autumn did not begin to rise fast until the latter half of October - six to eight weeks after case numbers began going up.\nIn the seven days up to 6 September just two death certificates mentioned Covid-19, the lowest figure in any week since the pandemic began in Scotland.\nAfter that, weekly deaths began to rise, with 76 recorded in the seven days up to 18 October.\nLast week, there were 13 death certificates mentioning Covid-19, according to the National Records of Scotland - three weeks after this spring's low of four deaths in the middle of May.\nWhat happens to this rate in the next few weeks will give a clearer indication on how much the link with deaths has weakened.\nLinda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland she was expecting the number of deaths to go up.\n\"We will see more deaths if cases continue to increase and we're going to see those deaths in two groups - the unprotected by full vaccination and, in a small number of cases, people who have had both doses, because the vaccines are not 100% protective,\" she said. \n\"So I think it will go up, but I'm hoping that it won't go anywhere near where we were before.\"\nIn the first minister's statement to Holyrood on Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon announced a \"revised strategic framework\" for tackling Covid, which took into account the protection being offered by vaccination against Covid sickness.\nShe said that previously the Scottish government was intent on suppressing the virus to the \"lowest possible level\", but this has been replaced with an aim of suppressing the virus \"to a level consistent with alleviating its harms\".\nThis essentially means that higher numbers of cases will be tolerated than in past waves of the pandemic.\nThe Scottish government's new strategy reflects the latest guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) on public health and social measures to tackle Covid.\nIn this document, the WHO says the focus can shift from case numbers to hospital admissions and intensive care rates in countries where the most vulnerable are fully vaccinated - a position Scotland will be in by next week, according to the first minister.\nBut there is a balance to be struck here.\nIf case rates are allowed to get completely out of control, then pressure will inevitably increase on the NHS and more will die, Prof Bauld said.\n\"If we really see these numbers continue to increase, it's still going to translate into some hospital admissions and people becoming very unwell.\n\"So we've just got to hold the course for a few more weeks and try and send the behavioural message that this is not a free-for-all - we all need to do our bit.\"\nA high case rate also increases the risk of new variants of concern emerging - ones that are more infectious, more deadly or which are resistant to current vaccines.\nThe WHO's document says that some form of Covid restrictions - for example isolating after a positive test - will need to be used \"for the foreseeable future\".\n\"Things are improving but it's not going away,\" Prof Bauld said.\n\"Into the winter months we're still going to have to have some mitigations... there may be [restrictions] that are put in place again, rather than everything just continuing open indefinitely.\"\nAnd Prof Bauld also cautioned against governments coming up with an acceptable death rate for Covid-19.\n\"I think there's pressure on politicians to come up with a number of tolerable deaths from this disease in the future and quite rightly they're resisting that,\" she said.\n\"There are also these constant comparisons with flu which is unfortunate, because its much more deadly than influenza - and more transmissible.\"\nThe vaccination programme has been operating for more than six months and has been made possible thanks to the hundreds of people who give the jabs. If you are one of those vaccinators, we'd like to hear from you. Why did you get involved and how many jabs have you administered? \nYou can now get in touch with BBC Scotland on the phone messaging service, WhatsApp. \nTo start using the app, simply download WhatsApp on to your smartphone free from the internet.\nThen add our WhatsApp number +44 7902 704679 to your phone's contact list.\nPlease make sure you read our terms of use and privacy policy."
