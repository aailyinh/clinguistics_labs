      "text": "Scientists behind a study tracking coronavirus in England say there are signs of a \"shallow decline\" in infection levels but they remain high.\nAnd with not all regions seeing the same downward trend, pressure on health services is likely to continue.\nJust under one in 60 people had the virus between 6 and 22 January according to researchers, with the trends \"going in the right direction\". \nThe estimate is based on swab tests of 168,000 people in households. \nConfirmed UK coronavirus cases, based on people with symptoms having tests, have fallen sharply since the start of the year - but surveillance studies such as this one, which test people at home with or without symptoms, are thought to provide a more accurate picture of the spread of the virus. \nThe latest figures from Imperial College London's React study - one data source used by the government to judge the progress of the epidemic - cover the first two weeks of the third national lockdown.\nSteven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics, at Imperial, said the prevalence of the virus was \"going in the right direction but not fast enough\" and \"by no means as fast as in lockdown one\".\nThe data found trends varied across England, with signs of a slight rise in the East Midlands, declines in London, the South East and South West, and levelling elsewhere.\nBut London had the highest proportion of people testing positive - 2.83%, which went up to more than 4% in 13- to 17- and 18- to 24-year-olds.\nAn interim report from React found that infections may have risen slightly during the first week of lockdown restrictions.\nBlack or Asian people and those living in large households or deprived neighbourhoods were more likely to test positive than others.\nHealthcare and care-home workers, as well as other key workers, were also more likely to be infected compared with other workers.\nStudy lead Prof Paul Elliott said infection rates \"remain very high\" but he was \"definitely heartened by what looks like a decline\".\nAnd the priority was now to drive them down more quickly to reduce the pressure on busy hospitals.\n\"The number of people infected with the virus is at the highest level that we've recorded since we began testing last May,\" he said.\n\"We're not seeing the sharp drop in infections that happened under the first lockdown.\n\"And if infections aren't brought down significantly, hospitals won't be able to cope with the number of people that need critical care.\"\nMore than 37,000 people are in hospital with coronavirus in the UK - twice as many as during the first peak, in April.\nAnd more than 4,000 are on ventilators, more than at any other time during the pandemic.\nDeaths reported within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus remain high, averaging more than 1,000 a day in the past week. The number of people who have died with Covid-19 has now surpassed 100,000 in the UK.\nHospital admissions of patients with Covid are coming down slightly, according to government figures.\nAll these metrics are used by government ministers and scientific advisers to decide when best to lift restrictions.\nDr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology, at the University of Reading, said looking at hospital admissions alone was not a reliable way to do this.\n\"While there is still so much virus circulating in the population, there will be a significant risk of filling intensive-care units with unvaccinated members of the working-age population and those for whom the vaccine fails to give any protection against Covid-19,\" he said."

      "tags": "UK economy,Car industry",
      "text": "The number of new cars built in the UK last year fell by a third to just under 921,000, the lowest total since 1984, latest industry figures reveal.\nOutput was 920,928 vehicles, a 29.3% fall on 2019, rounding off a \"dreadful year\", Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders chief Mike Hawes said.\nPandemic-enforced plant closures and falling consumer demand meant the worst output \"in a generation\", he said.\nBut he said the vaccine roll out and EU trade deal inspired optimism for 2021 \nProduction for UK and export markets fell 30.4% and 29.1% respectively last year. Eight in ten UK-built cars still head overseas, which Mr Hawes said reinforced the importance of tariff-free trade with the EU.\nThe EU remained the UK's biggest export destination, taking a 53.5% share, despite volumes falling 30.8% to 400,460 units. \nIn December, output was down 2.3% to 71,403 vehicles, with some manufacturers, including Honda, affected by border closures and subsequent component supply issues. \nShipments to the US, Japan and Australia last year all fell, down 33.7%, 21.6% and 21.8% respectively. Exports to China, however, ended the year up 2.3%, and those to South Korea and Taiwan also rose 3.6% and 16.7% respectively as these nations travelled on different trajectories in dealing with the pandemic. \nDespite the gloom, the UK continued to roll out battery electric, plug-hybrid and hybrid vehicles to buyers at home and around the world. Combined production of these models rose to 18.8% of all cars made in Britain, up from 14.8% a year before.\nMr Hawes said: \"These figures, the worst in a generation, reflect the devastating impact of the pandemic... The industry faces 2021 with more optimism, however, with a vaccine being rolled out and clarity on how we trade with Europe, which remains by far our biggest market. \n\"The immediate challenge is to adapt to the new conditions, to overcome the additional customs burdens and regain our global competitiveness while delivering zero emission transport.\"\nIndependent forecasts say UK car production will partly recover in 2021 to one million, but Mr Hawes said much will depend on the continued impact of the virus, the speed with which showrooms can reopen, and how quickly manufacturers can come to terms with new trading arrangements with the EU, which he described as \"much more complicated\".\nHe hoped the latest figures reflected the \"lowest ebb\" for the industry, but added that significant investment would be needed to return to the figure of 1.7 million reported in 2016. \nThis is terrible news for car makers and workers, and in the old days when economic growth was the overriding indicator of a nation's success, it would be 100% bad.\nBut now climate change is also a priority, and some argue that requires a new perspective.\nIf fewer cars are bought, it's likely to mean fewer miles driven - and that's exactly what the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says we need to combat climate change and air pollution (which is still produced even from electric car tyres and brakes).\nThe young are already shunning driving in favour of Uber in a trend that will swell if driverless taxis ever hit the road. Many city councils want green, calm streets with people walking and cycling on space taken back from cars. \nSuppose a two-car family sells one and buys a bike: is this a fear, or an aspiration - or both?"

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Germany,Coronavirus vaccines,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Germany's vaccine committee has said AstraZeneca's Covid jab should only be given to people aged under 65. \nThe committee cited \"insufficient data\" over its efficacy for older people.\nThe European Medicines Agency is to decide on Friday whether to approve the vaccine for use across the EU.\nThe UK has been using the AstraZeneca vaccine in its mass immunisation programme for weeks now, and public health officials say it is safe and provides \"high levels of protection\".\nThe German announcement comes as the EU is in dispute with leading manufacturers over a shortage of vaccines on the continent.\nUK-based AstraZeneca has said production issues at its Europe-based plants mean it will be unable to deliver the promised number of doses to the bloc.\nBut the EU says the firm must honour its commitments and deliver the jabs by diverting stock from the UK. It is calling on members to \"make use of all legal means\" to secure the supply.  \nPfizer-BioNTech has also cut the number of doses it is delivering to the 27-member bloc.\nThe independent vaccine commission advising the German government said there were \"currently insufficient data available to assess the vaccine efficacy from 65 years of age\" and recommended \"the AstraZeneca vaccine... should only be offered to people aged 18-64 years at each stage\". \nBut Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisations at Public Health England, said both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are \"safe and provide high levels of protection against Covid-19.\n\"There were too few cases in older people in the AstraZeneca trials to observe precise levels of protection in this group, but data on immune responses were very reassuring.\"\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was not worried by the German recommendation, saying British health authorities had made clear the AstraZeneca vaccine was \"effective across all age groups\".\nMeanwhile, Paul Hunter, professor of Medicine at the University of East Anglia, told BBC News that the jab was safe for people over 65 \"almost certainly provides substantial benefits in terms of preventing severe disease and reduce the chances of going into hospital\".\nAll of the regulators and experts in different countries have been looking at the same data on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. That data comes from clinical trials, and those did recruit fewer elderly people overall. \nThat's because they started off first with younger volunteers to get results as quickly as possible, given the urgency to find out if a vaccine would work well enough to help get us out of the pandemic.\nThe scientists who ran the trials have always been upfront about this. But they say there is other evidence to suggest the vaccine will work well in older adults. Studies show the over 65s have a strong immune responses to the vaccine. After receiving the shots their blood has plenty of the required antibodies that can fight coronavirus.\nThe UK has been using the AstraZeneca vaccine in its mass immunisation programme for weeks now and should soon have more proof from the real world setting about how much protection the shots give.  \nThe pace of the EU's vaccination programme has been criticised in recent weeks.\nThere are shortages due to delays in shipments of both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which are the only ones currently approved for use in the block.\nVaccination appointments are being delayed in many countries. In Madrid, Spain, authorities have suspended first doses of the vaccination for at least two weeks.\nSweden was set to receive one million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in February but is now expected to get just 400,000 doses.\nEuropean Council President Charles Michel commented on AstraZeneca's inability to provide all the doses expected over the coming weeks.\n\"If no satisfactory solution can be found, I believe we should explore all options and make use of all legal means and enforcement measures at our disposal,\" he said in a letter to EU leaders.\nToned down rhetoric\nOn Thursday the EU tried to dial down the emotion in its ongoing battle to get AstraZeneca to deliver the number of vaccines stipulated in their contract. Until now Brussels had reacted with outrage at the news it might only get a fraction of the vaccines expected from Astra Zeneca.\nNow it's toning down the rhetoric. Instead the president of the European Council threatened legal action. The EU has also stepped away from involving the UK in the row.\nIt is still arguing that AstraZeneca should use its plants in the UK, as well as those in the EU, to supply the bloc with promised vaccines. Brussels also disagrees with the UK government that its contract with AstraZeneca should get priority as it was signed first.\nBut in public, the European Commission was keen to underline today that its dispute was with AstraZeneca, not the UK government.\nThe EU signed a deal with AstraZeneca in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more, but the UK-Swedish company has reported production delays at plants in the Netherlands and Belgium.\nAstraZeneca's CEO said production was \"basically two months behind where we wanted to be\".\nThe EU had hoped that as soon as approval was given - which is expected on Friday - delivery would start straight away, but the production issues have dented this hope.\nReports said last week the EU would get 60% fewer vaccine doses - about 50 million jabs - than promised in the first quarter of the year.\nThe bloc is also facing delays with supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and it has a much bigger deal with the US-German vaccine maker.\nBoth the EU and AstraZeneca have vowed to work together to resolve the problems."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you Friday morning.\nThe prime minister and Public Health England have both defended the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, after Germany recommended that it should only be given to people aged under 65. Dr Mary Ramsay of PHE said the jab offers \"high levels of protection\" against Covid-19, particularly against severe illness, while Boris Johnson said he was not concerned by Germany's recommendation. AstraZeneca said the latest analyses of the jab's trial data supported efficacy in the over-65s. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is to decide on Friday whether to approve the vaccine for use across the EU.\nTory MP Sir Desmond Swayne has refused to apologise after claims he spread \"dangerous misinformation\" about coronavirus. The New Forest West MP told an anti-lockdown group that statistics on the virus \"appear to have been manipulated\" and risks to the NHS were \"manageable\". Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the comments were \"unacceptable\" and called for him to apologise, while Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has called for the prime minister to \"condemn these comments and take action\".  But Sir Desmond has stood by his remarks, saying he held a \"legitimate point of view\".\nThe government has withdrawn a social media advert urging people to \"Stay Home. Save Lives\" after it was criticised for stereotyping women. The image showed women home schooling children and doing domestic chores, while the only man featured was depicted relaxing on a sofa. The infographic was withdrawn after going viral on social media and facing criticism for being \"sexist\". The government said the ad did \"not reflect\" its \"view on women\".\nAfter the news that British residents arriving in England from Covid hotspots will have to quarantine in hotels, many would-be holidaymakers are again thinking of opting for UK destinations this summer. But there may be a shortage of the kind of UK accommodation they are looking for as demand is on the increase, say providers of holiday lets. Sarah and Steve Jarvis, who run the Independent Cottages website, say inquiries during the current lockdown in England are 300% up on the first lockdown in March to July 2020. \"People have got confidence in UK self-catering holidays, because the bookings are coming in thick and fast,\" Steve said.\nA mother whose baby survived an E-coli infection, sepsis and Covid after being born at 1lb 11oz has said he is \"our little warrior\". Sheree Murray was 25 weeks pregnant when she gave birth to Archie, who weighed just 765g, on 1 December. Archie was five weeks old when he got an E-coli infection which led to sepsis, and a week later his parents were told he had tested positive for Covid-19. He had to go into isolation for 10 days, but when his mother was finally able to hold him again she said she felt like she was on \"cloud nine\". \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "tags": "Companies,Apple",
      "text": "Apple sales have hit another record, as families loaded up on the firm's latest phones, laptops and gadgets during the Christmas period. \nSales in the last three months of 2020 hit more than $111bn (\u00a381bn) - up 21% from the prior year.\nThe gains come as the pandemic pushes more activity online, fuelling demand for new technology.\nApple now counts more than 1.65 billion active devices globally, including more than 1 billion iPhones.\nApple's gains follow the release of its new iPhone 12 suite of phones, which executives said had convinced a record number of people to switch to the company or upgrade from older models.\nThe firm said growth in China - where the pandemic has already loosened its grip on the economy - was particularly strong, helped in part by demand for phones compatible with new 5G networks. \nSales in the firm's greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, jumped 57%. In Europe, sales roles 17%, and they rose 11% in the Americas.\n\"The products are doing very well all around the world,\" said Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer. \"As we look ahead into the March quarter, we're very optimistic.\"\nAnalyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said he thought the firm was just at the beginning of a \"super-cycle\" as Apple devotees finally trade in old phones, coinciding with upgrades to telecommunications networks.\n\"With 5G now in the cards and roughly 40% of its 'golden jewel' iPhone installed base not upgrading their phones in the last 3.5 years, [Apple chief Tim] Cook & Co have the stage set for a renaissance of growth,\" he wrote.\nBig Tech is having an exceptionally lucrative pandemic. \nIt's hard not to be wowed by some of these figures. \nThat Apple recorded more than $100bn in sales in just three months is simply astonishing.\nFacebook figures are also well up on where they were last year. \nAs other companies have struggled to survive, Big Tech has flourished. \nThere are other reasons for some of these incredible figures. Certainly it seems iPhone enthusiasts were holding out for the new 5G enabled iPhone12. \nBut it's not just Apple and Facebook, all of the massive tech companies are having a bumper year.\nCovid-19 means people are spending more time indoors - buying things online, watching things online and chatting online.\nPerhaps then it's no surprise that these companies are posting record breaking figures. \nBut others point to these figures as yet more evidence that Big Tech has become too big to fail. \nThese figures are impressive. But they also attract the attention of politicians who are increasingly asking difficult questions - like are these tech mega companies operating in a market that is fair and with enough competition?\nApple said profits in the quarter reached nearly $28.8bn, up 29% compared with the same quarter last year.\nThe gains seen by technology firms like Apple contrast with losses hitting many other economic sectors, as the virus restricts activity and keeps shoppers at home.\nOther tech firms, such as Microsoft and Facebook, have also enjoyed strong growth.\nFacebook on Wednesday said increased online shopping during the pandemic helped lift ad revenue in the quarter by 30%. \nThe number of people active on its apps - which also include WhatsApp and Instagram - also rose to 2.6 billion daily, up 15% compared to 2019.\nIt said ad spending could slow as the Covid crisis relaxes and shopper appetite returns for services like travel rather than products.\nIt also warned that plans by Apple to change how it shares user data could weigh on growth."

The documents claim he \"actively participated and had complete knowledge of the conspiracy\".\n\"There are very serious charges against him including murder and abetment of terrorism,\" an Indian government official told the BBC.\n\"The seriousness of charges against him have been shared with the British authorities,\" they added.   \nMr Johal's lawyer, Jaspal Singh Manjphur, who has represented him since he was first arrested, told the BBC he was concerned by the length of time it was taking for the case to go through the Indian legal system.\n\"He has been in custody for over three years,\" Mr Manjphur said. \"Normally, if the prosecution wants, they can complete the case in that much time.\"\nMr Manjphur said the authorities had yet to provide any him with any evidence linking his client to the crimes and feared he was being framed, a charge denied by officials.\nA few weeks ago, Mr Johal was accused of being involved in another crime. While in prison he has been arrested for helping to plot the murder of a man in October 2020.\n\"He is in a high security jail, he is under CCTV surveillance for 24 hours. How can he be in contact with anyone?\", Mr Manjphur said.\nMr Johal is being held at Delhi's maximum security Tihar jail. \nHe claims he is often forced to stay in solitary confinement and is denied the same facilities as other prisoners, such as hot water. \n\"By making me stay in these conditions, they are ensuring that my mental condition remains disturbed,\" he said.\n\"It is very tough to live here,\" he said.\nThe vast majority of inmates at the prison are, like Mr Johal, held before a conviction in what is known as an \"under-trial\" in India.\nAt the end of 2019, 82% of prisoners held in Tihar jail had yet to complete the trial process. \nIn India it can take many years before under-trial prisoners ever get to court, especially in terror cases where bail is hard to secure, a concern for Mr Johal's lawyer. \n\"He will languish in jail until the trial is completed, in such cases it could take anywhere between five to 10 years,\" Mr Manjphur said.\nThe human rights charity Reprieve has written to the UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, asking that he calls for Mr Johal's immediate release.\nReprieve is also worried that some of the charges Mr Johal is awaiting trial for carry the death penalty as the maximum punishment. But experts stress that executions in India are extremely rare. \nThe UK's Foreign Commonwealth and Development office told the BBC that Mr Raab did raise the case with his Indian counterpart during his trip to India in December.\n\"We have consistently raised concerns about his case with the Government of India, including allegations of torture and mistreatment and his right to a fair trial,\" it said in a statement.\n\"Our staff continue to support Jagtar Singh Johal following his detention in India, and are in regular contact with his family and prison officials about his health and wellbeing.\"\nBut Mr Johal's brother Gurpreet said the family was still waiting for a meeting with the foreign secretary.\nHe said: \"We are calling for either Jagtar to be charged and a fair trial to take place or to be returned back to his country so he can spend his life with his wife in the UK.\" \nIn August last year Gurpreet Singh Johal was joined by dozens who protested outside Downing Street.\nJagtar Singh Johal's case has sparked protests around the world, from Westminster to Washington, Geneva to Toronto.\nIn his statement to the BBC, Mr Johal had this message for officials back home: \"I plead to the UK government to support me, I'm a British citizen and the government should understand that.\" "

      "text": "Two Australian states will reopen their borders to New South Wales (NSW) after it managed to control a Covid-19 outbreak in Sydney.\nSouth Australia and Queensland will remove their travel restrictions on Sunday and Monday respectively.\nIt comes after NSW reported 11 days without a locally acquired infection.\nAbout 180 cases were tied to the Sydney cluster, which emerged just before Christmas and prompted nationwide travel bans on the city's residents.\n\"Credit to New South Wales. They got on top of their cases,\" said Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk on Thursday.\nAustralia has recorded more than 22,000 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began - far fewer than many other countries.\nIn recent months in particular, the nation has taken swift and aggressive actions to contain outbreaks at their source.\nEarlier this month, the Queensland capital Brisbane completed a three-day lockdown over the detection of a single case.\nThis week, Australia also suspended a travel bubble with New Zealand after its first Covid case in months was confirmed to be a more contagious variant.\nNSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian welcomed the state border decisions on Thursday, saying: \"I hope this brings a lot of joy and relief to people and that people are reunited.\" \nMs Berejiklian had previously criticised some of the border closures from other states, arguing they were a disproportionate response. She noted many NSW residents lived far away from the Sydney hotspots.\nHer state managed to curb the city's fast-growing outbreak in December through aggressive contract tracing, restricting gathering sizes and making masks mandatory in shops and on public transport.\nDaily case numbers dropped to low single-digits by early January - prompting many Australian jurisdictions to allow travel to and from certain areas in the state.\nCurrently, only Western Australia maintains a 14-day quarantine requirement for people visiting from NSW.\nFrom Friday, limits on group gatherings in Sydney will also be eased. Face masks will also no longer be mandatory in retail shops but will still be required on public transport.\nOn Wednesday, Australia's Health Minister Greg Hunt confirmed the nation had not recorded a single local case since 17 January. Its only infections had been in returned overseas travellers in hotel quarantine.\n\"At the same time, the world has passed 100 million confirmed Covid cases and almost 17,000 lives have been lost in the last 24 hours,\" he added.\nOn Thursday, Australia was ranked eighth in a list of nations which had responded best to the virus. New Zealand and Vietnam topped the list from the Lowy Institute think tank."

      "tags": "Michael Gove,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "There \"will be no interruption\" to UK vaccine supplies, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said, after the EU urged AstraZeneca to supply it with doses from UK plants.\n\"It is the case that the supplies that have been planned, paid for and scheduled should continue,\" he added.\nThe EU and AstraZeneca are involved in a row over vaccine supply shortages.\nMeanwhile, Germany's vaccine committee has said the AstraZeneca vaccine should only be given to people aged under 65.\nIt cited a lack of sufficient data to recommend use in older age groups. \nThe EU has demanded that UK-made jabs are diverted to mainland Europe to fulfil contractual obligations.\nAstraZeneca has previously said it could deliver only a fraction of the doses between January and March that it had promised to the bloc, blaming production issues at EU plants for a reported 50 million-dose shortfall.\nHowever, they have both pledged to work together to resolve the crisis.\nMr Gove said the UK must continue with the \"acceleration\" of its vaccine rollout, which relies on \"the supply schedule that has been agreed to be honoured\".\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that \"we all want to do everything possible\" to ensure that as many people in neighbouring countries are vaccinated, which he said was best achieved through \"dialogue and co-operation and friendship\".\nPressed on whether the government will allow vaccines to go to the EU, he said: \"No\", adding that vaccine supplies \"that have been planned, paid for and scheduled should continue.\n\"There will be no interruption to that.\" \nThe prime minister's official spokesman said it \"remains our priority to vaccinate the most vulnerable across the UK\" when asked whether No 10 was considering the idea of sending jabs to the EU.\nAsked to clarify what he meant by \"most vulnerable\", he said that meant the top nine groups identified as most at risk - all those over 50, care home and health service staff and others at clinical risk - and the plan remained to vaccinate them by spring. \nHe would not comment on whether that meant vaccines manufactured in the UK could be delivered to the EU after that date.\nSir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the UK government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said it was in the UK's \"national interests\" to ensure as many people in the world as possible were vaccinated.\nAsked if vaccine nationalism was a reality in Europe, he told the Today programme: \"Yes, I'm afraid it is and it's something that we absolutely have to negotiate, we have to avoid, and it doesn't serve anybody to have these fights over vaccine supply.\"\nThe UK government is taking a firm line on this - and for good reason it believes.\nIt invested in the research done by Oxford University that developed this jab and was then quick to sign a deal with AstraZeneca for supply.\nThe deal was done in May, three months before the EU signed its contract.\nThat gave the UK a head start.\nThe UK supply is manufactured here - at plants in Oxfordshire and Staffordshire.\nSome doses were sent to Germany and the Netherlands last year for a process called fill-and-finish, which involves putting it into vials. This is now being done at a plant in Wrexham, creating a complete UK supply chain.\nAnd that arrangement, AstraZeneca sources say, had no impact on the production problems the EU vaccine manufacturing plants experienced.\nMaking a vaccine is a biological process - there are no guarantees in terms of quantity.\nThe fact the UK was quick off the mark gave the UK plants more time to tweak the process to get a better yield.\nIf the UK was to give the vaccine to the EU, why not then other countries? And would that be right when more than 1,000 people a day are dying with Covid here?\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the \"war of words\" between the EU and AstraZeneca has \"got to be resolved\". He told LBC Radio that he wanted to rectify the issue by \"ramping up manufacture\" globally, but he did not want a solution that would \"interrupt\" the UK's vaccination effort.\nAstraZeneca has blamed supply issues on manufacturing problems in two plants - one in Belgium and another in the Netherlands.\nThe EU, which signed a deal for 300 million doses in August, said it should not receive fewer doses just because the UK signed a contract with the UK-Swedish company earlier. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said AstraZeneca's two UK plants \"had to deliver\" doses.\nResponding to Germany's recommendation that the AstraZeneca jab should only be given to the under 65s, Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at Public Health England, said: \"Both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are safe and provide high levels of protection against Covid-19, particularly against severe disease. \n\"There were too few cases in older people in the AstraZeneca trials to observe precise levels of protection in this group, but data on immune responses were very reassuring.\"\nAn AstraZeneca spokesperson said the latest analyses of clinical trial data for its vaccine \"support efficacy in the over 65 years age group\", adding that the firm was awaiting \"a regulatory decision on the vaccine by the European medicines Agency (EMA) in the coming days\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he was not concerned by Germany's recommendation, adding that the UK's watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), had \"made it very clear\" that the AstraZeneca vaccine gives a \"high degree of protection after just one dose, and even more after two doses\".\nHe added: \"The evidence that they've supplied is that they think it is effective across all age groups [and] provides a good immune response across all age groups, so I don't agree with that [Germany's recommendation].\"\nThe UK government has promised to to deliver a first vaccine dose to 15 million of the most vulnerable by mid-February and to offer all adults their first dose by autumn.\nLatest figures show that more than 7.1 million people in the UK have now received a first jab.\nAsked about Labour's calls for teachers to be vaccinated over half-term, Mr Gove said the government wanted to concentrate on vaccinating \"the most vulnerable first\", adding that any decision on who should be prioritised next would be based on scientific advice.\nHe reiterated comments from England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, by saying that schools \"were in themselves safe\" but that children could pass on the virus to each other and then back into the community.\nProf Van-Tam also told Wednesday's Downing Street briefing there was not a \"markedly increased rate of infection or mortality\" from Covid-19 among teachers.\nHowever, Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has contested that, saying that teachers \"by virtue of them having to go out and do a frontline facing job, are more at risk of catching Covid\".\nPressed on why she was bringing herself into conflict with the scientific advice, she told the Today programme she said data showed \"all frontline key workers, including teachers... are more at risk of infection and death - that's a fact\".\nThe UK recorded a further 1,239 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test on Thursday, according to government figures. There have also been another 28,680 new infections.\nIn other developments:\nHave you been affected by vaccine supply issues?

      "tags": "Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Boris Johnson,Scottish independence,SNP (Scottish National Party)",
      "text": "It's a sign of these lockdown times that there's a bit of a row over whether the prime minister should be visiting Scotland at all on Thursday. \nFirst minister Nicola Sturgeon has said people shouldn't be travelling across the UK - and politicians should lead by example.\nBut Downing Street insists it is a \"fundamental role of the PM to be the physical representative of the UK government\".\nWhile London and Edinburgh debate whether the visit meets Covid guidelines, many unionists now believe making their case increasingly falls into the essential category. \nFor months, polls have suggested support for Scottish independence is higher than that for staying the UK.\nWe at the BBC like to be cautious around polls, but there is now a pattern: support for the Union looks weaker than ever. \nThere are two key reasons for the increase in support for independence, which come up time and again in conversations. Both are linked to Boris Johnson.\nThe first is Brexit. A comfortable majority of Scottish voters backed Remain in 2016 - and some of the increased support for independence appears to come from that group.\nThat's unlikely to be helped by the fact that the most prominent Brexit backer is now prime minister. \nThe second reason is the way the pandemic has been handled. Health is a devolved issue, so the Scottish government has been making most of the big decisions on it for the past 10 months.\nAlthough Scottish ministers admit mistakes have been made, polls suggest Scots are happy Ms Sturgeon is making the decisions and not Mr Johnson.\nPolling also indicates most Scots think an independent Scotland would have dealt with the pandemic better.\nSenior unionist campaigners and strategists in Scotland believe the Sturgeon v Johnson choice is one of their weakest points. \nSNP politicians only half-joke about rubbing their hands in glee when the prime minister heads north. \nEven senior Scottish Tories privately admit their man is just not popular in Scotland. That's why you normally see them focus on the Scottish leadership: Douglas Ross and Ruth Davidson. \nOne unionist strategist lamented: \"Boris is a liability.\" Yet this source also believes it is important for UK ministers to make regular trips to show they are engaging and making their case. \n\"There is a sense that Westminster Tories are suddenly paying attention... they're suddenly realising it's an existential threat,\" they said.\nThe UK government knows it needs to make the case for the Union more forcefully - and positively.  \nWe've already looked at how it intends to say no to an independence referendum in the near future - arguing recovery from the pandemic is the priority. But in Whitehall, many acknowledge they need to do more than just say no.\nExpect to hear more in the coming weeks about the UK government's role in Scottish life. Note how, on Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock made a point of talking about the Scottish Ambulance Service receiving support from other UK services.\nThis isn't uncommon, and works both ways, but unionists believe it shows the strength of cooperation. \"The Union in action,\" texted one person close to the prime minister. \nMr Johnson sees the vaccine programme as another example. The UK government has been responsible for procurement and the Scottish government is then responsible for distribution. \"It's a strong example of the governments of the UK working together,\" said a source.   \nThe Scottish government argues there would still be close cooperation if Scotland were independent. A senior source told me they believed the UK government had held it back at points in the pandemic - also suggesting it had failed to commit properly to a strategy to eliminate the virus earlier this year. \nThe UK government is prepared to fund projects in devolved areas, despite the row that will cause with Holyrood, because it believes it will show that Scotland has two governments, both of which matter. \nNone of this disguises the polling, though. Mr Johnson's government has argued for months that the furlough scheme is a perfect example of the UK in action - the Treasury supporting workers across the UK.\nThat hasn't always worked - and even backfired when the chancellor was accused of only extending the scheme when the South of England went into lockdown, not when Scotland and Wales both asked. \nIn London, there are debates about what to do next. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove is a key figure. The PM's former deputy Brexit negotiator Oliver Lewis is playing a central role too.\nA cabinet committee now meets almost weekly to discuss Union strategy, with representation from the Treasury, Cabinet Office, Scotland Office, Wales Office and Northern Ireland Office. \nSources talk of different strategies being floated, but say the main focus will be recovery from Covid, and arguing that's easier as part of the UK.\nInsiders talk about a focus on showing the tangible benefits of the Union, rather than \"constitutional tinkering\". \nLabour has set up a commission to look at devolution across the UK. It is being advised by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who argues the solution is as much about rediscovering the purpose of the UK as it is about moving more powers out of London. \nMuch of this is focused on May's Holyrood election. If the SNP wins comfortably - as polls suggest it will do - it will be able to go to Westminster and say it has a mandate for another referendum.\nMr Johnson has said an independence referendum should happen no more than once in a generation, but some believe that position is unsustainable. \nAs he visits Scotland, the stakes are high.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Schools in England will not be able to reopen to all pupils after the February half-term, but could do so from 8 March, the prime minister has said.\nBoris Johnson said this was the earliest schools could reopen and \"depends on lots of things going right\".\nThe BBC has been told the aim is for all schools and year groups in England to return at the same time. \nTheir return would mark the first stage in lifting the lockdown, the PM said.\nHe told a Downing Street news conference: \"The date of 8 March is the earliest that we think it is sensible to set for schools to go back and obviously we hope that all schools will go back.\"\n\"I'm hopeful, but that's the earliest that we can do it and it depends on lots of things going right, and... it also depends on us all now continuing to work together to drive down the incidence of the disease through the basic methods we've used throughout this pandemic,\" he added.\nThere was not enough data yet to decide when to end the lockdown, he said, but intended to set out a plan for how it could be eased - and the criteria involved - in the final week of February\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described the 8 March date as \"very much a hope and certainly not a guarantee\".\nMeanwhile, a further 1,725 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the latest government figures. The UK's official coronavirus death toll surpassed 100,000 on Tuesday. \nMr Johnson told MPs the country remained in a \"perilous situation\" as he said UK nationals and residents arriving from 30 high-risk countries would soon be ordered to quarantine in hotels.\nHe revealed a plan for the \"gradual and phased\" lifting of the lockdown in England could come in the week beginning 22 February.\nOther restrictions on daily life could be eased after schools reopen, but he explained this would depend on hitting vaccination targets, the capacity of the NHS, and deaths falling.\nAn earlier plan for mass testing for pupils and staff remains in place, the BBC has been told.\nEngland's schools have been closed to all but vulnerable children and those of key workers since the Christmas break.\nIn Scotland, it is hoped schools may begin a phased return in the middle of February. \nIn Wales, measures including school and college closures will be reviewed on Friday. In Northern Ireland, a review will take place on Thursday.\nThe prime minister said he understood frustration among pupils and teachers \"and for parents and for carers who spent so many months juggling their day jobs, not only with home schooling but meeting the myriad other demands of their children from breakfast until bedtime\".\nThe government initially planned to review England's lockdown measures - including school closures - on 15 February, which had raised hopes that pupils could return to classes after half term.\nAcknowledging the impact of continued school closures, Mr Johnson pledged to \"work with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure that pupils have the chance to make up their learning\" before 2024.\nHe said \u00a3300m \"of new money to schools\" would fund a catch-up programme over the coming year, with financial incentives for providers to educate pupils who have missed lessons due to the pandemic. \nAfter complaints about confusion and drift about when schools in England are going back, Boris Johnson has sought to bring some certainty.\nThey won't be going back straight after half term - but the target date will be 8 March.\nSources say the aim is for all schools and year groups in England, in primary and secondary, to return back on that date - rather than it being the starting date of a phased or regional return.\nAlthough that could be subject to any changes in local Covid-19 levels.\nWhen schools do go back it is expected there will be mass testing for pupils and staff, in the scheme initially planned for the start of term.\nIt still leaves parents home schooling for another five weeks - and means most of this term will have been without face-to-face lessons.\nThis will be a particular worry for pupils heading for whatever replaces GCSEs and A-levels this summer, after almost a full year of stop-start lessons.\nHead teachers say the delay is \"no surprise\" - and reopening must be done safely.\nAnd Labour says half term should be used to vaccinate teachers to help schools stay open.\nBut the prime minister will hope that parents would rather have some clarity about what's happening with schools, even if that means a longer delay.\nTeachers' and head teachers' unions said they supported reopening schools but added that it must be safe and not rushed.\nMary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said that although the most vulnerable would be protected by March, most parents would not be.\n\"It fails completely to recognise the role schools have played in community transmission. The prime minister has already forgotten what he told the nation at the beginning of this lockdown, that schools are a 'vector for transmission',\" she said.\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said the government needs to work with head teachers to review safety measures and create a \"workable plan\" for schools to reopen fully.\n\"The government will also have to put effort into reassuring families that it is safe to send their children back to school - there is a confidence test the government must pass to make the return a success,\" he said.\nIn other developments:"

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "tags": "Germany,Coronavirus vaccines,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Germany's vaccine committee has said AstraZeneca's Covid jab should only be given to people aged under 65. \nThe committee cited \"insufficient data\" over its efficacy for older people.\nThe European Medicines Agency is to decide on Friday whether to approve the vaccine for use across the EU.\nThe UK has been using the AstraZeneca vaccine in its mass immunisation programme for weeks now, and public health officials say it is safe and provides \"high levels of protection\".\nThe German announcement comes as the EU is in dispute with leading manufacturers over a shortage of vaccines on the continent.\nUK-based AstraZeneca has said production issues at its Europe-based plants mean it will be unable to deliver the promised number of doses to the bloc.\nBut the EU says the firm must honour its commitments and deliver the jabs by diverting stock from the UK. It is calling on members to \"make use of all legal means\" to secure the supply.  \nPfizer-BioNTech has also cut the number of doses it is delivering to the 27-member bloc.\nThe independent vaccine commission advising the German government said there were \"currently insufficient data available to assess the vaccine efficacy from 65 years of age\" and recommended \"the AstraZeneca vaccine... should only be offered to people aged 18-64 years at each stage\". \nBut Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisations at Public Health England, said both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are \"safe and provide high levels of protection against Covid-19.\n\"There were too few cases in older people in the AstraZeneca trials to observe precise levels of protection in this group, but data on immune responses were very reassuring.\"\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was not worried by the German recommendation, saying British health authorities had made clear the AstraZeneca vaccine was \"effective across all age groups\".\nMeanwhile, Paul Hunter, professor of Medicine at the University of East Anglia, told BBC News that the jab was safe for people over 65 \"almost certainly provides substantial benefits in terms of preventing severe disease and reduce the chances of going into hospital\".\nAll of the regulators and experts in different countries have been looking at the same data on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. That data comes from clinical trials, and those did recruit fewer elderly people overall. \nThat's because they started off first with younger volunteers to get results as quickly as possible, given the urgency to find out if a vaccine would work well enough to help get us out of the pandemic.\nThe scientists who ran the trials have always been upfront about this. But they say there is other evidence to suggest the vaccine will work well in older adults. Studies show the over 65s have a strong immune responses to the vaccine. After receiving the shots their blood has plenty of the required antibodies that can fight coronavirus.\nThe UK has been using the AstraZeneca vaccine in its mass immunisation programme for weeks now and should soon have more proof from the real world setting about how much protection the shots give.  \nThe pace of the EU's vaccination programme has been criticised in recent weeks.\nThere are shortages due to delays in shipments of both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which are the only ones currently approved for use in the block.\nVaccination appointments are being delayed in many countries. In Madrid, Spain, authorities have suspended first doses of the vaccination for at least two weeks.\nSweden was set to receive one million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in February but is now expected to get just 400,000 doses.\nEuropean Council President Charles Michel commented on AstraZeneca's inability to provide all the doses expected over the coming weeks.\n\"If no satisfactory solution can be found, I believe we should explore all options and make use of all legal means and enforcement measures at our disposal,\" he said in a letter to EU leaders.\nToned down rhetoric\nOn Thursday the EU tried to dial down the emotion in its ongoing battle to get AstraZeneca to deliver the number of vaccines stipulated in their contract. Until now Brussels had reacted with outrage at the news it might only get a fraction of the vaccines expected from Astra Zeneca.\nNow it's toning down the rhetoric. Instead the president of the European Council threatened legal action. The EU has also stepped away from involving the UK in the row.\nIt is still arguing that AstraZeneca should use its plants in the UK, as well as those in the EU, to supply the bloc with promised vaccines. Brussels also disagrees with the UK government that its contract with AstraZeneca should get priority as it was signed first.\nBut in public, the European Commission was keen to underline today that its dispute was with AstraZeneca, not the UK government.\nThe EU signed a deal with AstraZeneca in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more, but the UK-Swedish company has reported production delays at plants in the Netherlands and Belgium.\nAstraZeneca's CEO said production was \"basically two months behind where we wanted to be\".\nThe EU had hoped that as soon as approval was given - which is expected on Friday - delivery would start straight away, but the production issues have dented this hope.\nReports said last week the EU would get 60% fewer vaccine doses - about 50 million jabs - than promised in the first quarter of the year.\nThe bloc is also facing delays with supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and it has a much bigger deal with the US-German vaccine maker.\nBoth the EU and AstraZeneca have vowed to work together to resolve the problems."

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Coronavirus vaccines,Desmond Swayne,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A Tory MP has refused to apologise after claims he spread \"dangerous misinformation\" about coronavirus. \nSir Desmond Swayne told an anti-lockdown group that statistics on the virus \"appear to have been manipulated\" and risks to the NHS were \"manageable\".\nHome Secretary Priti Patel called the remarks \"thoroughly wrong\" and urged Sir Desmond to retract them.\nBut the New Forest West MP has stood by his words, telling Sky News he held a \"legitimate point of view\".\nSir Desmond - who has been a frequent critic of lockdown measures in Parliament - declined to be interviewed by the BBC about his comments.\nHe spoke to an anti-lockdown group - which also questions vaccine safety - during a recorded interview in November.\n\"We're told there is a deathly, deadly pandemic proceeding at the moment,\" he said. \"That is difficult to reconcile with ICUs (intensive care units) actually operating at typical occupation levels for the time of year and us bouncing round at the typical level of deaths for the time of year.\"\nThe interview has surfaced in the week the UK passed 100,000 deaths linked to the virus, and NHS data shows more than 37,000 people are in hospital with Covid-19. \nLabour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has called for the prime minister to \"intervene urgently\" over Sir Desmond''s conduct.\nShe said Boris Johnson should \"condemn these comments and take action\", adding: \"A failure to do so risks undermining our national effort to defeat this virus, combat dangerous anti-vaccine disinformation and vaccinate Britain.\"\nMs Patel said: \"These comments are thoroughly wrong and I very much hope Desmond will reflect and retract [them].\n\"I would strongly urge him to think about what he has said and the context in which his comments have been made and take these comments back.\"\nAnd Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said he hoped Sir Desmond \"would issue a full and complete retraction and apology for what he said\".\nBut the backbench MP told Sky News he had already complained in the Commons about \"the way in which statistics have been presented and data has been revealed\" during the pandemic and he was \"not clear as to what what I am being asked to apologise for\".\nAsked if he would apologise for his comments, Sir Desmond said \"no\" and claimed any action against him by his party would be a \"thought crime\".\nHe added: \"I accept entirely that the situation has changed and changed dramatically as a consequence of the new variant. But I think they were perfectly legitimate and widely held views at the time.\"\nIt is understood the Conservative Chief Whip, Mark Spencer, will speak to the MP and ask him to attend a meeting with scientific advisers.\nDuring the interview, he questions the \"manipulated\" figures which have influenced decisions made by the government. \nThe interview was done in early November and he states that death rates and critical care bed occupancy in hospital were fairly normal for that time of year.  \nBut this doesn't really represent why lockdowns are put in place. \nIn theory, they are put in place when cases are increasing quickly (or ideally just before) to stop hospitals being overwhelmed and deaths getting too high.\nWe normally see the increase in hospitalisations and deaths a couple of weeks after spikes in cases.  \nWhen the interview was recorded, deaths in England and Wales were 14% above average for that time of year, but by the end of November, they were 20% above average. Tory MP refuses to apologise over Covid claims\nAnd over the two weeks after the interview, the number of patients with coronavirus in intensive care units (ICU) in England increased by 25% to 1,250. \nMore recently, we've seen the impact of what happens when cases increase dramatically, influenced by the new strain of the virus.  \nThere are now around 3,700 patients with coronavirus in ICU - almost triple the number at the end of the second lockdown - and hospitals have had to find more critical care beds. \nThis has led to the recommended patient-doctor ratio not being met and patients being sent to other parts of the country for care. \nAnd in the most recent week, deaths were about 28% above average.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Social work,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Social workers say they are braced for a \"tsunami of needs\" as the UK recovers from the pandemic.\nThe British Association of Social Workers (BASW) expects workloads to increase as restrictions are lifted.\nOne worker described a \"big surge\" in referrals after the first lockdown and the fears of missing something wrong.\nOfficials in all four nations praised the efforts of social workers and highlighted schemes to help vulnerable children set up in the pandemic.\nA survey conducted by the BASW at the end of last year, seen by the BBC, suggests the majority of members had seen an increase in referrals since schools returned in the autumn. \nMinny Jackson, not her real name, works as a social worker with children in Greater London. \"When lockdown started it was quiet for a little bit, but definitely when the schools came back there was a big surge in referrals coming through. \n\"In March my case load was 18, now it's 26. Our biggest challenge is that every week we're getting new referrals on duty.\"\nMs Jackson said that trend was repeated after the short lockdown in England in November and the BASW believes there may be another surge after the current restrictions across the UK are eased. \n\"It feels like we're kind of just cementing over the cracks but not actually getting to the foundation of what's going on. Every team meeting everyone is talking about the concerns they feel, the pressures of the workload,\" Ms Jackson said. \n\"I think there's that constant worry that, 'Am I missing something, is there something here that I'm not seeing, that something untoward is happening?' and, 'How can I actually do the meaningful work through a computer screen?' When I think about it, it just makes me feel stressed.\"\nBetween November and December last year the BASW conducted a survey to investigate the impact of the pandemic on the industry. \nMore than two thirds of the 1,119 BASW members from across the four nations who responded said they had seen an increase in referrals or in their case load since the return of schools in the autumn.\nAnd more than three quarters were concerned about their capacity to safeguard and protect adults and children as a result of lockdown restrictions. \nAnother social worker who works with children described a case where contact with a family was done via Zoom, always against the backdrop of their blank living room wall. \nOn one occasion the computer was accidentally knocked into a different position and the case worker saw a child sleeping on a mattress on the floor. \nUpon seeing this the social worker made an emergency house call and the home was revealed to have extensive damp, broken windows, barely any furniture and the floor that the child was sleeping on was covered in animal excrement. \n\"How many young children have we missed, awful cases that might come to light when this pandemic is over? Are these children just collateral damage?\" the social worker said.\n\"How do we even begin to repair the damage that is being done to these children while the rest of the country's head is turned? We were in absolute crisis in children's care before the pandemic, now it's complete meltdown.\"\nAnother said: \"I just feel like we need to think about those who have worked outside the NHS, but on the frontline during this pandemic. It's almost like social work is the forgotten profession of key workers.\"\nThe situation is the same across the devolved nations, according to Allison Hulmes, the national director of BASW Cymru, but there is a fear that things will continue to get worse before they improve.\n\"It's the tip of the iceberg at the moment, we're really fearful about what's lying underneath... there are so many children who wouldn't have been vulnerable prior to the pandemic but have become vulnerable as the pandemic has unfolded,\" she said.\n\"Our fear is that there will be an absolute tsunami of need which will translate into increased referral and increased demand on the profession. \n\"Short term we'd like to see a clear roadmap for return of schools across the devolved nations, we need to increase the number of social workers that we have, so that would mean an investment in professionals and some acknowledgment from Westminster and devolved governments that social workers are essential workers, that they've been doing an incredibly difficult job, and we want the blame game to stop.\"\nThe UK government and the devolved administrations of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales praised the \"fantastic job\" social workers had done in \"very challenging circumstances\" adding that they had provided extra funds for social care and taken steps to ease workloads.\nThe Scottish Government also said it was giving frontline workers - including social workers - a one-off pro-rata payment of \u00a3500 in recognition of their work in the pandemic.\nThe UK government said it had started a review of children's social care in England, while Northern Ireland's Department of Health said it was carrying out a social service workforce review to help meet \"current and anticipated demand\". \nThe Welsh Government also said it was working with local authorities to tackle any future impact from the pandemic."

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon,Transphobia,Transgender people,SNP (Scottish National Party)",
      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has said transphobia within the SNP is \"not acceptable\" amid reports that large numbers of party members are leaving over the issue. \nThe SNP leader said transphobia should be treated with zero tolerance in the same way as racism or homophobia.\nThe party has been embroiled in a deeply divisive debate about plans to make it easier for people to change their legally-recognised gender.\nSome senior SNP figures have openly criticised Ms Sturgeon over the move.\nThey are concerned about the potential that allowing people to self-identify their gender would have on women's rights in areas such as single-sex changing rooms, and women-only shortlists. \nBut the row, which has been particularly fierce on social media, has led to accusations that the criticisms from some people within the SNP have crossed the line into transphobia.\nFormer Out For Indy trans officer Teddy Hope told BBC Scotland earlier this month that they would be leaving the SNP because of its \"inaction\" over the behaviour of some party members at a branch meeting in Bearsden in March of last year. \nTeddy, who identifies as non-binary, claimed that there were \"transphobic views\" voiced at the meeting, including comparisons to \"predators and paedophiles\". \nIn a video message posted on Twitter, Ms Sturgeon said she had heard reports of \"mainly young people in significant numbers leaving the SNP\" because they do not consider the party to be a safe, tolerant place for trans people.\nThe first minister said it \"grieves her deeply\" that they had reached that conclusion.\nAnd she pledged to do \"everything I can to change that impression and persuade all of you that the SNP is your party and that you should come home where you belong.\"\nMs Sturgeon added: \"Trans people have as much right as any of us to be safe, secure and valued for who they are.\n\"Transphobia is wrong and we must treat it with the zero tolerance we treat racism or homophobia.\n\"Those are the principles I want to characterise the SNP and the country that I am privileged to lead.\"\nMs Sturgeon acknowledged that there were differences of opinion on gender recognition reform, but said the debate should not be used as \"cover for transphobia\".\nThe Scottish government wants to amend the Gender Recognition Act to remove some of the existing barriers to people being able to change their legal gender. \nIt would see the country move to a \"self-declaration model\", with applicants no longer needing to have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria - distress as a result of a difference between their biological sex and their gender identity - or prove that they have been living as their acquired gender for two years.\nThe government has also been considering lowering the age that a person can apply to change their legally-recognised gender from 18 to 16. \nBut the proposals sparked a backlash, with 15 senior SNP politicians - including three cabinet ministers - writing an open letter urging Ms Sturgeon not to rush into the changes.\nThe group included Kate Forbes, who is now the country's finance secretary, and MP Joanna Cherry - who has been particularly outspoken about her concerns on social media. \nIn their letter, they said that changing the definition of male and female was a \"matter of profound significance\".\nThe letter stressed that all of those who had signed it were \"committed to human rights, equality and dignity for all people\" and called for an end to \"knee-jerk accusations of transphobia\" against anyone who raises concerns.\nThe government announced last year that it had \"paused\" work on the gender recognition proposals due to the coronavirus pandemic, and said it wanted to build \"maximum consensus\" on the issue in the future.\nThere has also been controversy within the Scottish Greens over trans rights, with MSP Andy Wightman quitting the party in December after accusing it of having an \"alienating and provocative\" stance on the issue.\nMr Wightman said he had been threatened with possible expulsion over his concerns about the potential impact on women's rights, and claimed that the party was \"very censorious of any deviation from an agreed line\".\nThe Greens had strongly backed the proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act, with the party's co-leader, Patrick Harvie, claiming that transphobia has grown worse in Scotland because of Ms Sturgeon's failure to turn \"words into actions\".\nAnd he said the Scottish government had broken promises to the trans community over gender recognition reforms."

      "text": "The government is being urged to give GCSE and A-level students more information about this year's exams as soon as possible. \nHead teachers say it would help pupils deal with the disruption caused by the recent Omicron surge.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh governments have confirmed that face coverings will remain compulsory in high schools. \nAll UK schools must offer face-to-face teaching to every age group, and provide effective online learning for pupils who are absent or isolating.\nThe specific Covid measures in place vary across the nations. \nAll school staff and secondary school pupils are asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week (three in Wales).\nIn England, secondary school pupils no longer need to wear masks in the classroom, and won't be required to wear them in communal areas from 27 January.\nA teachers union has urged the government to give GCSE and A-level students information about this year's exams ahead of the planned update on 7 February. Pupils will be offered a choice of topics in some subjects, but don't yet have the final details. \nIn Wales, some schools have reintroduced year-group bubbles, and have staggered start and finish times. Face coverings will remain compulsory in classrooms and communal areas until the end of the February half term, when schools will be expected to revert to their normal timetable. Rules will be reviewed on 10 February. \nIn Northern Ireland, schools reopened with the same measures as last term. New guidance says all primary and post-primary pupils in a class where there are multiple Covid cases should take an LFT. The overall guidance to schools will be reviewed in mid-February.\nIn Scotland, social distancing remains in place, pupils are separated into groups where possible. Pupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the 1m (3ft) social distancing rule still applies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the guidance for schools was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nThe latest data for England shows that 415,000 pupils (5.1%) were absent for Covid-related reasons on 20 Jan, up from 3.9% on 6 January.\nOver the same period, 4.5% of teachers and leaders were off because of Covid, although a quarter of schools had absence rates above 15%.\nIn addition, 4.7% of teaching assistants and other staff were off for Covid-related reasons. \nThe latest data in Northern Ireland shows that on 24 January, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covid - the highest rates since the new term began.\nIn Scotland on 21 January, 30,238 students (4.4%) were missing from school due to Covid-related reasons. \nMany schools have told the BBC they can't find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. A number of supply teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.\nEngland's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says the government is considering options to deal with staff shortages. \nHe previously urged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response.\nMr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes in the event of teacher shortages. \nBut teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children.\nYes - as long as they don't have any of the main Covid symptoms, under-18s don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. \nSimilarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. \nHowever, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advised to take LFTs for at least seven days. \nAll primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland should take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. \nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the second jab typically given 12 weeks after the first.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has also recommended that booster doses should be offered to children aged:\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has also been approved for five to 11-year-olds who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from Covid. \nThe JCVI also recommends that primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, but it's not yet clear when they might get the doses.\nChildren who aren't considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after testing positive for Covid before being vaccinated.\nVentilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid. \nIn England, the government is making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. \nLabour says this isn't enough, but the Department for Education says the units are only required in areas where doors and windows cannot be opened effectively.\nSome 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors had already been promised for England's schools to help identify areas with poor ventilation, but teaching unions complained this won't solve the problem. \nThe Scottish government gave \u00a3100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.\nThe Welsh government has a \u00a36m programme to increase air circulation and purity which will provide 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines."

      "tags": "Medical research,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,University of Oxford,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts.\nThe UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that \"adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine\".\nData from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now.\nThe risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. \nBased on the current data, the following is advised:\nThe MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIt found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April.\nThe MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate.\nAnd the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. \nIts head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was \"firming up\", more evidence would be needed. \nThe benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more \"finely balanced\".\nThe MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nPlatelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding.\nAmong these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT).\nCVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. \nAs a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke.  \nThe clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. \nThe MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice:\nCovid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA.\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clotting should be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect.\nAfter a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link.\nNevertheless, Denmark has stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - and Germany, Spain, Italy and Ireland have suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. \nFrance is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, while Australia says people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead.\nIt is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness.\nOnce injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus.\nExperts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. \nThe government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is \"plenty of evidence\" the vaccines appear to be effective against the Kent variant which is dominant in the UK.\nThere is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. \nHowever a study of around 2,000 people suggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease."

      "tags": "Department for Work & Pensions,Nottingham",
      "text": "Authorities who dealt with a benefits claim from a single mother, who took a fatal overdose after her payments were cut, made 28 errors in managing her case, a coroner has found.\nPhilippa Day, 27, was found collapsed at her Nottingham home beside a letter rejecting her request for an at-home benefits assessment in August 2019.\nShe died after two months in a coma.\nNottingham Coroner's Court heard the way her claim was dealt with was the \"predominant factor\" in her overdose.\nRecording a narrative conclusion, coroner Gordon Clow said he could not determine whether she intended to die rather than put her life at risk.\nMiss Day, who had been diagnosed with unstable personality disorder, had been receiving disabled living allowance (DLA) payments as she had type 1 diabetes. \nThose payments stopped in January 2019 after she made an application for a personal independence payment (PIP), reducing her income from \u00a3228 a week to \u00a360. \nThis, the inquest heard, was because a form she had sent went missing and her payments were not reinstated for months, despite her eligibility. \nThis led to her taking out short-term loans and ending up in debt.\nThe court heard in June, she called the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to say she was \"starving\" and \"couldn't survive like this for much longer\".\nShe was then asked to attend a face-to-face assessment despite it being \"distressing\" for her, Mr Clow said. \nThe coroner added Miss Day's mental health problems were \"exacerbated\" by the benefits process.\nHe accepted it had been \"the last straw\" for Miss Day who was already experiencing a range of stressors. \nHe said: \"Were it not for this problem, it is not likely that she would have [overdosed] on the 7th or 8th of August.\"\nCall handlers repeatedly failed to flag that the case required \"additional support\" due to her mental health problems, the coroner said.\nThe DWP did not tell her community psychiatric nurse that she had not returned the form before refusing her application, which could have resolved the issue.\nThe coroner said call handlers received little to no training on personality disorders like Miss Day's - all that was available was a factsheet.\nCapita was made aware of the risks to Miss Day's health from a face-to-face interview by her community psychiatric nurse, but did not act on it, he added.\nMr Clow said: \"Given the sheer number of problems in the handling of her claim, I am unable to conclude that each of these was attributable to individual human error.\"\nHe concluded the failure to administer her benefit claim in a way that avoided exacerbating her mental health problems was the \"predominant factor\" that caused Miss Day to overdose.\nMr Clow recommended changes at both the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and Capita, the authorities involved.\nIn a prevention of future deaths report, Mr Clow said the DWP should consider timely mental health training for call handlers and address \"poor record keeping\".\nThe DWP and Capita were also directed to review the change of assessment process so that it does not \"create unnecessary distress\". \nA spokesman for the DWP said: \"This is a deeply tragic case. Our sincere condolences are with Miss Day's family and we will carefully consider the coroner's findings.\"\nA Capita spokesman said the company also apologised for the mistakes made.\n\"We have strengthened our processes over the last 18 months and are committed to continuously working to deliver a high-quality, empathetic service for every claimant,\" he said. \n\"In partnership with the DWP, we will act upon the coroner's findings and make further improvements to our processes.\"   \nThis conclusion amounts to a near dismantling of the process for applying for the main disability benefit for people with psychiatric problems.\nWhile around 40% of claimants for personal independence payments have mental health conditions, the inquest found that call handlers for the DWP didn't receive adequate mental health training.  \nThe coroner found there was an \"institutional assumption\" in the DWP that problems with a claim were the claimants' fault.  \nLast year a report from the National Audit Office (NAO) found the department had investigated 69 suicides of benefit claimants since 2014-15.  \nThere were more cases they could have looked into, said the NAO, but in any case the department couldn't demonstrate any improvements from their investigations had actually been implemented.  \nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Stock markets,Reddit,GameStop",
      "text": "Amateur investors are responding with outrage after trading platforms curbed buying of shares in the US games firm GameStop and other companies.\nThe moves by Robinhood and Interactive Brokers follow days of frenzied trading that led to massive gains for some stocks. \nShares in GameStop dived by as much as 55% after the restrictions.\nIt is the latest twist in a battle that has pitted amateur investors against Wall Street giants.\nMajor hedge funds had bet billions of dollars that GameStop's shares would fall. \nBut they have faced major losses after amateurs, swapping tips on social media sites such as Reddit, drove up the share price by more than 700% in a week.\nOther firms, such as AMC Entertainment, Koss Corp and BlackBerry, also saw sharp gains. They were embraced by day traders after hedge funds bet against them.\nThe activity has drawn questions from regulators, who are monitoring trading amid fears of illegal actions.\nHowever, the amateur investors say they are just playing Wall Street at its own game.\nIn online forums they discussed legal action and accused Robinhood and other brokerages enacting their own form of market manipulation by restricting purchases of certain shares.\nRobinhood co-founder Vladimir Tenev tweeted that the firm had taken its decision based on regulatory requirements, and said limited buys of the restricted stocks would be allowed from Friday.\n\"They support a capitalist free market only when it works for them. What we saw today was not a free market and it forced an awful lot of people to lose an awful lot of money,\" said 18-year-old Myron Sakkas of Coventry, a student at Warwick University.\nMyron, who has had an account on the Trading 212 platform since August last year, said he had lost \u00a330 on Gamestop shares, which he owned for \"a couple of hours\" and sold when he saw what was happening.\nMyron said he had since been locked out of his account and unable to use it while his identity is being checked. But when he gains access again, he plans to take out the \u00a31,000 he has in it and call a halt.\nThough hoping to go into investment banking after he gets his degree, he said he was disillusioned by what he sees as \"market manipulation\" directed against people like him. \n\"When ordinary people try to make money in a system where only rich traders can make money, that's what happens,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Maybe I won't trade for a while, to be honest,\" he added. \"I've got other stuff to do.\"\nKey to what's going on is \"short selling\" or \"shorting\", where a big investment company such as a hedge fund tries to make money by betting that a company's share price will fall.\nThe hedge fund borrows shares in a company from other investors (for a fee) and sells the shares on the markets at, for example, $10 each, waits until they fall to $5, and buys them back. The borrowed shares are returned to the original owner, and the hedge fund pockets a profit.\nGameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as \"failing\" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street.\nBut in the last week, amateur investors who follow the Wall Street Bets forum on Reddit have poured money into buying the company's stock with the aim of pushing up the price. \nIf the price rises dramatically, short sellers face big losses and they need to buy back the shares they have borrowed quickly to prevent bigger losses  - a process known as covering.\nHowever, buying back the shares only adds to demand for the stock and pushes its price higher still.\nAnd amateurs aren't the only ones getting in on the action.\nThis week, for example, private equity firm Silver Lake Group, which had loaned money to AMC Entertainment, converted its bonds to shares after the surge in the firm's prices, a swap worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\nIn the US, anger over the trading restrictions united politicians whose stances typically sharply diverge.\nSenator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is taking over as chair of the banking committee, said he would hold a hearing about the \"state of the stock market\".\n\"People on Wall Street only care about the rules when they're the ones getting hurt,\" he said.\nRep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, known for her leftist views, called the restrictions \"unacceptable\" and expressed support for a hearing, to which Sen Ted Cruz, a staunch Republican, replied on Twitter, \"Fully agree\".\nDave Portnoy, founder of the Barstool Sports blog, who has emerged as one of the most high-profile amateur traders during the pandemic, also attacked the restrictions, singling out Robinhood, which has cast itself as a platform aimed at making Wall Street more accessible.\nThe firm also makes money through fees paid by Wall Street firms that execute trades for its users.\n\"'Democratizing finance for all' except when we manipulate the market, cause too many ordinary people are getting rich,\" he wrote.\nAnalyst Neil Wilson said that Reddit chat threads, suggest the day traders' battle with Wall Street is personal. \n\"Among the many aspects of this story that are strange, what is so unusual is the peculiar vigilante morality of the traders pumping the stock. They seem hell-bent on taking on Wall Street, they seem to hate hedge funds and threads are peppered with insults about 'boomer' money. \n\"It's a generational fight, redistributive and all about robbing the rich to give to the millennial 'poor'.\"\nElon Musk, who has a history of feuding with short sellers, also joined the fight, tweeting: \"Here come the shorty apologists. Give them no respect. Get Shorty.\"\nA one-word tweet by the billionaire entrepreneur on Tuesday - he tweeted \"Gamestonk!!\" - had been seen as giving Gamestop shares an extra boost.\nThe fracas follows a jump in casual investing during the pandemic, which saw people stuck at home with time on their hands and limited places to spend pour money into the market.\nThe surge has produced ripples of worry on Wall Street, including concerns that inexperienced investors could cause bubbles in certain stocks or were dabbling in investments with risks they did not fully understand.\nRobinhood - which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new interest in investing - has faced particular scrutiny for the way its app has made investment seem like a game. \nLast year, Massachusetts regulators filed a complaint accusing the company of marketing to inexperienced users and failing to protect them.\nOfficials said this week they were following the market battle.\nPress secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday President Joe Biden\u2019s economic team, including newly-appointed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, was \u201cmonitoring the situation\u201d.\nMassachusetts state regulator William Galvin called on the New York Stock Exchange to suspend GameStop for 30 days to allow a cooling-off period. \"This isn't investing, this is gambling,\" he said in an interview. \"This is obviously contrived.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon,Travel,Neale Hanvey,Boris Johnson,Scottish independence,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has insisted that Scotland's independence debate is \"irrelevant\" to most people as he urged the country to unite against Covid. \nThe PM was speaking during a trip to Scotland to emphasise the strength of the UK working together during the pandemic.\nThe SNP said he was panicking as opinion polls show declining support for the union.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon also questioned if his trip is essential.\nThe PM started his day-long visit by going to the Lighthouse Laboratory - which processes Covid tests - at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus in Glasgow.\nHe later visited troops who are setting up a vaccination centre in the Castlemilk area of the city, and toured the Valneva vaccine factory in Livingston.\nThe factory is expected to deliver 60 million doses to the UK by the end of the year if its vaccine is approved.\nMr  Johnson used the visit to argue that the priority should be \"fighting this pandemic and coming back more strongly together\" rather than arguing about the constitution.\nAnd he praised the \"amazing performance\" of Scottish people in the \"national effort\" to fight the pandemic. \nThe prime minister said: \"I think endless talk about a referendum without any clear description of what the constitutional situation would be after that referendum is completely irrelevant now to the concerns of most people\".\nMr Johnson also criticised the SNP's record in government, and added: \"We don't actually know what the referendum would set out to achieve.\n\"We don't know what the point of it would be - what happens to the army, what happens to the Crown, what happens to the pound, what happens to the Foreign Office. Nobody will tell us what it's all meant to be about.\"\nHe told reporters that \"the very same people\" who wanted independence \"also said only a few years ago, in 2014, that this was a once-in-a-generation event\".\n\"I'm inclined to stick with what they said last time,\" Mr Johnson said.\nUnder the current Covid regulations, people are only able to travel between Scotland and England for essential reasons, with similar regulations also in place to stop travel across council boundaries within Scotland.\nAsked at her daily coronavirus briefing on Wednesday how she felt about the prime minister's visit while the strict travel restrictions were in place, Ms Sturgeon replied she was \"not ecstatic\" about it.\nShe argued that leaders should abide by the same rules they impose on the general public, adding that she had herself rejected a suggested visit to a vaccine centre in Aberdeen for this reason.\nDowning Street has insisted it is important for the prime minister to be \"visible and accessible\" across the whole of the UK during the pandemic.\nIn response to Ms Sturgeon's criticism, the prime minister's official spokesman said: \"These are Covid-related visits. You've seen the prime minister do a number of them over the past few weeks.\n\"It is obviously important that he is continuing to meet and see those who are on the front line in terms of those who are providing tests, in terms of those who are working so hard to deliver the vaccination plan.\" \nMr Johnson's visit to Scotland is widely seen as being part of a \"charm offensive\" in response to polls indicating a rise in support for independence. \nHowever, polls have also suggested that the independence question is currently a lower priority for many people than other issues such as the pandemic, health and education. \nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said it was \"only right\" the prime minister visited people on the front line of the vaccine roll-out to make sure it is operating effectively.\nHe told BBC Breakfast Mr Johnson has visited other crucial locations in the UK's pandemic response, such as the Wrexham plant making the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, adding: \"No one thinks that's illegitimate.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer also said he backed the visit. \"I'm with the prime minister on this one,\" he told LBC Radio.\n\"He is the prime minister of the UK. It's important that he travels to see what is going on, on the ground.\"\nIt comes as the Scottish government sets out its budget, described as the \"most important in the history of devolution\" in the wake of huge spending increases to support people and businesses during the pandemic.\nBoris Johnson had a clear purpose on his visit to Scotland - to talk up what he calls the power of cooperation across the UK. \nDressed in white lab coat and protective gear, he was happy to tell me how the UK government is supporting the fight against coronavirus in Scotland.\nThat includes spending lots of money supporting jobs and businesses, building test centres, and procuring vaccine supplies from companies like the one he was visiting in Livingston. \nBut here's the paradox.\nNo matter what the prime minister does, or that the UK and Scottish governments are following broadly similar Covid strategies - the public in Scotland perceives that Nicola Sturgeon and her team are handling the pandemic response better. \nThis visit was controversial because it happened during lockdown but it went ahead because the UK government recognises how much work it has to do to make the case for the union in Scotland, with Scottish elections due in May when the question of indyref2 will be to the fore. \nOn Sunday, the SNP revealed an 11-point \"roadmap to a referendum\" on Scottish independence, which sets out how the party intends to take forward its plan for another vote on the issue. \nIt says a \"legal referendum\" will be held after the pandemic if there is a pro-independence majority at Holyrood following May's election.\nAnd it says it will \"vigorously oppose\" any legal challenge from the UK government.\nMr Johnson has repeatedly stated his opposition to a referendum, and has suggested that another one should not be held for 40 years. \nOpposition parties in Scotland have also accused Ms Sturgeon and the SNP of putting the push for independence ahead of the Covid pandemic.\nBut SNP deputy leader Keith Brown said the prime minister's trip was evidence that he is in a \"panic\" about the prospect of another referendum."

The Kremlin denies involvement. \nAn associate of Mr Navalny's has released a list of eight individuals drawn up by the opposition leader whom he says should face sanctions in order to put pressure on President Putin. \nMr Abramovich, who bought Chelsea in 2003, and former Arsenal shareholder Mr Usmanov, who owns a company that sponsors Everton, and who has links with the club's majority shareholder, were both included. \nThey were described in the list as being among \"key enablers and beneficiaries of Russian kleptocracy, with significant ties/assets in the West\".\nDuring an emergency debate in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge said: \"The best way we can show our support for Alexei Navalny is not by words but by actions.\"\n\"Navalny himself has said he wants the international community to use sanctions against complicit Russian kleptocrats who live outside Russia.\n\"He has named Abramovich and Usmanov, both of whom have significant wealth, property and links to English football clubs. \n\"But on Facebook Navalny has said that the sanctions haven't worked, because the West has refrained from sanctioning the people with the money.\"\nAsked to comment, a spokesman for Mr Abramovich said there was \"no foundation\" to Mr Navalny's claims.\nForeign Office Minister Wendy Morton said: \"We continue to work and protect human rights and civil society in Russia. We are considering all options for further action... it would be inappropriate for me to speculate on any future listings.\"\nThe Liberal Democrats have urged the government to consider sanctions. \nLayla Moran, the party's foreign affairs spokesperson, said: \"Navalny's team have released a list of names drawn up by Navalny just days before his return and arrest, which included Abramovich and Usmanov.\"\n\"Both individuals were described as key enablers with significant ties and assets in the West.\"\nRepresentatives for Mr Usmanov declined to comment. \nBoth men have always insisted their businesses are legitimate.

      "text": "Councils are being warned to ensure free nursery places are genuinely free after a large chain was found to wrongly charge parents top-up fees.\nThe local government watchdog found the Kiddi Caru nursery chain had broken the rules on government-funded places. \nSome two- and all three- and four-year-olds are entitled to fully funded early years places, but nurseries have long argued funding levels are too low.\nLocal government ombudsman Michael King said: \"Free must mean free.\"\n\"While I acknowledge local authorities - and the early years sector - are struggling financially, the government's intentions have always been that these places are provided free of charge to parents, and it is up to local authorities to administer them accordingly,\" he said.\n\"We are concerned that local authorities may not be delivering on the government's pledge to parents.\"\nHis comments come after he upheld the complaint of a father from Leicestershire who was charged top-up fees by Kiddi Caru nursery in Market Harborough for his daughter.\nDamian Roache was charged an extra \u00a31.08 per hour on top of the council grant of \u00a33.50 for care for his daughter.\nThis prompted the finding that they did not receive their entitlement free of charge. This amounted to nearly \u00a31,000 in extra fees.\nThe ruling said the county council had audited the nursery and considered the complaint but failed to identify the problems with the nursery's invoices or charges. \nAs a result, the \"council has failed to comply with government guidance. This is fault,\" it said.\nMr Roache first raised the issue with the nursery in March 2019, to be told the charging policy was correct.\nLeicestershire County Council turned down two complaints from the Roache family before finally accepting the Ombudsman's ruling.\nMr Roache told the BBC: \"Everyone was telling me I was wrong, but I knew I was right.  The government guidelines were very clear.\n\"I am sympathetic with the fact that educational establishments are underfunded by the government, but they need to take their fight to the government, don't have your fight with me. \n\"It doesn't give them the right to overcharge me.\"\nIn his report, Mr King told the council to make sure the complainant, and any other families who were wrongly charged top-fees by the nursery, be reimbursed.  A clear statement dating back to 2018 should set out what was overpaid.\nCouncillor Deborah Taylor, Leicestershire County Council cabinet member for children and families, said, they had reviewed the charging arrangements for the nursery involved and found they were \"unnecessarily complex.\"\n\"Due to the variable hourly charge, it was hard for the concerned parents to understand precisely what they were being charged for each hour of private nursery care.  Improvements have since been made at this nursery.\"\nMr King urged all other councils across England to check that the early years providers in their areas offering places through the Free Early Years Entitlement were \"not making the same errors.\"\nThe Childcare Act 2006 places a duty on councils to secure early years provision free of charge for local families, so it is down to local authorities to ensure schemes are within the law.\nProviders can charge for meals and snacks, and consumables such as nappies or sun cream, as part of a free entitlement place, but these charges must be voluntary. \nA spokesman for Kiddi Caru, which runs nurseries in central and southern England, said it had taken over the nursery in question in 2017, changed the way it offered free education entitlement and improved invoicing.\n\"We will continue to work with local authorities, including Leicestershire County Council, as they monitor early years' providers around the delivery of the free early education entitlement to families.\"\nNeil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said: \"Parents rightly do not expect to pay for something they have been told is free.\n\"But equally, it cannot be right that nurseries, pre-schools and childminders are expected to deliver these places at an often substantial loss, simply because government refuses to fund its flagship childcare policy adequately.\"\nPurnima Tanuku of the National Day Nurseries Association said it always advised providers to be very clear with parents about any additional costs. \nBut she added that the rates nurseries receive through the government grant were inadequate. \nShe added: \"The places aren't 'free' because the hourly rate provided by government does not cover the full cost of the delivery. In the end it is parents and providers who pay the price of chronic underfunding to the sector.\""

      "text": "The prime minister has responded to calls that were getting louder for clarity about what might happen next and when.\nHe pencilled in a date for the country's diary. But 8 March is the hoped-for beginning of the end of lockdown - far from a guarantee. \nPolitical demands for more information from his backbench MPs and the opposition were part of the reason for his announcement. But there was also the relentless march of the clock.\nThe government had promised it would give schools in England two weeks' notice of whether they would be able to open after half-term.\nWith Boris Johnson not expected in Westminster on Thursday, Wednesday was the last viable moment to keep that vow. \nWith cases still so high, and hospitals still so full, in theory the announcement wasn't that much of a surprise. \nNorthern Ireland is already in lockdown until 5 March, but will confirm its position on schools on Thursday.\nWales and Scotland are reviewing whether to extend closures beyond the middle of February in the next couple of days. Without dramatic falls in case numbers, they seem likely to be in step soon too. \nIn practice, though, Mr Johnson's announcement still felt like a big admission: that we're heading for 12 months of limits - starting last March - on our lives in one way or another.\nFirms and families around the UK will have had to cope with moving in and out of lockdown for a whole year. \nLike Tuesday's terrible 100,000-deaths mark, it's a milestone that at the beginning of all of this simply wouldn't have been imagined.\nBut as time as worn on, the pattern has become familiar: push the dates back, confront the worst rather than hope for the best.\nThe prime minister altered, maybe, too. You could hear it in his tone when asked what the chances of sticking to his date were. \"That's the earliest,\" he warned, suggesting that a long list of things have to go right. \nOne cabinet minister described the government's position: \"The decision making has been more and more cautious as they've been caught out so many times.\"\nNo one perhaps would be more delighted than Mr Johnson if the pace of the disease slows dramatically and the promise of the vaccine comes good very soon.\nBut at this time, with a buffer of several weeks to keep looking at the information, that's not a commitment that ministers are willing to make.

Sixty-seven of them are intensive care and 57 patients are receiving ventilation.\nMrs Foster said Northern Ireland's R-number - or rate of infection of the virus - was continuing to fall, with the rate in the community currently sitting between 0.65 and 0.8.\nBut she warned that the number of Covid patients in intensive care units has doubled in the past month, reaching its highest-ever level this week.\nMs O'Neill said she was \"encouraged\" by the progress made in the vaccination programme, with 175,284 people in Northern Ireland now having received their first dose.\nThe online booking system for the 65-69 age group opened last night and vaccinations for those people will be available at regional centres.\nOn Thursday, the executive also discussed a proposal that staff in special schools should be prioritised for vaccination - but ministers have requested further work between officials take place on the issue.\nIf it is not possible for all pupils to return on 8 March, priority will be given to pupils in exam years, BBC News NI understands.\nThat would include pupils taking GCSEs, AS and A-level and BTecs - but it is not clear if it would also include Primary Six pupils who may want to sit the transfer test in the autumn.\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said schools in England would not be able to reopen to all pupils after the February half-term, but could do so from 8 March.\nOn Thursday, another 47 Covid-19-related deaths were recorded in the Republic of Ireland, taking its total to 3,167.\nThe Irish health department also recorded another 1,466 confirmed cases of the virus."

      "text": "US climate envoy John Kerry has told the BBC a UN climate summit in the UK this November is \"the last best chance\" to avert the worst environmental consequences for the world.\nHe said years were lost on the climate issue under President Donald Trump, \"who didn't believe in any of it\".\nDozens of world leaders will attend the COP26 conference in Glasgow.\nMr Kerry spoke as President Joe Biden signed a flurry of executive orders designed to address climate change.\nHis latest edicts include a freeze on new oil and gas leases on public lands and set out to double offshore wind-produced energy by 2030.\nMr Biden - who re-entered the US into the 2016 Paris climate accord in one of his first acts as president - said America must lead the response to the crisis.\nThe newly appointed US climate tsar said: \"Glasgow will be extremely important. \n\"In fact, I would say that in my judgment, it is the last best chance the world has to come together in order to do the things we need to do to avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis. \n\"Three years ago, we were told we have 12 years to avoid those consequences. Three of those years were lost because we had Donald Trump, who didn't believe in any of it. And now we have nine years left to try to do what science is telling us we need to do.\"\nBut at a White House news conference on Wednesday, Mr Kerry acknowledged the crisis would not be fixed even if the US reduced its emissions to zero.\nHe said: \"He [Mr Biden] knows Paris alone is not enough. Not when almost 90% of all of the planet's global emissions come from outside of US borders.\n\"We could go to zero tomorrow and the problem isn't solved.\"\nDuring his four years in office, Mr Trump rolled back environmental regulations as he sought to maximise the nation's fossil fuel production.\nThe Republican president also claimed credit for the US achieving a level of energy independence, becoming a net petroleum exporter, midway through his term.\nMr Trump - who once called climate change a hoax - withdrew the US from the Paris pact, arguing that it unfairly left the world's other two top polluters - India and China - free to use fossil fuels.\nNearly 200 countries signed up to the accord, which aims to keep the global temperature rise this century well below 2C above pre-industrial levels.\nBy making John Kerry his Climate Envoy, Joe Biden isn't just appointing one of America's most experienced and senior politicians, he is also getting a man who is very deeply invested in making the process of international climate diplomacy work.\nJohn Kerry was President Obama's Secretary of State and was instrumental in negotiating the landmark Paris climate agreement, the first time virtually all the nations of the world agreed they needed to act to tackle climate change.\nNo surprise then that he sees the Glasgow COP26 conference in November as the crucial forum for the world to come together to avoid really damaging climate change.\nHis tone is emollient, however. He knows the US's virtual absence from climate talks during the Trump administration means he has to approach other world leaders with a sense of humility.\nAmerica hasn't yet earned the moral authority to demand other nations take action.\nIt is clear, however, that this veteran and wily political operator has every intention of using his formidable negotiating skills to try to ensure the world makes the most ambitious deal possible in Glasgow in November.\u00a0\nThe new US president indicated he would not wait until November's summit in Scotland to engage in multilateral talks on the climate issue. \nThe series of executive orders that Mr Biden signed on Wednesday announced a US summit of leaders to be held in April on Earth Day.\n\"Just like we need a unified national response to Covid-19, we desperately need a unified national response to the climate crisis because there is a climate crisis,\" he said, establishing a White House office of domestic climate policy.\nMr Biden directed the Department of the Interior to pause oil and gas drilling leases on federal lands and water and to launch a review of existing energy leases.\nMr Biden aims to conserve at least 30% of federal lands and oceans by 2030.\nThe new president - whose fellow Democrats control Congress - has signed over three dozen executive orders in his first week in office, more than any of his predecessors.\nCritics note he told ABC News while campaigning last October that only a \"dictator\" would use executive orders excessively. \"We're a democracy,\" said Mr Biden. \"We need consensus.\"\nMr Biden endured a storm of criticism for last week's executive order halting construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, that would have transported oil from Canada through the US.\nHis White House is trying to get ahead of more criticism by addressing job creation. \nMr Biden argued that \"millions\" of Americans would be able to find employment \"modernising our water systems, transportation, our energy infrastructure - to withstand the impacts of extreme climate\".

      "text": "The prime minister and Public Health England have both defended the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, after Germany recommended that it should only be given to people aged under 65.\nDr Mary Ramsay of PHE said the jab offers \"high levels of protection\" against Covid-19, particularly against severe illness.\nBoris Johnson said he was not concerned by Germany's recommendation.\nAstraZeneca said the jab's trial data supported efficacy in the over-65s.\nGermany's vaccine committee said the AstraZeneca vaccine should only be given to people aged under 65, citing a lack of sufficient data to recommend use among older age groups. \nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) is to decide on Friday whether to approve the vaccine for use across the EU.\nBut Dr Ramsay, head of immunisations at Public Health England, said: \"Both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are safe and provide high levels of protection against Covid-19, particularly against severe disease. \n\"There were too few cases in older people in the AstraZeneca trials to observe precise levels of protection in this group, but data on immune responses were very reassuring.\"\nMr Johnson said he was not concerned by Germany's recommendation, adding that the UK's watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), had \"made it very clear\" that the AstraZeneca vaccine is \"very good and efficacious\" and gives a \"high degree of protection after just one dose, and even more after two doses\".\nSpeaking during a visit to Scotland, the prime minister added: \"The evidence that they've supplied is that they think it is effective across all age groups [and] provides a good immune response across all age groups, so I don't agree with that [Germany's recommendation].\"\nAn AstraZeneca spokesperson said the latest analyses of clinical trial data for its vaccine \"support efficacy in the over 65 years age group\", adding that the firm was awaiting \"a regulatory decision on the vaccine by the EMA in the coming days\".\nAll of the regulators and experts in different countries have been looking at the same data on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nThat data comes from clinical trials, and those did recruit fewer elderly people overall. \nThat's because they started off first with younger volunteers to get results as quickly as possible, given the urgency to find out if a vaccine would work well enough to help get us out of the pandemic.\nThe scientists who ran the trials have always been upfront about this. \nBut they say there is other evidence to suggest the vaccine will work well in older adults. \nStudies show the over-65s have a strong immune responses to the vaccine. After receiving the shots their blood has plenty of the required antibodies that can fight coronavirus.\nThe UK has been using the AstraZeneca vaccine in its mass immunisation programme for weeks now and should soon have more proof from the real world setting about how much protection the shots give.  \nProf Paul Hunter, of the University of East Anglia, told BBC News that the elderly should not worry about receiving the jab.\nHe said: \"I'm almost 65 myself and I would happily take any of the vaccines, including the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. We do know that it is safe in people over 65. \n\"They have much fewer side effects than younger people and it almost certainly provides substantial benefits in terms of preventing severe disease and reducing the chances of going into hospital.\"\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC's Radio 4's PM programme that Germany's recommendation \"just reflects different levels of caution\", adding: \"What they are basically doing is saying 'We'd like to wait a big longer and know a bit more before we move.\"\nProf Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said: \"We have no concerns about the safety of the vaccine in any age group\".\nDr Doug Brown, chief executive of the British Society for Immunology, said the MHRA would have \"carefully scrutinised the evidence\" on the AstraZeneca jab before making their recommendation, and referred to its original report which stated that there is \"there is limited information available on efficacy in participants aged 65 or over, although there is nothing to suggest lack of protection\".\nHe said this reflected a \"need for more data\" on the effectiveness of the jab in this age group, but noted the jab had shown a \"good safety profile\" in all published reports.\nProf Jim Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford, said German scientists had \"not said the vaccine is ineffective for over-65s\".\nHe added: \"Scientists often disagree about how much evidence is needed for any new advance and there is always more data to be secured.\n\"Normally this all happens out of sight of the glare of the media and not in a pandemic, but such debates are an important part of the scientific process that is familiar to anyone who has ever been through peer review.\" \nMeanwhile, the EU and AstraZeneca are involved in a row over vaccine supply shortages. \nAstraZeneca has previously said it could deliver only a fraction of the doses between January and March that it had promised to the bloc, blaming production issues at EU plants for a reported 50 million-dose shortfall.\nThe EU has demanded that UK-made jabs are diverted to mainland Europe to fulfil contractual obligations.\nHowever, both sides pledged to work together to resolve the crisis.\nBut Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said there would \"be no interruption\" to UK vaccine supplies.\nIt comes as the UK recorded a further 1,239 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test on Thursday, according to government figures.

      "text": "A World Health Organization (WHO) team has come out of quarantine and will start on-the-ground investigations into the origins of the coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan. \nThe scientists will begin interviewing people from research institutes, hospitals and the seafood market linked to the initial outbreak.\nTheir research will rely upon evidence provided by Chinese officials.\nThis comes after months of negotiations between the WHO and Beijing.\nSome relatives of Covid-19 victims in China are hoping to meet with the investigators.  Zhang Hai, a Wuhan native whose father died in February, told the BBC he hopes speaking to the WHO can \"aid their investigation\". \nThe group of 13 experts arrived in Wuhan on 14 January, and spent two weeks in quarantine that ended on Thursday. While in isolation, the team had been in video calls with each other and Chinese scientists. \nOn Thursday afternoon they exited their hotel and boarded a bus without speaking to journalists. Earlier in the day members of the team tweeted about the end of their quarantine, including pictures of themselves receiving letters certifying they had completed medical isolation.\n\"New phase, new priorities,\" tweeted Dutch virologist Marion Koopmans.\nThea Fischer, a Danish member of the investigation team, told Reuters news agency that going outside after quarantining \"is just as if one has landed from the moon\". \n\"I lived opposite two of the others in the team, so it was my hope that every time they knocked on the door, that the other two also went out and had their temperature measured, so you could at least exchange a few words and see a human being,\" she said on Thursday. \nThe WHO had said its investigators were denied entry into China after one member of the team was turned back and another got stuck in transit. Beijing later said it was a misunderstanding.\nCovid-19 was first detected in Wuhan in late 2019, but China has been saying for months that it is not necessarily the place where the virus originated from.\nState media have recently suggested the pandemic might have begun outside of China - Spain, Italy or even the US - and have also carried claims that the virus has been entering the country through frozen food imports, though experts have cast doubt on this.\nOn Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki raised concern about \"misinformation\" from \"some sources in China\" and said it was \"imperative we get to the bottom\" of where the virus originated and how it was able to spread worldwide. \nHer comments sparked outrage in China with Zhao Lijian, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, calling on the US to \"respect facts and science, respect the hard work\" of the WHO experts. \nIn an earlier interview with the BBC, Professor Dale Fisher, chair of the global outbreak and response unit at the WHO, said he hoped the world would consider the investigation in Wuhan a scientific visit. \"It's not about politics or blame but getting to the bottom of a scientific question,\" he said.\nProf Fisher added that most scientists believed that the virus was a \"natural event\".\nIt was initially believed the virus originated in a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat. It was suggested that this was where the virus made the leap from animals to humans.\nMeanwhile a year on since the outbreak began in Wuhan several families of Covid-19 victims are still looking for answers.\n\"I think it's necessary that the experts meet me and other people who have lost family members to the virus, and hear from our experiences,\" said Mr Zhang. \n\"I hope the WHO will not be used as a tool to spread lies,\" the 51-year-old told the BBC.\nMr Zhang said he believes delayed reporting about the virus by Wuhan city officials in the initial days of the outbreak had cost his father his life. \nHis family had travelled to the city in January last year from the city of Shenzhen, where they currently live, so that Mr Zhang's father could receive subsidised surgery for a leg fracture. \nThe surgery was successful, but Mr Zhang's father then contracted Covid-19 and subsequently died.\n\"If it was made known that there was a virus outbreak in the city, we wouldn't have gone there,\" he said. \n\"By covering up that fact at the time, many lives were lost, so the Wuhan government has knowingly committed murder. They need to be held accountable for that.\nUntil I get an official apology from the local authorities over what happened to my father, I will not give up.\"\nLocal government officials in Wuhan and its surrounding Hubei province have been accused of downplaying the virus in the early days of the pandemic, and several were fired last year.\nMr Zhang claimed Chinese authorities have blocked his online calls for accountability as well as efforts to organise other families of Covid victims.\nHe said a WeChat group formed by the families that had at least 80 members was deleted recently without explanation. Six separate accounts which Mr Zhang had set up on microblogging platform Weibo to share his story have also been blocked. \"Every time I write something, it'll just get blocked,\" he told the BBC.\nMr Zhang said police have paid visits to his home in Shenzhen as well, and in November last year he was summoned to a police station for questioning. \nBut he remains unafraid about potential repercussions. \"I know I have done nothing wrong,\" he said.\nReporting by Waiyee Yip."

      "text": "A UK-wide policy for reopening schools would make sense, Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has said.\nMr Hart said differences between the nations on schools policy are confusing for parents and children.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has given the date of 8 March \"at the earliest\" for the reopening of schools in England, which have been closed across the UK during lockdown.\nThe Welsh Government is yet to set such a date.\nThere have been calls for ministers to say what milestones should be reached before children return to classrooms.\nOn Wednesday Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the situation had not changed in Wales and the first minister would be providing an update on Friday.\nAsked by BBC Wales whether he would like to see a similar target in set in Wales, Mr Hart said: \"I always think, and I thought right from the beginning, that if we can do these things on a UK-wide basis, it makes sense. \n\"It makes sense because public compliance is easier to achieve that way, people understand exactly what the rules are, what the restraints are, what the support might be, whether it's financial or otherwise.\"\nHe said where there are differences on Covid rules between the four nations \"it can be a bit confusing for parents and businesses and even kids too for that matter\".\nBut, asked if he thought the Welsh Government should provide a detailed plan for coming out of lockdown, he said that setting out timescales for lifting restrictions \"is quite risky\".\nThe Welsh secretary said Covid \"doesn't follow a predictable pattern\".\n\"The danger of me standing here now and saying it'll definitely be like this is it probably, definitely won't,\" he said.\nA Welsh Government spokeswoman said: \"As the first minister has said on many occasions, where we can work together as four nations it makes sense to do so. \n\"However, education is devolved to Wales and any decision on schools will be made by the first minister and the education minister.\"\nMeanwhile Plaid Cymru has accused Labour of being split on making teachers a priority for vaccinations.\nWhile UK Labour has called for all teachers to be vaccinated in England, the Welsh Government has declined to put them in a priority list.\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Si\u00e2n Gwenllian said that the safety of all pupils and school staff should be the main driver of policy in preparation for the reopening of schools. \n\"When it comes to vaccinating teachers, the Labour Party is facing both ways in Westminster and in Wales,\" she said. \nThe party called for teachers to be vaccinated before schools reopen.\nThe Welsh Government said: \"We are following the priority groups set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and all people in the highest priority groups will be immunised as safely and as soon as possible.\n\"Teaching staff, whose role it is to provide intimate personal care for some of our most vulnerable students (in school or college) with complex medical needs, are included as part of the priority list for vaccination along with social care workers.\"."

      "text": "One in six households is struggling to afford broadband during the current UK lockdowns, according to a survey by Citizens Advice.\nThe charity warned that the poorest people were effectively being \u201clocked out\u201d of access to key services.\nOnly three of the 13 largest broadband providers offer affordable tariffs for those on low-income benefits, it said.\nIt is calling on the government to force providers to offer cheaper plans to people struggling financially.\nCitizens Advice also wants the telecoms regulator Ofcom to take action.\n\"Broadband allows people to be part of society,\" said Ned Dukes, community advice worker at Citizens Advice Haringey.\nApplying for support, as well as job applications and job interviews, are largely all carried out online. \n\"Without access to the internet, people are effectively locked out of key services and everything they need to live a full and proper life,\" he added.\n\"But for people on welfare benefits, every single decision about how they spend \u00a31 can make a difference. Broadband can be incredibly expensive.\"\nIn December, Ofcom said that households were paying an average of \u00a337 a month for a landline and broadband - with more than 4.7 million struggling to afford their bills.\nOut of 1,646 surveyed by Citizens Advice who said they have broadband, 275 said they struggled to pay their broadband bills between March last year - when the first lockdown began - and January 2021.\nCitizens Advice estimated that 2.3 million people had fallen behind on their broadband bill towards the end of last year.\nA government spokesperson told the BBC: \"We brokered a deal with the major telecoms providers who have committed to support those finding it difficult to pay their bills. \nThis includes ensuring customers are fairly treated and to offer generous mobile and landline packages to vulnerable customers. However we do encourage providers to go further on fixed broadband and offer a social tariff to those on low incomes during these challenging times.\" \nMaxine, who lives alone, claimed universal credit in March when she lost work in the hospitality industry.\n\u201cThroughout the lockdown the only way I've been able to see my elderly parents, and most of my grandkids is on video calls,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI don't have broadband as I can't afford it, so when my data has gone I can't see them any more. \n\u201cDo you know how heartbreaking it is to not be able to see them? It's really isolating just being alone. \n\u201cThere were times where if I ran out of data it would be weeks until I saw another person.\u201d\nNot being able to access the internet for food shopping, job applications, checking benefits and bills, means you \u201close out\u201d, she added.\nAlistair Cromwell, acting chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"The pandemic has cemented the fact that broadband is an essential utility. It is not a luxury for those who can afford it.\n\"Without broadband we struggle to teach our children, order food and medicines, work or search for a job.\n\"While the government has provided free laptops and mobile data to help children study at home, these are ultimately just a sticking plaster.\n\"To tackle the digital divide, it must take urgent action to ensure everyone can afford their broadband, no matter which provider they are with.\"\nOfcom said it agrees that afforable broadband is \"vital\".\n\"Some companies already offer low cost tariffs for certain customers, but we're pushing all providers to do more to support those in financial difficulty,\" a spokesman said.\n\"Although we can't make social tariffs mandatory without a formal direction from government, we're continuing to collect data on affordability and we're ready to act if more measures are needed.\"\nThe government has been contacted for comment."

      "text": "The government has withdrawn a social media advert urging people to \"Stay Home. Save Lives\" after it was criticised for stereotyping women.\nThe image showed women home schooling children and doing domestic chores, while the only man featured was depicted relaxing on a sofa.\nThe infographic was withdrawn after going viral on social media and facing criticism for being \"sexist\".\nThe government said the ad did \"not reflect\" its \"view on women\".\nCarrying the slogan \"Stay Home, Save lives. The new Covid-19 variant is spreading fast\", it was widely shared on social media earlier this week.\nThree scenes showed women cleaning, ironing and teaching children.\nAnother depicted a family on a sofa, mother and daughter curled up beside a man who has his feet on the ground.\nCommenting on Instagram, Lorraine Candy, former editor of Sunday Times Style Magazine who reported on the advert, along with Glamour magazine, said: \"Are there no intelligent, smart women advising the government about this? I am perplexed by the lack of awareness.\" \nParenting blogger Anna Whitehouse said: \"Showing a man lounging about while women (and girls) 'do it all' may bear some truth but it can't be the blueprint from the top. How did this get signed off in 2021?\"\nFor Labour, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson said the advert put \"women back 'in their place'\", adding: \"How out of touch can this government get?\"\nConservative former minister Caroline Nokes, chair of the Women and Equalities Committee, also criticised the image, tweeting: \"Someone signed this off.\"\nThe prime minister's spokesman said : \"We have provided information for the public throughout the pandemic.[The advert] does not reflect our view on women and we have removed it.\"\nThe Advertising Standards Authority stipulates that campaigns \"must not include gender stereotypes that are likely to cause harm, or serious or widespread offence\".\nAmong scenarios it deems \"likely to be unacceptable\" is one \"that depicts a man with his feet up and family members creating mess around a home, while a woman is solely responsible for cleaning up the mess\".\nAnother is an \"ad that belittles a man for carrying out stereotypically 'female' roles or tasks\". \nA report last November by the Fawcett Society, a charity campaigning for equal rights, found the pandemic was having a \"devastating\" effect on gender equality in the workplace, with women more likely than men to lose their jobs or be left dealing with childcare."

      "tags": "Novavax,Coronavirus vaccines,Stockton-on-Tees,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new coronavirus vaccine has been shown to be 89% effective in large-scale UK trials.\nThe Novavax jab is the first to show in trials that it is effective against the new virus variant found in the UK, the BBC's medical editor Fergus Walsh said.\nThe UK has secured 60 million doses of the jab, which will be made in Stockton-on-Tees in north-east England.\nMeanwhile, a single-dose vaccine developed by Janssen is 66% effective, trial results have shown.\nJanssen, a company owned by Johnson & Johnson, is also investigating whether giving two doses will give either stronger or longer-lasting protection.\nThe company said its initial findings showed one dose prevented 85% of severe cases.\nBoth the Novavax and Janssen jabs will need to be reviewed by regulators before they can be used.\nThe PM welcomed the \"good news\", with doses of the Novavax jab expected to be delivered in the second half of this year if approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the government said.\nThe UK has so far approved three coronavirus vaccines for emergency use - one from Oxford University and AstraZeneca, another by Pfizer and BioNTech, and a third from drug firm Moderna.\nThe Novavax jab, which is given in two doses, was shown to be 89.3% effective at preventing Covid-19 in participants in its Phase 3 clinical trial in the UK, and around 86% effective at protecting against the new UK variant. The jab's efficacy against the original Covid-19 strain was calculated to be 95.6%.\nThe Phase 3 trials - the final stage before a vaccine is looked at by a regulator - enrolled more than 15,000 people aged between 18-84, of whom 27% were older than 65, US firm Novavax said.\nIn the South African part of the trial, where most of the cases were the South African variant of the virus, the vaccine was 60% effective among those without HIV. \nStan Erck, chief executive of Novavax, said the results from the UK trial were \"spectacular\" and \"as good as we could have hoped\", while the efficacy in South Africa was \"above people's expectations\". \nHe told the BBC the manufacturing plant in Stockton-on-Tees should be up and running by March or April, with the company hoping to get approval for the vaccine from the MHRA around the same time. \nMinister Lucy Frazer told BBC Breakfast the government could not put an exact timeframe on when the Novavax jab might be approved as the regulation process is \"out of our control\".\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the new vaccine would be \"another weapon in our arsenal to beat this awful virus\", if approved.\nProf Paul Heath, chief investigator of the UK Novavax trial, said the trial findings were \"enormously exciting\", particularly because of the jab's efficacy against the UK variant.\nThese extremely encouraging trial results suggest another powerful vaccine against coronavirus could soon be within reach. \nIt works in a slightly different way to the ones that are already available - but does the same job of teaching the body's immune system to recognise and fight the pandemic virus. \nWhat is more, it appears to be effective against emerging and more infectious variants of coronavirus too - something scientists have feared might not be possible because the vaccines were all designed to match the original virus, not these new, mutated versions. \nProtection against illness from the new UK variant was high - around 86%.\nEven with the South Africa variant, which has undergone the most worrisome changes, it offered a level of protection similar to that given by flu shots against influenza.\nEngland's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said, if the jab is approved, it \"increases our future resilience\" against the virus.\nNadhim Zahawi, the UK minister responsible for the vaccine rollout, said he was \"particularly thrilled\" to see the positive results as he had taken part in Novavax's trials himself.\nIn total, the UK has ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and 40 million of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - both are currently being rolled out in the UK. \nAnother 17 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, which was approved by the MHRA in early January, are expected in the spring. \nThe aim is to give everyone in the top four priority groups - up to 15 million people - a first dose by mid-February.\nPfizer and Moderna vaccines rely on technology that has not been used in previous vaccines, but the Novavax jab uses a more traditional method of recreating part of the spike protein of the virus to stimulate the immune system.\nLike the Oxford vaccine, the Novavax jab can be stored at regular fridge temperature - which means it can be distributed more easily.\nMore than 7.4 million people in the UK have so far received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the latest government figures.\nMeanwhile, the latest estimate for the UK's R rate from the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, is 0.7 to 1.1. It means that on average, every 10 people with the virus will infect between seven and 11 other people. Last week, the R rate was between 0.8 and 1.\nThe latest growth rate range is between -5% and 0%, indicating that the number of new infections is broadly flat or shrinking by up to 5% every day. \nSeparately, the EU's vaccine contract with AstraZeneca has been published, in a growing row over reduced supplies of their jab.\nKate Bingham, who used to chair the UK's Vaccine Taskforce, said the reason the UK had a good supply of vaccines compared with other countries was because of its ability to get clinical trials completed quickly and at a high standard through the NHS's registry - with some 400,000 volunteers signing up \"before the US even started their Phase 3 studies\".\nThe UK recorded a further 1,239 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test on Thursday. There have also been another 28,680 new infections.\nHow have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

And thank you guys for loving it,\" the 25-year-old actor, who played Daphne Bridgerton, wrote on Instagram.\nReg\u00e9-Jean Page, whose performance as love interest the Duke of Hastings won him fans around the world, also celebrated the news.\nBridgerton's colourful costumes, wisteria-fronted homes and entertaining storylines were celebrated globally as many fans turned to the show at the end of a year marked by coronavirus.\nAdapted from a series of historical romance novels by author Julia Quinn, the drama follows members of the Bridgerton family as they navigate London's high society in the 1800s.\nBut it was Page and Dynevor's depictions of the Duke and Duchess's tumultuous relationship that catapulted them to fame while their raunchy sex scenes raised some eyebrows.  \nExecutive producer Shonda Rhimes was widely praised for her \"colour-blind casting\" which put black actors in the type of historical roles that were traditionally filled by white actors.\nThe show was designed for today's millennial and Gen Z audiences and has been described as a Regency-era Gossip Girl. \nNetflix defines a \"view\" as any piece of content watched for at least two minutes - meaning its numbers are not comparable to traditional TV viewing figures.\nNetflix said Bridgerton had made the top 10 in every country it operates in except Japan.\nThe previous record for most-watched debut series on the platform was held by fantasy drama The Witcher, which Netflix said was watched by 76 million households in its first 28 days.\nJinny Howe, vice-president of original series at Netflix, said Bridgerton \"defies tradition, and demonstrates that period dramas are not limited in scope or audience\".\n\"The empowerment of people of colour and women made Bridgerton feel accessible and contemporary, resonating with audiences all around the world,\" she wrote in a blog post.\nThe show has been renewed for a second series."

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon,Boris Johnson,Scottish independence",
      "text": "The Scottish government has published draft legislation for a possible second referendum on Scottish independence.\nIt wants to hold a vote after the pandemic but \"in the first half of the new parliamentary term\". So does it mean indyref2 is now inevitable?\nYes, in September 2014. \nScottish voters were given the choice of staying in the UK or becoming an independent country. \nThey backed staying the UK by 55% to 45%.\nIn one word - Brexit.\nScotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon started openly pushing for another referendum - often referred to as indyref2 -  immediately after the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016.\nScottish voters backed Remain by 62% to 38%, but the UK as a whole voted to Leave by 52% to 48%.\nFor nationalists, this was proof that Scotland needed to take its future into its own hands rather than being tied to the UK and its Conservative government. \nMany wanted indyref2 to be held before the UK left the EU in a bid to stop Scotland being \"dragged out against its will\" - but the argument is now that independence could allow Scotland to rejoin the EU in the future.\nThe SNP, which forms a pro-independence majority at Holyrood alongside the Scottish Greens, has spent much of the past five years arguing that its electoral success alongside the Brexit vote means it has a \"cast-iron mandate\" to hold a referendum.\nSo far, the UK government has refused to grant the formal consent that Ms Sturgeon has previously said would be needed to ensure any referendum is seen as being legal.\nA series of opinion polls suggesting that a majority of people in Scotland were now in favour of independence rattled unionists ahead of the Scottish Parliament election in May - although some more recent polls have suggested that support for remaining in the UK could have edged narrowly ahead again.\nNot surprisingly, opponents of independence - including the prime minister - don't want another vote on the issue.\nThey argue that the 2014 referendum was, in Ms Sturgeon's own words at the time, a once-in-a-generation opportunity - which Mr Johnson has suggested should mean another one should not be held for about 40 years.\nUnionists say Ms Sturgeon and her government should be focusing on tackling Covid and improving public services like health and education rather than independence.\nThey also say that rejoining the EU would not be a straightforward process for an independent Scotland - and could potentially lead to a hard border between Scotland and England. \nAnd they accuse the SNP of failing to give clear answers to key questions over issues such as currency.\nThere have been divisions in the SNP on how to secure another referendum.\nMs Sturgeon has predicted that the UK government's hardline stance will crumble if there is another pro-independence majority in the Scottish Parliament after May.\nBut some MPs and grassroots independence supporters are not convinced that this will happen, and have accused Ms Sturgeon and the SNP hierarchy of being too cautious.\nThis may be partly why a draft bill has now been published, setting out how a referendum can be held once the Covid pandemic ends if the May elections produces another pro-independence majority at Holyrood.\nThe Scottish government has not given a specific date, but says it wants a referendum to be held in the first half of the next parliamentary term.\nIt says there can be \"no democratic justification whatsoever\" for Westminster to attempt to block it - but has not said what it will do if formal consent is not forthcoming.\nOpinion polls, excluding don't-knows, had previously suggested a narrow majority of Scots want to remain in the UK - but things appeared to have shifted over the past year, with more than 20 consecutive polls indicating majority support for independence. \nHowever, polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice says support for the SNP and for independence is now consistently lower in the polls than it was at the beginning of the year.\nHe wrote last week that the past half dozen polls have averaged 51% for No and 49% for Yes once undecideds were removed. \nThis represents a five-point fall in support for independence compared with the position in the last half dozen polls conducted before the end of last year. \nSir John also said it was the first time that No have been ahead in a running average of the polls since this time last year.\nMeanwhile, polls have also suggested that the SNP's hopes of winning a majority in this May's election are also on a knife edge.

      "text": "Scientists behind a study tracking coronavirus in England say there are signs of a \"shallow decline\" in infection levels but they remain high.\nAnd with not all regions seeing the same downward trend, pressure on health services is likely to continue.\nJust under one in 60 people had the virus between 6 and 22 January according to researchers, with the trends \"going in the right direction\". \nThe estimate is based on swab tests of 168,000 people in households. \nConfirmed UK coronavirus cases, based on people with symptoms having tests, have fallen sharply since the start of the year - but surveillance studies such as this one, which test people at home with or without symptoms, are thought to provide a more accurate picture of the spread of the virus. \nThe latest figures from Imperial College London's React study - one data source used by the government to judge the progress of the epidemic - cover the first two weeks of the third national lockdown.\nSteven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics, at Imperial, said the prevalence of the virus was \"going in the right direction but not fast enough\" and \"by no means as fast as in lockdown one\".\nThe data found trends varied across England, with signs of a slight rise in the East Midlands, declines in London, the South East and South West, and levelling elsewhere.\nBut London had the highest proportion of people testing positive - 2.83%, which went up to more than 4% in 13- to 17- and 18- to 24-year-olds.\nAn interim report from React found that infections may have risen slightly during the first week of lockdown restrictions.\nBlack or Asian people and those living in large households or deprived neighbourhoods were more likely to test positive than others.\nHealthcare and care-home workers, as well as other key workers, were also more likely to be infected compared with other workers.\nStudy lead Prof Paul Elliott said infection rates \"remain very high\" but he was \"definitely heartened by what looks like a decline\".\nAnd the priority was now to drive them down more quickly to reduce the pressure on busy hospitals.\n\"The number of people infected with the virus is at the highest level that we've recorded since we began testing last May,\" he said.\n\"We're not seeing the sharp drop in infections that happened under the first lockdown.\n\"And if infections aren't brought down significantly, hospitals won't be able to cope with the number of people that need critical care.\"\nMore than 37,000 people are in hospital with coronavirus in the UK - twice as many as during the first peak, in April.\nAnd more than 4,000 are on ventilators, more than at any other time during the pandemic.\nDeaths reported within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus remain high, averaging more than 1,000 a day in the past week. The number of people who have died with Covid-19 has now surpassed 100,000 in the UK.\nHospital admissions of patients with Covid are coming down slightly, according to government figures.\nAll these metrics are used by government ministers and scientific advisers to decide when best to lift restrictions.\nDr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology, at the University of Reading, said looking at hospital admissions alone was not a reliable way to do this.\n\"While there is still so much virus circulating in the population, there will be a significant risk of filling intensive-care units with unvaccinated members of the working-age population and those for whom the vaccine fails to give any protection against Covid-19,\" he said."

      "text": "A major search operation for three people missing on a fishing boat from Conwy will resume on Friday morning, the coastguard has said.\nThe Nicola Faith vessel was expected back in the port at midnight on Wednesday.\nBut the fishing boat was reported missing to the HM Coastguard shortly after 10:00 GMT on Thursday.\nA search involving seven RNLI lifeboats, a helicopter and fixed-wing plane was suspended at about 21:00 GMT.\nRescue teams from Rhyl, Bangor and Llandudno Coastguard Rescue Teams were sent to assist the search, along with seven RNLI lifeboats from Rhyl, Llandudno and Conwy. \nAs well as the coastguard search and rescue helicopter from Caernarfon, a fixed-wing coastguard aircraft also took part in the operation.\nAt about 20:00, the Beaumaris, Conwy and Llandudno inshore lifeboats returned to their stations having been stood down, with the all-weather boats from Rhyl, Llandudno and Hoylake remaining at sea a while longer. \nThe entire search was then suspended for the night, with \"a further search planned for first light\" on Friday, the coastguard said.\nAn RNLI spokesman told BBC Wales: \"Absolutely every effort is being made to find the missing vessel and our thoughts are clearly with the family, who are clearly worried about their loved ones at this time.\"\nRhyl RNLI volunteer Paul Frost said the 10m (33ft) fishing vessel was last seen at 22:00 on Wednesday night, off Rhos-on-Sea.\nHe added the search operation was being heavily-resourced as it covered a huge area.\n\"It is literally hundreds of square miles, the area searched is something like 30 miles across by about 15 miles out as well. That's why so many resources have been utilised to try and search the area adequately,\" he said.\n\"It's very, very cold but the sea conditions aren't too bad. But the problems now are exacerbated by the oncome of night which makes searching more difficult.\"\nNorth Wales Police was also involved and an alert was sent to other boats in the nearby area, a coastguard spokeswoman said.\nAs it grew dark, duty controller for HM Coastguard Rob Priestley said: \"We are continuing to search a wide area to try and find this vessel with all the assets we have at our disposal. We're also asking other vessels in the area to keep a look out for anything that might also assist the search.\"\nThe boat was said to have left Conwy yesterday to go fishing and hadn't returned. \nIt was due to return at midnight last night, but the alarm was raised round about 10am this morning when the emergency services were contacted.\nHolyhead coastguard have been coordinating the search during the course of the day. \nThey've had a quite considerable number of resources - we're talking about three coastguard team volunteers on the land, searching the coast, out at sea; seven lifeboats, which lifeboat crews say is a very unusual amount of lifeboats all at one time, all on the same job, all out searching a very wide area; and then up in the air above there's been a coastguard helicopter and a fixed-wing aircraft as well.\nIt's covering a very large area, as far east as Rhyl where, off the coast there, people have spotted search activity going on, and as far west as Beaumaris and Puffin Island, that area just off the coast of Anglesey was brought into the search area this afternoon."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Schools in England will not be able to reopen to all pupils after the February half-term, but could do so from 8 March, the prime minister has said.\nBoris Johnson said this was the earliest schools could reopen and \"depends on lots of things going right\".\nThe BBC has been told the aim is for all schools and year groups in England to return at the same time. \nTheir return would mark the first stage in lifting the lockdown, the PM said.\nHe told a Downing Street news conference: \"The date of 8 March is the earliest that we think it is sensible to set for schools to go back and obviously we hope that all schools will go back.\"\n\"I'm hopeful, but that's the earliest that we can do it and it depends on lots of things going right, and... it also depends on us all now continuing to work together to drive down the incidence of the disease through the basic methods we've used throughout this pandemic,\" he added.\nThere was not enough data yet to decide when to end the lockdown, he said, but intended to set out a plan for how it could be eased - and the criteria involved - in the final week of February\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described the 8 March date as \"very much a hope and certainly not a guarantee\".\nMeanwhile, a further 1,725 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the latest government figures. The UK's official coronavirus death toll surpassed 100,000 on Tuesday. \nMr Johnson told MPs the country remained in a \"perilous situation\" as he said UK nationals and residents arriving from 30 high-risk countries would soon be ordered to quarantine in hotels.\nHe revealed a plan for the \"gradual and phased\" lifting of the lockdown in England could come in the week beginning 22 February.\nOther restrictions on daily life could be eased after schools reopen, but he explained this would depend on hitting vaccination targets, the capacity of the NHS, and deaths falling.\nAn earlier plan for mass testing for pupils and staff remains in place, the BBC has been told.\nEngland's schools have been closed to all but vulnerable children and those of key workers since the Christmas break.\nIn Scotland, it is hoped schools may begin a phased return in the middle of February. \nIn Wales, measures including school and college closures will be reviewed on Friday. In Northern Ireland, a review will take place on Thursday.\nThe prime minister said he understood frustration among pupils and teachers \"and for parents and for carers who spent so many months juggling their day jobs, not only with home schooling but meeting the myriad other demands of their children from breakfast until bedtime\".\nThe government initially planned to review England's lockdown measures - including school closures - on 15 February, which had raised hopes that pupils could return to classes after half term.\nAcknowledging the impact of continued school closures, Mr Johnson pledged to \"work with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure that pupils have the chance to make up their learning\" before 2024.\nHe said \u00a3300m \"of new money to schools\" would fund a catch-up programme over the coming year, with financial incentives for providers to educate pupils who have missed lessons due to the pandemic. \nAfter complaints about confusion and drift about when schools in England are going back, Boris Johnson has sought to bring some certainty.\nThey won't be going back straight after half term - but the target date will be 8 March.\nSources say the aim is for all schools and year groups in England, in primary and secondary, to return back on that date - rather than it being the starting date of a phased or regional return.\nAlthough that could be subject to any changes in local Covid-19 levels.\nWhen schools do go back it is expected there will be mass testing for pupils and staff, in the scheme initially planned for the start of term.\nIt still leaves parents home schooling for another five weeks - and means most of this term will have been without face-to-face lessons.\nThis will be a particular worry for pupils heading for whatever replaces GCSEs and A-levels this summer, after almost a full year of stop-start lessons.\nHead teachers say the delay is \"no surprise\" - and reopening must be done safely.\nAnd Labour says half term should be used to vaccinate teachers to help schools stay open.\nBut the prime minister will hope that parents would rather have some clarity about what's happening with schools, even if that means a longer delay.\nTeachers' and head teachers' unions said they supported reopening schools but added that it must be safe and not rushed.\nMary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said that although the most vulnerable would be protected by March, most parents would not be.\n\"It fails completely to recognise the role schools have played in community transmission. The prime minister has already forgotten what he told the nation at the beginning of this lockdown, that schools are a 'vector for transmission',\" she said.\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said the government needs to work with head teachers to review safety measures and create a \"workable plan\" for schools to reopen fully.\n\"The government will also have to put effort into reassuring families that it is safe to send their children back to school - there is a confidence test the government must pass to make the return a success,\" he said.\nIn other developments:"

      "text": "Home schooling can be tough. It's difficult to concentrate, there's emotional exhaustion, boredom, a lack of motivation and it's really hard not going out to see friends. And that's just the parents.\nThis winter lockdown is taking its toll on families, now struggling even more on the black ice of uncertainty as no-one can say when schools in England are going to reopen for most pupils again.\n\"There's a sense of fatigue,\" says Jacqueline Smallwood, who is at home with three secondary-school children. She says her own \"concentration levels have fallen dramatically\".\n\"It's so repetitive that it just makes you feel tired,\" she says of the latest lockdown and the \"silent struggle\" facing both parents and their children to try to get motivated.\nThere might have been some guilty enjoyment at the start of the year when the school term was initially delayed, not having to get up and out on cold January mornings. \nUntil it dawned on them that this was becoming something much longer than a few weeks. \nIt's morphed from early January to half term in mid-February and now maybe Easter in early April or even later. And Jacqueline says, as a matter of \"respect\", parents need to know what's happening about schools.\nThe confusion over a return date seems to have further frayed the nerves of parents.\nThe mother, who lives outside Canterbury in Kent, says she worries about the pressures building up on young people.\nFor teenagers like her sons, she says this \"should be a pivotal time in their lives,\" when they're beginning to get some independence and when social lives are hugely important - but instead they're stuck inside with their parents.\n\"We can't live like the Waltons forever,\" she says, referencing the US TV series of a folksy family relying on each other.\nThe first lockdown created an unexpected sense of togetherness, an \"enforced bonding\" that she says turned out to be a \"massive positive\".\nBut Jacqueline, who works as a writer, sees no such upside to the latest lockdown. There is a collective frustration - and she says it has been made even worse by the confusion about when schools will go back.\nThe online home-schooling seems to be working, she says, with teachers trying to boost the enthusiasm levels, but it's no real substitute for being in school. And she wants much more clarity about when they will go back.\n\"I've tried not to be political about decisions being made, but you can't help but feel disappointed. They don't seem to understand how real people are living,\" she says.\nShe says when politicians say maybe schools will or won't be back by Easter, they don't realise how much that uncertainty affects families trying to plan for what comes next.\nEducational psychologist Dan O'Hare says the \"key word is 'uncertainty'\".\nNot knowing what is coming next adds to the pressure, he says, and children out of school are already facing big unknowns such as what's going to happen about exams or when will they see their friends and teachers.\n\"It's really stressful for children and their families,\" says Dr O'Hare, who is co-chair of the British Psychological Society's division for educational and child psychology. \"They need a sense of a plan.\"\nThis lockdown is also in the depths of winter - and he says employers need to think about making sure staff working from home are able to take a break in daylight hours, so that families can get outside.\nIt's no use asking parents to answer work emails all day and expect them to go out when it's dark.\nFor some families it has got very difficult.\n\"It's affected her emotionally a lot,\" says Dave in Bolton, who is worrying about his six-year-old daughter, who has been crying because she misses her friends.\n\"It's awful, you can't put a positive spin on it. She's at that age where she's enjoying her friends, becoming more socialised,\" he told BBC 5 Live.\n\"She's quite a confident little girl and I can't help worry that being stuck at home is going to impact her in the longer term.\"\nThe father says many of her classmates are still going into school - and that makes it even harder when she sees her friends on school Zoom calls.\nJen Locke in Newcastle makes the point that women can often be \"the most adversely affected by the decision to keep schools closed\". \nShe says home schooling has \"fallen squarely on my shoulders\", helping her children in the day and then shifting her work with an IT company into the evening, so it's an early start through to a very late finish.\n\"It's a huge mental strain\u2026 I'm knackered from it all,\" she says, right down to trying to get children to bed who aren't tired because they're not going out.\nA lockdown weariness seems to be out there, despite the best efforts of schools.\nSimon Armstrong in Bristol, whose son is in secondary school, says: \"Virtual lessons, no matter how well delivered, are a woeful substitute for real lessons.\"\n\"I am at the end of my tether,\" he says.\nThe Department for Education said: \"We are committed to reopening schools as soon as the public health picture allows, and will inform schools, parents and pupils of plans ahead of February half term.\" \nBut Labour has accused the government of causing \"chaos and confusion\" for parents and schools.\nThe National Association of Head Teachers said: \"Now is the moment for calm heads to decide on a sustainable return to school, not another chaotic and last-minute set of decisions that could easily result in a yo-yo return to lockdown.\""

      "text": "No changes will be made to income tax rates and bands in the coming year after the Scottish government set out its budget plans.\nFinance Secretary Kate Forbes told MSPs that this was a time for \"stability, certainty and targeted support\".\nShe also pledged an \"exceptional response\" to the Covid-19 pandemic, with extra funding for jobs and skills.\nLocal authorities will also be offered incentives to freeze council tax rates to prevent household bills rising.\nPandemic tax reliefs for businesses are also to be extended, while the poundage rate of non-domestic rates is to be cut for the first time in the history of devolution.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish Fiscal Commission has warned that the economy will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024.\nThe budget plans come almost one year on from the first confirmed case of coronavirus in Scotland, with Ms Forbes saying \"the pandemic has shaken our society and economy to their core\".\nShe said her goal was to \"bring much-needed support and stability\" and to lay the groundwork for a \"fairer, stronger and greener\" economy in future.\nThe budget includes \u00a31.1bn of spending on jobs and employment support, extra cash for the health service to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, and \u00a33.1bn for education.\nIncome tax rates and bands are to remain unchanged, with the thresholds for all but the top rate to rise in line with inflation.\nThe government has earmarked \u00a390m for councils as an incentive to freeze local rates - the equivalent of a 3% increase - in a bid to protect household budgets.\nHowever a tax cut for housebuyers announced during the first lockdown will end on 1 April, with the starting point for Land and Buildings Transaction Tax to return to \u00a3145,000 - although relief for first time buyers will continue.\nMs Forbes said: \"This budget is focused on delivering tax policies that will support economic recovery and maintain our commitment to creating a fairer and more progressive tax system. \n\"It is about striking the right balance between raising the revenue required to fund our public services and supporting the economic recovery through targeted interventions.\"\nNon-domestic rates relief for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses will be extended by at least another three months, with Ms Forbes saying this could be extended further if the UK government makes a similar move in its budget in March.\nAnd the finance secretary took the \"unprecedented step\" of reducing the poundage rate of non-domestic rates to 49p, which she said would save firms more than \u00a3120m.\nSpending plans include a record \u00a316bn for health services, along with an extra \u00a3869m to tackle Covid-19, and \u00a311.6bn in total for local government.\nMs Forbes also announced an uplift in police budgets and \"significant extra funding\" for the justice system, with \u00a350m aimed at clearing the backlog in court cases.\nOther spending plans include:\nMs Forbes will now enter negotiations with opposition parties over the plans, with the minority SNP administration needing the support of at least one other party to pass a budget.\nScottish Conservative finance spokesman Murdo Fraser welcomed the tax plans, and called for rates relief for businesses to be extended for a full 12 months.\nHe also said the government must focus \"100%\" on managing the pandemic and the economic recovery, pointing to \"unprecedented support\" from the UK Treasury over the past year.\nScottish Labour's interim leader Jackie Baillie welcomed \"renewed focus on the economy\" and jobs, saying she looked forward to talks with ministers.\nHowever, she warned the country was heading for \"a huge economic crisis and a cost of living crisis not seen since wartime\", and that the support for local government \"falls short of what is required\".\nThe Scottish Greens have backed the SNP in every budget vote in this parliamentary term, but co-leader Patrick Harvie said the plan announced on Thursday \"does not pay for a green recovery\" and amounted to \"moving pennies here and there\".\nScottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie, meanwhile, called for more funding for mental health services and a greater focus on education and business support.\nThe budget includes plans for public sector pay, including a 3% rise for those on salaries below \u00a325,000 and a 1% rise for others. Ms Forbes said this was a \"progressive and restorative approach\".\nHowever, public sector unions criticised the move, with GMB Scotland saying it \"won't amount to more than a tenner a week for most\". The FDA described it as \"a slap in the face to the very workers this government has publicly applauded\".\nAnd the EIS said the move was \"an effective pay freeze\" for teachers which would be met with \"deep disappointment\".\nBusiness groups meanwhile welcomed many of the measures, but called for support - in particular on tax rates - to go further.\nThe Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the plans in the budget were \"welcome, but do not go nearly as far enough as to avoid risk of widespread business collapse and job losses\".\nChief executive Dr Liz Cameron said restrictions on firms had been \"devastating\", and that the three-month extension of rates relief was \"too short a reprieve\" to give certainty.\nThe Federation of Small Businesses echoed calls for the tax breaks to be extended to a full year, with policy chair Andrew McRae saying: \"If we lose businesses in the jaws of this crisis, then bouncing back becomes that much harder.\"\nCBI Scotland said Ms Forbes was right to put business support and economic recovery \"front and centre\" of the budget, welcoming the rates relief and income tax plans.\nDirector Tracy Black said that while \"health must come first\" and lowering transmission rates should be the government's priority, it was \"only right that proper consideration is given to reopening the economy when it is safe to do so\"."

      "text": "Boris Johnson has insisted that Scotland's independence debate is \"irrelevant\" to most people as he urged the country to unite against Covid. \nThe PM was speaking during a trip to Scotland to emphasise the strength of the UK working together during the pandemic.\nThe SNP said he was panicking as opinion polls show declining support for the union.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon also questioned if his trip is essential.\nThe PM started his day-long visit by going to the Lighthouse Laboratory - which processes Covid tests - at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus in Glasgow.\nHe later visited troops who are setting up a vaccination centre in the Castlemilk area of the city, and toured the Valneva vaccine factory in Livingston.\nThe factory is expected to deliver 60 million doses to the UK by the end of the year if its vaccine is approved.\nMr  Johnson used the visit to argue that the priority should be \"fighting this pandemic and coming back more strongly together\" rather than arguing about the constitution.\nAnd he praised the \"amazing performance\" of Scottish people in the \"national effort\" to fight the pandemic. \nThe prime minister said: \"I think endless talk about a referendum without any clear description of what the constitutional situation would be after that referendum is completely irrelevant now to the concerns of most people\".\nMr Johnson also criticised the SNP's record in government, and added: \"We don't actually know what the referendum would set out to achieve.\n\"We don't know what the point of it would be - what happens to the army, what happens to the Crown, what happens to the pound, what happens to the Foreign Office. Nobody will tell us what it's all meant to be about.\"\nHe told reporters that \"the very same people\" who wanted independence \"also said only a few years ago, in 2014, that this was a once-in-a-generation event\".\n\"I'm inclined to stick with what they said last time,\" Mr Johnson said.\nUnder the current Covid regulations, people are only able to travel between Scotland and England for essential reasons, with similar regulations also in place to stop travel across council boundaries within Scotland.\nAsked at her daily coronavirus briefing on Wednesday how she felt about the prime minister's visit while the strict travel restrictions were in place, Ms Sturgeon replied she was \"not ecstatic\" about it.\nShe argued that leaders should abide by the same rules they impose on the general public, adding that she had herself rejected a suggested visit to a vaccine centre in Aberdeen for this reason.\nDowning Street has insisted it is important for the prime minister to be \"visible and accessible\" across the whole of the UK during the pandemic.\nIn response to Ms Sturgeon's criticism, the prime minister's official spokesman said: \"These are Covid-related visits. You've seen the prime minister do a number of them over the past few weeks.\n\"It is obviously important that he is continuing to meet and see those who are on the front line in terms of those who are providing tests, in terms of those who are working so hard to deliver the vaccination plan.\" \nMr Johnson's visit to Scotland is widely seen as being part of a \"charm offensive\" in response to polls indicating a rise in support for independence. \nHowever, polls have also suggested that the independence question is currently a lower priority for many people than other issues such as the pandemic, health and education. \nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said it was \"only right\" the prime minister visited people on the front line of the vaccine roll-out to make sure it is operating effectively.\nHe told BBC Breakfast Mr Johnson has visited other crucial locations in the UK's pandemic response, such as the Wrexham plant making the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, adding: \"No one thinks that's illegitimate.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer also said he backed the visit. \"I'm with the prime minister on this one,\" he told LBC Radio.\n\"He is the prime minister of the UK. It's important that he travels to see what is going on, on the ground.\"\nIt comes as the Scottish government sets out its budget, described as the \"most important in the history of devolution\" in the wake of huge spending increases to support people and businesses during the pandemic.\nBoris Johnson had a clear purpose on his visit to Scotland - to talk up what he calls the power of cooperation across the UK. \nDressed in white lab coat and protective gear, he was happy to tell me how the UK government is supporting the fight against coronavirus in Scotland.\nThat includes spending lots of money supporting jobs and businesses, building test centres, and procuring vaccine supplies from companies like the one he was visiting in Livingston. \nBut here's the paradox.\nNo matter what the prime minister does, or that the UK and Scottish governments are following broadly similar Covid strategies - the public in Scotland perceives that Nicola Sturgeon and her team are handling the pandemic response better. \nThis visit was controversial because it happened during lockdown but it went ahead because the UK government recognises how much work it has to do to make the case for the union in Scotland, with Scottish elections due in May when the question of indyref2 will be to the fore. \nOn Sunday, the SNP revealed an 11-point \"roadmap to a referendum\" on Scottish independence, which sets out how the party intends to take forward its plan for another vote on the issue. \nIt says a \"legal referendum\" will be held after the pandemic if there is a pro-independence majority at Holyrood following May's election.\nAnd it says it will \"vigorously oppose\" any legal challenge from the UK government.\nMr Johnson has repeatedly stated his opposition to a referendum, and has suggested that another one should not be held for 40 years. \nOpposition parties in Scotland have also accused Ms Sturgeon and the SNP of putting the push for independence ahead of the Covid pandemic.\nBut SNP deputy leader Keith Brown said the prime minister's trip was evidence that he is in a \"panic\" about the prospect of another referendum."

It was incredible,\" he told CNN.\nThere were a variety of themes such as this reference to the Bernie Sanders meme from last month's presidential inauguration. \nAnd this homage to influential women including Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who died last year. \nThe idea for the house floats came from a carnival regular, Megan Joy Boudreaux, who had suggested it in a post on Twitter after the mayor's announcement in November.\n\"It doesn't matter if your budget is zero and you're recycling cardboard boxes, or whether your budget is tens of thousands of dollars and you've got a mansion on St Charles. We want everyone who wants to do this to participate,\" she told the New York Times.  \nShe said she had expected a few friends and neighbours to join in, but by the beginning of January more than 9,000 people had signed up - some as far afield as the UK and Australia, the AP reports.\nSome homes were decorated in honour of musicians, like this house below that paid tribute to former New Orleans resident and jazz clarinet payer Pete Fountain.\nAnd this house which referenced country music star Dolly Parton. \nThere were also tributes to musician Dr John.\nAnd others evoked Zydeco music pioneers Boozoo Chavis and Clifton Chenier and the 'Cajun Hank Williams', DL Menard.\nAn online map of the decorated houses is being made available for people to visit in their own time and, it is hoped, in a socially-distanced way.\nAll pictures subject to copyright."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "One in three police officers in England and Wales has been threatened by someone they believed had Covid-19, a survey suggests.\nA poll of rank-and-file officers by the Police Federation found 32% said someone they thought to be infected had threatened to breathe or cough on them.\nSome 21% of officers said a suspected infected person tried to spit at them.\nIt is the largest survey published of frontline officers' experiences of policing the pandemic. \nMeanwhile, police chiefs have reiterated calls for officers to be prioritised for vaccination, along with teachers and firefighters.\nThe Demand, Capacity and Welfare Survey was carried out between 5 October and 23 November last year, with about one in 10 rank-and-file officers responding.\nJust over half of officers, 55%, said they had been the victim of an unarmed physical attack in the past year, while 16% said they had suffered injuries requiring medical attention.\nWhile only 3% of officers had tested positive for Covid-19, 26% believed they had had the virus.\nChairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales John Apter said the survey showed the \"huge pressure\" officers were under policing the pandemic and the negative impact this was having on their welfare.\nHe added: \"The increasing level of violence they face, especially involving the weaponising of the virus, is a sad indictment of the society we live in.\"\nA total of 12,471 officers provided useable responses to the survey, from a total Police Federation membership of more than 120,000 from the rank of constable to chief inspector.\nOn Tuesday the Metropolitan Police Service, the biggest force in the UK, said five officers had died with Covid-19 in the past two weeks.\nMeanwhile, police leaders are pushing the government for frontline officers to get priority access to Covid-19 vaccines.\nMr Apter said: \"They must be given all the protection they need to protect themselves and this includes being prioritised for the Covid vaccine. We have had enough of the warm words - we now need action.\"\nThe chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, Martin Hewitt, said it was important to society that police forces retain their resilience and were able to use the vaccination process to protect their level of service.\nAround 8% of officers in England and Wales are currently off work. It is thought more than 20 officers have died from Covid-19.\n\"The simple fact of the matter is you can't do policing at two metres distance,\" Mr Hewitt said.\nHe said it was right that the \"uniquely vulnerable\" were being vaccinated first - people most likely to be seriously ill or die - but called for frontline officers, teachers and firefighters to be prioritised next.\nLast week, Home Secretary Priti Patel said ministers were working to ensure police and other frontline workers were moved up the priority list for vaccination.

      "tags": "EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The rollout of Covid vaccines in European Union (EU) countries is picking up speed, with more than 300 million jabs  administered.\nAs of 20 June, nearly half of the EU's adult population have had at least one one dose, while 28% have been fully vaccinated.\nEarlier this year, the rollout was hit by delays in production and distribution and vaccine hesitancy in some countries.\nIn the week to 20 June 2021, Germany administered an average of 1 dose per 100 people a day, with Italy and France close behind on  0.9 dose per 100 people - all higher than the UK's 0.6 per 100.\nHungary - which is using Russian and Chinese vaccines as well as the EU-approved ones - has fully vaccinated 46% of its population, the same proportion as the UK. \nIn France, children who are 12 and over can be vaccinated, with parental consent. The government is hoping to avoid class closures when schools reopen after the summer holidays. \nThe EU authorised the use of the Pfizer vaccine in children aged 12-15 at the end of May. \nGermany said it would give it to those aged 12-17 with pre-existing conditions while a number of other EU countries said they would vaccinate children before the start of the next academic year.\nIn June 2020, all 27 member states joined a scheme giving the EU central responsibility for buying vaccines.\nHowever, the EU was slower than the UK to negotiate a contract with AstraZeneca and there were supply problems.\nIts deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna also saw early problems with production and distribution.\nIn February, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the EU's vaccine difficulties, saying: \"We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time.\" \nIn January 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all age groups, but a number of EU countries initially refused to recommend its use for people over 65.\nFrance and Germany eventually revised their stance and approved the vaccine for 65-74 year olds at the beginning of March.\nThey were again among 13 European countries who paused the AstraZeneca rollout again later in March, following reports that a small number of people developed blood clots after receiving the jab. \nOn 7 April, the EMA said there was a \"possible link\" between the vaccine and the clots, although it is still recommended the jab for all age groups. \nSeveral EU countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands now say only people over 55 or 60 should get the jab, while others like Denmark have suspended its use altogether. \nThe headlines surrounding AstraZeneca led to a drop in confidence in the jab. In March, the polling company YouGov suggested that only a third of Germans and 23% of French respondents considered it safe.\nThe EU took AstraZeneca to court to force it to deliver more doses of vaccine. The company blamed production problems but said it had \"fully complied\" with its contract.\nThe EU lost its legal battle. It had wanted AstraZeneca to deliver 120 million doses by the end of June but a court ruled that the company must instead provide 80 million doses by the end of September. \nThe EU said the UK has had an unfair advantage in contracts it signed with vaccine manufacturers, some of whom have plants in the EU.\nEU leaders considered a ban on exports of vaccines to the UK but decided not to introduce one.\nInstead, they called for more transparency from the UK and other countries on the number of doses they export.\nThe EU says that by 1 June 2021, it had exported 245 million doses to 46 different countries. \nUnder the terms of the EU scheme, member states are not supposed to strike deals with any vaccine manufacturer with whom the EU already has an agreement, but they can make separate deals with vaccine makers which have not signed agreements with the EU.\nHungary has been using Russia's Sputnik vaccine for months and and Slovakia has also bought doses of it.\nGermany said in April it would begin talks to secure supplies of the Russian vaccine and Austria said it would buy one million doses, but only once the EU's medicines agency approves the jab for use in the EU. \nThe Czech Republic and Poland have entered talks with both Russia and China.\nThe UK approved the Pfizer vaccine in November 2020, nearly three weeks before EU regulators. \nThe government claimed that being outside the EU allowed it to be more nimble in this area. \nHowever, the UK's approval of the vaccine would have been permitted anyway under EU law - a point made by the head of the UK medicines regulator.\nThe UK could have joined the EU vaccine scheme last year while it was still in a transition phase with the EU, but it chose not to. \nIf it had, the UK might not have been able to do as many deals with vaccine companies."

      "tags": "Insects,Natural History Museum",
      "text": "It's amazing what treasures are tucked away in the collections of London's Natural History Museum - some not fully recognised yet even by the curators.\nConsider two beetles wedged in the grooves of a piece of oak that was dug from a Cambridgeshire bog in the 1970s.\nThe insects were donated to the London institution by a farmer concerned they might be an invasive species. They weren't, and so were put in a drawer. \nOnly now have they been examined and shown to be nearly 4,000 years old.\nThe beetles are Oak Capricorns (Cerambyx), a species not previously known to have ever existed in Britain.\nAbout the size of your thumb, they have wonderful long antennae. And if alive today and resident in the UK, they would certainly be among the country's largest beetles.\n\"They're as big as a stag beetle,\" said the NHM's senior curator of insects, Max Barclay.\n\"As far as I know, the story is this: A farmer in eastern England was cutting up wood he'd found while doing some deep ploughing and discovered these insects inside; dead, of course. This was a huge piece of waterlogged oak, and he sent us a sample. I think, primarily, he was concerned the beetles were pests. My colleagues at the time said, 'well, they're not British', and so they were left.\n\"Today, you find this species halfway down France. You get it in Poland, Hungary and into Slovakia. And there are also old records from southern Germany.\n\"We recently had the opportunity with some American collaborators to actually date the wood and the beetles. This was really interesting. Because the beetles are inside the wood, you know they're the same age; and it's therefore a test of the dating techniques to show they get the same results whether it's plant material or animal material. It's a kind of Rosetta Stone moment.\"\nThe radiocarbon dating found the beetles and the oak to be 3,785 years old. \nThe farmer's land near Ramsey in Cambridgeshire would have looked very different back then.\nIt was the Bronze Age, and we think these islands were experiencing relatively dry and warm conditions. We don't have thermometer records but many other similar \"proxies\" suggest this. The presence of the wood-chomping beetles probably speaks also to more forested times. East Anglia has since been cleared of nearly all its ancient woodlands.\nIf you're wondering why it's taken more than four decades to properly describe these beetles, consider this: The NHM holds 8-10 million beetle specimens in its collections. It would be a mammoth task to fully assess all of them. \nYou can still find something \"new\" in the insects brought back to Britain by the great naturalists Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. Darwin on his Beagle expedition picked up 8,000 beetles. Wallace, working in the \"Malay archipelago\", amassed 10 times that number.\n\"There's a voyage of discovery to be made in the collections every day. I like to call it 'the last frontier of exploration',\" Max told BBC News.\nThe beetles' story is featured in the next episode of the Channel 5 documentary series, Natural History Museum: World of Wonder, which airs on Thursday 28 January at 20:00 GMT."

      "tags": "Scottish government,Derek Mackay,Scottish Parliament,Scottish Budget",
      "text": "The Scottish government is to set out its budget plans for the year ahead on Thursday.\nFinance Secretary Kate Forbes will detail her tax and spending proposals against the continuing backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, the SNP government's partnership agreement with the Greens, and a fresh set of election pledges to be delivered.\nSo how big is the Scottish budget, where does the money come from, and where is it likely to go?\nIn 2022-23, the Scottish government's core revenue block grant - the cash it will have to spend on day-to-day matters - will be \u00a335bn.\nPoliticians, prone to such rows, are locked in a dispute about whether this is enough to be getting on with.\nThe Conservatives point out that it is about 8% more than ministers typically had to spend prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. \nHowever, the SNP note that it is still less than there was on hand over the past two years, when extra billions were ploughed in to fund relief programmes - and given the pandemic has not gone away, nor should the funding.\nThis block grant - a share of the UK-wide budget as calculated via the Barnett Formula - accounts for a fair chunk of the Scottish budget, but tax revenues raised in Scotland have played an increasingly large role in recent years.\nAnd as we saw throughout the pandemic, the measures announced now can be topped up on an ongoing basis through the year via \"Barnett consequentials\" - effectively Holyrood's share of cash committed to devolved areas by the UK government, which Scottish ministers can spend as they like.\nLeaving the row over how much money there is aside, it is clear that there is an ever-increasing list of demands on that funding which Ms Forbes will need to manage.\nThe biggest wad of cash goes on health, which usually accounts for more than 40% of the overall spend. Covid has only boosted what was already a huge portfolio.\nThe government has already committed to increasing health spending still further, with Nicola Sturgeon promising to increase investment by 20% over the parliamentary term. A \"significant down payment on that commitment\" is expected on Thursday.\nSocial care is also set to suck up a fair chunk of the budget, even before the new National Care Service is set up.  For example, the doubling of the Scottish Child Payment is forecast to cost \u00a390m next year, and more than \u00a3300m per year when fully rolled out.\nThe next biggest recipient in the budget is generally local government, which takes about a quarter of the cash while delivering many core services from schools to bin collections.\nThere are always calls for town halls to be given more funding - or the power to raise it themselves via council tax hikes - and this debate is likely to be intensified in light of the role they played in the pandemic, and indeed local elections coming up in May.\nEducation, transport and justice also take up hefty chunks of spending, with funding for the likes of the police usually likely to be maintained if not increased.\nThere will also likely be extra support for businesses, as efforts to get them back on their feet post-pandemic continue.\nThis has implications, however - the Fraser of Allander Institute estimates that the current set of rates reliefs for tourism, hospitality and leisure firms costs the government around \u00a3736m in reduced revenue. Ms Forbes faces a decision over how far and how long she should continue to fund such programmes.\nAnd there is also sure to be a focus on environmental initiatives, with Greens in government and COP26 still large in the memory.\nThis will likely range across a number of portfolios, with everything from low-carbon transport to renewable energy and \"just transition\" funding to support jobs during the move away from oil and gas.\nSince 2018, Scotland has had a separate system of income tax rates and bands to the rest of the UK.\nThis added two extra tax rates - one just below the basic rate, providing a break for low earners, and just one above it, to squeeze a little more from those who earn above the median wage.\nMeanwhile, the higher and top rates of tax are both a percentage point higher than elsewhere in the UK, in what the finance secretary terms a \"progressive\" move to bolster local services.\nIt seems unlikely the government will make big changes again, with the SNP having pledged in May's election manifesto that it would \"freeze income tax rates and bands\".\nMs Forbes could potentially tinker with the thresholds - the point at which the various rates kick in. The Fraser of Allander Institute reckon that freezing thresholds, rather than raising them in line with inflation, would generate an extra \u00a3140m of revenues.\nHowever, this would constitute a tax increase, which may not be popular at a time when National Insurance Contributions are also going up.\nOne thing to watch out for alongside the budget is the latest set of forecasts from the Scottish Fiscal Commission, which may provide an insight into the impact of the pandemic, the recovery of the economy and the employment market through 2022.\nIn previous years, this was the part of the budget that really got people excited at Holyrood - the political horse-trading where Ms Forbes would bargain with opposition parties to thrash out a budget deal.\nHowever, with the Scottish Greens joining the SNP in government, this backroom intrigue has disappeared.\nThere will still be some discussion within St Andrews House about what should be in the budget, and Ms Forbes may still meet with other parties for the sake of appearances.\nBut with the votes of the seven Green MSPs locked in, the plans announced on Thursday will not need to be revised - and the budget bill looks set to coast through parliament with minimal fuss."

Sixty-seven of them are intensive care and 57 patients are receiving ventilation.\nMrs Foster said Northern Ireland's R-number - or rate of infection of the virus - was continuing to fall, with the rate in the community currently sitting between 0.65 and 0.8.\nBut she warned that the number of Covid patients in intensive care units has doubled in the past month, reaching its highest-ever level this week.\nMs O'Neill said she was \"encouraged\" by the progress made in the vaccination programme, with 175,284 people in Northern Ireland now having received their first dose.\nThe online booking system for the 65-69 age group opened last night and vaccinations for those people will be available at regional centres.\nOn Thursday, the executive also discussed a proposal that staff in special schools should be prioritised for vaccination - but ministers have requested further work between officials take place on the issue.\nIf it is not possible for all pupils to return on 8 March, priority will be given to pupils in exam years, BBC News NI understands.\nThat would include pupils taking GCSEs, AS and A-level and BTecs - but it is not clear if it would also include Primary Six pupils who may want to sit the transfer test in the autumn.\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said schools in England would not be able to reopen to all pupils after the February half-term, but could do so from 8 March.\nOn Thursday, another 47 Covid-19-related deaths were recorded in the Republic of Ireland, taking its total to 3,167.\nThe Irish health department also recorded another 1,466 confirmed cases of the virus."

And it would be a surprise if everything went smoothly.\"  \n\"Everyone has a right to the vaccine, and the best way to guarantee this right is to remain calm - politically, economically and individually,\" urges Belgium's Le Soir.\nThe idea of buying vaccines from elsewhere has been gaining ground in some parts of Europe.\nHungary controversially decided to buy Russia's Sputnik V vaccine before it has received EU approval but now pro-government papers are weighing in. Magyar Hirlap argues that the Russian vaccine \"could be life-saving\" and Magyar Nemzet says failure to get vaccines on time \"could take hundreds of thousands of lives\". But left-wing daily Nepszava accuses Prime Minister Viktor Orban of using the vaccine policy for his own political ends, so that he \"can say with a sly smile, you see, we have won again, we have just managed to overtake Brussels at the revolving door.\"\nCroatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic says \"Covid-19 vaccine diplomacy is turning into vaccine hijacking\", but he's stated that Croatia has not  yet turned towards other vaccine manufacturers, due to the agreement stipulating that EU member states would not contact manufacturers themselves.\nOn the possibility that Russia and China might step in to provide their own vaccines, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said \"if they want to supply a vaccine to the EU, they need to ask the EMA [for approval]\".\nPolish Health Minister Adam Niedzielski has said that, though his government \"has no alternative plans to procure vaccines\", there are more reasons to buy additional vaccines, as producers do not always honour their commitments, according to Gazeta Wyborcza.\nThe Polish government was \"analysing various opportunities, but the matter is rather delicate, so we cannot share any details\", it quoted him as saying.\nRomanian news outlet Kr\u00f3nika suggests Hungary's decision to buy the Russian vaccine is entirely justifiable in the face of supply issues. \"The Hungarian leadership has at least made an effort to find a solution to the crisis,\" the outlet said. \nCalls for a more diverse vaccine provision are not limited to Central and Eastern Europe. \nIn Italy, where the government said it would take legal action against Pfizer and AstraZeneca over the delays, the regional head of the department of health for Rome said the Sputnik V vaccine was \"needed\" and that the European Medicines Agency should approve it. \n\"This isn't about geopolitics: it's a race against the spread of the mutations,\" Alessio D'Amato said."

What we saw today was not a free market and it forced an awful lot of people to lose an awful lot of money,\" said 18-year-old Myron Sakkas of Coventry, a student at Warwick University.\nMyron, who has had an account on the Trading 212 platform since August last year, said he had lost \u00a330 on Gamestop shares, which he owned for \"a couple of hours\" and sold when he saw what was happening.\nMyron said he had since been locked out of his account and unable to use it while his identity is being checked. But when he gains access again, he plans to take out the \u00a31,000 he has in it and call a halt.\nThough hoping to go into investment banking after he gets his degree, he said he was disillusioned by what he sees as \"market manipulation\" directed against people like him. \n\"When ordinary people try to make money in a system where only rich traders can make money, that's what happens,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Maybe I won't trade for a while, to be honest,\" he added. \"I've got other stuff to do.\"\nKey to what's going on is \"short selling\" or \"shorting\", where a big investment company such as a hedge fund tries to make money by betting that a company's share price will fall.\nThe hedge fund borrows shares in a company from other investors (for a fee) and sells the shares on the markets at, for example, $10 each, waits until they fall to $5, and buys them back. The borrowed shares are returned to the original owner, and the hedge fund pockets a profit.\nGameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as \"failing\" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street.\nBut in the last week, amateur investors who follow the Wall Street Bets forum on Reddit have poured money into buying the company's stock with the aim of pushing up the price. \nIf the price rises dramatically, short sellers face big losses and they need to buy back the shares they have borrowed quickly to prevent bigger losses  - a process known as covering.\nHowever, buying back the shares only adds to demand for the stock and pushes its price higher still.\nAnd amateurs aren't the only ones getting in on the action.\nThis week, for example, private equity firm Silver Lake Group, which had loaned money to AMC Entertainment, converted its bonds to shares after the surge in the firm's prices, a swap worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\nIn the US, anger over the trading restrictions united politicians whose stances typically sharply diverge.\nSenator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is taking over as chair of the banking committee, said he would hold a hearing about the \"state of the stock market\".\n\"People on Wall Street only care about the rules when they're the ones getting hurt,\" he said.\nRep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, known for her leftist views, called the restrictions \"unacceptable\" and expressed support for a hearing, to which Sen Ted Cruz, a staunch Republican, replied on Twitter, \"Fully agree\".\nDave Portnoy, founder of the Barstool Sports blog, who has emerged as one of the most high-profile amateur traders during the pandemic, also attacked the restrictions, singling out Robinhood, which has cast itself as a platform aimed at making Wall Street more accessible.\nThe firm also makes money through fees paid by Wall Street firms that execute trades for its users.\n\"'Democratizing finance for all' except when we manipulate the market, cause too many ordinary people are getting rich,\" he wrote.\nAnalyst Neil Wilson said that Reddit chat threads, suggest the day traders' battle with Wall Street is personal. \n\"Among the many aspects of this story that are strange, what is so unusual is the peculiar vigilante morality of the traders pumping the stock. They seem hell-bent on taking on Wall Street, they seem to hate hedge funds and threads are peppered with insults about 'boomer' money. \n\"It's a generational fight, redistributive and all about robbing the rich to give to the millennial 'poor'.\"\nElon Musk, who has a history of feuding with short sellers, also joined the fight, tweeting: \"Here come the shorty apologists. Give them no respect. Get Shorty.\"\nA one-word tweet by the billionaire entrepreneur on Tuesday - he tweeted \"Gamestonk!!\" - had been seen as giving Gamestop shares an extra boost.\nThe fracas follows a jump in casual investing during the pandemic, which saw people stuck at home with time on their hands and limited places to spend pour money into the market.\nThe surge has produced ripples of worry on Wall Street, including concerns that inexperienced investors could cause bubbles in certain stocks or were dabbling in investments with risks they did not fully understand.\nRobinhood - which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new interest in investing - has faced particular scrutiny for the way its app has made investment seem like a game. \nLast year, Massachusetts regulators filed a complaint accusing the company of marketing to inexperienced users and failing to protect them.\nOfficials said this week they were following the market battle.\nPress secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday President Joe Biden\u2019s economic team, including newly-appointed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, was \u201cmonitoring the situation\u201d.\nMassachusetts state regulator William Galvin called on the New York Stock Exchange to suspend GameStop for 30 days to allow a cooling-off period. \"This isn't investing, this is gambling,\" he said in an interview. \"This is obviously contrived.\""

They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "text": "It is \"crucial\" tourism is allowed to reopen by Easter after a \"catastrophic\" year, an industry insider has said.\nNorth Wales Tourism chief executive Jim Jones said firms had spent \"extremely heavily\" to make them Covid-secure. \nHe warned of job losses in an industry that employed 43,000 people in north Wales.\nThe Welsh Government said it was \"committed to doing all we can to protect businesses during this very challenging time\".\nMany businesses had already \"gone under,\" and others were \"teetering on the edge of failure,\" Mr Jones said.\n\"If we don't get the opportunity to open by Easter it means a lot more loss of jobs, loss of business and also the economy is going to be so hard hit it's going to take a long, long time to recover.\n\"So, it's crucial we get the opportunity to open this Easter.\"\nFor one holiday cottage agent, bookings have increased by 13% on the same time last year, which was before the pandemic struck.\nRuaridh MacDonald, who owns The Cottage Company with his wife Caroline, said it was unsurprising given the restrictions on foreign travel.\n\"Rightly or wrongly, people feel they may be able to go on holiday in the UK rather than abroad,\" Mr MacDonald said.\n\"We can feel confidence levels rising and you can see it day by day.\"\nBut businesses have had to nurture that confidence, including offering \"no-quibble\" refund or reschedule options.\nThomas Scarrott is the director of Vale Holiday Parks, which is based near Aberystwyth, in Ceredigion, but has 14 sites across Wales and south-west England.\nDespite a \"difficult\" 2020, Mr Scarrott said the company had received about 1,500 bookings from the start of the Easter holiday period until the end of summer. \nBut while bookings are \"looking good\", they are nowhere near where they would usually be - and can be cancelled by the customer if restrictions are not lifted.\n\"Because of the way in which the law and consumer rights works, there's no risk to booking a domestic holiday - you are not going to lose out financially,\" Mr Scarrott explained.\n\"So as good as the bookings are, that income will only be realised once the holiday is realised.\"\nWhen the restrictions are lifted, Mr Scarrott knows his staff will be busy taking bookings - but has called for certainty as early as possible.\nHe added: \"We strongly believe we can open and offer a service without shared facilities - people would come to the caravan, go to the beach and enjoy the coast path.\"\nPaula Warren, owner of Hide Wales cabins, shepherd's hut and lodge in St Donats, Vale of Glamorgan, said they had seen some bookings for later in the summer, but spring and early summer is still \"very, very quiet\".\n\"We would usually take 40% of our bookings in the first two weeks of January, but this year we didn't take any,\" she said.\nBut Ms Warren said she is \"not panicked\" and remained \"hopeful\", adding customers had been \"so kind\" in choosing to defer bookings rather than cancel them.\nCustomer confidence is fragile, Ms Warren suggested, which means making them feel comfortable enough to book with them is all the more important.\n\"The first question they will ask is 'what are the terms and conditions',\" she said.\n\"Our previous Ts and Cs were slightly more looking after our business, but we have changed that - we have tried to put ourselves in their shoes.\"\nDespite a \"tricky time\" for the domestic tourism sector, Luke Edwards, of cottage lettings agent Menai Holidays, in Anglesey, said \"we are starting to see signs of bookings picking up\".\n\"It's still too early to say whether there will be a boom, but confidence in the UK holiday market seems to be on the up,\" he said.\n\"Hopefully, once we have a clear idea of when we will be allowed to welcome people to north Wales again, we are hopeful of seeing the tourism industry in Wales and the UK blossom.\"\nNorth Wales Tourism boss Jim Jones added businesses \"totally\" understood the need for safety, and for Covid-19 case numbers to drop, but the \"uncertainty, and not knowing, is adding to the anxiety that our businesses are suffering\".\nHe said the industry was down \u00a32.17bn on revenues of \u00a33.6bn in 2019.\nHe called on the Welsh Government to support the industry with measures including business funds and rates relief.\n\"We're not seeing any sign of any road map to recovery,\" said Mr Jones. \n\"We're still waiting to see what that entails so I think it's really, really important that the Welsh Government starts to share with us what their plans are for recovery into 2021.\"\nBusinesses outside of tourism are also calling for an Easter start-up.\nArete Outdoor Learning Centre sits a few miles from the foot of Snowdon, in the village of Llanrug, providing residential courses for school children across the UK.\nIt said if schools were open, it should be able to as well.\nCentre director Gareth Davies said: \"For the sector, we've lost 6,000 jobs already. Thirty centres have shut since the start of the pandemic and there's 20 more under serious threat across the UK.\n\"The sector's been decimated and there's not going to be anything left for future generations without an Easter re-start, or alternatively sector-specific funding to help us survive, if the government don't change their guidance.\"\nThe Welsh Government said: \"Our package of support is the most generous in the UK and more than \u00a31.7bn of Welsh Government financial assistance has reached businesses since March.\"\nIt said money had already reached tourism, hospitality and leisure businesses from a \u00a3180m fund opened in January. \n\"Wales will remain in alert level four until infection rates are under control,\" it added.\n\"We review the Wales-wide measure in place at least every three weeks.\""

      "tags": "Curiosity rover,Mars,Nasa,Extraterrestrial life,Geology,Nasa Perseverance Mars rover,Astrobiology,Space exploration,Mars rovers",
      "text": "The US space agency's Perseverance rover is now just three weeks from arriving at Mars.\nThe robot and the Red Planet are still separated by some 4.5 million km (3 million miles), but this gap is closing at a rapid rate.\nThe biggest, most sophisticated vehicle ever sent to land on another planet, the Nasa robot is being targeted at a near-equatorial crater called Jezero.\nTouchdown is expected shortly before 2100 GMT on Thursday 18 February.\nTo get down, the Nasa rover will have to survive what engineers call the \"seven minutes of terror\" - the time it takes to get from the top of the atmosphere to the surface.\nThe \"terror\" is a reference to the daunting challenge that is inherent in trying to reduce an entry speed of 20,000km/h to something like walking pace at the moment of \"wheels down\".\n\"When the scientists look at our landing site, Jezero Crater, they see the scientific promise of everything: the remains of an ancient river flowing in and flowing out of this crater and think that's the place to go to look for signs of past life. But when I look at Jezero, I see danger,\" says Allen Chen, the engineer who leads the Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) effort for Perseverance.\n\"There's danger everywhere. There's this 60-80m-tall cliff that cuts right through the middle of our landing site. If you look to the west, there are craters that the rover can't get out of even if we were to land successfully in one of them. And if you look to the east, there are large rocks that our rover would be very unhappy about if we put down on them,\" he told BBC News.\nFortunately, Perseverance has some tried and tested technologies that should ensure it reaches a safe point on the surface. Among them is the famous \"Skycrane\" jet pack that successfully landed Nasa's previous rover, Curiosity, eight years ago. \nThere are even some additions designed to improve reliability. The parachute system that slows the atmospheric descent from super- to sub-sonic speeds now has something called \"range trigger\". This more precisely times the opening of the parachute to bring the rover closer to its notional bulls-eye.\nUnlike Curiosity which just opened the chute when it reached a pre-determined velocity, Perseverance will check its surroundings first before issuing the command.\nAllied to this is Terrain Relative Navigation. Perseverance will be examining the ground below and checking it against satellite imagery of the crater to better gauge its position.\nIt's like you or I looking out the window of our car and then looking back at a map to see where we are, says Chen. \n\"That's what we're asking Perseverance to do on her own, to figure out where she is, and then fly to known safe spots that are nearby.\"\nCuriosity managed to touch down about a mile from the notional bulls-eye. It overshot slightly. Perseverance, with its enhanced landing technologies, should do much better.\nScientists have already named the area that includes the bulls-eye. It's called Timanfaya, named after the Spanish national park in Lanzarote, one of the Canary Islands.\nThe Lanzarote Timanfaya is a volcanic terrain; the Martian version, which encompasses a 1.2km by 1.2km square likely also includes some volcanic rock. It's the floor of Jezero Crater.\nAlthough this is the landing spot, it's not the major interest for the mission. That's the remnant delta just to the north, along with some more distant carbonate rocks which the researchers think may trace the edge of a once huge lake in Jezero.\n\"Carbonate rock is extremely abundant on Earth, but is quite rare on Mars  and we're not really sure why that is,\" says Ken Farley, the Nasa project scientist on Perseverance. \n\"There's a region on the edge of the crater that would have been the shore with a high concentration of carbonate. This is very attractive to us, because on Earth carbonate often is precipitated [by living organisms]: people will be familiar with things like coral reefs. And it is a good way to record bio-signatures,\" he told BBC News.\nThe dream is Perseverance will stumble across fossil evidence of stromatolites. These are sedimentary deposits that have been built by layers, or mats, of micro-organisms.\nThe structures, and the chemistry within them, is recognisable to geologists. That said, we are talking about rocks in Jezero that are almost four billion years old. \nDiscoveries are unlikely to be of the slam-dunk variety, which is why Perseverance will package up its most interesting finds for later missions to retrieve and bring back to Earth for more detailed study.\nFarley says Perseverance will be asking the most fundamental of questions and whatever answers its produces will be instructive.\n\"Is it a case of if you build a habitable environment then life will come? Or is it like a magic spark that also has to happen? And the answer to that question is really important, because we now know that there are billions, literally billions, of planets out there beyond Earth. \n\"What is the likelihood that life doesn't exist out there? It seems small to me, but it all hinges on how ubiquitous that spark is that gets life going,\" he explained."

      "text": "Tesla reported record deliveries in the fourth quarter, boosted by increased demand for electric vehicles.\nBut its shares fell in after-hours trading after profit fell short of analyst expectations.\nWhile many car firms were hit hard in 2020 by the coronavirus pandemic, Tesla bucked the trend.\nIts shares surged nearly 700% over the year, making it the world's most valuable carmaker.\nGovernments around the world have been \"setting tougher targets for switching to electric vehicles\", helping to increase interest in Tesla, said Rebecca Crook, chief growth officer at digital agency Somo.\n\"Tesla had an incredibly successful 2020, joining the likes of Amazon as the unofficial 'winners' of a turbulent year,\" she said.\n\"It's been a challenging past 12 months for car manufacturers,\" she said. \"It's critical for Tesla to maintain this momentum because its success sends optimism into the wider automotive industry.\"\nTesla, which is led by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, saw steady sales and profitable quarters in 2020 as other car manufacturers were hit by the effects of the Covid-19 crisis.\nBut the race is on in the car industry to develop electric vehicles to meet emissions targets and challenge Tesla's market lead.\nThe company delivered 180,570 vehicles in the fourth quarter, a quarterly record, even though it narrowly missed its overall 2020 goal of half a million deliveries.\nNet income, excluding share-based compensation payouts to Mr Musk, rose to $903m (\u00a3660m) from $386m last year, falling short of average analyst expectations for a $1.08bn quarterly profit.\nThis combined with a lack of a clear target for 2021 vehicle deliveries sent shares down 4% in after-hours trade. Investors had hoped for a significant increase over the company's 2020 delivery goal of half a million vehicles.\n\"Over a multi-year horizon, we expect to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries. In some years we may grow faster, which we expect to be the case in 2021,\" Tesla said in a statement.\nBut investor focus was \"always going to be on profitability\", which was lower than the market had expected, said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\"We think that reflects the shift from premium Model S and X vehicles to lower priced Model 3s and Model Ys,\" he said.\n\"Tesla will argue... as more vehicles are fed through production lines profitability will improve. That's true, but it relies on global demand for an ever-increasing number of Teslas.\"\nThe good news for Tesla is that electric vehicles have caught the public imagination, said Mr Hyett, adding that Joe Biden's entrance to the White House will probably mean more focus on electric vehicles.\n\"However, an increasingly competitive landscape means Tesla will have to work harder in the future,\" he said.\nAt present Tesla is heavily reliant on selling carbon credits to rivals, but as those rivals begin producing electric vehicles of their own, that demand will fall, he added."

      "text": "Spotify has patented technology that will allow it to analyse your voice and suggest songs based on your \"emotional state, gender, age, or accent\".\nThe patent, which was filed in 2018  and granted on 12 January, would allow the streaming giant to \"make observations\" about a user's environment and emotions using speech recognition technology.\nSpotify could then play music reflecting their mood or even their social setting - \"e.g. alone, small group, party,\" according to the patent.\nIf implemented, the feature will presumably boost the streaming statistics for Lesley Gore's It's My Party (And I'll Cry If I Want To).\n\"It is common for a media streaming application to include features that provide personalized media recommendations to a user,\" explained Spotify in its application.\nHowever, it continued, the current approach for discerning a user's tastes is unsatisfactory, because it requires them \"to tediously input answers to multiple queries\" about their age, gender and favourite bands.\nThe patent suggests that speech recognition could be used to gather information about age and gender, while contextual cues such as \"intonation, stress, [and] rhythm\" would provide clues as to whether a user was \"happy, angry, sad or neutral\".\n\"It should be understood that the above example metadata categories of emotions, gender, age and accent are merely examples, and numerous other characterizations and classifications can be used,\" it said in the filing.\nThe results would be combined with other information - including a user's previously-played songs, and their friends' taste in music - to improve recommendations.\nThe technology is one of several technical innovations that Spotify has patented over the last year.\nIn September, it patented a karaoke-like feature that allows people to \"overlay a music track with their own vocals\". And earlier this week, it gained permission for a \"cadence-based media content selection engine\" - which matches the tempo of your music to your running speed.\nLast year, it also conducted a study of how people's personality traits influence their musical preferences.\n\"Those who scored high in conscientiousness tended to concentrate their listening to a more narrow window of time of day,\" concluded Spotify's Research and Development team.  \n\"Self-assessed introverts, on the other hand, tended to dig deeper into an artist's catalogue, listening to more tracks for each artist they discovered.\"\nThe streaming service, which has 320m global users, has been granted a patent that would allow it to use such insights to promote content - including music, podcasts and advertising - that has been tweaked to appeal to a listener's personality.\n\"In some embodiments in which the personalized content includes one or more messages with audio components,\" explains the patent, \"the electronic device changes a tone of voice for messages for presentation to the user.\"\n\"For example, the tone of voice may be more upbeat, high-pitched and/or exciting for users that have been assigned the personality trait of extroversion.\"\nWhile such tracking technology seems dystopian, Spotify's own researchers have cautioned against implementing it without due consideration of the ethical implications.\n\"We recognize that one's digital history is extraordinarily personal and sensitive,\" they wrote in their paper. \"As such it must be treated with proper consideration of the conceivable misuses... from its access. \n\"We disavow any future research or applications that violate ethical standards of data usage and are not transparent about privacy to its users\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "A free anthology of books by black British authors is to be provided to every primary school in England. \nReading charity BookTrust said the initiative was part of a drive to increase the diversity of voices in children's literature. \nThe collection, called Happy Here, is aimed at children aged seven and older and will be published on 5 August. \nIt will feature writers including Yomi Sode, Clare Weze, Dean Atta, Patrice Lawrence and Sharna Jackson.\nThe project is a collaboration between BookTrust, publisher Knights Of and charity Centre for Literacy in Primary Education (CLPE).\nJill Coleman, director of children's books at BookTrust, said: \"Happy Here is going to thrill and inspire children in families and schools across the country and we want to make sure it is read by thousands of children.\n\"We are proud to be working with Knights Of and CLPE as part of our effort to drive a long-term, sustainable increase in the diversity of voices published in children's literature.\"\nAimee Felone, co-founder of Knights Of, said: \"Being able to commission work that has no motive other than to amplify, uplift and celebrate what it means to exist in the UK today as black British is liberating for our team.\n\"Each and every author and illustrator has focused not on the trauma or hardship of their existence, which is too often highlighted in children's fiction, but the experience and possibility of happiness for their characters.\""

      "title": "How Tesla generated billions for Scottish stock-pickers",
      "tags": "Elon Musk,Amazon,Tesla,Alibaba,Electric cars,Tencent",
      "text": "Tesla last year made half a million new cars. That means the pioneer of electric vehicles is a relatively small auto manufacturer, and only half the scale it intended to be by now. \nYet its stock price says it's the most valuable auto maker on the planet, worth more than $800bn(\u00a3580bn). \nThat has made its boss, Elon Musk, the world's richest man, owning 21% of the stock.  At the start of last year, wealth watchers say he was worth a mere $27bn. By year's end, it was more like $150bn. \nHe is the number one poster boy for entrepreneurs. Not only is he minted, but he's controversial, unpredictable, and a stand-out visionary who makes the coolest products - batteries and solar panels to tackle global warming, while his space rockets reverse launch into their own parking spaces.\nThat ought to mean the stock pickers who backed him and Tesla get some kudos too, and gobsmacking profits for their investors. So which is the next biggest owner of Tesla stock?\nYou would find it at the foot of Calton Hill in Edinburgh, next to a large building site, a multiplex cinema and the capital's John Lewis store. (It happens to be on a site earmarked nearly 50 years ago for the headquarters of BBC Scotland, but that remained in Glasgow instead.)\nYou might not notice it. Baillie Gifford can seem low key to capital residents. It's not a big consumer brand. Owned by its 47 partners, it gets by with a modest profile. Founded as a law firm in 1907, it's canny and long-term. \nBut as an investment partnership, it's now huge and getting a lot bigger. At the end of last month, it had \u00a3326bn in funds under management. Forbes magazine last month rated it \"the world's best stock-picking firm\".\nThe partnership's profit on holdings of Tesla shares last year alone was a staggering $29.5bn (\u00a321.2bn).\nAs the share price rocketed by more than 700% over the year, it had to sell some stock. The rules of various funds, including the flagship Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, require them to limit investors' exposure to a single stock within the portfolio.\nSo it made a profit of nearly $15bn (\u00a310.8bn) on shares it had to sell, and the rest was paper profit on the equity it retained. By the end of last month, that stake was worth $19.5bn (\u00a314bn).\nMuch of the stock-picking credit goes to managers of the Scottish Mortgage fund, James Anderson and Tom Slater. They are among 80 or so investment managers within a Baillie Gifford staff of 1,300, most of them in two Edinburgh offices, soon to be merged at the new office complex going up at Haymarket.\nIf the former manager's name sounds familiar as someone with cash to splash, then yes, that's the same James Anderson who poured \u00a33.5m into Scottish football last year, without even being much of a football fan. Clubs are important for local communities at a tough time, and particularly for smaller towns, he explained.\nThe duo began investing in Tesla only eight years ago. By last year, they owned nearly 8% of it. After last year's sales, that is now below 3%. When they started investing, a share traded at $6. By close of trading on Wednesday, it was $846.\nThe intention is not to back technology firms, but to find those that are \"technology-enabled\" - using tech to do something, and companies whose visionary leaders have ideas for disrupting markets. \nOther companies backed include online retailers Amazon and Alibaba, Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO, genetic sequencer Illumina and Chinese conglomerate Tencent. The funds realised by selling Tesla shares have been ploughed into promising younger ventures, such as Swedish green battery-maker Northvolt.\nThe company emphasises that the profits are not made by Baillie Gifford itself, but by its clients - those who invest in its funds. The investment partnership makes it money out of managing those funds, while partners may also have their own personal stakes in the funds. \nScottish Mortgage was the first fund launched by Baillie & Gifford in 1908. It now has little focus on Scotland and nothing to do with mortgages.  \nIt is listed on the London Stock Exchange, and as the real and paper profit on Tesla stock grew by $5.5 billion (\u00a34bn) during last year, leaving a stake worth $2.2bn (\u00a31.6bn), the Investment Trust share price grew so much that it emerged as the biggest riser on the FTSE100 index, and, by valuation, Scotland's biggest company.\nIn November, as Scottish Mortgage had to offload Tesla stock, James Anderson voiced the approach of the company as one that invests with patience and a purpose: \"We are privileged to have been Tesla's largest external shareholder over a critical period for the development of the company. \n\"We are immensely grateful for the extraordinary efforts and achievements of Tesla in driving forward a transportation and energy revolution in the face of persistent scepticism and often downright hostility. Without Tesla's efforts the possibility of averting climate disaster would have been significantly reduced. \n\"In our view the underlying purpose of providing equity capital at scale is to try to assist in mitigating, and hopefully solving, the most serious problems the world faces. For sure, we and our clients are extremely happy with the progress of the share price but we see this as but a reflection of the ultimate objective.\"\nBeing a partnership without external shareholders, there's no pressure to deliver quarterly returns. And with the returns they get over time, investors in their funds are unlikely to be anxious that Tesla's earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020, announced on Wednesday night, came in below market expectations.\nIt seems that the move down a gear into the mid-market of electric cars will mean growth in vehicle production each year of around 50%, and more than that this year, but that comes at the price of lower margins. \nSo in after-market trading, the stock price was down by 5%. Baillie Gifford clients can afford that kind of paper loss."

      "tags": "Scottish government,Scottish Budget,Kate Forbes",
      "text": "No changes will be made to income tax rates and bands in the coming year after the Scottish government set out its budget plans.\nFinance Secretary Kate Forbes told MSPs that this was a time for \"stability, certainty and targeted support\".\nShe also pledged an \"exceptional response\" to the Covid-19 pandemic, with extra funding for jobs and skills.\nLocal authorities will also be offered incentives to freeze council tax rates to prevent household bills rising.\nPandemic tax reliefs for businesses are also to be extended, while the poundage rate of non-domestic rates is to be cut for the first time in the history of devolution.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish Fiscal Commission has warned that the economy will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024.\nThe budget plans come almost one year on from the first confirmed case of coronavirus in Scotland, with Ms Forbes saying \"the pandemic has shaken our society and economy to their core\".\nShe said her goal was to \"bring much-needed support and stability\" and to lay the groundwork for a \"fairer, stronger and greener\" economy in future.\nThe budget includes \u00a31.1bn of spending on jobs and employment support, extra cash for the health service to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, and \u00a33.1bn for education.\nIncome tax rates and bands are to remain unchanged, with the thresholds for all but the top rate to rise in line with inflation.\nThe government has earmarked \u00a390m for councils as an incentive to freeze local rates - the equivalent of a 3% increase - in a bid to protect household budgets.\nHowever a tax cut for housebuyers announced during the first lockdown will end on 1 April, with the starting point for Land and Buildings Transaction Tax to return to \u00a3145,000 - although relief for first time buyers will continue.\nMs Forbes said: \"This budget is focused on delivering tax policies that will support economic recovery and maintain our commitment to creating a fairer and more progressive tax system. \n\"It is about striking the right balance between raising the revenue required to fund our public services and supporting the economic recovery through targeted interventions.\"\nNon-domestic rates relief for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses will be extended by at least another three months, with Ms Forbes saying this could be extended further if the UK government makes a similar move in its budget in March.\nAnd the finance secretary took the \"unprecedented step\" of reducing the poundage rate of non-domestic rates to 49p, which she said would save firms more than \u00a3120m.\nSpending plans include a record \u00a316bn for health services, along with an extra \u00a3869m to tackle Covid-19, and \u00a311.6bn in total for local government.\nMs Forbes also announced an uplift in police budgets and \"significant extra funding\" for the justice system, with \u00a350m aimed at clearing the backlog in court cases.\nOther spending plans include:\nMs Forbes will now enter negotiations with opposition parties over the plans, with the minority SNP administration needing the support of at least one other party to pass a budget.\nScottish Conservative finance spokesman Murdo Fraser welcomed the tax plans, and called for rates relief for businesses to be extended for a full 12 months.\nHe also said the government must focus \"100%\" on managing the pandemic and the economic recovery, pointing to \"unprecedented support\" from the UK Treasury over the past year.\nScottish Labour's interim leader Jackie Baillie welcomed \"renewed focus on the economy\" and jobs, saying she looked forward to talks with ministers.\nHowever, she warned the country was heading for \"a huge economic crisis and a cost of living crisis not seen since wartime\", and that the support for local government \"falls short of what is required\".\nThe Scottish Greens have backed the SNP in every budget vote in this parliamentary term, but co-leader Patrick Harvie said the plan announced on Thursday \"does not pay for a green recovery\" and amounted to \"moving pennies here and there\".\nScottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie, meanwhile, called for more funding for mental health services and a greater focus on education and business support.\nThe budget includes plans for public sector pay, including a 3% rise for those on salaries below \u00a325,000 and a 1% rise for others. Ms Forbes said this was a \"progressive and restorative approach\".\nHowever, public sector unions criticised the move, with GMB Scotland saying it \"won't amount to more than a tenner a week for most\". The FDA described it as \"a slap in the face to the very workers this government has publicly applauded\".\nAnd the EIS said the move was \"an effective pay freeze\" for teachers which would be met with \"deep disappointment\".\nBusiness groups meanwhile welcomed many of the measures, but called for support - in particular on tax rates - to go further.\nThe Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the plans in the budget were \"welcome, but do not go nearly as far enough as to avoid risk of widespread business collapse and job losses\".\nChief executive Dr Liz Cameron said restrictions on firms had been \"devastating\", and that the three-month extension of rates relief was \"too short a reprieve\" to give certainty.\nThe Federation of Small Businesses echoed calls for the tax breaks to be extended to a full year, with policy chair Andrew McRae saying: \"If we lose businesses in the jaws of this crisis, then bouncing back becomes that much harder.\"\nCBI Scotland said Ms Forbes was right to put business support and economic recovery \"front and centre\" of the budget, welcoming the rates relief and income tax plans.\nDirector Tracy Black said that while \"health must come first\" and lowering transmission rates should be the government's priority, it was \"only right that proper consideration is given to reopening the economy when it is safe to do so\"."

      "tags": "Tourism,Companies,Staycations,Hospitality industry,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "After the news that British residents arriving in England from Covid hotspots will have to quarantine in hotels, many would-be holidaymakers are thinking of opting for UK destinations this summer.\nUnderstandably, they don't want to undergo the \"managed isolation process\" requiring them to spend 10 days in a hotel on their return to the UK.\nBut there may be a shortage of the kind of UK accommodation they are looking for, say providers of holiday lets. \nFrom cottages to campsites, demand is on the increase. Even the UK's luxury hotels are expecting the move to give them a boost.\nSarah and Steve Jarvis, who run the Independent Cottages website listing more than 1,800 properties, say inquiries during the current lockdown in England are 300% up on the first lockdown in March to July 2020.\nHowever, they also point out that many properties still need to honour bookings that were rolled over from 2020 because of earlier virus curbs, restricting availability for new requests.\n\"People started the year with bookings already in the calendar,\" Sarah told the BBC. \"We're going to end up in a situation where we have demand outstripping supply again.\"\n\"It's almost like the perfect storm,\" adds Steve. \"People will be hesitant about going abroad with the new travel restrictions and the UK is looking like a very good option.\n\"People have got confidence in UK self-catering holidays, because the bookings are coming in thick and fast.\"\nIn normal times, says Sarah, people are looking for accommodation for an average of four people to go away on holiday together.\nBut at the moment, they are getting lots of inquiries for groups of up to nine people, as extended families or groups of friends seek to make up for the family Christmas celebrations they missed out on.\n\"Families are going to go away and they want to take their parents with them,\" Sarah says. \"It's a safe option for elderly relatives.\"\nUnusually, some are also booking ahead for next Christmas already.\n\"Straight after Boxing Day, people usually start thinking about summer holidays, but we're also seeing very early bookings for the festive season,\" says Steve.\nAnother holiday provider, holidaycottages.co.uk, says it has seen a sharp increase in demand since mid-January.\nThe firm's chief marketing officer, James Starkey, says: \"In the past week, bookings taken for May half-term onwards are up 39% compared to last year, with the summer holidays up 98%. \nWe do still have just over half of our properties available for seven-night breaks in the summer holidays but, with them booking more quickly this year, we anticipate another strong summer for the UK staycation industry.\"\nAt Trencreek Holiday Park in Newquay, Cornwall, there is definitely a pick-up in interest from holidaymakers.\nThe park offers a mixture of camping and self-catering accommodation, covering a wide range of travel needs.\n\"Since Monday, the phone's been getting a lot busier,\" says Julliette Hautot, who runs the business with her husband. \n\"The calls are on the up and it's definitely going to be busy for the summer,\" she told the BBC.\n\"Slots are filling up for July and August. There's not a lot left, especially for the school holidays.\"\nShe is also noticing more inquiries for September than usual, perhaps reflecting a feeling that pandemic restrictions will ease later rather than sooner.\nHotels are noticing the staycation trend as well. The Best Western chain has just done a survey of 6,000 of its UK customers and found that 90% of them felt safer holidaying in Britain this summer rather than abroad.\n\"With the worries around quarantine, we are now starting to see bookings landing for the big summer months coming through in the last 24 hours,\" spokesperson Andrew Denton told the BBC.\n\"The experience of last summer has taught people not to leave it to the last minute as Britain gets booked, so to book ahead and quit worrying about quarantine, which might impact an international trip.\"\nAt the upper end of the spectrum, the UK's luxury hotels are anticipating opportunities as a result of the hotel quarantine measures for international travel.\nPride of Britain Hotels, a collection of 50 of independently-owned luxury hotels including the Athenaeum in London's Mayfair, says the measures are set to benefit home-grown tourism.\n\"Anything that makes international travel more difficult will clearly add to the appeal of a holiday taken within one's own country this year,\" said the consortium's chief executive, Peter Hancock.\n\"For luxury hotels in the UK, we believe there is huge pent-up demand that is just waiting for the restrictions to be eased. \n\"It could be a brilliant summer for domestic tourism, marking a desperately-needed return to profitability in our sector.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The EU and the UK-based Covid vaccine maker AstraZeneca have vowed to work together to resolve a bitter row over supply shortages to the bloc.\nAstraZeneca had agreed to deliver millions of doses in January-March but then said significantly fewer jabs would arrive on time. It blamed production problems at European plants.\nThe EU is demanding the firm divert jabs from the UK.\nThe UK government has said there \"will be no interruption\" to UK supply.\nCabinet Minister Michael Gove said it was \"critical\" to make sure that the \"schedule that has been agreed and on which our vaccine has been based goes ahead\". \nThe EU signed a deal with AstraZeneca in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more, but the UK-Swedish company has reported production delays at plants in the Netherlands and Belgium.\nAstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said production was \"basically two months behind where we wanted to be\".\nUK factories have not experienced problems.\nOn Thursday, scientific adviser to the UK government Sir Jeremy Farrar urged against vaccine nationalism, saying \"it doesn't serve anybody to have these fights over vaccine supply\". \nThe contract between the EU and AstraZeneca contains a confidentiality clause - but the EU has asked the company to release the details nevertheless.\nThe EU says the shortfall is greater than previous reports suggested. Instead of receiving around 100 million doses before the end of March, they are now expecting 25 million, one official said on Wednesday.\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine, developed with Oxford University, has not yet been approved by the EU, although this is expected on Friday.\nThe EU has been criticised for the slow rollout of inoculations for its population of around 450 million. \nIt has a much bigger vaccine deal with US-German vaccine-maker Pfizer-BioNTech but it is also facing delays in supplies.\nThe dispute comes as countries globally race to get their hands on vaccines to protect populations against Covid-19 and deal with the fallout of the pandemic. \nAfter crisis talks on Wednesday between the EU and AstraZeneca, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides expressed regret over the \"continued lack of clarity on the delivery schedule\".\n\"We will work with the company to find solutions and deliver vaccines rapidly for EU citizens,\" she tweeted.\nAn AstraZeneca spokesman said the company had \"committed to even closer co-ordination to jointly chart a path for the delivery of our vaccine over the coming months\".\nBefore the talks, Ms Kyriakides insisted that UK factories were part of the EU's deal with the company.\nIn an interview on Tuesday with Italian newspaper La Repubblica, AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said the contract compelled it to make its \"best effort\", rather than obliging it to meet a set deadline for delivery of the vaccines.\nMs Kyriakides said this characterisation of the deal was \"not correct or acceptable\".\nShe added that the EU rejected \"the logic of first-come first-serve\". \n\"That may work at the neighbourhood butcher's but not in contracts, and not in our advanced purchase agreements.\"\nMs Kyriakides appeared to be responding to Mr Soriot, who said that the UK had signed its contract with AstraZeneca three months before the EU and that this extra time had been used to \"fix all the glitches we experienced\" regarding the UK.\nThe EU had hoped that, as soon as approval was given, delivery would start straight away, with some 80 million doses arriving in the 27 nations by March.\nHowever the delays reported by AstraZeneca have dented that hope.\nItaly was among the countries threatening to sue over the delays. \nOfficials have not confirmed publicly how big the shortfall will be, but Reuters news agency reported that deliveries would be reduced to 31 million in the first quarter of this year.\nThe EU has also ordered 2.3 billion doses of vaccines from four other companies, of which only those of Pfizer/BioNTech (600 million) and Moderna (160 million) have been approved.\nPfizer has not been able to supply the 12.5 million vaccines it promised the EU by the end of 2020, saying last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeks because of work to increase capacity at its Belgian processing plant.\nAs a result of delays, Spanish officials said the Madrid region was halting almost all vaccinations for two weeks and supplies in Catalonia were also threatened.\nThe EU has threatened to restrict the exports of vaccines made within the bloc to deal with the shortfall."

      "text": "Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 350 million confirmed cases and more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. \nThe US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. \nVery few places have been left untouched. \nThe latest available data for the total number of cases in France since the start of the pandemic is from 16 January. \nIn the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University.

      "text": "People wishing to travel out of the UK will first be required to declare their reason for travel and prove it is essential, the home secretary has said.\nPriti Patel said declarations would be checked by carriers and there would be increased police at airports and ports.\nThe PM said earlier that UK nationals and residents returning from \"red list\" Covid hotspots would have to quarantine in government-provided hotels.\nBut Labour described the measures as \"too little, too late\".\nShadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said protecting the UK's borders was one of the key areas where the government had \"fallen short\" and he was \"deeply concerned\" the latest measures were \"yet another example of this - too little, too late\".\nHe added proposals to limit hotel quarantine to the specific \"red list\" of countries did \"not go anywhere near far enough\", adding the measures left \"huge gaps\" in the UK's defences against emerging variants of the virus.\nIt comes as a further 1,725 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported in the UK on Wednesday, as well another 25,308 new infections, according to the government dashboard.\nThe data also shows that up to and including 26 January, more than seven million people have received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine.\nIn a statement to the House of Commons on Wednesday, Ms Patel said England's lockdown rules were \"clear [that] people should be staying at home unless they have a valid reason to leave. Going on holiday is not a valid reason.\"\nShe said the new rule would require people wishing to leave the UK to go abroad to first \"make a declaration for why they need to travel\", which would then be \"checked by carriers prior to departure\".\nMs Patel said: \"Anyone who doesn't have a valid reason for travel will be directed to return home or they will face a fine.\"\nUnder the national lockdown, people must only travel abroad for essential reasons. \nThese are the same as the \"reasonable excuses\" for domestic travel, including:\nShe said it was \"clear that there are still too many people coming in and out of our country each day\" and other border measures would be toughened up to \"reduce passenger flow\" and protect the UK's \"world-leading\" vaccination programme.\nPolice checks at home addresses will be increased to ensure arrivals are complying with self-isolation rules, and the UK will continue to refuse entry to non-UK citizens from \"red list\" countries which were already subject to the travel ban.\nThe list of travel exemptions would also be \"urgently\" reviewed, she added, to make sure \"only the most important and with exceptional reasons are included\".\nEarlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that UK nationals and residents returning from 30 high-risk countries would have to quarantine in government-provided hotels.\nThe measures will apply to people coming from most of South America, southern Africa and Portugal, amid concern over new variants of the virus. Most overseas visitors from those countries are already barred from entering the UK. \nBritish nationals and those with residency rights who arrive from high-risk countries will be required to quarantine in a hotel at their own expense for up to 10 days, in a bid to improve compliance with self-isolation rules. \nKeri McMenamin was returning to the country with her husband and two children after securing a job offer - leaving the UK in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic last year.\n\"It is literally luck of the draw,\" the 38-year-old said after securing her family's place in Australia's 14-day quarantine system. \"You didn't know what to expect.\" Having done some research, Keri discovered Facebook groups busy with people relaying their experiences of quarantine.\n\"A lot of people were saying, 'Look, just expect the worst and then whatever you get is a bonus.'\"\nIn the end, the family was given an interconnecting room. But the windows were sealed and their time outside limited to 20-minute stints every two to three days.\nMr Johnson told the House of Commons on Wednesday that arrivals who could not be refused entry would be required to isolate in government provided accommodation, such as hotels, \"without exception\".\nThese arrivals would be escorted from the airport and \"transported directly into quarantine\", with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) working to set up these facilities \"as quickly as possible\", he said.\nMs Patel said the DHSC would \"set out further details\" on the hotel quarantine policy next week.\nIan Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, told the Commons that the Scottish and Welsh governments wanted \"to go further\" than what the UK government was proposing on quarantine measures, and challenged the PM to \"stop his half measures\" and bring in \"stricter enforcement on international travel\".\nA spokesman for the Welsh government said \"the need for a joint approach\" to border measures had been agreed between the UK's four nations and the Republic of Ireland, but it did not believe the approach outlined by the UK government went \"far enough\".\n\"Further discussions on the details of the proposals will take place as soon as possible,\" he added.\nIn response to the government's announcement, Airport Operators Association chief executive Karen Dee welcomed the news that the new hotel quarantine policy would only apply to a limited number of countries, but questioned what \"additional public health benefit\" it would have, given strict travel rules were recently introduced.\nShe called on the government to set out \"when and how we can ease all these measures safely and provide people with reassurance that travel will be possible again in the future\".\nAt the moment, incoming travellers have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test on departure, taken in the previous 72 hours. Then they still have to quarantine for up to 10 days, although this can be done at home.\nThose who do not comply will face a fine of \u00a3500, with Border Force officials carrying out spot checks. \nIn England, the self-isolation period can be cut short with a second negative test after five days. \nQuarantine rules are set separately in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland but have tended to differ only slightly.\nHotel quarantine is already in use in countries including New Zealand and Australia. \nAre you a UK national in one of the countries affected?

      "text": "Bird flu has been confirmed in pheasants at a premises in north Wales, the Welsh Government has said.\nThe Chief Veterinary Officer for Wales confirmed the presence of the H5N8 strain at a premises in Penysarn near Amlwch on Anglesey.\nThe Welsh Government said a temporary control zone had been immediately imposed around the site.\nMortality of birds on the premises is high and all those surviving in the affected group will be culled.\nThis is the first confirmation of the disease in Wales in the winter of 2020-21, the government said.\nIt follows confirmation of several outbreaks of Avian Influenza in other parts of the UK this winter. \nThe temporary control zone came into force on 27 January at 21:00 GMT and will run until the declaration is withdrawn or amended by further declaration, the Welsh Government said. \nNew measures came into force in Wales, England and Scotland on 14 December, making it a legal requirement for all bird keepers to keep their birds in enclosures and to follow strict biosecurity measures. \nThe Food Standards Agency has said on the basis of the current scientific evidence, avian influenza poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. \n\"This case of Avian Influenza in pheasants on Anglesey serves to reinforce the need for all keepers of poultry and other captive birds to practice the very highest levels of biosecurity,\" said Christianne Glossop, the Chief Veterinary Officer for Wales. \nPoultry keepers with more than 50 birds must be on the poultry register, and those with fewer are strongly advised to register their birds to enable disease control. \nIt means they will be immediately informed in the event of an avian disease outbreak.\nBird flu, or avian flu, is an infectious type of influenza that spreads among birds. \nThe NHS says it can affect humans - but only in very rare cases. \nTo date there have been no cases of humans being infected with avian influenza in the UK, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) said. \nBird flu is spread by close contact with an infected bird, whether it is dead or alive.\nThere are two forms of the virus - high pathogenicity (HPAI) and low pathogenicity (LPAI), The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says.\nPathogenicity indicates the severity of the disease if the bird contracts the virus."

      "text": "The once-mighty iceberg A68a looks to be in its death throes.\nThe largest fragment from a block of Antarctic ice that originally measured some 5,800 sq km (2,240 sq miles) in area has suffered another major split.\nSatellite imagery shows at least two segments drifting close together about 135km south-east of the British territory of South Georgia. They will no doubt soon move further apart.\nFor more than three years, A68a was the biggest iceberg in the world.\nAt its greatest extent, it was about a quarter of the size of Wales - or New Jersey or Israel. \nBut warmer climes and more aggressive seas gradually pulled it apart as it moved northwards away from Antarctica into the South Atlantic.\nIcebergs are named in sequence, with the prefix letter denoting the quadrant of the white continent from where they calved, with the number recording their position in that sequence. \nEach subsequent major fragment to come off the original block then gets a lettered suffix. \nBefore Thursday, this nomenclature process had got up to A68f. After this latest split, the larger portion will retain the name A68a with the smaller one getting the new name of A68g.\nThe US National Ice Center, which oversees the naming system, issued a release on the topic late on Thursday.\nTowards the end of last year, A68a looked from space like a huge pointing hand. Its still significant bulk prompted fears that it could disrupt life on South Georgia should it become grounded just offshore in shallow water.\nThe concern was that the presence of such a large obstacle might disrupt the foraging behaviour of the island's many penguins and seals.\nWith the latest disintegration event, the danger of this scenario seems to have passed.\nA major question now is whether the scientific expedition that was aiming to study the iceberg will have anything left to observe by the time it arrives on site.\nResearchers will soon board the British Royal Research Ship James Cook in the Falkland Islands and sail east towards South Georgia.\nThey have other, unrelated investigations to pursue as well, but they were hoping to place some autonomous vehicles around A68a to learn more about its impacts on the environment. \nTheir study subject has got considerably smaller since the expedition was announced in mid-December."

      "tags": "France,Coronavirus vaccines,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The EU has urged pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca to supply it with more doses of its Covid-19 vaccine from UK plants, amid a row over shortages.\nThe company has infuriated the bloc by saying it can deliver only a fraction of the doses it promised for the first quarter of the year.\nIt blames production issues at European plants, but the EU says doses made elsewhere should make up the shortfall.\nThe EU has been criticised for the slow rollout of its vaccinations.\nThe contract between the EU and AstraZeneca contains a confidentiality clause but the EU has asked the company to release the details nevertheless.\nReports said last week that the EU would get 60% fewer doses of the vaccine than promised for January-March 2021.\nThe EU reiterated its position after the two sides met on Wednesday evening to try to resolve the issue.\nHealth Commissioner Stella Kyriakides tweeted that the EU regretted the \"continued lack of clarity on the delivery schedule\".\n\"We will work with the company to find solutions and deliver vaccines rapidly for EU citizens,\" she said.\nAn AstraZeneca spokesman said the company had \"committed to even closer co-ordination to jointly chart a path for the delivery of our vaccine over the coming months\".\nPfizer/BioNTech, which has an even bigger vaccine-production deal with the EU, is also experiencing delays. \nFrench drug maker Sanofi has announced that it will help produce 125 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab by the end of the year.\nThe company will allow Germany-based BioNTech to use its facilities in Frankfurt from July, Sanofi said in a statement, having delayed the development of its own vaccine.  \nAt a news conference earlier on Wednesday, Ms Kyriakides said UK factories, which have not experienced problems, were part of its deal with the company and had to deliver.\n\"The 27 European Union member states are united that AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments in our agreements,\" she said.\nIn an interview on Tuesday with Italian newspaper La Repubblica, AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said the contract compelled it to make its \"best effort\", rather than obliging it to meet a set deadline for delivery of the vaccines.\nMs Kyriakides said this characterisation of the deal was \"not correct or acceptable\", and called on the company to be \"open and transparent\" about its production of vaccines.\n\"We signed an advanced purchase agreement for a product which at the time did not exist and which still today is not yet authorised and we signed it precisely to ensure that the company builds a manufacturing capacity to produce the vaccine early so that they can deliver a certain volume of doses the day that it is authorised,\" she said.\nShe added that the EU rejected \"the logic of first-come first-serve\". \n\"That may work at the neighbourhood butcher's but not in contracts, and not in our advanced purchase agreements.\"\nShe appeared to be responding to Mr Soriot, who said that the UK had signed its contract with AstraZeneca three months before the EU and that this extra time had been used to \"fix all the glitches we experienced\" regarding the UK.\nMeanwhile, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"I'm confident of our supplies and we'll keep rolling out vaccines as fast we possibly can. \n\"I am very pleased at the moment that we have the fastest rollout of vaccines in Europe by some way.\"\nIn a nutshell, here is why EU officials are furious with AstraZeneca. They say the contract between them and the pharmaceutical giant clearly stipulates that the two main vaccine production factories in the UK are to be classed as primary manufacturing sites, and the production sites in Belgium and the Netherlands are secondary priorities.\nThe vaccine production issues are in Belgium and the Netherlands (they have been producing lower yields). So, this is a no-brainer to EU officials - the UK sites should be used to transport the vaccines across the continent.\nAnd today's impromptu news conference by the EU's Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides shows that any tolerance of the company's previous explanations has worn thin. \nIn fact, EU officials point out to me that EU money went into upgrading the facilities in the UK and that they fully expected it to be operational for them. This has turned into a deeply unpleasant row, and sets the stage for a difficult meeting with the UK-Swedish company.\nThe EU signed a deal with AstraZeneca in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more, but the company has reported production delays at two plants, one in the Netherlands and one in Belgium.\nMr Soriot said production was \"basically two months behind where we wanted to be\".\nItaly was among the countries threatening to sue over the delays. \nThe AstraZeneca vaccine has not yet been approved by the EU, although the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to give it the green light on Friday.\nThe EU had hoped that, as soon as approval was given, delivery would start straight away, with some 80 million doses arriving in the 27 nations by March.\nOfficials have not confirmed publicly how big the shortfall will be, but Reuters news agency reported that deliveries would be reduced to 31 million - a cut of 60% - in the first quarter of this year.\nThe EU has also ordered 2.3 billion doses of vaccines from four other companies, of which only those of Pfizer/BioNTech (600 million) and Moderna (160 million) have been approved.\nPfizer has not been able to supply the 12.5 million vaccines it promised the EU by the end of 2020, saying last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeks because of work to increase capacity at its Belgian processing plant.\nAs a result of delays, on Wednesday Spanish officials said the Madrid region was halting almost all vaccinations for two weeks and supplies in Catalonia were also threatened.\nThe EU has threatened to restrict the exports of vaccines made within the bloc to deal with the shortfall.\nHave you been affected by vaccine supply issues?

Other popular destinations were India (54,000), Qatar (38,000) and Vietnam (36,000).\nThe new additions to the UK's \"red list\" means travel is now banned from 33 countries. \nFrom 04:00 on Friday all arrivals who have in the 10 days before their arrival in the UK been in these countries will have to self-isolate immediately, along with their households, and will not be eligible to use test to release - where people can leave quarantine early with a negative test after five days. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said passengers allowed to enter the UK would need proof of a negative test and a completed passenger locator form before arrival, or could face two \u00a3500 fines. \nBritish nationals currently in the UAE should make use of the commercial options available if they wish to return to the UK, the Department for Transport said. \nIndirect commercial routes that will enable British and Irish nationals and residents to return to the UK continue to operate.\nDubai Airport said all direct flights due to arrive in the UK after 13:00 GMT on Friday had been suspended and it told passengers booked on those flights not to travel to the airport. \nEtihad Airways also said all its passenger flights to the UK would be suspended from that time until further notice and it was working with affected customers to rearrange their travel plans. \nIt comes after the government announced a tightening of travel rules on Wednesday. \nHome Secretary Priti Patel said that people wishing to travel out of the UK will first be required to declare their reason for travel and prove it is essential.\nPolice checks at home addresses will be increased to ensure arrivals are complying with self-isolation rules.\nThe home secretary criticised influencers for \"showing off about which parts of the world they are in\", along with people who turned up at London's St Pancras station with skis.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson also announced that UK nationals and residents returning from red list countries would be required to quarantine in government-provided hotels, though the policy has not yet been implemented.\nOn Thursday, a further 1,239 deaths in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were recorded.

But it's sparked a political row, with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saying she's \"not ecstatic\" about the visit and questioning whether it's \"essential\", as required by Covid travel rules. \nThe EU and Covid vaccine maker AstraZeneca are vowing to work together to resolve a row over supply problems that have seen Brussels demand the company divert stocks from the UK. After \"constructive\" talks, Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides says the EU will \"work with the company to find solutions\", while AstraZeneca is committing to \"even closer co-ordination\". UK PM Boris Johnson says he's \"confident of our supplies\".\nScientists behind a study tracking coronavirus in England say there are signs of a \"shallow decline\" in infection levels but they remain high.

It brings the Republic of Ireland's death toll to 3,120.\nThe Irish Department of Health also confirmed 1,335 more Covid-19 cases.\nSpeaking at the weekly health news conference on Wednesday, Mr Swann said the pandemic had caused \"destruction\" and left \"heartbreak in its wake\".\n\"Staying at home is making a difference. The R-number has been moving in the right direction,\" he said.\n\"We have to sustain and build on that progress.\"\nThe reproductive rate of the virus - known as the R rate, measures the infection rate of Covid-19 and had risen to about 1.8 after Christmas relaxations.\nIt has been falling since lockdown restrictions were introduced on 26 December, and Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said NI's R-number for hospital admissions has now fallen back below one.\nBut he warned that the pressure on the system was still significant and would continue for several more weeks.\nHe added that there would need to be a \"sustained\" drop in the figures before relaxations of the lockdown could be considered by the executive.\nIt has also been confirmed that the number of people in Northern Ireland who have received their first Covid-19 now stands at 168,140.\nMore than 50,000 people aged over 80 have been vaccinated.\nOn the payment to health workers, Mr Swann said it would \"not be without its challenges\" but that he valued all staff in the health service.\n\"For some people, especially some of our lower paid workers, it may in fact have an adverse impact on their social security payments or supports that recipients may be claiming,\" he added.\n\"I have written to the ministers of finance and communities asking them to urgently consider the issue and to engage with the tax and benefit authorities in Great Britain to request that these payments are excluded from consideration in this regard.\"\nThere will also be a one-off payment of \u00a32,000 for all non-salaried students on clinical placements in the health service.\nMr Swann added that he intends to provide a one-off payment for carers as well, describing them as \"among the greatest unsung heroes\" of the pandemic.\nBut he said: \"There is still more work to be done in this regard and it will be significantly more complex to administer than the staff payment.\"\nKevin McAdam, who is from Unite the union, said the \"recognition payments\" will be allocated with assurances that this will not affect pay negotiations with healthcare workers.\nMr McAdam welcomed that health care workers and non-salaried students on placements will be \"receiving something more tangible than applause\".\n\"The student payment is a recognition payment, it does not solve the problems around whether student placements should be paid, I think that is an argument for another day.\"\nMeanwhile, a senior Department of Finance official has warned there is \"a higher than usual risk\" of some \u00a3430m unspent by the NI Executive being returned to the Treasury.\nMinisters must submit further funding bids, or risk it being handed back at the end of the financial year.\nA department official, Jeff McGuinness, said the Treasury was being pressed to show flexibility in carrying unspent money over but added that it was \"imperative\" Stormont pressed ahead, rather then rely on agreement from Treasury.\nHe said the other devolved administrations were also asking the Treasury for similar levels of carry-forward of unspent fiscal allocations."

It is a great step towards the realisation of human rights of all human beings,\" Karolina Pawlowska from the Ordo Iuris international law centre told the BBC.\n\"This also means there will no longer be discrimination against children who are sick or disabled,\" she said, adding that the court's ruling was in line with the Polish constitution and UN treaties on the rights of the child.\nPoland already had some of Europe's most restrictive abortion laws, and around 1,000 legal terminations are performed each year.\nAn estimated 200,000 women have abortions illegally or travel abroad for the procedure."

      "tags": "Comedy,Adoption",
      "text": "Comedian Dara \u00d3 Briain has revealed his recent search for his birth mother.\nThe 48-year-old spoke publicly for the first time about his adoption at an early age on Wednesday evening, at The Irish Times Winter Nights festival.\n\u00d3 Briain noted at the online event how he'd enjoyed a happy childhood in Bray with his \"supportive\" parents.\nBut after being inspired by the film Philomena he tracked down his biological mother, who told him his adoption \"was built on shame\".\n\"I talked to my birth mother about it today, and I said, 'Look, did you want this?' and she said, 'There was no choice in this',\" said the Mock the Week host.\n\"The whole thing was built on shame and expediency and a feeling of, just get this done.\"\nThe stand-up comedian and broadcaster underlined he came from an \"unbelievably content family background\", and that his family were happy to discuss his adoption, but that the subject just didn't come up that often.\n\"Being adopted is a state of knowing you're adopted, then it not being mentioned for ages,\" he explained. \"And then at a point in later life going, 'Hang on, am I adopted?'\n\"I remember my father coming to London for lunch, and we had one of those conversations where you just clear the decks on everything. I told him, 'I seem to remember knowing this', and he said, 'Yeah, but it's not a secret. I quit telling you because, you know, why would you keep saying it?'\nIt was only after seeing the Oscar-nominated Philomena - starring Dame Judi Dench as Irishwoman Philomena Lee embarking on a quest to find her adopted son, with the help of journalist Martin Sixsmith, played by Steve Coogan - that \u00d3 Briain decided to start his own search.\n\"Maybe [my birth mother] might want to know how it turned out,\" he added. \"And maybe it's our responsibility to go, 'That worked out \u2026 I did end up in a stable home, and you should be grand about that'.\"\nHe has now met his birth mother and various biological siblings, but is yet to meet the whole family due to the pandemic restrictions.\nWhile the process of searching for his birth mother was largely a  \"positive\" one, the TV funnyman did say the bureaucracy of it all was \"unnecessarily hard\".\nUnder Irish law, the rights of the mother to privacy override the rights of the adopted child to find out who they are.\nDuring the interview, \u00d3 Briain lifted up pages of adoption files, which had the word \"redacted\" on them.\nHe ultimately sourced his own birth certificate, which he admitted was a nerve-wracking moment.\n\"I wanted to find a quiet moment to open this document. I remember finding it and reading it for the first time. It's an elemental piece of paper. It's a huge document to get in your hand,\" he continued.\n\"I wasn't crying or anything like that, but it was still... that this other person is me.\"\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

It is the only way forward.\"\nShe added she \"remains absolutely confident that we will get justice for Harry\".\nThe Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab raised the case with the new US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in their telephone conversation on Wednesday.\nA spokesman for the Foreign Office said it believed the US's refusal to extradite Mrs Sacoolas \"amounts to a denial of justice\".\nBut State Department spokesman Ned Price said: \"The United States government has declined the United Kingdom's request for extradition of a US citizen involved in a tragic vehicle accident that occurred in the United Kingdom.\n\"Our decision in that regard was final.\n\"At the time the accident occurred, and for the duration of her stay in the UK, the US citizen driver in this case had immunity from criminal jurisdiction.\"\nMrs Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence official based at RAF Croughton, was charged with causing death by dangerous driving.\nBut a Home Office extradition request was refused by Donald Trump's secretary of state Mike Pompeo in January last year.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Cardiff,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The family of a 40-year-old mother-of-five who died with coronavirus have urged people to respect lockdown rules.\nKaren Hobbs had a heart attack and died, weeks after testing positive for Covid-19.\nThe former EasyJet cabin crew member developed symptoms a week before Christmas, was not able to get out of bed and started struggling to breathe.\nShe was taken to hospital and died on 19 January.\nKaren's sister Rachel Hobbs said her normally healthy sister became very ill over Christmas.\n\"She just looked dreadful, Christmas Day she was laid up in bed, she couldn't do anything,\" she said.\n\"I knew she was really bad but I'd never seen anybody like that before, it was shocking, for someone that healthy to be barely able to walk to a car is quite shocking.\"\nOn 2 January, Karen was put into an induced coma.\n\"She was really terrified, she said 'I need to come out of this and see my children again'. She never came out of it,\" her sister added.\nThe family were told Karen's organs were beginning to fail and she was \"going downhill\" about a week before she died, and they were allowed to visit.\n\"She did look a little bit better, she had more colour, she was quite puffy - swelling and a bit of a rash on her. Her lungs were struggling, so we came home a little bit shocked.\n\"They started feeding her in a tube and were able to move her, I thought perhaps she's recovering a little bit and then I had the phone call to say that she'd gone.\n\"Her body just couldn't take it any more. I don't think it's sunk in. I think the children are still in a bit of shock as well, I thought she would come out of it but she just had it so severe. \"\nRachel said her sister, from Cardiff, was healthy with no underlying conditions.\n\"She didn't go anywhere - she did online shopping, she was in the house - so we don't even know where it could have come from, she was one of the ones who stayed safest.\n\"It's just shocking to think a young mum of five is no longer here. They've lost their mum and they lost their grandfather and nan a couple of years ago so they must feel 'who will be next'?\nRachel said her sister was a fantastic mother to her five children, aged 14, 11, nine, eight and four.\n\"I don't think the youngest understands, I think she thinks mummy's still just in the hospital.\n\"She was a very hands-on mum, she spent a lot of time with the children. She'd sit and play with them for hours, sit and colour, she was always there for them.\"\nRachel added that Karen had no patience with people who broke lockdown rules: \"She used to get quite annoyed about people who broke the rules and she wasn't slow on coming forward, she'd say it as well.\n\"It just goes to show how bad this virus is. She would say 'make sure you follow the rules because nobody is safe, it is real this virus, stay at home and only go out when you need to'.\"\nIn the days since Karen's death a fundraising page has been set up by friends to support her children and their dad, and has raised more than \u00a320,000.\n\"I'm absolutely amazed at how generous people have been and how kind people have been, the community has come together and I think she'd be proud too that it's raising awareness about the pandemic.\n\"That'll help the children going forward now. Out of a bad thing, it's been nice people getting in touch, kind words, messages, little things about what she was like.\""

We've temporarily extended validity of codes and added extra capacity. Bear with us while we get this sorted.\"\nThe Department of Health this week announced a twin track approach to accelerating NI's vaccination programme.\nIt said this would ensure more people can take up the offer of vaccination.\nGPs will be focusing on the 70 plus age group, while the seven regional vaccination centres will in parallel be offering offer vaccination appointments to 65-69 year-olds.\nAs of Monday, 159,642 people in Northern Ireland had received a first coronavirus vaccine dose.\nThe development comes as Northern Ireland's Department of Health has recorded 16 more coronavirus-related deaths, taking its toll so far to 1,779.\nA further 527 people have tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours.\nThere are 775 people in Northern Ireland's hospitals who are being treated for the virus - 68 of them are in intensive care and the number of people requiring ventilators has risen to 56.\nSince Monday, there has been a reduction in the number of inpatients, patients receiving intensive care treatment, and the number of patients ventilated.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, 54 more Covid-19 related deaths were recorded on Wednesday. It brings the Republic of Ireland's death toll to 3,120.\nThe Irish Department of Health also confirmed 1,335 more Covid-19 cases."

      "text": "Black MPs from across the parties have joined together in a video encouraging people to get the coronavirus vaccine.\nThe Office for National Statistics has found all ethnic minority groups, other than Chinese, are more likely to die from the virus than white people.\nBut a study suggests black people over 80 are half as likely to get the vaccine.\nCampaigners have urged the government to do more to encourage those who are reluctant to get the jab. \nJabeer Butt, chief executive of the Race Equality Foundation, says the government needs to get data on \"who has been offered the vaccine, who has taken it up and use that to target messages\".\nThe government says it is working closely with minority ethnic groups who have questions about vaccines including working with faith and community leaders.\nIn the clip, tweeted by Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi, Labour MP David Lammy and Conservative James Cleverly speak about how they have lost relatives to the virus. \nLabour's former Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott says \"MPs don't agree all the time\" and her Labour colleague Dawn Butler adds \"but on taking the vaccine we do\". \nAnother Labour MP, Clive Lewis, says \"We understand the genuine history of mistrust some black people will rightfully feel.\"\nAnd Conservative MP Adam Afriyie says the vaccine has been \"robustly tested by some of the world's best scientists\".\nThe clip ends with the MPs pledging to take the vaccine when they are offered it. \nConservative MP Bim Afolami, who took part in the video, told the BBC: \"I will do anything I can to help increase the take-up of vaccines amongst black and other ethnic minority populations. \n\"As a son of a doctor and a pharmacist, I know the real stresses and strains that the NHS is under, and the fastest way we relieve that pressure, save lives, and get our economy and society back to normal, is for everybody to take the vaccine.\"\nAnd Labour's shadow women and equalities minister Marsha de Cordova said \"Black people are more likely to die from Covid-19 than white people, so it's really worrying that so many in the black community are reluctant to have the vaccine. \n\"We understand this lack of trust may stem from structural racism in our history, education and health services but we also know that the virus thrives on these racial inequalities, and the only way to stop it now is to have the vaccine.\"\nEarlier this week British Asian celebrities - including comedian Romesh Ranganathan and cricketer Moeen Ali - made a similar video urging people to get the vaccine. \nThe OpenSafely study by the University of Oxford and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found of the million of those over 80 but not living in a care home, 43% of the white people had been given their first dose, compared with 30% of the Bangladeshi and Pakistani people and 21% of the black people. \nThe study - which was based on more than 20 million patient records in England - also found that people living in deprived areas or those with mental-health conditions or learning disabilities were also less likely to receive the vaccination.\nThe authors of the study, which is yet to be peer-reviewed, said the findings of discrepancies between ethnic groups are \"concerning\".\n\"It requires action, and further investigation; possible drivers include systematic barriers to healthcare access, and vaccine hesitancy amongst certain groups; it may also only arise in the very earliest stages of this new vaccination programme,\" they said.\nThe BBC's community affairs correspondent Adina Campbell says there are many reasons why some are fearful including racial inequalities which already exist, a flurry of misinformation which appears to be targeting those groups on social media and a lack of trust toward those in public health care."

      "text": "Black people over the age of 80 were half as likely as their white peers to have been vaccinated against Covid by 13 January, a large study suggests.\nThis is despite the fact black people are four times more likely to die with Covid-19 than their white counterparts. \nPeople living in deprived areas or who have severe mental-health conditions or learning disabilities were also less likely to have received a vaccination.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England. \nThe OpenSafely study, by the University of Oxford and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, found of the million people over 80, but not living in a care home:\nBangladeshi and Pakistani people are twice as likely to die with Covid-19 as their white counterparts. \nSeparate NHS England figures show that 82% of the 5.8 million first doses have gone to white people, 5% to people from an Asian background, 1.% to black people, and another 10% to people who don't state their ethnicity at all.\nBut these figures don't give any information on uptake among different ethnic communities in different age groups, such as the over-80s.\nBirmingham-based business owner Tru Powell told BBC Radio 5 Live of a \"lack of trust between the government and people of colour\".\n\"People of colour have been subject to institutionalised racism within the healthcare system,\" she said.\n\"We are five times more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act and four times more likely to die in childbirth.\"\nStudy author Dr Ben Goldacre said the gap between people belonging to different ethnic minorities was \"striking and widening\". \nIt was \"not clear what the drivers of that are,\" he said.\nBut there were clues from previous vaccination campaigns and surveys on Covid-vaccine hesitancy.\nEvidence presented to government outlined factors including \"perception of risk, low confidence in the vaccine, distrust, access barriers, inconvenience, socio-demographic context and lack of endorsement, lack of vaccine offer or lack of communication from trusted providers and community leaders\".\nThere may also be a geographical effect as the vaccine programme is not being rolled out at the same speed in every part of the country.\nAnd the team plans further analysis to look at differences within GP practices.\n\"It's really important to spot differences early and resolve them,\" Dr Goldacre said.\n\"It's been a heroically fast vaccine rollout programme.\n\"And it's very early days, so these differences may resolve.\"\nBut misinformation, some potentially maliciously targeted at certain communities, may also play a role.\nDr Samara Afzal told BBC Radio 5 Live there were \"various myths going around\".\n\"Some people think it's not gone through enough trials. Some people think it causes infertility, some people think it's not halal, it contains alcohol. There are various messages going around social media.\"\nBut the vaccine does not contain more than negligible amounts of alcohol - no more than could be found in a slice of bread.\nAnd the British Islamic Medical Association recommends those who are eligible have it.\nNone of the Covid vaccines in use contain live virus so there is no reason to believe they could affect fertility. \nIn fact some limited data has linked catching coronavirus to reducing, in particular male, fertility so the vaccine could be protective against this. \nTrials were set up and completed quickly because so many people's time and money were focused on the vaccines at once, allowing certain stages of testing to run in parallel.\nUS public-health expert Dr Theresa Chapple-McGruder compared it to cleaning a house - if lots of people with previous house-cleaning experience brought mops and buckets to help, it would be faster but no less meticulous - if anything the job might get done more thoroughly.\nAnd any issues not brought to light by the trials of tens of thousands of people are likely to be very rare and much more so than the known consequences of catching the coronavirus, which can include death, organ damage, loss of hearing, sight and taste and other long-term health problems."

She has previously apologised for the party.\nThe 30-year-old flew to Egypt for a private performance on 21 November. On her return the following day, she should have isolated for two weeks.\nInstead, she threw a birthday party in London, which violated lockdown rules that prevented households mixing indoors.\nMs Ora has said she \"deserved criticism\" for her actions, and would donate her fee from the concert to charity. Her team did not want to comment about the latest revelations, which emerged during a licence review for Casa Cruz.\nThe general manager at Casa Cruz, Scottie Bhattarai, told police he was contacted by a representative of Ms Ora on the day of the party.\nCharles Holland, representing the Met Police, told the committee hearing that Mr Bhattarai admitted he had been \"contacted by Ms Ora's representatives and offered \u00a35,000 for the use of the premises that evening\".\nIn a statement to police, Mr Bhattarai said he had accepted the offer \"because he was greedy\". He was \"fully aware the event breached coronavirus regulations\", Mr Holland said.\nMr Bhattarai said he began admitting guests at about 19:00 GMT. Between 15 and 20 people were at the venue at the party's peak, at about 21.00, he said.\nMr Holland said officers arrived at the venue after 21:10 but \"were not afforded access\".\nPolice said they found that Casa Cruz's CCTV hard drives were blank two days later, with no footage available from the previous month.\nOfficers said the devices had either been reformatted or the hard-drives had been replaced.\nThe venue is accused of breaching licensing rules by not allowing police into the premises and failing to provide them with CCTV footage. \nIt is also alleged that Casa Cruz locked fire doors during the party, a breach of health and safety regulations.\nThe licensing committee is considering whether to revoke the licence of the restaurant. \nMr Bhattarai is also subject to a criminal investigation, while four party-goers were issued fines at the time. Their identities have not been revealed.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel condemned Ms Ora's behaviour as \"wrong and irresponsible\".\n\"There are no excuses whatsoever,\" she added.\n\"We have had a tragic death toll in our country from coronavirus; we are seeing record numbers of people in hospital and a terrible strain on the NHS, and the message is to stay at home and save lives. \n\"So these celebrities and influencers should be thinking very, very hard about their own actions and what kind of message that sends out.\"\nCasa Cruz said it fired Mr Bharratai following the revelations.\nThe restaurant's parent company said it was upgrading the CCTV system so footage could not be tampered with in future, the committee heard.\nForty-four written submissions were made by local residents in support of Casa Cruz keeping its licence.\nA decision will be made at a later date.\nFor more London news follow on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel."

      "tags": "Tourism,Companies,Staycations,Hospitality industry,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "After the news that British residents arriving in England from Covid hotspots will have to quarantine in hotels, many would-be holidaymakers are thinking of opting for UK destinations this summer.\nUnderstandably, they don't want to undergo the \"managed isolation process\" requiring them to spend 10 days in a hotel on their return to the UK.\nBut there may be a shortage of the kind of UK accommodation they are looking for, say providers of holiday lets. \nFrom cottages to campsites, demand is on the increase. Even the UK's luxury hotels are expecting the move to give them a boost.\nSarah and Steve Jarvis, who run the Independent Cottages website listing more than 1,800 properties, say inquiries during the current lockdown in England are 300% up on the first lockdown in March to July 2020.\nHowever, they also point out that many properties still need to honour bookings that were rolled over from 2020 because of earlier virus curbs, restricting availability for new requests.\n\"People started the year with bookings already in the calendar,\" Sarah told the BBC. \"We're going to end up in a situation where we have demand outstripping supply again.\"\n\"It's almost like the perfect storm,\" adds Steve. \"People will be hesitant about going abroad with the new travel restrictions and the UK is looking like a very good option.\n\"People have got confidence in UK self-catering holidays, because the bookings are coming in thick and fast.\"\nIn normal times, says Sarah, people are looking for accommodation for an average of four people to go away on holiday together.\nBut at the moment, they are getting lots of inquiries for groups of up to nine people, as extended families or groups of friends seek to make up for the family Christmas celebrations they missed out on.\n\"Families are going to go away and they want to take their parents with them,\" Sarah says. \"It's a safe option for elderly relatives.\"\nUnusually, some are also booking ahead for next Christmas already.\n\"Straight after Boxing Day, people usually start thinking about summer holidays, but we're also seeing very early bookings for the festive season,\" says Steve.\nAnother holiday provider, holidaycottages.co.uk, says it has seen a sharp increase in demand since mid-January.\nThe firm's chief marketing officer, James Starkey, says: \"In the past week, bookings taken for May half-term onwards are up 39% compared to last year, with the summer holidays up 98%. \nWe do still have just over half of our properties available for seven-night breaks in the summer holidays but, with them booking more quickly this year, we anticipate another strong summer for the UK staycation industry.\"\nAt Trencreek Holiday Park in Newquay, Cornwall, there is definitely a pick-up in interest from holidaymakers.\nThe park offers a mixture of camping and self-catering accommodation, covering a wide range of travel needs.\n\"Since Monday, the phone's been getting a lot busier,\" says Julliette Hautot, who runs the business with her husband. \n\"The calls are on the up and it's definitely going to be busy for the summer,\" she told the BBC.\n\"Slots are filling up for July and August. There's not a lot left, especially for the school holidays.\"\nShe is also noticing more inquiries for September than usual, perhaps reflecting a feeling that pandemic restrictions will ease later rather than sooner.\nHotels are noticing the staycation trend as well. The Best Western chain has just done a survey of 6,000 of its UK customers and found that 90% of them felt safer holidaying in Britain this summer rather than abroad.\n\"With the worries around quarantine, we are now starting to see bookings landing for the big summer months coming through in the last 24 hours,\" spokesperson Andrew Denton told the BBC.\n\"The experience of last summer has taught people not to leave it to the last minute as Britain gets booked, so to book ahead and quit worrying about quarantine, which might impact an international trip.\"\nAt the upper end of the spectrum, the UK's luxury hotels are anticipating opportunities as a result of the hotel quarantine measures for international travel.\nPride of Britain Hotels, a collection of 50 of independently-owned luxury hotels including the Athenaeum in London's Mayfair, says the measures are set to benefit home-grown tourism.\n\"Anything that makes international travel more difficult will clearly add to the appeal of a holiday taken within one's own country this year,\" said the consortium's chief executive, Peter Hancock.\n\"For luxury hotels in the UK, we believe there is huge pent-up demand that is just waiting for the restrictions to be eased. \n\"It could be a brilliant summer for domestic tourism, marking a desperately-needed return to profitability in our sector.\""

      "text": "Stationery chain Paperchase has been bought out of administration in a deal rescuing up to 90 of its 127 stores.\nThe sale to a newly incorporated company, Aspen Phoenix NewCo, means that about 1,000 of its 1,500 employees will keep their jobs.\nPaperchase chief executive Ollie Raeburn said the deal was \"tough but necessary\" to secure the firm's future.\nHe said it had suffered from \"the cumulative impact of lockdowns and related restrictions\".\nThe second lockdown in November came at a crucial period for the firm, which makes a high proportion of its sales then.\nJust under half its sales, 40%, come from trade in November and December. \nOn 5 January, the firm filed a notice to appoint administrators, a move designed to give it breathing space from its creditors while it worked out a rescue plan. \nIn its latest announcement, Paperchase said the sale had been completed following the appointment of PwC as administrators.\nThe business has been sold in what is known as a pre-pack administration after seeing a collapse in sales due to the lockdowns and restrictions on the High Street. \nThis allows for continuation of the business and the ability to safeguard jobs while avoiding the need to liquidate the company.\nThe chain is the latest of a string of high-profile retailers to hit trouble in the past year. \nThe sector was already battling with the shift to online sales, coupled with rising costs, including rents and higher minimum wages. \nCoronavirus restrictions which shut non-essential shops piled on the pressure. \nPaperchase said that under its new ownership, it would remain \"an omni-channel business, albeit with a smaller, more relevant, retail footprint\"."
