      "tags": "Music",
      "text": "Irish President Michael D Higgins has led tributes to the founder of The Chieftains traditional Irish music group, Paddy Moloney, who has died.\nBorn in 1938, Mr Moloney grew up in a musical family in north County Dublin.\nA piper, tin whistle player and composer, he formed The Chieftains in 1962.\nPresident Higgins said people around the world inspired by Mr Moloney's music \"will have learnt with great sadness\" of his passing.\nHe said Mr Moloney's \"extraordinary skills\" were at the forefront of the renaissance of interest in Irish music.\n\"He brought a love of Irish music not just to the diaspora, but to all those across the world who heard his music and appreciated it for its own sake as it transcended all musical boundaries,\" he said.\nTaoiseach (Irish prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin thanked Mr Moloney for his \"massive contribution to the life of our nation\".\n\"The term 'legend' is regularly overused, but hard to think of any other way to describe this giant of Irish music and culture,\" he said.\nMusicians to pay tribute to the Chieftains founder include Colum Sands, Imelda May and Frances Black.\nGrammy award winning singer-songwriter Van Morrison tweeted: \"So sorry to hear of the passing of fellow Irish Musician Paddy Maloney.\n\"He was a great musical talent, we shared many laughs together and his legacy will endure.\"\nMr Moloney's first instrument was a plastic tin whistle, according to The Chieftains' official website.\nBy age eight, he was learning to play the uilleann pipes under pipe master, Leo Rowsome.\nThe Irish Traditional Music Archive (ITMA) said few could lay claim to the \"level of impact Paddy Moloney had on the vibrancy of traditional music throughout the world\".\nIn a statement on social media, ITMA said: \"Uilleann piper, tin whistle player, composer, arranger and leader of The Chieftains, Paddy made an enormous contribution to Irish traditional music, song and dance. \n\"What a wonderful musical legacy he has left us.\"\nIrish Tourism Minister Catherine Martin said Moloney's music was \"a source of pride and inspiration for all of us\". \n\"With the passing of Paddy Moloney, we have lost a giant of the national cultural landscape,\" she said. \n\"Through the Chieftains, he brought the joy of Irish music to a global audience. His music was a source of celebration and pride for all of us.\" \nSinger Imelda May said Mr Moloney \"made us all so proud of our heritage and brought such joyous energy.\n\"He was ours wasn't he. I'm honoured to have known and worked with not just a legend but a thoroughly lovely man.\"\nA former journalist who watched Paddy Moloney perform at a memorial service at Ground Zero for a banker who was killed in the 9/11 attacks said she had never forgotten the moment rescue workers and mourners stopped to listen to him play.\nGeorgina Brennan-Stynes, a former reporter for Irish American magazine, interviewed Mr Moloney after his performance to remember Matthew O'Mahony.\nMr Moloney was asked to play by Mr O'Mahony's widow who had described her husband as \"the Chieftains biggest fan\".\n\"Paddy felt he had to do it - he felt he could not walk away without leaving a piece of himself there, it was so beautiful,\" Ms Brennan-Stynes recalled.\nShe said a crowd of thousands listened to his \"haunting\" performance the day after Mr O'Mahony's funeral.\n\"If there could've been any comfort, it was that the music he played on his tin whistle came from his heart to theirs,\" she said.\n\"He was giving all of those people some kind of farewell, a lament - it was almost as if he was playing in a very small graveyard in a small part of Ireland for a very loved neighbour and he did that for thousands of people and he was compelled to do it.\nWriting in Irish American magazine in 2002, Ms Brennan-Stynes recalled Mr Moloney saying he hadn't rehearsed for the event and had instead been inspired in the moment.\n\"Then as I played I felt I saw them all - the faces, faces without images,\" he said at the time.\n\"The mechanics of the music disappeared and my heart went into it. I got the shivers up my back.\"\nIrish singer-songwriter Colum Sands shared his memories of Paddy Moloney on Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.\n\"I can't overemphasise the sense of detail and control he had,\" he said.\n\"He was so inventive in terms of his collaborations. You could go on for a long time with the people he played with - an orchestra in China to Van Morrison.\"\n\"He was such a huge influence in Irish music in giving it international confidence.\"\nIrish musician Frances Black posted on social media that she was \"deeply saddened to hear of the passing of the Great Paddy Moloney\".\n\"What a lovely talented gentle man. We'll miss his wonderful playing always, Sleep well Paddy,\" she said."

      "text": "Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been given a role with the United Nations as a special representative.\nWriting on Twitter, the ex-minister said the job would focus on helping Africa's economy recover from Covid. \nIt comes four months after Mr Hancock resigned from his cabinet post for breaking social distancing guidelines by kissing a colleague. \nThe Under Secretary General of the UN, Vera Songwe, praised his \"success\" in tackling the UK's pandemic response.\nIn a letter posted online by Mr Hancock, Ms Songwe said the \"acceleration of vaccines that has led the UK move faster towards economic recovery is one testament to the strengths that you will bring to this role, together with your fiscal and monetary experience\".\nThe announcement also comes on the day a report from MPs was published, claiming the government and its scientists' failure to do more to stop Covid spreading early in the pandemic was one of the country's worst public health failures.\nMr Hancock's official title will be \"UN special representative on financial innovation and climate change for the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa\". \nHis new role will be unpaid and he will continue as a Conservative MP.\nMr Hancock said he was \"honoured\" to be appointed and would help \"promote sustainable development\", alongside working on the economic recovery. \nMs Songwe said the UN had been working with people across the world on Africa's climate actions and resilient recovery - and that she wanted to appoint Mr Hancock \"given your global leadership, advocacy reach and in depth understanding of government processes through your various ministerial cabinet roles\".\nShe added: \"The role will support Africa's cause at the global level and ensure the continent builds forward better, leveraging financial innovations and working with major stakeholders like the G20, UK government and COP26.\"\nIn his acceptance letter, which he also posted on Twitter, Mr Hancock wrote: \"As we recover from the pandemic so we must take this moment to ensure Africa can prosper.\"\nThe chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, said it was a \"fascinating and important appointment\".\nHe added: \"Boosting the economies of Africa is one of the most essential tasks of this generation.\"\nMr Hancock announced his resignation in June after the Sun newspaper published pictures and a video of him and Gina Coladangelo - who were both married at the time with three children - kissing.\nThe newspaper said the images had been taken inside the Department of Health and Social Care on 6 May.\nFollowing the revelations, a number of Conservative MPs, as well as Labour and the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, had called for Mr Hancock to go.\nMs Coladangelo also left her role as a non-executive director at the DHSC.\nMr Hancock ended his 15-year marriage to his wife, Martha, and the relationship with Ms Coladangelo is understood to be a serious one."

      "tags": "Coronavirus public inquiry,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Welsh government,NHS Wales,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan has apologised for the mistakes made by the Welsh government in its initial handling of the pandemic.\nShe was responding to a report by MPs which said the UK's early response to the pandemic is one of the worst ever public health failures. \n\"I'm prepared to apologise to all of those who have suffered,\" she said.\nThe report said the slow move to lockdown led to a higher initial death toll than if ministers acted sooner.\nIt said the slow move into restrictions - backed by UK government scientists and adopted by the UK's central and devolved governments - was \"wrong\" and \"deliberate\".\nThe study, written by two House of Commons committees, claimed scientific advisers and government suffered \"a degree of group think\".\nWales and the rest of the UK went into lockdown on 23 March - while the policy was controlled by ministers in Cardiff, early on they acted alongside the Westminster government.\nThere were 2,289 deaths in Wales due to Covid, and 2,512 deaths involving Covid, in the first wave of the pandemic up to the end of July 2020. \nOpposition parties reiterated calls for a Wales-only public inquiry, with Plaid Cymru saying the Welsh government \"must take responsibility for its actions\".\nIn the Senedd, First Minister Mark Drakeford declined to say whether he agreed the early response was one of the worst ever public health failures in the UK, and said he had not read the report.\n\"I've been asked the question many times, 'Were there things that you would have done differently had you known then what you know now?' \" he said.\n\"We didn't know those things then, we were following the advice that we had at the time.\"\nHe said as \"our knowledge grew\" ministers have \"not hesitated to take our own decisions where we thought that was in the best interests of Wales\".\nThere have been a total of 8,262 deaths where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate up to 24 September this year.\nSpeaking at a press briefing, Ms Morgan said: \"Of course I'm prepared to apologise to all of those who have suffered during the pandemic. \n\"This was a new disease that we'd never seen before. None of us knew how it was going to impact, none of us knew how it was going to spread, none of us had any idea that it could be spread even without showing any symptoms.\"\nShe added: \"Of course we made mistakes at the beginning of that process, because of the lack of information and data and knowledge that we have now learned.\n\"I think we have a duty and responsibility to say sorry to people where we've made mistakes.\"\nBut the minister argued it would have been \"extremely difficult\" to have locked down Wales before England, because of the border and \"because furlough was not available\".\nShe said since then, the Welsh government has taken a \"far more cautious approach compared to that of the rest of the United Kingdom\".\nBut Ms Morgan denied that the Welsh government had suffered from group think - when a group of individuals reaches a consensus without critical reasoning.\nA decision to scrap community testing for coronavirus early in the pandemic was described by the report as a \"serious mistake\".\nWales, in common with the rest of the UK, took the same approach. Ms Morgan partly blamed this on a limitation on the number of tests available at the time.\nFigures showed that there were 157% more care home deaths from all causes than there would be normally in April 2020, with 1,171 in total.\nThe daughter of a man who died from Covid last year said it was \"good to have an apology\" but said it was \"slightly qualified\".\nCatherine Griffiths, whose father Harry Griffiths died with Covid in his Aberystwyth care home, told BBC Wales: \"They didn't know what was happening in the first wave but they knew what was happening in the second wave, my father died in the second wave.\n\"They should have protected people they should have acted and learned from countries in the Far East. While we were going into the second wave they were asking people to do quick tests before they enter care facilities, and we weren't doing that.\"\nMs Griffiths is part of the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru group, which is calling for a dedicated public inquiry for Wales into decisions made about the pandemic. \nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the report showed the \"fatalistic approach at the heart of this Westminster government\" but also called for a Welsh public inquiry.\nPlaid health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"The Welsh government must take responsibility for its actions - good and bad, and there should be no avoidance of detailed scrutiny.\"\nWelsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said: \"The pandemic was an unprecedented crisis and as these reports show decision-makers in government followed the science and evidence provided by experts.\"\nHe added the report shows \"why we need a Wales-specific Covid inquiry\".\nHowever Mark Drakeford argued in the Senedd that the report strengthens the argument for the Welsh \"experience to be properly investigated within the wider UK context\".\nThe first minister has backed a UK government inquiry, but has not ruled out a Wales-only effort if he is not satisfied with what is set up by the UK government.\nMr Drakeford told the Senedd he was yet to receive a reply to a letter to Communities Secretary Michael Gove on the 10 September setting out a \"series of tests\" the Welsh government would apply \"to give us confidence\".\nThe first minister said he was hoping to have a meeting with the prime minister in the coming days, and added he expects devolved governments to be \"properly involved\" in the appointment of the UK government's inquiry chair.\nDuring the press conference it was announced that the Welsh government had set a target of offering all 12 to 15-year-olds a Covid vaccine by the end of October.\nThe government also said all residents of care homes will have been offered a booster by the same date. \nDr Gill Richardson, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Vaccines, said she expected the majority of people over 50 or who have an underlying health condition to have been offered their booster by the end of the year. \nA Welsh government statement said the committees' report \"does not scrutinise decisions made by any of the devolved governments in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland\".\n\"Some actions and decisions in the pandemic response were taken at a UK level on a four-nations basis - we have always been open to working together where there are shared decisions and shared responses. \n\"We have followed the advice of our medical and scientific advisers and have taken a more cautious approach. Independent reports, by Audit Wales, have shown our approach to testing, for example, was less costly and more efficient than that taken by the UK government.\""

      "text": "People in Wales now need an NHS Covid pass to be able to legally attend big events or nightclubs.\nThey are compulsory for over-18s, and show people have either tested negative on a lateral flow test or are fully vaccinated against Covid.\nWales' rugby game against New Zealand on 30 October will be one of the first mass events to require Covid passes.\nSome nightclub bosses said they felt \"singled out\" by the rules, but other people said they felt reassured.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said the new scheme was \"vulnerable to abuse\" but the \"huge bulk of people\" will follow the new rules.\nAsked if people could falsify their lateral flow tests, Mr Drakeford said: \"It is vulnerable to people who want to abuse the system but that's why the law is there.\"\n\"I am quite sure the huge bulk of people will use the lateral flow test in the correct way,\" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain programme.\nHe also rejected claims the new Covid pass was a financial burden for businesses, adding: \"Nightclubs already have to check people for their age. \n\"I don't think the cost issue is a very significant one here.\"\nIn its autumn and winter plan Mr Drakeford's government has not ruled out extending the scheme if further action is needed to tackle Covid rates.\nHe suggested that could include using passes when going to care homes or visiting hospitals.\n\"If numbers in the community continue to rise... being able to show a Covid pass if you were going into a care home might be an extra defence,\" he said.\nWelsh Education Minister Jeremy Miles told BBC Politics Wales that public services were expected to face \"significant pressure\" this winter, and the pass would cut transmission of the virus.\nThe Senedd voted on the passes last Tuesday - a vote the Welsh government said will not be repeated, despite it passing by just one vote.\nAnyone who is over 16 and has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England, or has had a negative lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours, can get a pass.\nThey are compulsory for anyone over 18 to enter:\nThe Welsh government says any venue that can serve alcohol, is open between midnight and 0500, and where music is provided for dancing will need to check for passes.\nThat means it could cover other venues not traditionally considered nightclubs which have a late licence.\nVenues can either apply the pass rules from when they open their doors, or when they open their dancefloor.\nNegative tests will be self-certified but the Welsh government plans to make it illegal to fake a negative test.\nLarge events could also be allowed to check passes at random, rather than check every person who attends.\nThe NHS Covid Pass is available digitally but you need to register for an NHS login via the website.\nYou need to upload a photo of your ID. That can be a passport, full UK driving licence or full European driving licence. \nThis allows you to produce a Covid pass using a smart phone, computer or laptop.\nYour NHS Covid Pass includes a barcode. The expiry date refers to the barcode and will update automatically. It does not apply to your vaccination status.\nIn Wales, you cannot get the pass via the NHS app, as this is only valid in England.\nWales is not the first nation to introduce such a pass.\nIn France, people have had to prove they are fully vaccinated, have recently tested negative or recently recovered from Covid with a \"health pass\". That must be produced on entering cafes, restaurants or public transport.\nScotland is the only other UK nation to use them after they were introduced on 1 October.\nOne nightclub and bar in Denbighshire has decided to close earlier in the evening rather than dealing with the \"complexity\" of implementing Covid passes.\nMike Murray, manager of Bar 236 in Prestatyn, said the club used to stay open past midnight with live music and DJs, but would need extra staffing to police the system, and it was not worth it financially.  \n\"We always weighed up the situation, following the government guidelines to make it a safe and comfortable environment to drink in.\n\"We've even been keeping masks on and doing table service after the government advice changed because what's wrong with doing it a little longer to keep people comfortable?\"\nHe added he received a lack of guidance from Welsh government as to \"what passes would look like or where we could get one from if people asked\". \n\"We want people to come in and let common sense prevail: If you're unwell, don't come to the bar.\"\nThe decision to introduce Covid passes has very much split opinion, which was evident in the Senedd vote.\nGuto Brychan, chief executive of Cardiff music venue Clwb Ifor Bach, said the timing made things difficult as students had just returned to university and it is \"the busiest time of year\".\nHe said this was made more difficult because many students are from outside Wales and may not understand the law.\nMr Brychan said: \"One of the main concerns as well is that the Covid pass isn't uniform across the whole of the hospitality industry.\n\"It seems to have been specifically designed to target places that supply dancing or culture, but I'd argue the high risk activity here is the consumption of alcohol, not dancing.\n\"There'll be plenty of venues open as late as ourselves that will have as many people in them but won't have the restrictions that we have in place.\"\nLidi Staffurth is one of thousands of people who have been shielding during the pandemic due to a condition which makes them extremely vulnerable to Covid-19.\nShe said Covid passes would help reassure people who might feel uncertain about attending large events, adding she felt she had her \"freedom back\".\nMs Staffurth labelled it a \"brilliant idea\", not least because there are three young people in her family.\n\"If they're in large groups then we'll know they're around people who are double vaccinated, or at least free from Covid,\" she said.\n\"I think it's a fantastic idea and for a society at large it means people are looking after each other. \n\"I think some young people just don't care - they've had it with Covid, and I think we've all had it with Covid - but they live in their own little bubble and they don't really see beyond that bubble a lot.\n\"And that's fair enough, but it means with a Covid pass they're made to consider that.\"\nDavid Chapman, executive director for UK Hospitality in Wales, called for \"tolerance\" from government, licencing authorities and the public as the passes were introduced. \nHe told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast there was some \"trepidation\" in the industry, particularly about alignment with England, as well as staff shortages. \n\"We've got staffing problems as people will know already and more labour intensive moves such as this actually makes it quite difficult for a business to juggle resources well at the moment,\" he said. \nHe also called for the \"easiest possible trading conditions\" over Christmas, saying businesses had been told passes would stop \"stop at a certain point when society and the health service can cope\". \nDr Mair Hopkin, chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners in Wales, said the risk of Covid will increase as the weather gets worse and people spend more time indoors.\nShe said: \"They've introduced them in France and it seems to have been very acceptable to the French population, and also it seems to have coincided with a more rapid drop in their incidence rates.\n\"If that happens here then that would be a good thing.\"\nEconomy Minister Vaughan Gething said he would not \"expect perfection on day one\" as the system is introduced.  \nHe said: \"We do accept there may be problems in venues getting used to what they need to do.\""

      "text": "The Welsh NHS is experiencing its \"most challenging period\" since the start of the pandemic, according to its chief executive.\nDr Andrew Goodall said attempts to deal with the backlog in planned treatments were still being hampered by the prevalence of Covid-19.\nHe said numbers in hospital with Covid are still at a \"significant\" level. \nMeasures in hospitals to stop it spreading are also adding to the delays in planned treatments.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dr Goodall said: \"Even with all of the extraordinary efforts that have taken place over the past 20 months, this is the most challenging period of time.\n\"We've actually seen months where high, if not record numbers of patients, are coming into our system.\n\"The numbers are increasing. We are probably at the fullest that we've seen across our system in the past 20 months at this stage.\"\nHe said healthcare providers were still dealing with \"significant numbers\" of Covid-19 patients amid high levels of the virus within communities.\n\"Whilst the number of patients being hospitalised [with Covid] are much lower than we've seen over the last 20 months or so, it still means that we have patients who are affected by lots of the precautions that would take place within our hospital and our healthcare environments,\" he said.\nAsked why patients awaiting planned surgery in Wales were five times more likely than those in England to have to wait more than a year for treatment, Dr Goodall said it was vital to do more to improve access to care.\n\"Before we came into the pandemic, we had some issues around our waiting times and have been focusing on actions to improve that\", he said.\n\"We have had too many patients not able to access our services.\n\"We have got a responsibility to make sure that we can speed up the access to care and make sure that we have other plans.\"\nAcute hospitals in Wales have more patients in their beds than at any time since the pandemic began.\nIn the past week, there were, on average, 5,762 patients in general and acute beds each day. \nBed occupancy - the proportion of beds with patients in them compared to beds available - is also at its highest level.\nOver the past two weeks, it has been at an average of 89%, hitting 90% on some days this week.\nHospitals are trying to deal with a backlog of patients, to eat into waiting times, as well as dealing with Covid patients.\nThe first wave of the pandemic saw surgery cancelled to help free up beds and while the third wave has brought fewer Covid patients, they still add to pressures.\nOn Tuesday, the daily average of patients with confirmed Covid was 432 - the highest figure this month so far, although well below numbers seen in previous waves. \nMore than 50 of these patients are in critical care or on ventilation - the most since 19 September - although non-Covid patients are still outnumbering Covid patients.\nIncluding suspected Covid and recovering patients, Covid patients of all types totalled 656 patients on Tuesday or 7.7% of all hospital patients.\nThere has been no dramatic rise in Covid admissions, which remain at an average of 35 a day - 3% of all hospital admissions. This is within a similar range we have been seeing for the last six weeks. \nScientific modelling for the Welsh Government suggests we're heading for a peak in the next few weeks in terms of Covid hospital cases although a new report said the \"exact turning point is not clear\".

      "tags": "NI Brexit,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,European Commission,European Union,Brexit",
      "text": "\"I suppose you've rung me to talk about the Northern Ireland Protocol...\", comes the weary voice down the phone. \nIt's not diplomats or politicians from any particular EU country who greet me like that these days. It's the reaction I get pretty much across the board.\nFour years of Brexit negotiations before the UK's final departure in January last year have left the EU with no appetite for more. \nMember states are far more focused on struggling with post-Covid economic challenges, soaring gas prices and smouldering intra-EU strife with Poland and Hungary. The last thing EU capitals say they need or want right now is a trade war with the UK.\nBut tensions over the Northern Ireland Protocol are real. \nBrussels and London agree - though to differing degrees - that the protocol isn't working well for the people of Northern Ireland.\nOn Tuesday, the UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost called for far-reaching changes to the text. \nBrussels views this as a demand for a rewrite, and the EU is refusing to renegotiate the protocol's framework.\nIt was drawn up as part of the Brexit divorce deal, known as the Withdrawal Agreement. The result of an effort by EU and UK negotiators to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - dividing Northern Ireland, which is part of post-Brexit UK, from EU member state Ireland. \nThe fear was that a customs border between them might endanger the peace process.\nAnd that's how Northern Ireland - which is legally part of the UK customs union - ended up also remaining in the EU customs union and single market for goods after Brexit, as set out in the protocol. \nThis \"exceptional solution\" as the negotiators saw it, was an attempt to recognise the exceptional case of Northern Ireland, to avoid that hard border with the Republic of Ireland and to safeguard the peace process after Brexit.\nBut, to protect the EU's single market from goods potentially flooding in unchecked from the UK, Brussels insisted customs checks needed to be carried out between Great Britain and Northern Ireland - if they weren't going to take place on the island of Ireland.\nThis has angered unionists in the North, who feel they are being severed from the United Kingdom. \nLord Frost and others in the UK government warn the Protocol is upsetting the delicate political balance in Northern Ireland, thereby endangering the peace process the agreement was supposed to protect.\nBut Brussels insists this is an international treaty signed knowingly at the time by the UK government. \nIt says it is happy to work on ironing out any day-to-day practical difficulties of the protocol, raised by businesses and civil society in Northern Ireland. But the EU wants to make clear this week that it is not bowing to \"attempts at bullying\" by London, in the words of one European diplomat I spoke to. \nThe EU describes its new proposals as \"practical steps to solve concrete problems\".\nIt says it wants to ensure the smooth arrival of medicines from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. \nBecause it has heard complaints in Northern Ireland that regulations are being made concerning life there, without local involvement, Brussels will undertake this week to consult more with the authorities and businesses there.\nAnd while the EU insists that waiving customs checks altogether would endanger its single market, EU insiders say new measures being suggested this week to reduce the number of checks on goods and animal products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland (and therefore potentially onwards into the EU single market) already go too far for some EU member states.\nHowever, for now, Brussels is refusing to engage with Lord Frost's demand to remove the role of the European Court of Justice in the protocol. \nThe ECJ is a red rag to many Brexit supporters including in the governing Conservative party.  \nDavid Frost said on Tuesday he wanted to see the Protocol changed to become \"like a normal treaty in the way it is governed, with international arbitration instead of a system of EU law ultimately policed in the court of one of the parties, the European Court of Justice\".\nBut again the EU insists the protocol is no normal treaty.\nIt says that Northern Ireland's ongoing participation in the EU customs union and single market means in those areas it is subject to EU regulations and those, in turn, are always policed by the European Court of Justice.\nYet there is some wiggle room here. \nIn its agreements with sovereignty-minded Switzerland, the EU has an additional layer of oversight - placing the ECJ very much at arm's length.\nBut even if Brussels eventually suggested this, would the UK government go for it?\nOn Tuesday, Baroness Chapman, shadow Brexit Minister in the Labour Party, accused senior Conservatives of being \"desperate to use a tussle with Brussels\" to distract from what she described as the government's domestic failures - whether on Covid or the current energy crisis.\nA number of EU diplomats I've spoken to have echoed this sentiment. They're not convinced the government wants to resolve the protocol situation with Brussels, they say. At least not right away.\nThat is an accusation denied by the UK government. \nIn fact, Lord Frost says he's put together the legal text of a \"forward-looking\" new protocol which he has passed to the European Commission for consideration. \nFor now, despite some barbed exchanges by individual politicians (take a look at this weekend's Twitter spat between Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney and Lord Frost) both the EU and the UK insist theirs are not take-it-or-leave-it positions. \nBoth sides say they're open to discussion over the coming weeks. Lord Frost called on Brussels to be \"ambitious\" and to work together with the UK to agree \"a better way forward\". The EU is calling for \"constructive dialogue\". \nLet's see.\nThe UK government has threatened to suspend parts of the protocol if it deems that to be necessary.\nThe EU assumption is that, even if talks go badly, the UK would be unlikely to take such action before mid-November when the international COP26 climate summit in Glasgow comes to an end.\nThis would avoid a big UK moment on the global stage being dominated by headlines about a row with Brussels and the possible endangering of the Northern Ireland peace process.\nBut Brussels is readying itself for every eventuality. Key EU member states say they've asked the European Commission to prepare \"targeted retaliation\" if, for example, the UK suddenly stops customs checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nOne possibility you hear mentioned is that the EU could start new legal proceedings against the UK and/or suspend parts of its post-Brexit \"zero tariff zero quota\" trade agreement with the UK. The idea would be to target strategic UK markets like whisky or cars \"to send a clear message to London\", according to EU diplomats I've spoken to. \nAs bilateral discussions start again in earnest over the Northern Ireland Protocol, there's definite potential for things to get a lot messier."

      "text": "Mexico City's governor has confirmed that a statue of an indigenous woman will replace the capital's Christopher Columbus monument.\nThe statue was removed last year after indigenous rights activists threatened to tear it down.\nClaudia Sheinbaum said it will be replaced by a replica of a pre-Columbian statue known as the Young Woman of Amajac.\nProtesters have toppled Columbus statues in Latin America and the US.\nColumbus, an Italian-born explorer who was financed by the Spanish crown to set sail on voyages of exploration in the late 15th Century, is seen by many as a symbol of oppression and colonialism as his arrival in America opened the door to the Spanish conquest. \nMs Sheinbaum's latest announcement was made on 12 October - the anniversary of Columbus' discovery of the Americas.\nIn the US it is widely celebrated as Columbus Day. But in Mexico and other Latin American countries it is known as D\u00eda de la Raza (Spanish: Day of the Race). Many view it as a commemoration to native resistance against European conquest.\nMs Sheinbaum said she wanted to make the change as part of the \"decolonisation\" of the famous Reforma Avenue, where an empty plinth currently stands. \nShe added that the new monument - set to to be three times as tall as the Columbus statue - was in recognition that \"indigenous women had been the most persecuted\" during and after the colonial period.\nThe original Young Woman of Amajac was discovered in January in Veracruz.\nIt is believed that the sculpture depicts a leading female member of the Huastec people at the time of its creation.\nThe original currently sits in Mexico City's Anthropology Museum, which is going to create the replica. \nAfter the city government decided to remove the Columbus statute from its plinth, a number of proposals were put forward including a statue inspired by a pre-Hispanic Olmec head. \nHowever, it was derided as a token gesture for its lack of authenticity, prompting Ms Sheinbaum to cancel it and opt instead for the Young Woman of Amajac. \nThe statue of Christopher Columbus will be moved to a park in another area of Mexico City."

      "tags": "COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit.\nIt aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough.\nThe agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade:\nEmissions\nIt was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a greenhouse gas which causes climate change.\nThis is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a \"climate catastrophe\". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. \nCoal\nFor the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.  \nHowever, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to \"phase down\" rather than \"phase out\" coal after a late intervention by China and India. \nDeveloping countries\nThe agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy.\nThere's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (\u00a372bn) a year by 2020 was missed.\nWhile some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the \"start of a breakthrough\", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. \nFossil fuel subsidies\nWorld leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas.\nHowever, no firm dates have been set.\nA flurry of other announcements were made:\nThe world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, pledged to cooperate more over the next decade in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy.\nChina has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. \nLeaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - promised to stop deforestation by 2030.\nThis is seen as vital, as tress absorb vast amounts of CO2. \nSimilar initiatives haven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed.\nA scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030 was agreed by more than 100 countries. \nMethane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. \nThe big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.\nFinancial organisations controlling $130tn agreed to back \"clean\" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries.\nThe initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets.\nHowever, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. \nMost commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed.\nOnly a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. \nCOP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 Paris Agreement. \nSix years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming \"well below\" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.\nCOP stands for \"Conference of the Parties\", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. \nThe goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach net zero by mid-century.\nNext year's COP27 summit is in Egypt.\nTop image from Getty Images.

      "text": "A review of the work of a former locum consultant radiologist in the Northern Trust has identified major discrepancies in 66 images.\nThe trust has concluded a review of 13,030 scans and x-rays.\nThe review was launched in June after the General Medical Council raised concerns about the locum consultant radiologist's work.\nThe highest level of hospital investigation will be carried out into the cases of 17 patients.\nThe doctor worked at hospitals run by the Northern Health Trust between July 2019 and February 2020.\nMore than 9,000 patients were contacted as part of the review.\nThe trust's medical director, Dr Seamus O'Reilly, has said that of the 17 patients, 10 have died since their images were taken.\n\"I think it's important to say that patients die for a variety of reasons and it would be entirely wrong at this time to link those deaths to the inaccurate image reporting,\" he said. \n\"It is a possibility and the SAI will look very closely at that.\"\nThe review identified six images at level one - a major discrepancy where errors or omissions in reporting could have had an immediate and significant clinical impact for the patients concerned. \nA further 60 images were level two - a major discrepancy with a probable clinical impact.\n\"Most of the images categorised as having Level 1 and Level 2 discrepancies are CT scans but some are MRI scans, chest x-rays and other x-rays,\" said Dr O'Reilly.\nHe said images where concerns were classed as level one and level two were reviewed on a weekly basis by a group of experts. \nThey also considered some images categorised as level three, where a clinical impact is unlikely.\n\"That detailed clinical assessment, which has resulted in 69 patients being called back, was to determine whether any clinical harm occurred as a result of the discrepancies found in the lookback review,\" said Dr O'Reilly.\n\"I can confirm that following careful consideration, the clinical assessment group has determined that 17 patients should now be part of a Level 3 Serious Adverse Incident (SAI) review.\"\nDr O'Reilly said an independent panel will provide individual case reports for each patient determined to be an SAI, explaining what happened, why it happened, and how this may have had an impact on the patient/relative and if the patient's outcome would have been different had the discrepancy not occurred.\nHe added that the panel is expected to make recommendations on how radiology reporting processes may be strengthened to minimise the possibility of similar adverse events occurring in the future.\nThe trust said it will now contact affected patients and families to inform them of the pending SAI review and to seek their participation throughout the process."

      "tags": "Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "Climate change is set to cause major changes across the world: sea levels will rise, food production could fall and species may be driven to extinction.\nThe UN has warned that the world needs to limit climate change to below 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. But scientists say that keeping to the 1.5C target will require \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes\" in all aspects of society.\nSo how warm has the world got and what can we do about it?\nThe world is now nearly one degree warmer than it was before widespread industrialisation, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\nThe global average temperature for the first 10 months of 2018 was 0.98C above the levels of 1850-1900, according to five independently maintained global data sets.\n(If you can't see this chart tap or click here) \nThe 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, with  2015-2018 making up the top four, the WMO says.\nIf this trend continues, temperatures may rise by 3-5C by 2100.\nOne degree may not sound like much, but, according to the IPCC, if countries fail to act, the world will face catastrophic change - sea levels will rise, ocean temperatures and acidity will increase and our ability to grow crops, such as rice, maize and wheat, would be in danger.\nAlmost 400 all-time high temperatures were set in the northern hemisphere during the summer of 2019. \nRecords were broken in 29 countries for the period between 1 May and 30 August. A third of the all-time high temperatures were in Germany, followed by France and the Netherlands.\nThese European records were set amid heatwaves across the continent that sent temperatures soaring in June and July.\nOver the period shown on the map below (May to August 2019), the yellow dots show where a heat record was broken on a given date, pink indicates places that were the hottest they had ever been in the month shown, and dark red represents a place that was the hottest since records began.\nMore than 30 all-time records were broken in the US, according to the Berkeley Earth data. In Japan, where 11 people died as a result of the summer heatwave, 10 all-time temperature highs were set.\nIf we add up all the promises to cut emissions made by countries that are party to the Paris climate agreement, the world would still warm by more than 3C by the end of this century.\nOver the past few years, climate scientists have shifted the definition of what they believe is the \"safe\" limit of climate change.\nFor decades, researchers argued the global temperature rise must be kept below 2C by the end of this century to avoid the worst impacts. \nCountries signing up to the Paris agreement pledged to keep temperatures \"well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C\".\nBut scientists now agree that we actually need to keep temperature rises to below 1.5C.\nThe countries emitting the most greenhouse gases by quite a long way are China and the US. Together they account for more than 40% of the global total, according to 2017 data from the European Commission's Joint Research Centre and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.\nUS environmental policy has shifted under the Trump administration, which has pursued a pro-fossil fuels agenda.\nPresident Donald Trump has begun the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris climate change agreement.\nMr Trump said the deal struck in 2015 would disadvantage US businesses and workers.\nAlmost all (95%) of cities facing extreme climate risks are in Africa or Asia, a report by risk analysts Verisk Maplecroft has found. \nAnd it's the faster-growing cities that are most at risk, including megacities like Lagos in Nigeria and Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nSome 84 of the world's 100 fastest-growing cities face \"extreme\" risks from rising temperatures and extreme weather brought on by climate change. \nThe extent of Arctic sea ice has dropped in recent years. It reached its lowest point on record in 2012.\nSea ice has been reducing for decades, with melting accelerating since the early 2000s, according to the UK Parliament's Environmental Audit Committee.\nThe Arctic Ocean may be ice-free in the summer as soon as the 2050s, unless emissions are reduced, the committee has said.\nThe extent of Arctic sea ice in 2019 was tied with 2007 and 2016 as the second lowest on record. The maximum extent, reached in March 2019, was tied with 2007 as the seventh lowest in the 40-year satellite record.\nWhile governments need to make big changes - individuals can play a role too. \nScientists say we all have to make major changes to our lifestyles, in order to avoid severely damaging climate change.\nThe IPCC says we need to: buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter; eat more locally sourced seasonal food - and throw less of it away; drive electric cars but walk or cycle short distances; take trains and buses instead of planes; use videoconferencing instead of business travel; use a washing line instead of a tumble dryer; insulate homes; demand low carbon in every consumer product.\nOne of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact on the planet is to modify your diet to include less meat - according to recent studies. \nScientists say we ought to eat less meat because of the carbon emissions the meat industry produces, as well as other negative environmental impacts. \nA recent study published in the journal Science highlighted a massive variation in the environmental impact of producing the same food.\nFor example, beef cattle raised on deforested land produces 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than those reared on natural pastures.\nCrucially, the analysis shows that meat with the lowest environmental impact still creates more greenhouse gas emissions than growing vegetables and cereal crops in the least environmentally-friendly way.\nBut as well as altering our diets, research suggests that farming practices need to change significantly to benefit the environment.\nBy Nassos Stylianou, Clara Guibourg, Daniel Dunford, Lucy Rodgers, David Brown and Paul Rincon\nCorrection 24 February 2020: A previous version of this story said that \"the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet is to modify your diet to include less meat\". This has been amended to now refer to \"one of the biggest,\" taking account of different individual lifestyles and circumstances. We have also replaced the in-line link with a research article on 'The global impacts of food production'."

      "tags": "Sarah Everard murder,Metropolitan Police Service,Greenwich",
      "text": "Radio presenter Emma Wilson has said Sarah Everard's murderer Wayne Couzens flashed her and that Met Police officers laughed when she reported it.\nThe Magic FM DJ - who is also known as Emma B - said he exposed himself to her when she walked past an alleyway in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2008.\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour she recognised him when she saw his photo in news reports.\nThe Met Police is investigating the presenter's complaint. \nMs Wilson told the programme she was \"so very sure\" it was Couzens - who at the time was a volunteer officer with Kent Police - and that it \"adds to the clamour of chances there were to stop this man\".\nCouzens - who went on to become a Met Police officer - was given a whole-life term last month for the kidnap, rape and murder of Ms Everard.\nThe police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), is looking into the Met's handling of three other alleged indecent exposure incidents involving Couzens, including two said to have taken place in south London three days before he murdered Ms Everard.\nThe other allegation centres around a report of how Kent Police investigated a claim in 2015. Details of a car linked to Couzens had been passed on to police but he was not identified. \nA Met Police review found that an allegation Couzens exposed himself outside a fast-food restaurant in the days before he murdered Ms Everard had been allocated for investigation, but by the time of the marketing executive's abduction it was not concluded.\nThe IOPC said two Met officers had been served with misconduct notices for possible breaches of professional standards in relation to the incident.\nMs Wilson said she knows it was Couzens who exposed himself to her as he had a \"face that doesn't go anywhere, it stays with you\".\nShe explained how she ran into a nearby shop to alert police who then visited her to take a statement. \n\"They were asking me what I could see... he was playing with himself and there were specifics about his state of arousal that they thought were quite amusing. It was really humiliating,\" Ms Wilson said.\n\"I remember clearly saying to them, 'I really hope this is all he needs to do' and I said that at the time because I was so struck by how feeble their response was.\"\nThe presenter said the incident was \"aggressive, it was purposeful, it was calculated\" and that \"it wasn't this comic character that we have of this local peeping Tom or the local flasher in the flasher mac\".\n\"There's a really big part of me that hopes it wasn't him because if it was, this is horrific that it could have gone on for so very, very long.\"\nThe Met Police said at the time, that a search of the area was conducted but the suspect could not be found. CCTV inquiries were unsuccessful and the matter was passed on to the local safer neighbourhoods team for intelligence.\nThe force added that to the best of its knowledge, it was \"not aware\" of any reports before his March arrest where he had been named as a suspect. \nIt said if it received any allegations it would investigate.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Met Police Deputy Commissioner Bas Javid acknowledged there was a \"crisis\" of confidence in policing in the wake of Ms Everard's murder.   \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: \"We want women and girls particularly to feel safe in communities. \n\"There's a lot of work to be done to rebuild that trust and give people the confidence to come forward.\"\nHe said as well as the independent review into the force's standards and culture, the Met Police was taking other steps to be \"proactive\".\nThose measures include undertaking an examination of all ongoing sexual and domestic abuse allegations against officers and staff, and significantly boosting the number of officers who investigate police misconduct."

      "tags": "NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK's failure to do more to stop Covid spreading early in the pandemic was one of the country's worst public health failures, a report by MPs says.\nThe government approach - backed by its scientists - was to try to manage the situation and in effect achieve herd immunity by infection, it said.\nThis led to a delay in introducing the first lockdown, costing thousands of lives, the MPs found.\nBut their report highlighted successes too, including the vaccination rollout.\nIt described the approach to vaccination - from the research and development through to the rollout of the jabs - as \"one of the most effective initiatives in UK history\".\nBut campaigners criticised the report for failing to focus on those who had died, saying references to practical issues, including problems with laptops, was \"laughable\".\nThe 150-page document, Coronavirus: Lessons learned to date, is from the Health and Social Care Committee and the Science and Technology Committee, and MPs from all parties.\nIt predominantly focused on the response to the pandemic in England. The committees did not look at steps taken individually by Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nThe MPs called the pandemic, which has claimed more than 150,000 lives in the UK and nearly five million worldwide so far, the \"biggest peacetime challenge\" for a century.\nSome early failings, the report suggested, resulted from apparent \"group-think\" among scientists and ministers.\nIt meant the UK was not as open to different approaches on earlier lockdowns, border controls and test and trace as it should have been.\nA woman whose twin sisters died within three days of one another after testing positive for Covid says the report from MPs uses the success of the vaccine programme to deflect from earlier failures.\nZoe Davis' sisters Katy and Emma, who were both nurses, died in April 2020.\nShe says: \"Nobody is saying that the vaccine programme hasn't been phenomenal but the frustrating thing is that's a deflection of what is actually being brought to attention and the overall message is that Covid failures have cost lives.\"\nLindsay Jackson, from Derbyshire, whose mother died with Covid, said the report confirmed her fears she had about care home visits in March 2020.\n\"I knew in my own mind the lockdown was too slow, I knew the social care sector wasn't being looked after, I knew people shouldn't have been released from hospital without tests, and this just confirms that.\"\nShe is calling for the government to move to a public inquiry now to see if anyone is culpable.\nConservative MPs Jeremy Hunt and Greg Clark, who chair the committees, said the nature of the pandemic meant it was \"impossible to get everything right\". \n\"The UK has combined some big achievements with some big mistakes. It is vital to learn from both,\" they said.\nCabinet Office minister Stephen Barclay said scientific advice had been followed and the government had made \"difficult judgements\" to protect the NHS.\nHe said the government took responsibility for everything that happened - saying the government would not shy away from any lessons to be learned at the full statutory public inquiry, expected next year.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the report was a \"damning indictment\" and showed the errors and failures of running down the NHS before the pandemic.\nHe called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to apologise to the bereaved and hold the public inquiry as soon as possible. \nWhen Covid hit, the government's approach was to manage its spread through the population rather than try to stop it - or herd immunity by infection as the report called it.\nThe MPs said this was based on dealing with a flu pandemic, and was done on the advice of its scientific advisers on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). \nBut the idea was not challenged enough by ministers in any part of the UK. Although other parts of Europe were guilty of this too, the MPs added.\nToo little was done in the early weeks to stop Covid spreading, the MPs said, despite evidence from China and then Italy that it was a virus that was highly infectious, caused severe illness and had no cure.\n\"The veil of ignorance through which the UK viewed the initial weeks of the pandemic was partly self-inflicted,\" the report said.\nAsked whether herd immunity had been a policy in the early days, Mr Hunt said he did not think there was any desire for the whole population to be infected.\nHowever, he said there was a \"fatalism that it was likely that in the end, that will be the only way that we will stop the progress of the virus\".\nDecisions on lockdowns and social distancing during those early weeks - and the advice that led to them - were described as \"one of the most important public health failures the UK has ever experienced\".\nThe advice from scientists changed on 16 March 2020 - with a lockdown announced a week later.\n\"This slow and gradualist approach was not inadvertent, nor did it reflect bureaucratic delay or disagreement between ministers and their advisers,\" the report said, describing it as a \"deliberate policy\".\n\"It is now clear that this was the wrong policy, and that it led to a higher initial death toll than would have resulted from a more emphatic early policy. In a pandemic spreading rapidly and exponentially, every week counted.\"\nA Liverpool FC and Atletico Madrid football match on 11 March - as a pandemic was declared by the WHO - and the Cheltenham Festival of Racing between 10 and 13 March, may have spread the virus.\nMr Barclay said hindsight was \"an issue\". Had the government known how much the country would be willing to endure, lockdown may have come sooner, the minister added.\nThe MPs also highlighted how ministers in England rejected scientific advice to have a two-week \"circuit-breaker\" in the autumn.\nThey said it was impossible to know whether that would have prevented the second lockdown in November, although they pointed out it had not in Wales.\nThe UK was one of the first countries in the world to develop a test for Covid in January 2020, but failed to translate that into an effective test-and-trace system during the first year of the pandemic, the report said.\nTesting in the community stopped in March 2020 and for weeks during the first peak only those admitted to hospital were tested.\nIt was not until May that the NHS Test and Trace system was launched in England, but the report described its start as \"slow, uncertain and often chaotic\".\nIt said the system was too centralised, only later making use of the expertise in local public health teams run by councils.\nBut it praised the target set by then Health Secretary Matt Hancock to get to 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, saying it played an important part in galvanising the system.\nThe greatest praise though was reserved for the vaccination programme and the way the government supported the development of a number of vaccines, including the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\nIt said the whole programme was one of the most effective initiatives in history, and will ultimately help to save millions of lives here and across the world.\nA key step, taken early on following a suggestion from chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, was to set up a task force that combined the talents of scientists, the NHS and the private sector, led by the \"bold leadership\" of venture capitalist Kate Bingham.\nThe development of treatments, such as dexamethasone, for Covid through the UK Recovery Trial was another area where the UK's response was genuinely world-leading, the report said. \nAnd the NHS and government were also credited with the way hospital intensive care capacity was increased to ensure the majority who needed hospital treatment received it.\nThe report's recommendations include comprehensive government plans for future emergencies, a bigger role for the armed forces in emergency response plans, and considering a government and NHS volunteer reserve database.\nThe MPs said the pandemic had also exacerbated existing social, economic and health inequalities which would need addressing.\nThe report highlighted \"unacceptably high\" death rates in ethnic minority groups and among people with learning disabilities and autism.\nFor ethnic minorities, there were a variety of factors, including possible biological reasons and increased exposure because of housing and working conditions. \nFor people with learning disabilities, not enough thought was given to how restrictions would have a detrimental impact on them - particularly in terms of accessing health care more generally. Do not resuscitate orders were also used inappropriately.\nThere was a lack of priority attached to care homes too at the start of the pandemic.\nThe rapid discharge of people from hospital into care homes without adequate testing or isolation was a prime example of this.\nThis, combined with untested staff bringing infection into homes from the community, led to many thousands of deaths which could have been avoided.\nScience minister George Freeman said it was too early for any proper discussion about blame or fault.\nAsked about the higher UK death toll, he said: \"A lot of that is actually to do with the very, very heavy obesity-related cardiometabolic chronic disease cohort that we've been carrying for years - that's a failure of public health in this country over decades.\"\nLobby Akinnola, of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, said Mr Freeman's comments were \"grossly offensive\", adding that \"the statutory inquiry cannot come soon enough\".\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

He was eventually imprisoned for tax evasion, and spent several years locked up in Alcatraz - the infamous island prison in San Francisco Bay.\nThe belongings remained in the possession of his family for almost 75 years after his death in 1947. \nDiane Capone - one of of Al Capone's three surviving granddaughters, who lives in California - said the decision to sell the items was based on her and her sisters getting older, Reuters reports. \nShe also said the increasing threat of wildfires to their homes in northern California had been a factor."

      "tags": "Floods,Climate change",
      "text": "Hundreds of people could die in floods in the UK, the Environment Agency has warned in a hard-hitting report that says the country is not ready for the impact of climate change. \nEarlier this year in Germany, dozens of people died in floods. \n\"That will happen in this country sooner or later\" unless the UK becomes more resilient to increasingly violent weather, the agency concludes.\nEmma Howard Boyd, chair of the agency, said: \"It is adapt or die.\"\nThe apocalyptic tone is deliberately intended to startle governments, companies and communities into preparing for global warming effects such as higher sea levels and more extremes of rainfall and drought.\nThe new report, seen by the BBC ahead of its publication on Wednesday, assesses the country's readiness to cope with the many different risks of climate change.\nIn its response, environment department Defra said it was taking key measures to protect the UK from the effects of global warming.\nWe are currently heading for an increase in the global average temperature of just under 3C by the end of the century.\nBut the agency projects that even a smaller rise of 2C would have severe consequences:\nAccording to Ms Howard Boyd: \"We can successfully tackle the climate emergency if we do the right things, but we are running out of time to implement effective adaptation measures.\n\"Some 200 people died in this summer's flooding in Germany. That will happen in this country sooner or later, however high we build our flood defences - unless we also make the places where we live, work and travel resilient to the effects of the more violent weather the climate emergency is bringing.\"\nRead more about the COP26 summit here.\nThe agency calls for new thinking on flood protection, closer partnerships between government and businesses, and projects to restore natural systems that absorb carbon and hold back rainwater.\nMs Howard Boyd added: \"With the right approach we can be safer and more prosperous. So let's prepare, act and survive.\"\nThe loss of life in Germany last July is a reminder of the last time flooding led to a massive death toll in the UK.\nBack in 1953, a storm surge killed 307 people in England and 19 in Scotland.\nThat tragedy forced a radical rethink about flood protection and a massive investment in coastal defences that eventually led to the Thames Barrier in London.\nNow, as officials across the UK weigh up future phases of flood defence, the report identifies what it calls five \"reality checks\" about climate change:\nThe agency calls for new thinking on flood protection, saying that \"business as usual\" approaches are no longer adequate.\nIn practical terms, that means better co-ordination between companies, national agencies and local authorities, with businesses and homeowners encouraged to take basic steps to flood-proof their own properties. \nIt wants more investment in natural ways of reducing flood risk, such as restoring upland areas that can retain rainwater upstream and improving management of the soil so there's less run-off. \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nThe agency also suggests trialling new arrangements and technologies for warning local communities about flood risks, and having closer coordination with other emergency services. \nThe agency acknowledges that billions of pounds have been spent on flood defences - and that more is earmarked.\nAnd it recognises that the UK, as host of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow next month, is highlighting the importance of helping communities and nature adapt to climate change.\nIn response, Defra highlighted several key measures designed to adapt to a changing climate: \u00a35.2bn to protect 336,000 properties from flooding and coastal erosion better; a national framework to manage water supplies; and a \u00a3640m Nature for Climate Fund to tackle climate change and adaptation together.\nA spokesperson said: \"We are taking robust action to improve resilience to climate change across the whole country and economy, and adaptation to climate change is integrated in policies throughout government.\n\"We're also using our COP26 presidency to drive climate adaptation around the world, protecting communities and natural habitats.\"\nFollow David on Twitter.\nDo you have any questions about the forthcoming COP26 global climate conference in Glasgow?\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "US officials are investigating possible cases of Havana syndrome illness in Colombia, days before a visit by the Secretary of State, US media say.\nUS embassy staff in Bogota may have been injured by the mysterious illness, which causes a painful sound in the ears, fatigue and dizziness.\nFirst reported in Cuba in 2016, US diplomats around the world have since reported cases of the syndrome.\nIts origins are unknown, with some speculating it is a type of weapon. \nOn Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal first reported that emails sent by US Ambassador to Colombia Philip Goldberg confirmed a number of \"unexplained health incidents\" or UHIs - the term used for Havana syndrome by the US government - since mid-September. \nColombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque told the New York Times that the country is investigating the reports. He added that the US is leading the inquiry.\nAmericans who have been hit by Havana syndrome have described an intense and painful sound in their ears. Some of the estimated 200 affected have been left with dizziness and fatigue for months.\u202f\nMore than half of those impacted were CIA employees, according to the Times. \nOn Friday, reports of Havana syndrome emerged at the US embassy in Berlin. President Joe Biden released a statement vowing to find \"the cause and who is responsible\".\nIt came hours after he signed a new law that entitles the heads of the CIA and State Department to provide financial compensation to those US government employees who have been harmed by the syndrome. \nA State Department official refused to confirm the reports to BBC News on Tuesday.\nIn a statement, the official said \"we are vigorously investigating reports of AHIs wherever they are reported,\" and that they are \"actively working to identify the cause of these incidents and whether they may be attributed to a foreign actor\".\nThe news comes ahead of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's scheduled travel to Bogota next week. \nIn August, Vice-President Kamala Harris delayed travel to Vietnam after two US officials were medically evacuated from the country after falling ill.

      "title": "Brexit: Northern Ireland firms give their verdict on the protocol",
      "tags": "NI Brexit,Brexit",
      "text": "The European Commission will later bring forward its much-anticipated proposals for resolving problems with the Northern Ireland Protocol. \nThe protocol is the special Brexit deal agreed in 2019 to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. \nIt keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, but that creates a trade border for some products travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \nUnionists say this undermines their place in the UK, but also creates fundamental problems for Northern Ireland firms. \nBBC News NI has spoken to a number of businesses across Northern Ireland which say they have been affected by the protocol. \nAndrew Lynas - Lynas Foodservice, County Londonderry\nThe Coleraine-base company says it has had to employ two people to specifically deal with protocol-related paperwork as well as find alternative suppliers.  \nIt delivers to more than 5,000 catering customers across the UK and Ireland. \nMr Lynas believes labour shortages, particularly with Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) drivers in Great Britain, means many businesses in England, Scotland and Wales may \"cut their losses\" and reduce trade with businesses in Northern Ireland. \n\"We've probably had to say goodbye to about 20 different suppliers, \" he says. \n\"We've been able to find some alternatives on the island, and some in Europe but for some we haven't been able to find alternatives.\n\"There's just a lot of hassle and complexity and when you talk to a supplier in GB, they don't fully understand all the bits of that paperwork.\"\nMr Lynas believes scrapping the Northern Ireland Protocol \"isn't the answer\" but says a workable solution needs to be found. \nEamon McKey - Deli Lites, County Down\nEamon McKey, chief operating officer with County Down-based Deli Lites, says 70% of its business is delivered to the Republic of Ireland, and the prospect of a hard border on the island was the company's \"greatest concern\".\nHe says the protocol has produced new opportunities for the firm.\n\"We welcomed the protocol as resolving the land border issue for us,\" he says. \nHe says he believes more people are now shopping locally, and Deli Lites has won a number of accounts that were previously serviced by competitors in Great Britain. \nHowever, challenges include a loss of some of the firm's suppliers in Great Britain. \n\"There are ongoing threats to our GB supply chain,\" he says. \nMr McKey says that, on one occasion, one of its suppliers lost \"valuable\" produce because of delays due to temperature checks during shipping.\n\"This has impacted on our service to our customer and we are waiting on a replacement delivery,\" he adds. \n\"That type of incident is likely to further restrict GB supply into Northern Ireland. We do see opportunities, but we also have had problems.\"\nJohn McGuinness - Garden Depot, County Tyrone\nThe Strabane-based garden firm is struggling to stock Christmas trees for the upcoming festive season. \nMr McGuiness sells about 600 Christmas trees each December, the majority of which in previous pre-Brexit years have been sourced from suppliers in Scotland. \nBut that's not the case this year. \nMr McGuinness says trees coming from Great Britain are now subject to \"protocols, customs and paperwork\" that complicates a process that had worked well before the UK and EU parted ways. \nA product like Christmas trees have a limited shelf life, he says, and any process that delays their delivery is not good for business. \n\"You only have a certain amount of time from when you cut a tree until it gets to someone's house and before it dies, so all of that has to be taken into consideration,\" he says. \nLarger stores than his that also sell trees are in a similar position, he adds, and businesses are looking to get trees from local suppliers. \nThat means \"there's less trees available and the price has gone up as well\", he says.\n\"I think we will get them, maybe not all the quantity, or all the different sizes that we would normally get, but we will be grateful to get what we do get.\"\nMichael and Lesley Cairnduff - Oscar Pet Foods, County Down\nThe Cairnduffs are the local nutritional advisers for Oscar Pet Foods in County Down, and have been providing a home delivery service for pet food and supplies for more than 25 years. \nThe company's head office is in Lancashire.\nMrs Cairnduff says their shipping costs have more than doubled in the first six months of this year compared to the same period in 2020. \n\"The first six months of this year were extremely worrying,\" says her husband.\nHe says the amount of administration time that head office now spends on Northern Ireland has increased by a factor of 50. \n\"For us here, it's gone up, our delivery work, the paperwork and red tape, by a factor of about 10. Obviously we'd prefer to spend that on customer service and marketing, and not using it for the Northern Ireland Protocol,\" he adds. \nMrs Cairnduff says food pallets coming from England are now taking 10-12 days, whereas it would have taken about four days pre-Brexit. \nShe says the EU should repurpose the trusted trader scheme, as they can prove they don't sell any of their produce on to the EU. \n\"If that was put in place, it would make life a lot simpler for us. Treat us the same as our counterparts in England are being treated,\" she says. "

      "text": "\"It's a kind of hopelessness I guess. Helplessness,\" says Ross Simpson, 22, from Glasgow. He's telling me how he and his friends feel about stopping the worst effects of climate change. \nThe warnings keep coming of more heatwaves, droughts, floods, and global temperatures going up and up and up. Seeing so many negative stories in the news only makes Ross feel worse. \nLike many, he worries it's already too late. \n\"What difference does changing your lifestyle actually make in the grand scheme of things? Why do anything, if we're all doomed anyway?\"\nNoor Elmasry, 22, has been having similar conversations with her friends across the Atlantic, in Chicago. \"I think a lot of the frustration manifests from seeing people in power just constantly disappoint you,\" she says.\nTheir feelings are shared by young people around the world. In a recent survey, 10,000 young people were asked about climate change. Three quarters said the future of the world was frightening, while more than half said they thought humanity was doomed. \nFeelings of fear, shame, guilt, anger and frustration have been given a name: climate anxiety. And it's on the rise. \nSo what can you do if you're worried the planet is doomed? The BBC asked a group of scientists who have been working on climate change for years about what worked for them. \nRepeatedly, scientists said taking action in their own lives helped to ease their anxieties. \nMany were proud of the scientific work they had been part of, but some also spoke about doing simpler things: recycling, eating a plant-based diet, insulating their homes, going on marches and engaging with politics. \nDr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist who contributed to a major report on climate change this year, said she occasionally planted mango saplings by the roadside. \nWould it save the world on its own? No. Did it make her feel a bit better? Yes. \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nDr Jonathan Foley has worked on climate change for three decades as a researcher, author and government advisor and now investigates climate change solutions. \nHe says action is the antidote that works for him, and points out that it can take many forms.  \n\"Some people might become activists because they're really angry and they want to shake things up. Great, we need that. Others could be artists and want to share how they feel and inspire others. Great, we need that too. We need everybody.\"\nDr Natalie Jones, a specialist in existential risk at the University of Cambridge, found relief in being alongside like-minded people at protests, rallies and other events. \n\"It's an atmosphere you can't beat,\" she says. \"As soon as you meet other people who have the same concerns, you're like, 'okay, I would much rather be here'.\"\nRead more about the COP26 summit here.\nThe choice for her is often between \"doomscrolling\" - staring at a phone or computer and dwelling on negative news - or working on solutions with like-minded people.\n\"Everyone's in the same boat, right? So there's a huge amount of solidarity,\" she says. \"I got a lot of meaning by knowing what we're doing might really change things.\"\nShe says the pandemic has made that hard for many people, but adds: \"I really hope that people can feel like they can start that stuff again.\"\nAlmost all the scientists shared stories about coming to terms with how they felt about climate change. \"I've felt terrified,\" says Dr Jones. \n\"I've felt incredibly angry at fossil fuel interests who have delayed action for so long. I've felt frustration at politicians. I've gone through real helplessness.\"  \n\"We've all been there,\" Dr Jones adds. \"Everyone who works on climate has been there. For me that was like 10 years ago. You have to acknowledge these things and come to some level of acceptance.\"\nBut what does acceptance actually look like? Dr Jones says she spoke to friends and a counsellor. She continues to keep a journal to write down her feelings. \n\"For me, I don't know how to process thoughts and feelings without writing them down. The main thing is getting it all out of your head. If it stays there it just turns into a big unhelpful stew.\"\nCaroline Hickman has studied the impact on climate change on the mental health of young people and helped lead the survey of 10,000 young people. \n\"We need to pay attention to how we feel and to process these complex feelings and support others in dealing with how they feel, as we take action in world,\" she says. \"Otherwise, there's a high risk of burnout, because we're tired.\"\nShe says feelings of anxiety are normal. \"It's an emotionally, mentally healthy response to feel anxiety, dread, despair, depression in relation to the climate emergency.\"\nYet many of the scientists had a stubborn optimism that comes from working on the problem. You will have good days and bad days, Dr Foley says. \n\"Maybe that's how you feel some days,\" he says when I ask him about feeling down. \"But I hope you come back and maybe roll up your sleeves and see that actually maybe doom isn't guaranteed.\""

      "title": "Brexit: Lord Frost proposes 'entirely new' NI protocol",
      "tags": "NI Brexit,Brexit",
      "text": "Brexit Minister Lord Frost has proposed plans for an entirely new protocol to replace the existing Northern Ireland Protocol.\nIn a speech to diplomats in Portugal on Tuesday, he described his new legal text as \"a better way forward\".\nThe protocol is the special Brexit deal agreed for Northern Ireland to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. \nUnionists argue it undermines Northern Ireland's constitutional position in the UK and creates a trade barrier. \nIn a plea to the European Union to allow for \"significant change\" to post-Brexit rules governing trade with Northern Ireland, Lord Frost said his proposed text would support the Good Friday Agreement.\nHe said it was forward-looking, improved on the current \"excessively rigid\" protocol, and would allow the EU and UK to \"get back to normal\" by removing \"the poison\" from their relationship.\nWith the EU expected to put forward proposals on Wednesday, Lord Frost again warned Brussels London could unilaterally waive some of the terms of its agreement if the bloc failed to budge.\n\"We have a short, but real, opportunity to put in place a new arrangement, to defuse the political crisis that is brewing, both in Northern Ireland and between us,\" Lord Frost said.\nHowever, Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Louise Haigh said the move to replace the protocol was \"stoking tension while solving nothing\". \nIn a tweet, the Labour MP said Lord Frost's speech \"sets the stage for another destabilising stand-off, with the agreement businesses and communities need further away than ever\". \n\"Stability, jobs and livelihoods depend on real progress in Northern Ireland in the coming weeks,\" she said. \n\"It would be a serious abdication of responsibility to block a pragmatic way forward and provoke more poisonous instability.\"   \nLord Frost urged the EU to look carefully at the UK's new legal text, and said the existing protocol could not survive, as it did not have support right across Northern Ireland.\nHe also warned the UK could still trigger Article 16 - which allows either side to effectively override large parts of the agreement - if the EU and UK could not agree on changes to the existing protocol.\n\"We would not go down this route gratuitously or with any particular pleasure but it is our fundamental responsibility to safeguard peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland and that is why we cannot rest until this situation is addressed,\" said Lord Frost.\nThere are two schools of thought about how this latest negotiation is shaping up.\nThe first is that Lord Frost's hard line on the European Court of Justice (ECJ) is standard pre-negotiation tactics, aimed at grinding out another concession or two.\nAfter all the Brexit process has always delivered a deal, even at times when it seemed improbable.\nThe UK government wants to remove the ECJ from its oversight role as part of the Northern Ireland Protocol, saying as long as it continues the protocol will never survive. \nThe EU, on the other hand, has said it would be very hard for the protocol to continue without the court's oversight.\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney has warned that the UK's demands on the protocol could cause \"a breakdown in relations\" with the EU.\nHe has hinted that maybe the UK doesn't want a deal unless it's total victory.\nUnder that scenario, the UK would go through the motions before triggering Article 16.\nIt would use this to gut the protocol while calculating that the EU's ability to retaliate is limited or or at least would take a long time to amount to anything.\nWe should find out which view is right by the end of this year.\nThe Brexit minister said the protocol represented \"a moment of EU overreach when the UK's negotiating hand was tied\" and that it could not \"reasonably last in its current form\".\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed up to the protocol as part of his Brexit agreement in 2020, but has since argued it was agreed in haste and was no longer working for the people of Northern Ireland.\nThe EU has repeatedly said it would not renegotiate the protocol, criticising the UK for reneging on an agreement that both sides signed in good faith.\nThe UK government also wants to reverse its previous agreement on the oversight role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which is the EU's highest court.\nLord Frost said his new text proposed reliance on \"international arbitration instead of a system of EU law ultimately policed in the court of one of the parties\".\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - Northern Ireland's largest unionist party - said if the current protocol was not replaced with a long-term solution Northern Ireland would be exposed to \"further harm and instability\". \nThe DUP leader has previously warned his party may quit Stormont if its demands over the protocol are not met.\nBut Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the protocol was an international treaty that \"recognises the special status of this island.\"\nIts implementation, the Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president added, was \"not negotiable\".\n\"The conduct of the British government throughout these negotiations has been duplicitous and disgraceful and is an effort to break yet another international agreement\".\nShe said: \"The attempts by the Tories and the DUP to undermine the protections and opportunities of the Protocol and impose a hard border must be opposed\".\nUlster Unionist assembly member Steve Aiken said it was \"self-evident\" the existing protocol was not working.\nHe said the party would consider the UK government's legal text and the EU proposals due on Wednesday.\nThese will focus on easing practical problems, rather than changing oversight arrangements.\nBut Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry MP said Lord Frost had \"chosen to enter into another layer of delusion\".\nMr Farry said short of the UK \"rejoining the Customs Union and Single Market, there is no alternative than for the UK to work with the EU in a spirit of partnership to achieve as many mitigations and flexibilities as possible.\"\nSDLP MLA Matthew O'Toole said Lord Frost's remarks represented a \"deliberate distortion of facts and contempt for people here\".\nHe said Lord Frost had negotiated the protocol, agreed to its terms and \"backed Boris Johnson's campaign to sell it during the last general election\".\nTraditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said: \"If, as Lord Frost says, it is the UK that governs Northern Ireland, then, there must be an end to the European Union's writ in this part of the United Kingdom.\n\"Put simply, it requires an end to the Protocol in all its parts.\" \nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he hoped the UK government was \"serious about moving on in partnership\".\nHe said Wednesday's EU proposals \"will deliver practical solutions to make the Protocol work better\".\nOn Monday, Mr Coveney accused the UK of repeatedly dismissing EU proposals for the protocol ahead of their publication."

      "text": "A majority of Stormont parties have backed proposals for exclusion zones banning anti-abortion protests outside sexual health centres in Northern Ireland.\nProtests and demonstrations would not be allowed within the zones.\nThe assembly voted on Tuesday, by 58 votes to 29, to allow the bill to complete its first key legislative hurdle.\nIf the legislation becomes law it would be the first of its kind in the UK.\nBut there remain several legislative hurdles before the bill would make it into law.\nGreen Party Northern Ireland leader Clare Bailey is behind the move and said it will protect staff and women accessing services.\nLaws allowing for the provision of abortion services in Northern Ireland took effect last March, after they were drawn up by Westminster.\nFollowing a public consultation, the government decided not to include powers to establish exclusion zones but said it would keep the matter \"under review\".\nMs Bailey proposals, which she brought through Stormont in a private member's bill, put the onus on the Department of Health to establish \"safe access\" zones outside premises providing abortion services. \nSpeaking during the second stage of the debate on Tuesday, Ms Bailey said it was \"not a rushed response\" to the number of protests outside sexual health and pregnancy counselling clinics, but what she had witnessed while volunteering for the Marie Stopes Clinic in Belfast almost a decade ago.\nShe said during her time she had experienced being \"spat at, I had holy water splashed on me, I was verbally abused, I had one young woman who was so distressed she ran into four lanes of oncoming traffic to escape the protestors\".\nShe called on MLAs to \"focus on what this bill seeks to achieve, and that is simply safe access to health care provision for all people and all staff\", insisting it was not an attempt to remove the right to protest.\nSinn Fein, Alliance, the SDLP and Ulster Unionists were among parties in favour of the move.\nBut the DUP and TUV said they were strongly opposed to it, arguing it could affect the rights of people to protest.\nDUP MLA Jonathan Buckley described the bill as \"regressive\".\n\"Neither I nor my party support abuse or harassment,\" he said, adding that he was concerned that \"anything from a conversation to a leaflet\" would be deemed criminal under the legislation.\nWhile TUV leader Jim Allister dismissed the suggestion that \"to oppose this bill is to endorse harassment, abuse or violence\".\n\"It is none of those things,\" he said.\nBut Sinn F\u00e9in's Emma Sheerin said while her party respected the right to protest, she argued that to justify the actions of those outside health clinics as protest \"is a huge disservice\".\nAlliance's Paula Bradshaw told MLAs that she would support the bill, because \"being at the vanguard of safety, wellbeing, privacy and dignity is exactly what this assembly should be about\".\nThe SDLP's Cara Hunter said she believed the legislation addressed forms of intimidation, harassment and violence which she believed were unacceptable, while Ulster Unionist Alan Chambers called on parties to put aside their views on abortion and look at the bill as addressing safety in accessing healthcare.\nLaws allowing for the provision of abortion services in Northern Ireland took effect last March, after they were drawn up by Westminster.\nFollowing a public consultation, the government decided not to include powers to establish exclusion zones but said it would keep the matter \"under review\".\nMs Bailey's bill would put the onus on Stormont's Department of Health to establish \"safe access\" zones outside premises providing abortion services.\nIn a statement to BBC News NI, Health Minister Robin Swann said: \"No one should be obstructed or intimidated from accessing lawful healthcare services for whatever reason, including the staff who work at these facilities.\"\nHowever, even though proposals have passed their second stage in the assembly on Tuesday, time remains short for the bill to complete legislative passage before the assembly election scheduled for May."

      "title": "Brexit: EU proposes fewer checks on GB-NI goods",
      "tags": "NI Brexit,European Commission,Brexit",
      "text": "The EU has released its plan for a reduction of post-Brexit checks on goods and medicines arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. \nNorthern Ireland has a special Brexit deal which keeps it in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU.\nBut it means goods arriving from Britain face checks and controls.\nThe UK government said it is studying the detail of the EU's proposals.\nThe new plan, which seeks to calm a long-running dispute over a key part of the Brexit agreement, would remove about 80% of spot checks, the EU said.\nThe EU said customs paperwork would also be cut by 50%.\nThe UK says the current arrangement imposes too many barriers.\nAt the start of the year, the new post-Brexit arrangement - known as the Northern Ireland Protocol - was introduced to help prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nIt involves keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods - but this, in turn, creates a new trade border with Great Britain. Unionists say this undermines their place in the UK.\nBrexit Minister Lord Frost said the protocol - which the UK originally agreed to - was harming the peace process in Northern Ireland and that it undermined the Good Friday Agreement. \nThe EU acknowledges that it has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses and is now attempting to ease that burden with what it calls \"a different model\".\nIt has produced \"bespoke arrangements\" covering food, customs and medicines. \nEuropean Commission Vice-President Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said he had listened to, and engaged with, those in Northern Ireland. \n\"Today's proposals are a direct, genuine response to their concerns,\" he said. \n\"We have put a lot of hard work into them to make a tangible change on the ground.\"\nHe said he looked forward to \"engaging earnestly and intensively\" with the UK government.\nSome firms in Northern Ireland affected by the protocol say supply chains are being disrupted, and while there may be opportunities, there are also some problems. \nOn Wednesday, a UK government spokesman said the next step should be a \"rapidly conducted\" round of intensive talks on both the UK and EU proposals.\n\"Significant changes which tackle the fundamental issues at the heart of the protocol, including governance, must be made if we are to agree a durable settlement which commands support in Northern Ireland,\" he said.\nA solution is needed that both safeguards the Good Friday Agreement and \"puts the UK-EU relationship on a stronger footing\", he added. \nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Ian Paisley told the BBC's Newsnight programme that Prime Minister Boris Johnson told him \"personally that after agreeing to the protocol he would sign up to changing that protocol and indeed tearing it up, that this was just for the semantics\".\n\"I do believe that the government didn't really want this to happen to Northern Ireland and they took a short term bet.\n\"The trouble is this has cost the business people of Northern Ireland \u00a3850m which we can't afford, so it's got to be fixed and it's got to be fixed fast.\"\nTalks between the EU and UK on the new proposals are now likely to go on for several weeks.\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the proposals were a \"major effort\" to address the post-Brexit trade rules between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\"Meats, whether they're chilled meats or other food stuffs, can come into Northern Ireland and if they're staying in Northern Ireland then the checks that are currently required will not be required,\" he said. \nThis would be dependent on proper sharing of data and proper labelling, he added. \nThere are also plans to give Northern Ireland politicians and other interested parties greater influence over the implementation of the protocol.\nHowever, the measures will fall short of UK demands to fundamentally change the protocol by removing the European Court of Justice (ECJ) from an oversight role.\nOn Tuesday, the UK's Brexit minister Lord Frost proposed plans for an entirely new protocol to replace the existing one.\nAs part of these plans, the UK government wants to reverse its previous agreement on the oversight role of the ECJ, which is the EU's highest court.\nThe agreement states that the ECJ has jurisdiction to rule on matters of EU law in Northern Ireland - so for example, if there was a dispute around complying with applicable EU law, the EU could take the UK to the ECJ.\nThe movement of food products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland have faced the biggest difficulties due to the EU's strict rules.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal: It is an agreement that means goods can pass freely across the Irish border. Basically, lorries don't have to stop and prove their goods follow EU rules when they go between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU).\nIt means Northern Ireland still follows some EU rules: As the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) no longer follow EU trade rules, some goods from there have to be checked when they arrive in Northern Ireland.\nBut some goods from Britain can't enter Northern Ireland at all: EU rules don't allow certain products, like chilled sausages, to enter its market. A grace period, where the rules don't apply, has been in place since January but no long-term solution has been found.\nRead more: The Northern Ireland Protocol explained\nThe EU says its new plan for food means that most products destined for consumers will not need to be physically checked when arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nA grace period, which means the protocol is not being fully implemented, currently means that supermarkets do not face a full range of controls.\nThe EU says its new proposals will go beyond this and cover more businesses.\nIt says the level of identity and physical checks will be up to 80% lower compared to other single market borders. \nHowever, it says for this to work it will need the UK to build properly equipped border posts at Northern Ireland's ports, allow access to real time trade data and implement \"only for sale in UK\" labelling.\nThe possibility also remains that some GB food products could be banned in Northern Ireland.\nThe EU maintains a \"prohibited and restricted\" list of food imports, which includes chilled meat products like fresh sausages.\nThe EU is proposing that \"national identity goods\", or those which do not have a non-GB supply chain, would be exempt, but that leaves open the possibility that some goods could be banned.\nOn customs, the EU is proposing what it calls a \"unique facilitation\" for paperwork, which it says will mean Northern Ireland importers can submit a greatly reduced amount of information.\nIt estimates this will halve the administrative burden.\nIt will also expand the concept of \"goods not at risk\" - this is an existing arrangement which Northern Ireland traders use so they do not have to pay EU tariffs on GB goods.\nThe EU says the combination of the agri-food and customs proposals will effectively create an \"express lane\" to help facilitate the movements of GB goods whose end destination is Northern Ireland.\nThe supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland has emerged as one of the most difficult issues. \nPharmaceutical distributors have warned that if the current protocol was fully implemented they would have to withdraw hundreds of products from sale in Northern Ireland.\nThe EU is now proposing to change its laws around the regulation of medicines to keep products flowing.\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d has previously said he will do \"whatever it takes\" to guarantee the supply of medicines.\nThis is a complicated area and the pharmaceutical industry will need time to assess if the plan will work.\nThe EU originally floated a version of this idea in July but the industry was unconvinced at that time.\nThe proposals for giving Northern Ireland politicians and other stakeholders a greater voice include the establishment of structured groups to provide a forum for discussion on key issues.\nIt would also see interested parties invited to some meetings of the Specialised Committee, one of the joint UK/EU bodies that oversee the protocol.\nThe EU says it also wants to create a stronger link between the Northern Ireland Assembly and the EU/UK Parliamentary Partnership Assembly.\nIt also intends to create a website to track which EU legislation is applicable in Northern Ireland.

If anyone has any questions please speak to your healthcare professional and report any adverse reactions via the Yellow Card scheme.\"\nThe Yellow Card Scheme is a website for reporting suspected adverse drug reactions. \nThe packs involved each contain 10 sachets that have the drug paracetamol in them. Other ingredients include an expectorant (intended to help clear phlegm) called Guaifenesin and decongestant called Phenylephrine. \nParacetamol is an everyday medicine that children can take, but, like other medicines it can be dangerous if your child takes too much. \nThe affected sachets, which contain 1000mg of paracetamol, incorrectly state that children aged 12 years and over can take 4 sachets (diluted in water) over a 24-hour period, which would deliver the equivalent of 4000mg of paracetamol in total. \nThe recommended dose by age, however, is:\nIt means someone who is 12-15 might potentially take 1000mg more than they should.\nChair of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society Thorrun Govind said parents should not panic if this has happened, but should follow the advice to monitor their child for any potential side effects. \n\"Nausea and vomiting or drowsiness are some of the things to look out for,\" she said. \nThe NHS says if your child has an extra dose of paracetamol by mistake, wait at least 24 hours before giving them any more. \nIf they have taken two extra doses or more, they may need treatment. \nThe batch numbers affected are:\nThe recall does not affect any other products that share the same product licence number (PL 12063/0104) but are distributed by other retail stores."

      "tags": "Domestic abuse,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Cardiff University",
      "text": "Covid-19 restrictions led to the sharpest fall in violent crime for at least 20 years, a report suggests. \nViolence was down by a third in England and Wales in 2020 compared with the previous year, according to research by Cardiff University. \n\"From a violence perspective, 2020 was the safest year on record,\" said co-author Prof Jonathan Shepherd.   \nBut the report also found that the easing of restrictions was \"accompanied by rapid increases\" in violence.\nCardiff University's Violence Research Group analysed data for the whole of 2020 from 133 NHS hospital emergency departments, minor-injury units and walk-in centres, across England and Wales.\nThe number of people who attended for treatment of violence-related injuries in 2020 was 119,111 - 56,653 fewer than in the previous year. \nThe reductions were across all age groups but were most marked among children under the age of 11, where violence levels were down by 66%. \nThe report concluded that this was \"likely to reflect the unprecedented restrictions imposed on free movement of citizens and businesses to limit the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic\".  \nWhen restrictions were eased in May 2020 to include the phased re-opening of pubs and bars, violence rose again, and by August it had reached pre-pandemic levels.\nDuring the second lockdown in the autumn, which included a 22:00 curfew, there was another sharp fall in the number of people needing hospital treatment for injuries. \nThe data highlights a clear link between violence and late-night drinking.\n\"Efforts to prevent serious violence should be concentrated in night-time economies where pubs, clubs and other licensed premises are located,\" says the report.\nAnother encouraging conclusion is that there has been a gradual reduction in serious violence over most of the past 20 years. \nThis is because of \"advances in inter-agency collaboration, data sharing and analysis, targeted policing and real-time CCTV surveillance,\" said Prof Shepherd. \n\"These factors are all vulnerable when the economy is stretched; they need constant attention.\"\nBut while the figures are clearly welcome, they do not tell the whole picture. \nHomicide in England and Wales has been rising since 2015, as has knife crime. \nAlso, not all violence ends with a visit to hospital. \nStatistics for the year ending March 2020 revealed that fewer than half of all violent incidents resulted in physical injury.\nThe effects of lockdown on domestic violence are still unclear because few of the hospitals in this survey were able to provide information on the location of violence. \nData from Cardiff A&E shows levels of violence in the home in the city were unchanged in 2020. \nHowever, other figures have shown an increase in demand for domestic abuse services across England and Wales. \nA 10% rise in domestic violence-related offences was recorded by the police in the year ending September 2020, which may reflect improved levels of police recording. \nThe picture is further complicated because a large number of domestic offences are never reported. \nOn Thursday the Office of National Statistics will publish annual figures on crime patterns, which will shed more light on what happened to violence during the pandemic.

      "text": "A wave of desperate 999 calls reported a car travelling the wrong way along the M4 motorway one February night.\nHelp wasn't able to arrive in time to stop it ending with one driver dead and another seriously injured.\nThe BBC Crash Detectives series producer describes how one driver's actions can have a far reaching and lasting impact on numerous lives.\nIt was edging close to 22:30 on a Friday night in 2019, with traffic flow on the M4 busier than normal.\nPenny Roberts and her family had spent the week in London and were now among that traffic, heading home to west Wales.\nIt was such a regular journey that she, and her partner Mark, had an established routine to share the driving. \nAs they neared Newport it would normally be her turn to drive, but that night Mark was at the wheel.\n\"We'd stopped at junction 24 to get coffee, I just didn't feel like driving so asked Mark to carry on instead,\" she recalls.\n\"I'm just so relieved that he did. I'm not sure we'd still be here if it wasn't for him.\"\nThey finished their coffees and rejoined the westbound carriageway, cruising at about 65mph.\nPenny rode in the passenger seat of her small Mercedes A class car. Her 23-year-old daughter, boyfriend and the family dog squeezed in the back seat; the boot crammed full of luggage.\nThey passed the slip road for junction 26 at Malpas, and were gaining steadily on the car in front when Mark indicated and moved out to the middle lane to overtake.\n\"At that point we were heading uphill, and all I could see ahead of me was red tail lights,\" he said.\nAnd then he did a double take. \n\"Amongst all the red, I saw the glare of white headlights, moving across from the left. I then realised very quickly that a car was on the wrong side of the road and it was coming towards us, at speed.\"\nHe stayed calm and planned a course of action.\n\"I decided to stay in the middle lane and just concentrate totally on the vehicle coming at us, on the grounds that if they swerved I would have to take evasive action,\" he said.\nA tense five or six seconds ticked by, before the silver Vauxhall Astra careered past in the outside lane, just half a metre from the driver side of their car.\nMark recalls looking in his rear view mirror to see the car behind them veering across all three lanes as its driver desperately avoided a collision.\n\"It all happened in a split second, but it was absolutely terrifying,\" said Penny.\n\"Mark's a very good driver - he saw the car and kept his nerve. \n\"I don't know how he had time to comprehend all of that, but he did. I can't be sure that I would have done the same.\" \nPenny, a former BBC Wales journalist, took out her phone and joined the flurry of motorists frantically dialling 999.\nAt the same time, Shifa Begum and her husband Walie were on the eastbound carriageway, travelling home to Weston-super-Mare.\nTheir three children, aged 10, six and 15 months, were all fast asleep in the back.\nHer husband, who was driving, suddenly asked: \"Can you see that? There's a car - it's going the wrong way!\"\nShe looked to her right, and saw they were keeping pace with a car as it travelled along the opposite carriageway.\n\"I grabbed my phone and called the police, but I was just so shocked that nothing was coming out of my mouth,\" she said.\nShe put her phone on speaker and let her husband do the talking.\n\"He was trying to stay calm, because we didn't want to wake the kids and scare them. All I could think was that I hope that person manages to get off the road.\"\n\"It's a Vauxhall Astra I think,\" Walie tells the operator. \"They're still going, they're not stopping.\"\n\"Are they going fast?\" asks the operator.\n\"Well, we're doing 50 now, and ... oh! There's been a crash! They've hit a car!\"\n\"Seeing the moment they crashed like that was just horrendous, I couldn't breathe, I felt physically sick,\" said Shifa.\n\"We slowed right down and Walie asked me should he go and help? He really wanted to stop, but we had kids in the car. I said there was no way he could just run across the motorway.\"\nRealising they had done all they could, they carried on. \n\"I was literally shaking, all the way home. My legs were like jelly. I just couldn't stop thinking about it,\" she said.\nThe silver Vauxhall Astra, which the callers had seen travelling in the wrong direction, had crashed head-on into a black one series BMW, in lane three of the westbound carriageway.\nAs Gwent Police forensic collision investigator Dean Burnett arrived at the scene, fire crews were working to free the 21-year-old driver of the BMW, who was seriously injured.\nThe 38-year-old woman at the wheel of the Astra had died.\nAs Mr Burnett carried out a painstaking analysis of the scene evidence, he needed to find out why the woman was travelling on the wrong carriageway.\nInquiries revealed how horrified witnesses saw her make a left-hand turn from the intersection at junction 28 in Newport. \nShe lived locally, and was thought to be familiar with the junction lay out - yet still drove up the wrong slip road, towards oncoming traffic.\nShe then continued for 2.8 miles before crashing into the BMW - but not without numerous close calls with other vehicles in the minutes beforehand.\nAt an inquest into the woman's death, the coroner said it was hard to understand why the driver did not realise her mistake and pull over on to the hard shoulder.\nBut blood tests revealed she was two-and-a-half times the legal alcohol limit to drive and she had also taken cocaine.\nMr Burnett said: \"I was under no illusions at all that that level of intoxication was a significant, if not the main contributory factor in this collision.\"\nThe 21-year-old BMW driver had life-changing injuries, but the terrifying reality faced by numerous other unsuspecting motorists that night, was captured on motorway CCTV.\nWith more than 20 years' experience investigating serious and fatal collisions, the impact of what he saw in the footage was not lost on Mr Burnett.\n\"There's some serious near misses. You can only imagine what those drivers are going through. It's horrific.\n\"Motorways are statistically our safest roads - because we're all going in the same direction, so the last thing you expect is something travelling towards you,\" said Mr Burnett.\nThe natural instinct for most drivers faced with that scenario, is to brake and swerve - and this is seen numerous times in the CCTV.\nBut he added that there are ways to be on guard to deal with such unexpected issues on the road - and that is to stay alert, and always be looking well ahead.\n\"Motorways especially are where drivers tend to switch off more, because the traffic is going in the same direction. Extend your observations at all times, so you can see any changes in road circumstances in front of you.\n\"It's more of an effort to do this at night, when you're tired and it's dark and you're less likely to be alert, but this is a good example of why, even when you're tired, you still need to have your wits about you.\"\nAs soon as she got home, Shifa Begum began searching online, desperate to know the outcome.\n\"When I saw that the woman had died, I just felt numb, I've never seen anything like that before and wouldn't like to see it again.\"\nAnd she pledged that from that day on, she would never drive on the motorway again.\n\"All these different scenarios just go through your head. I'm so scared now.\"\nPenny Roberts is still regularly travelling between west Wales and London - but two years on, the experience is never far from her mind.\n\"I can't drive down that stretch of road without thinking about how we could have all been killed, and how my other daughter would have been left alone.\n\"I feel desperately sorry for the man who was injured, as well as the woman's family and her children. But I'm also very angry. Cars are lethal weapons, and can destroy lives.\n\"A matter of seconds could have been the difference between life and death for the four of us.\"\nThe story of how police pieced together what happened was shown in The Crash Detectives on BBC One Wales.\nIf you or someone you know has been affected by the issues raised in this article, information on available support can be found on the BBC Action Line website."

      "tags": "Social care,Home care,Employment,Care homes,NHS England,NHS",
      "text": "Shortages of care staff, who support older or disabled people in the community, are causing major problems for hospitals, the BBC has learned. \nNHS chief executives say rising numbers of patients are stuck in hospitals in England due to a lack of care staff. \nThe situation is \"dire\", according to NHS Providers, which represents health service trusts.\nThe government says extra funding and a regular recruitment drive will help boost the care workforce. \nCare companies are facing acute problems in recruiting and retaining staff, according to a report which suggests there are now more unfilled care jobs than before the pandemic. \nThe annual Skills for Care workforce report is based on data provided by a representative sample of employers of England's 1.54 million care workers.\nThe researchers calculate that employers were failing to fill 8% of posts before the pandemic.\nFigures obtained since suggest this had fallen to below 6% by June 2020 - but by August this year the trend had reversed with 8.2% of care sector roles unfilled. \nThis amounts to more than 100,000 posts with no-one to fill them, says Skills for Care. \nIncreasingly, care companies are forced to turn down work supporting patients as they move from hospital back to their own homes or care homes. \nThose patients have to stay in hospital longer, putting more pressure on an NHS already struggling with Covid-19 and the waiting list backlog. \n\"We've just tipped over the point where delayed discharges are a bigger problem than Covid,\" said one hospital boss who asked not to be named. \n\"Roughly 100 beds blocked and domiciliary care providers are handing dozens of [patient care] packages back to the council as they don't have staff to deliver them,\" said another. \nA third manager had 140 patients ready to leave hospital, but the carer shortage meant \"patients are dying in hospital when their choice was home, a hospice or nursing home\".\nThe anonymous comments from more than 20 hospital bosses were gathered by NHS Providers, in response to a BBC request for information. \nThe organisation's deputy chief executive, Saffron Cordery, said the delays are particularly worrying as winter is about to put extra pressure on services. \nNot being able to leave hospital when they are ready can delay a patient's recovery and rehabilitation, said Ms Cordery, while those waiting for treatment face backlogs.\n\"It's vital that government delivers its commitment to place vital social care services onto a sustainable footing.\"\nShe also highlighted the need for \"crucially - a sustainable workforce, properly valued and respected for this vitally important work\". \nCare companies say the main factors making it hard to find and keep staff are: \nIn Sheffield, Tracey Hobson, a clinical manager at Northfield Nursing Home, says: \"Recruitment is an absolute nightmare\". \n\"You wake up in the morning and you're thinking, you know, I'm not going to be able to ensure that these people get the care that they deserve, and have enough staff to do it.\"\nTracey says the sector faces a national staff shortage. She personally receives about 20 messages each day from recruitment agencies, desperate to hire her. \n\"You know, I've got a job. I'm looking after people to the best of my ability.\"\nIn Buckinghamshire, Dr Kris Owden runs Caremark Aylesbury and is also a doctor who worked on hospital wards during the pandemic. \nThe firm pays relatively well and has managed to recruit enough new staff to replace most of those leaving but Dr Owden says they are still overstretched and have to refuse up to eight new people needing care each day.\n\"For us to be in this position before the winter, before the Christmas period is terrifying,\" he said. \nHe says a properly resourced care system would take pressure off the NHS and wants to see carers paid better, with a proper career structure and recognition of their skills. \nAmong his senior staff, supervisor Charlotte Backhouse and manager Vicky Hartgill - who are both normally office-based - are having to step in and do front-line work.\nOn top of her regular job, Vicky worked through the weekend and on Monday had an 05:00 start. Although she loves seeing clients, she says she is \"shattered\". \nShe added: \"We need to be able to recruit, we need to be able to recruit in a safe way and just have a bigger workforce.\n\"We do have to pick up the phone and change times. We do have to be creative with the care that we provide - and until we can get some more people through the door to support us, that's the way things will have to stay.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: \"We appreciate the dedication and tireless efforts of care workers throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond. \n\"We are providing at least \u00a3500m to support the care workforce as part of the \u00a35.4bn to reform social care.\n\"We are also working to ensure we have the right number of staff with the skills to deliver high quality care to meet increasing demands. \n\"This includes running regular national recruitment campaigns and providing councils with over \u00a31bn of additional funding for social care this year.\""

      "text": "The UK's largest commercial port says the supply chain crisis has caused a logjam of shipping containers.\nThe Port of Felixstowe, which handles 36% of the UK's freight container traffic, blamed the busy pre-Christmas period and haulage shortages.\nHowever, it said the situation has been improving over the last few days.\nShipping giant Maersk told the BBC it is re-routing some of its biggest ships away from the port.\nThe Financial Times first reported on Tuesday that Maersk was re-routing ships away from Felixstowe to other European ports, where smaller vessels will be used for UK deliveries.\nLars Mikael Jensen, head of global ocean network at Maersk, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Drive programme that some of its largest 20,000-container ships were waiting outside Felixstowe for between four to seven days.\n\"We've taken those measures because we saw, because of the big ships, there is a limit to how many berths they can call in Felixstowe, and because its slower, it took longer to handle every ship,\" he said.\n \"Instead of wasting time waiting, we progressed to the next stop, and arranged that the boxes are relayed from that port rather than wait for a week and then discharge.\"\nProblems at Felixstowe come as retailers and other groups warn of mounting concern about stocks in the run-up to Christmas trading.\nThe port has blamed several factors for the build-up of shipping containers, including the busy pre-Christmas peak, haulage shortages, poor vessel scheduling, and the impact of the pandemic.\nOn top of this, there are a high number of empty containers currently sitting at the port. Felixstowe said it is asking shipping lines to remove them as quickly as possible.\n\"The vast majority of import containers are cleared for collection within minutes of arriving and there are over 1,000 unused haulier bookings most days,\" the port stressed.\n\"However, the situation is improving and there is more spare space for import containers this week, than at any time since the beginning of July, when supply chain impacts first started to bite.\"\nIndustry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers with several sectors from retailers to domestic refuse collection affected. The government recently drafted in military personnel to help deliver fuel and to issue emergency temporary visa to foreign drivers.\nThe shortage has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic, Brexit, tax changes and a backlog of HGV driver tests.\nTim Morris, head of the Major Ports Group, which represents port operators, said the industry had been had been hit by a whole host of issues, including Brexit border changes, global demand for goods travelling by sea, and the pandemic. \n\"It has not been easy and there have been times of real stress on the ports system,\" he said. \"Ports have taken significant action to respond to the challenges and build resilience.\"\nThe problem is not just confined to the UK. Ports across the world have also suffered significant delays. Retailers have highlighted particular issues in China and east Asia, where pandemic restrictions and poor weather conditions have affected shipping.\nSarah Treseder, chief executive of the trade group UK Chamber of Shipping, said there are reports of dozens of ships forced to wait outside ports in America and Asia.\n\"We anticipate the disruption will continue while the underlying market volatility stabilises,\" she said."

      "tags": "Travel,Coronavirus vaccines,Apps,NHS",
      "text": "The NHS Covid Pass, used to show a person's vaccine status for travel and events, stopped working on Wednesday.\nThe feature, contained in the NHS smartphone app, usually allows users to access a barcode or text records about which vaccine doses they have had.\nInstead, users received error messages or a notice saying that high traffic volumes are \"limiting access to the service\".\nNormal access to vaccine records was restored after more than three hours.\n\"The NHS Covid Pass service was temporarily unavailable between 11:45 and 15:15 today as a result of a technical issue with a global service provider that affected many different organisations,\" NHS Digital said in a statement.\nOnline, many travellers expressed concern that they might not be able to prove their vaccinated status at airports or other departure points without the app.\nSome claimed they missed their flight because of the problem, while others reported being \"stranded\" at an airport unable to fly.\nJournalist Caroline Frost was among those affected, tweeting that she was \"kindly offered a later flight for \u00a3250 and an express PCR test at Heathrow for \u00a3119 - not happening.\"\nChuck Adolphy, a 24-year-old from Surrey, was at Gatwick Airport waiting to fly to Slovenia on holiday when he found the app was no longer working.\nHe told the BBC he tried to show staff working for EasyJet his paper vaccine card - which is not widely accepted a proof of vaccination - but that they were \"having none of it\".\nHe said he was turned away and missed his flight - and that EasyJet has refused to give him a refund.\nMr Adolphy said he did not know if the airline employees knew the outage was widespread at the time. But he described the situation as a \"shambles\".\nHe is now hoping to book a flight tomorrow instead.\nEasyJet later said in a statement that it was \"not aware of any significant impact\" due to the outage, but was offering passengers who could not board a free transfer to an alternative flight. \nIt is possible to save an offline version of the Covid Pass, which remains valid for 30 days. Some users simply screenshot their barcode, and iPhone users can also save a version to their Apple Wallet.\nBut those methods needed to have been done before the system went down.\nOther elements of the general-purpose NHS app, such as subscriptions, appeared to be working during the outage.\nThe Covid Pass is also required for entry to some events and locations in England, though that has become less common as restrictions have been relaxed at most entertainment venues.\nThe digital version is available for those over 16 years old who were vaccinated in England, Wales, or the Isle of Man.\nA paper version of the pass is also available as a letter for fully-vaccinated people in England. The letter is sent to the address on file with a patient's local GP surgery, but can take up to five working days to arrive, the NHS says.\nThe vaccine record in the NHS app is separate to the NHS Covid-19 app, which was widely used earlier in the pandemic to estimate exposure to those who tested positive to the virus, and \"pinged\" many people with self-isolation alerts."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,European Court of Justice,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Simon Coveney,Reality Check,European Union",
      "text": "The UK government has said it wants to remove the European Court of Justice from its oversight role as part of the Northern Ireland Protocol, saying as long as it continues the protocol will never survive. The EU, on the other hand, has said it would be very hard for the protocol to continue without the court's oversight. So what is the ECJ, what is its role in the protocol and what are the possible alternatives?\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg.\nIt is actually composed of two separate courts - the Court of Justice and the General Court. From 2004 to 2016 there was a third court, the Civil Service Tribunal, but its work is now done by the General Court.\nTo avoid confusion this article will refer to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to describe the work of the entire institution.\nIf you want to know more detail, or look up a specific case, you can do so here.\nIt's not to be confused with the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), which is a separate institution and is not part of the European Union.\nIt decides whether the institutions of the EU are acting legally, and it settles disputes between them.\nIt ensures that the member states of the EU are complying with their legal obligations as set out in the EU treaties and it allows member states to challenge EU legislation.\nIt interprets EU law at the request of national courts.\nTaken all together, this means that the ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, and pretty much everything else that the EU does.\nUnder the terms of the protocol - agreed jointly by the UK and EU as part of the Brexit deal - Northern Ireland continues to follow EU rules on product standards, which enable the free movement of goods in the EU's single market.\nMany goods need to be inspected when they arrive at Northern Ireland's ports and customs documents have to be filled in.\nThe agreement that created the protocol states that representatives from the EU have the right to oversee its implementation and application.\nIt also states that the ECJ has jurisdiction to rule on matters of EU law in Northern Ireland. \nIf there was a dispute around compliance with applicable EU law, the EU could take the UK to the ECJ, which would rule on whether the UK was in breach of its obligations under the terms of the protocol.\nIn any cases brought before the ECJ, the UK would participate in proceedings in the same way as an EU member state.\nBrexit Minister Lord Frost wants the ECJ's role in overseeing the protocol to be removed.\nIn a paper published in July, the government said it had only agreed to the ECJ's role because of the \"very specific circumstances\" of the protocol negotiation.\nIt now wants a new governance arrangement in which disputes should be \"managed collectively and ultimately through international arbitration\".\nThis objection to the ECJ's role can be linked back to the Brexit referendum. In fact it goes right back to one of the problems that British Eurosceptics have always had with the EU - the fact that European courts were able to rule on matters of EU law in the UK.\nDuring the Brexit campaign a key slogan for the leave campaign was \"take back control\".\nThen at the Conservative Party conference in October 2016, the new Prime Minister Theresa May said: \"We are not leaving (the EU) only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. That is not going to happen.\"\nVague promises to take back control of our laws suddenly became a very specific promise to end the jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK. It became a government red line.\nBut that did not stop the government signing up to the NI Protocol, complete with ECJ oversight. It is that which Lord Frost now wants to change.\nThe EU is bringing forward its own proposals on Wednesday, but these will focus on easing practical problems with the movement of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, rather than changing oversight arrangements.\nSpeaking early in October, European Commission Vice-President Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d  said: \"I find it hard to see how Northern Ireland would stay or would keep the access to the single market without oversight of the European Court of Justice.\"\nThere was also a strong response from Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney after Lord Frost reiterated that he wanted the ECJ removed from its oversight role.\nMr Coveney said the UK's demands on the protocol could \"cause a breakdown in relations\" with the EU.\nSpeaking to RT\u00c9's Morning Ireland programme he added that the UK's dismissals were now \"more serious\", given the comprehensive compromise proposals the EU is bringing forward.\n\"Each time the EU comes forward with new ideas, new proposals to try to solve problems, they are dismissed before they are released and that is happening again this week,\" Mr Coveney said.\nHe said dismissals were being seen across the EU as \"the same pattern, over and over again\" by the UK.\nWe need to wait and see what exactly the UK government is proposing, but some hypothetical alternatives have been mooted.\nOne alternative that has been suggested is the model associated with dispute resolution used in the main withdrawal treaty with the EU and bilateral treaties the EU has concluded with neighbouring countries like Ukraine.\nUnder these treaties, proceedings go to an arbitration panel before proceedings in front of the ECJ, but only for questions of interpreting EU law.\nDavid Phinnemore, professor of European politics at Queen's University Belfast, says one problem with this from the EU's point of view is that the EU is clear that the only body that can interpret EU law is the ECJ - not an intermediary such as the arbitration panel.\nBut Anton Spisak, trade policy lead at the Tony Blair Institute, suggests it could provide a \"landing zone\" for the UK government and the EU.\nHe says that while the ECJ is the only body that can interpret EU law, the arbitration panel acts as the \"default arbiter\".\nIn his view the UK is ultimately prepared to accept a \"more narrow role for the ECJ not as a default, but only in those circumstances where EU rules apply\".\nHe says: \"The arbitration panel is the one making the ultimate decision, but the panel has to take the views of the ECJ into account.\n\"This is the way the EU has dealt with other third countries applying EU law in the past and the reason why I think it is a realistic proposition is that the EU recently put it on the table with Switzerland.\"\nAnother possible alternative is something along the lines of the EFTA Court, which is responsible for the three countries which are members of the European Economic Area (EEA): Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.\nProf Phinnemore says: \"In theory that is a a possible alternative, but it would mean setting up a dedicated court for Northern Ireland.\"\nHe also points out that the EFTA Court rules in line with the jurisprudence of the ECJ.\nMr Spisak also does not believe the EFTA Court is a practical solution.\nProf Phinnemore says: \"There is no precedent that allows anything other than the ECJ to rule on EU market rules.\n\"If you want to be part of the single market for goods you have to follow EU rules and I cannot see the EU moving away from that\".\nMr Spisak says: \"In a sensitive debate like this it is useful to start from the first principals. If there are EU rules in the protocol, whether now or in some kind of renegotiated agreement, it is simply unavoidable for the ECJ to be an arbiter of those rules. \n\"And because it is unlikely to have a protocol where EU rules don't feature at all, both sides have to find a way of accommodating the ECJ within that agreement.\"\nBut he believes there is a possible compromise to be struck.\nHe says: \"There is a technical solution that looks like a more standard international treaty but involves the ECJ in specific circumstances. The real difficulty is political.\n\"The EU compromising on the ECJ would signal to the UK that it is ready to renegotiate a key part of the protocol, which it has said it wouldn't do.\"\nAt the moment, things remain uncertain.\nBBC News NI's Economics and Business Editor John Campbell says there are two schools of thought about how this latest negotiation is shaping up.\nThe first is that Lord Frost's hard line on the ECJ is standard pre-negotiation tactics, aimed at grinding out another concession or two.\nAfter all the Brexit process has always delivered a deal, even at times when it seemed improbable.\nThere is another view, hinted at by Mr Coveney, that maybe the UK doesn't want a deal unless it's total victory.\nUnder that scenario the UK would go through the motions before triggering Article 16.\nIt would use this to gut the protocol while calculating that the EU's ability to retaliate is limited or or at least would take a long time to amount to anything.\nWe should find out which view is right by the end of this year."

      "text": "Opposition parties are calling for a health board to release the full 2013 report into \"worrying standards of care\" at a mental health unit.\nThe Holden Report warned the Hergest unit at Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor, was \"in serious trouble\". A redacted summary was released in 2015. \nIn June, the Information Commissioner's Office told Betsi Cadwaladr health board to release the full report after a Freedom of Information request.\nBut it appealed against the decision.\nThe health board said \"publishing this full report would breach the confidence of those members of staff who contributed to it\".\nA review of the 42-bed Hergest psychiatric unit was commissioned after complaints by staff.\nThe report's author, Robin Holden, said staff relationships had \"broken down to a degree where patient care is undoubtedly being compromised\".\nIn a statement at the time, Betsi Cadwaladr said action had been taken to address the report's recommendations, including a restructuring of the board's management of mental health services.\nA separate inquiry into the Tawel Fan mental health ward at another north Wales hospital - Ysbyty Glan Clwyd - led to the board being put into special measures by the Welsh Government in 2015. The board remains in special measures to this day. \nOn 8 May 2019, a request was made for \"a copy of the full Robin Holden Report, redacted only to the extent needed to protect patient confidentiality and the identity of the whistleblowers\".\nThe request was refused, leading to a review of the decision by the Information Commissioner.\nIn a decision notice issued on 30 June, Catherine Dickenson from the Information Commissioner's office upheld the complaint and called on Betsi Cadwaladr to \"disclose a full copy of the report with only the names of individuals subject to the grievances redacted\". \nBut Betsi Cadwaladr has this week appealed against the decision.\nHefin Jones-Roberts' adopted daughter Elizabeth was admitted to the Hergest unit in 2006 when she was 18 years old, diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n\"There was a lady there in a wheelchair and she said to me 'the way they bully your daughter is unbelievable. If only I had a camera on this wheelchair to show what they're doing once you leave this ward',\" he said.\n\"That really frightened me. There's no doubt about it - this had left a scar on my daughter. But she's coming through that tunnel now and we are so glad of it.\"\nThe health board's interim chief executive Simon Dean said: \"We have a duty of care to our employees and are concerned that publishing this full report would breach the confidence of those members of staff who contributed to it. \n\"Since this report was produced in 2014, we have taken a range of actions to improve standards of care on the Hergest Unit. \n\"Reports from unannounced inspections of the unit by Healthcare Inspectorate Wales show that standards of care, staff morale and leadership arrangements have improved in recent years.\n\"We encourage anyone with concerns about the care that they or a loved one have received to contact us directly,\" he added.\nConservative Member of the Senedd for Clwyd West, Darren Millar said: \"The deliberate attempts to stifle its publication are unhelpful and undermine trust between the health board and the people it serves.\n\"The public have a right to know whether scandals such as Tawel Fan could have been avoided and the publication of this report may help to shed a light on these issues.\"\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman called on Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething to intervene \"to ensure that this cover-up comes to an end now\".\nRhun ap Iorwerth MS said: \"Family members have fought hard to get this document out into the open. The health board's management have fought to keep it secret every step of the way and that begs many questions.\n\"If there's nothing wrong, what have you got to hide?\"\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme, Labour's MS for Wrexham and the Welsh Government's Environment Minister, Lesley Griffiths, said: \"I think if you can publish information, it's always good to be very transparent and this is something obviously the minister for health and social services will be discussing with the health board.\""

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),China,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) says a new taskforce may be the last chance to find the origins of Covid-19.\nIt has nominated 26 experts to join the body, the Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins of Novel Pathogens (Sago). \nMore than a year-and-a-half since the virus was detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the question of how it first emerged remains unclear.\nThe team will consider if the virus jumped from animals to humans in Wuhan markets or leaked in a lab accident.\nChina has strongly refuted the second theory.\nIn February, a WHO team tasked with investigating Covid's origins flew to China and concluded that the virus had probably come from bats but that more work was needed.\nThe team called the lab leak theory \"extremely unlikely\".\nBut the WHO's director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, later said the investigation had been hampered by a lack of data and transparency from China.\nThe proposed members of the Sago group include six experts who visited China as part of the previous team.\nAside from coronavirus, Sago will also look into the origins of other high-risk pathogens.\n\"Understanding where new pathogens come from is essential for preventing future outbreaks,\" said Dr Tedros said.\nIn a joint editorial in the journal Science, Dr Tedros and other WHO officials said \"a lab accident cannot be ruled out\".\nMichael Ryan, the WHO's emergencies director, said Sago's work may be the \"last chance to understand the origins of this virus\".\nThe announcement of the new group comes as CNN reported that China was preparing to test tens of thousands of blood bank samples taken in the early months of the pandemic. \nBut Chen Xu, China's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said Sago's work should not be \"politicised\".\n\"It is time to send teams to other places,\" he said.\nTulip Mazumdar, Global Health Correspondent\nAlmost two years since the start of the pandemic, we still don't know how or when the deadly Sars-Cov-2 virus emerged. Investigating new viruses is always extremely complex, but scientists have been able to find the source of the two previous coronavirus outbreaks - both of which have emerged from animals.  \nIt's been nine months since the last WHO-convened mission returned from Wuhan, saying a similar animal spillover was the most likely source of the pandemic. But questions continue to be raised about a potential accident at a Wuhan lab which studies coronaviruses and keeps thousands of bat samples. China has strenuously denied this. \nThe WHO says China still hasn't shared crucial data from the earliest days of the pandemic. The UN agency - which has been caught in the firing line between China and the US's bigger geopolitical fight on this issue - has been hardening its language on investigations into a lab leak theory. \nThe science is becoming increasingly politicised, with China so far refusing to allow international scientists back into the country.  \nIt's hoped this new Sago body with experts from 26 different countries will be able to break this impasse, and finally get some much needed answers so the world can better prepare for future outbreaks.

They [the government] should be held accountable, there should be a separate investigation into the Wales Covid situation.\nShe added the lives of her and her mother and sister have changed \"unimaginably\" since Robert's death. \n\"We're not living any more we're just getting through one day at a time. \n\"I hope lessons have been learned from it but it doesn't take away the fact that we're not going to see my Dad again and it could've been avoided. \n\"He died in the second wave, so by then, things should've been better, they should've improved and they hadn't by the second wave.\" \nHelen Whyley, director of the Royal College of Nursing in Wales, also said an apology was unlikely to be enough for healthcare staff. \n\"I'm sure for some families that [the apology] will bring them a degree of comfort, but for my members and for nurses who lost colleagues during this pandemic, I'm not sure an apology is going to be enough,\" she said. \n\"I think we really do need to understand the lessons that we need to learn from what happened.\"\nMeanwhile, Anna-Louise Marsh-Rees, co-founded Covid Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru after the death of her father, Ian, told BBC Wales Today the MPs' report highlighted the need for a Wales-specific Covid inquiry. \nShe said: \"It [the report] almost had to be just England because there are so many differences in the way the four nations made decisions handled the situation, so it would be almost impossible to cover that easily. \n\"Even more so it highlights the reason each nation needs to look at the way they handled the pandemic in isolation.\"\nThe Welsh government said: \"The first minister has made it clear that the UK-wide inquiry should fully encompass all decisions made in Wales.\n\"Some actions and decisions in the pandemic response were taken at a UK level on a four-nations basis - we have always been open to working together where there are shared decisions and shared responses.\"\nDr Ian Frayling, a senior cancer pathologist from Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan, said he contracted Covid-19 at the end of February 2020. \nHe said he was ill with the virus initially, before he started to feel fatigued with long Covid a few weeks later.\nHe said the report highlighted a need for specialist long Covid clinics in Wales, as there are in England. \n\"This is a thing that's specific for Wales. For me I am approaching my day 600 and I'm still affected. \n\"I've had to go for England for MRI scans, I've got damage in at least six organs.\"\nDr Frayling said the Welsh government's decision not to set up long Covid clinics was \"perverse\" and \"absolutely dangerously stupid\".\nThe Welsh government said it was providing an \"individual tailored approach\" to long Covid so they can access services as close to home as possible. \nA spokesperson added: \"People who require more specialist support, which is only available from hospital-based services will be referred via their GP or healthcare professional. \n\"As we are learning more about long Covid, the programme will be reviewed on a six-monthly basis.\""

      "text": "A record Euromillions jackpot will roll over after no ticket holder won in Tuesday's draw. \nBut the \u00a3184m prize will not be added to for the next draw on Friday as it has reached its maximum level.\nThe previous largest UK prize was in 2019 when an anonymous ticket-holder won the \u00a3170m Euromillions jackpot.\nCamelot's Andy Carter said \"any money that would have gone into the jackpot will now boost prizes in the next winning prize tier\".\nTuesday's winning numbers were 06, 13, 22, 45, 49 with Lucky Stars 10, 11. The Millionaire Maker Selection was ZKZF66866.\nThe National Lottery said a \"huge influx of players\" before the 19:30 BST cut-off time caused its website and app to run slower than normal - although some customers said they were unable to access the website at all.\nSpeaking ahead of the draw, Mr Carter said he had seen a wide range of reactions from winners over the years.\n\"I've seen people be sick with excitement, I've seen people resign their job on the spot, I've seen people jumping up and down.\n\"I've known husbands who haven't told wives and wives who haven't told husbands, I've been to homes where there's literally a party going on already,\"  said Mr Carter, whose job it is to advise winners.\nThe jackpot for Euromillions - which is played in nine European countries - is currently capped at \u20ac220m, meaning that once it reaches that point it cannot roll over again and add extra prize money. \nThat cap was reached on Friday and the jackpot will stay at the same level for five draws unless it is won.\nBut on the fifth occasion the jackpot amount must be won - even if that means sharing it among all those ticket-holders who are just one number short.\nThe Euromillions jackpot cap rises by \u20ac10m whenever it is won somewhere in one of the nine countries. The cap was most recently raised in February this year. It can keep rising until a maximum of \u20ac250m.\nMr Carter or one of his colleagues would be among the first people to speak to any winner, to provide them with advice and put them in touch with previous winners.\n\"If you've won a large amount of money, the best thing you can do is go and have a cup of tea with another winner, because they're the people that will truly understand,\" Mr Carter said.\nWith \u00a3184m under their belt, a UK winner could buy a house in each of the top 10 priciest streets in the UK, including in Kensington Palace Gardens in London, where the average house price is nearly \u00a330m."

      "text": "We all knew it was coming, but now it's official: Squid Game has become Netflix's biggest ever series launch.\nThe Korean drama was watched by 111 million users in its first 28 days, knocking Bridgerton (82 million) off the top spot.\nNetflix counts a view as anyone who's watched two minutes of an episode.\nNetflix's vice president for content in Korea, South East Asia, Australia and New Zealand says the show's success is \"beyond our wildest dreams\". \nMinyoung Kim told CNN: \"When we first started investing in Korean series and films in 2015, we knew we wanted to make world-class stories for the core K-content fans across Asia and the world.\n\"Today, Squid Game has broken through beyond our wildest dreams.\"\nThe nine-part series, which debuted in September, tells the story of a group of misfits taking part in a series of children's playground games.\nThere's a prize of 45.6bn Korean won (\u00a328m) up for grabs, which doesn't sound too bad until you realise if you lose, you get killed.\nFrom celebrities to sports stars, everyone's been talking about Squid Game.\nThe show's actors have shot to international fame - Jung Ho-yeon, who plays Sae-byeok, has gained 14 million Instagram followers since it launched on 17 September, Forbes says. \nSo what's the secret to the drama's success?\nWarning - the rest of this article contains some mild spoilers... \nSimilar in some ways to The Hunger Games, or the 2000 movie Battle Royale, the show focuses on a group of people in South Korea desperately in debt.\nThey're first tricked (then volunteer) into playing a deadly tournament of children's games, realising this may be their only chance to win the money they need to survive.\nChloe Henry is a fan of Korean shows and says Squid Game stands out from the others.\n\"It's not something that's been done before,\" the 26-year-old from Sheffield tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n\"With other shows, you can guess what's going to happen whereas this one is more 'wow' - a shock that you weren't expecting.\"\nShe feels the characters and intense acting keep you connected to the show.\n\"The actor who plays Seong Gi-hun, his emotion was so raw and it was so interesting to watch.\"\nSeong Gi-hun is a loveable gambling addict with huge debts and facing the loss of his daughter. He's the show's main character.\nChloe says the drama also gives viewers a different perception of South Korea.\n\"People in general think of South Korea as a big flash country with a lot of rich people, so it's nice to see the other side that is not really spoken about, like the struggle and poverty.\"\nKorean influence has grown massively in the UK. \nPeople here Googled Korea-related topics in October more than ever before, according to Google Trends data, and last month the Oxford English Dictionary added 26 new words of Korean origin to its latest edition to ride \"the crest of the Korean wave\".\nAs in the Oscar-winning Korean film, Parasite, the hardship seen in Squid Game is what makes it appealing to an international audience, says Dr Hye-Kyung Lee - who's researching the rise of K-drama and K-pop at King's College London.\n\"These dramas or films are entertaining, and they have something unique which can strike a chord with people around the world.\n\"They present a critique of society and social economic conditions, which people can relate to through the characters.\"\nDr Lee says other Korean dramas do touch on issues of society, economy and politics, but Squid Game has been far more direct in its approach.\n\"It's serious, the message is extreme and I think that reflects what's happening right now.\"\nThe violence, which means the show's not recommended for anyone under the age of 15, is part of Squid Game's appeal for Chloe.\n\"Other Korean shows can be quite modest, they don't show blood, nudity and they blur out weapons. \n\"It's nice to be able see things and be unexpected.\" \nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

      "title": "Toy shops warn of Christmas shortages amid port delays",
      "tags": "Companies,Christmas,Retailing,Shipping industry,Felixstowe,Haulage",
      "text": "One of the UK's biggest toy retailers is warning delays at UK ports will result in shortages this Christmas. \nGary Grant, boss of The Entertainer, said it would get harder to get stock to the right places at the right time.\nBarbie dolls and Paw Patrol toys are among the children's favourites he expects to run out fast.\nThe government said that Felixstowe had reported \"improved capacity over the past few days\". \nA container logjam at ports, including Felixstowe, and a shortage of HGV lorry drivers has sparked widespread concern among retailers about future stocks.\nMr Grant said his 170 shops are looking \"very full right now\". But he added that demand \"will outstrip availability\" because there aren't enough drivers to move the company's stock. \n\"There'll never be toy shops with no toys. There will be toy shops without all the toys that they would normally expect to have due to the shortages, and that is largely down to transportation and warehouse issues, rather than there being a shortage of toys.\"\nThe shortage of drivers means that shipment containers are being offloaded but left stacked on the quayside waiting for collection. The dearth of drivers also means there is a delay in returning empty containers for re-use.\nThe problems come at the busiest time of the year for retailers, when most goods are imported from Asia to sell during Christmas trading. \nThomas O'Brien, managing director of Leeds-based toy designer Boxer Gifts, which manufacturers its products in China, said there's \"plenty of stock\" but the real problem is that \"everything takes longer and is horrendously more expensive\" which means the company \"will be struggling to keep price increases to anything lower than 10%\".  \nItems that are in short supply include a sloth soft toy and the moody cow stress ball.\n\"Ironically the moody cow which we're short of is almost a nice acronym for how feel at the moment,\" he added.  \nWhile there are alternative toys, Mr O'Brien said the firm has lost six weeks of \"planning time\" to be able to re-stock at short notice. \nHe said containers shipped from Qingdao, China to Felixstowe are costing him $15,000 (\u00a311,003) rather than the normal rate of $2,500 in 2020.\nEntrepreneur Jack Griffiths, co-founder of loungewear company Snuggy, said he is expecting containers on five different ships, holdings \u00a31m worth of Christmas items, to arrive over the next week but they will now be delayed by three weeks. \n\"We're seasonal and we have to make the most of these months, 80% of our turnover comes from October to February.\"\nIn November, the business usually takes \u00a3500,000 worth of sales which Mr Griffiths said he \"probably won't be able to get in if we don't get that stock in time\". \nThe company has already run out of the SnuggyPod product which was due to arrive two weeks ago. Mr Griffiths said the product \"probably won't arrive for three weeks at Felixstowe and then it'll take three weeks to get them out of the port due to the driver issues\". He added that because the SnuggyPod is the firm's original design, there aren't any alternatives. \n\"As the weeks go by I can only see it getting worse which is just something we don't want to think about\". \nMr Griffiths anticipates he will have to get products shipped by railway and air rather than sea. It comes after \u00a3400,000 worth of his stock was delayed earlier in the year when it got stuck on the Ever Given ship which blocked the Suez Canal.\nSteve Parks, director at Seaport Freight which deals with food shipments from overseas as well as other goods, says moving products from Rotterdam port to Felixstowe is delaying goods by two to three weeks.\n\"So things like coconut milk, frozen fish and carpets are being delayed from China.\"\nWhile Mr Parks said Britain's shortfall in HGV drivers is \"largely\" to blame for the congestion at the port, other countries are experiencing problems, including the US and China.\n\"This is absolutely the worst period I have known, ever,\" he said. \"We can't get space on ships coming out of the Far East.\"\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said that fluctuating capacity at ports \"has been exacerbated by the ongoing global container and HGV driver shortages\".\n\"All ports across the UK remain open to shipping lines with Felixstowe reporting improved capacity over the past few days and the government continues to work closely with the freight industry, to tackle the challenges faced by some ports this autumn,\" the spokesperson said.\nAndrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said there was \"no need to panic buy\" but advised customers to start their normal shopping process earlier.\n\"If you see something you want, now is the time to buy as retailers have most of their Christmas stock, but we can't guarantee having supplies of everything over the next few weeks\".\n\"It's a challenge for small retailers because they don't have the cash to stockpile,\" he added.  \nThe UK's biggest commercial port Felixstowe told the BBC that it currently had 50,000 containers which were waiting to be collected, due to a shortage of HGV lorry drivers. \nOfficials at the port have asked the shipping lines to reduce their empty container stocks as \"quickly as possible\".\n\"It's not the port of Felixstowe affecting the supply chain, it's the supply chain affecting the port of Felixstowe,\" it said, adding that the problems are \"similar at all major UK ports\". \nDanish shipping giant Maersk has been forced to divert some of its larger ships from Felixstowe to ports in the Netherlands and Belgium to avoid delays. Smaller ships are then transporting the goods to the UK.\nA spokesman for the port of Rotterdam said it has been busy over the last couple of weeks, but said: \"It's more to do with Covid than anything else because of the balance of empty and full containers being in the wrong place.\"\nThe pandemic is also being blamed in part for bottlenecks at US ports. President Joe Biden will meet with major US retailers as well as the bosses of ports on Wednesday to address the issues.\nSultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chief executive Dubai-based DP World, the global logistics giant which operates out of Southampton and London Gateway, said \"nobody knows how long it's going to take\" to resolve the congestion and shipping container shortages. \n\"I think it's going to take a long time,\" he said, adding: \"The problem is complicated because you have a backlog of cargo.\"\nThe UK Ports Association trade group, said most UK ports were operating normally but that the shortage of drivers meant \"some delays\".\n\"This has meant that some freight is not being collected as rapidly as it would normally. The situation is impacting all types of ports, not just container terminals. \nIndustry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers. It has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic, Brexit and a backlog of HGV driver tests.\nThe government recently drafted in military personnel to help with the driver shortages and deliver fuel. Emergency temporary visas have also been issued to foreign drivers.\nConservative Party chair Oliver Dowden told the BBC that the government was increasing the number of people having tests and that he would \"expect that number to increase as we approach Christmas\". \nAsked about potential Christmas shortages, he told Sky news: \"The situation is improving, I'm confident that people will be able to get their toys for Christmas.\""

      "text": "A friend of the first victim of the serial killer Stephen Port told the police she knew he was responsible, an inquest has heard. \nChina Dunning, who went to college with Anthony Walgate, said: \"I was convinced it was the actions of Stephen Port, who I knew at the time as Joe Dean.\" \nMr Walgate was found outside Port's flat in Barking, dead from an overdose of the \"date rape\" drug GHB.\nPort went on to kill a further three young men.\nMs Dunning told the inquest at Barking Town Hall that she raised her concerns with police but felt that because Mr Walgate was young, gay and sometimes worked as an escort, officers might not be convinced.\n\"I think they probably assume 'Yeah, he takes drugs as well'. I just wanted to convince them that they shouldn't hold that stereotype. That wasn't what his character was.\"                                                                                                      \nShe said that nine months after Anthony's death she went to Snaresbrook Crown Court to see Stephen Port being sentenced for lying to the police.\n\"I knew this person was responsible for my friend's death and I wanted to see who it was and what was going to happen.\"\nMs Dunning told the jury she met Det Sgt Martin O'Donnell - one of the officers in charge of investigating the death - and told him Stephen Port's account of what happened was still untrue and that police needed to look at Port's computer.\nShe said that Det Sgt O'Donnell told her there were only two people who knew what happened that night and that it was a long and expensive process to seize and analyse a computer.\nShe alleges he told her: \"You need to let it go. You are not going to find out\".\nThe jury has already heard that by this time the police had had Stephen Port's computer for nearly a year - and they could have seen Stephen Port's browser history, including searches for raping and drugging boys.\nAfter killing Mr Walgate, Port went on to kill Gabriel Kovari, Daniel Whitworth, and Jack Taylor.\nFollowing a trial at the Old Bailey in 2016, Port was found guilty of all four murders and sentenced to a whole-life term.\nThe inquest at Barking Town Hall is examining whether police mistakes cost the lives of some of the victims by failing to stop Port sooner.

      "tags": "NI Brexit,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Brexit,Trade",
      "text": "A Brexit deal, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, is at the centre of a dispute between the UK and the European Union (EU).\nSince it came into force at the start of 2021 the protocol has disrupted trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK has suggested it could suspend parts of the arrangement by triggering part of the protocol known as Article 16.\nThe protocol allows lorries to deliver goods without having paperwork and goods checked when they cross the border from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland.\nThis arrangement was easy to maintain before Brexit. When both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were part of the EU, they automatically followed the same EU trade rules, which meant no checks were required.\nHowever, a new arrangement was needed after Northern Ireland (along with the rest of the UK) left the EU. The EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods, such as milk and eggs, arrive from non-EU countries. Similar rules exist in other areas, such as medicine licensing. \nTo try to get round the problem the UK and the EU negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is now part of international law.\nRather than checks taking place along the Irish border, it was agreed any inspections and document checks would take place between Northern Ireland and  Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) instead.\nThis was allowed after it was agreed that Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU rules on product standards (part of the EU's single market rules). \nChecks on GB goods take place at Northern Ireland ports to make sure they comply with EU laws. However, this has led to criticism that a new trade border has effectively been created in the Irish Sea. \nUnionists are strongly opposed to the checks because they don't want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK.\nAlso, not all checks under the protocol have been fully implemented yet. For example, supermarkets had reduced paperwork required under a temporary \"grace period\". However, the UK decided to extend these periods - something the EU said was a breach of international law. \nDespite signing up to the agreement in 2019, the UK government now says the protocol represented a huge compromise by the UK and has accused the EU of applying it too rigidly.\nThe UK is calling for changes, which include:\nArticle 16 is a set of three paragraphs in the protocol that allows either side to suspend any part of the agreement that causes \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\".\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss - now the UK's lead Brexit negotiator - said she would trigger Article 16 if the UK failed to secure changes.\n\"I want a negotiated solution but if we have to use legitimate provisions, including Article 16, I am willing to do that,\" she wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.\nIf the UK went down this route, it could prompt the EU to respond with measures that would impose tariffs (or import taxes) on aspects of trade between the two sides.\nThe EU has warned that any such move would \"lead to instability and unpredictability\".\nThe EU has set out proposals, but says a renegotiation of the text of the Protocol is out of the question:\nIn return, the EU wants extra safeguards to prevent products from Great Britain crossing into the Republic of Ireland.\nThe border is a sensitive issue because of the history of Northern Ireland and the agreements made to bring peace, which included the removal of visible signs of the border.\nThe fear is that if any infrastructure were to be installed, such as cameras or border posts, it could become a target and lead to political instability.\nDuring negotiations, all sides agreed that protecting the 1998 Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority."

      "text": "A mum whose daughter died after taking ecstasy has struck up an \"unlikely\" friendship with the mother of the teenager who supplied the fatal drug.\nKerry Roberts' daughter Leah Heyes, 15, collapsed after taking MDMA supplied by Connor Kirkwood.\nAfter agreeing to meet his mother, Tammy, Ms Roberts said she realised both had \"lost something\" as a result of the drug.\nThey are campaigning together to raise drugs awareness among young people.\nLeah died in May 2019 after she took the Class A drug with a group of friends in a car park in Northallerton, North Yorkshire.\nThe drugs were brought into the town by Connor, then 17, with another boy, Mitchell Southern, handing them over to Leah.\nConnor, from Dishforth, was jailed for 21 months last year but was released after serving six months of his sentence.\nThe mothers were introduced to each other through restorative justice - a process in which victims of crime can meet those who committed the offence against them.\nAlthough Ms Roberts did not want to meet Connor, it was suggested that by meeting his mother they would be able to share and understand each other's stories.\nIt gave Ms Kirkwood the opportunity to explain how she had been struggling for years to get help for Connor. \nHe had become involved in county lines gangs, which target vulnerable teenagers and use them to supply drugs. \nMs Roberts said: \"People will look at us and think it's an unlikely friendship.\n\"People will see us as two separate things but we are both grieving. They are both our children.\"\nMs Kirkwood described how, from the age of 15, Connor went from being a \"presentable young man\" to \"wearing trackies and not speaking to anyone\".\nShe knew he was involved in drugs and had reported him to police, but when questioned he would refuse to give any information about the gangs. \nDespite police involvement and her constant requests for help, Ms Kirkwood said they were never offered a drug referral or other support. \nShe said she had struggled with \"guilt and shame\" over whether she could have prevented Leah's death.\n\"I thought where have I gone wrong? How did this happen? What did I do?\" she said.\n\"And there's the guilt of my child being involved in someone else's child losing their life.\n\"I lost the child that had a passion for sport, was always smiling. I don't see a smile anymore.\n\"I have this 19-year-old man. I don't know who he is. I get to see him in bed and why do I get that? \n\"That's my guilt because that's not fair.\"\nLeah's mum, who described her daughter as her \"best friend\" said she had felt \"a lot of hatred\" and was initially against the meeting.\n\"There was hatred for Connor, for the situation. I thought how is it going to do me any good? I have nothing to say to her,\" she said.\nBut she said hearing the other side of the story had helped ease those emotions. \n\"I've read about county lines and there's more of an understanding and I'm thinking he was a child, he was 15. He wasn't a 21-year-old dodgy drug dealer.\n\"I get how my friends and my family were like: 'why are you meeting her?', but I think it's done us both some good.\"\nShe added: \"People who didn't know Leah would probably think she came from a rough family, that her mum didn't care.\n\"People have their own thoughts and I had those thoughts about Connor's mum. I didn't realise the story.\"\nBoth women are working together on a campaign called Do You Know MDMA? to get the message out that drugs kill. Ms Roberts has also launched a petition urging the government to make supplying drugs to under-16s a specific criminal offence.\nShe said: \"I feel like if we've told our story and tried to educate people then we can't do much more.\n\"Leah died and I can't let that be for no reason.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "A campaign to stop many BTec vocational qualifications being scrapped within two years has won the backing of MPs and Lords from across the parties. \nSome 118 have written to Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi asking him to re-think plans to use T-levels to replace them in England. \nPeers voted on Tuesday to amend the Skills Bill to demand a four-year transition before funding is removed\nThe government said T-levels offer students a route to university or work. \nAlthough they are at the same level as BTecs, T-levels are different in their design and include a work placement, which college principals say reduces the time available to re-take core GCSEs such as maths and English.\nColleges offering T-levels are likely to make GCSEs in English and maths an entry requirement, which means colleges are unlikely to offer places to those who need to do re-takes.\nIf a student does not have the GCSE grades to do A-levels or Btecs, then the entry requirements for the new T-levels will mean they have fewer options.\nThe letter to Mr Zahawi is in support of the Protect Student Choice campaign by a coalition of education organisations including many colleges and universities.\nBill Watkins, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said the shake-up was far from \"levelling up\".\n\"This is a hammer blow for social mobility,\" he said.\nGraham Pennington, chief executive of Sandwell College Group - which presently offers A-levels, BTecs and T-levels - said if many BTecs are scrapped \"possibly tens of thousands of young people would not have a clear route\". \n\"They're going to find it very difficult to come to college and gain qualifications that will help them get further in their life.\n\"It's a very risky scenario,\" he added.\n\"Lots of young people will find themselves with no real pathway to fulfil their goals and dreams, and that's incredibly sad.\"\nT-levels are the government's flagship new technical qualification being phased in over three or four years from 2020. \nDesigned with business, they require a minimum of 45 days of work placement. \nThree were launched in 2020 and a further seven have started this term. \nCadbury College in Kings Norton, Birmingham, offers students a choice of A-levels, BTecs or T-levels - which are equivalent to three A-levels. \nJess Cartmell is on a T-level childcare and education course at the college.\n\"I like the fact that it's something I definitely want to do and it will definitely take me to where I want to be,\" she said.\nAs well as learning about child development and childcare in college, Jess is spending two days a week on a placement in a nursery. \nBut she says she was unusual in knowing what she wanted to do at the age of 16. \n\"Less than half knew what they wanted to do, I think that's why most people chose BTecs and A-levels.\"\nYasna Rezael, who is doing two BTecs in Applied Science and Psychology, said: \"At the beginning of the year I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, so I chose applied science which means I can have a variety of choices at university.\"\nWithin a couple of years most 16-year-olds in England will be asked to choose between traditional A-levels or T-levels.\nThe letter to Mr Zahawi has been signed by three former Education Secretaries - Lord Baker of Dorking, Baroness Morris of Yardley and Lord Blunkett.\nThey argue the move \"will leave many students without a viable pathway after their GCSEs, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds\".\nThey are concerned that \"removing the vast majority of BTecs will lead to students taking courses that do not meet their needs, or dropping out of education altogether\".\nHigher and further education minister Michelle Donelan said the government would ensure there was a good range of high quality courses.\nShe said: \"T-levels are a route to university. They are a highly academic courses that focus on on certain skill levels and they're going to be highly respected not just by business, but by universities.\n\"We will ensure there's a good range of courses overall and ensure there is quality.\""

      "tags": "Nazi Germany,Neo-Nazism,Germany,Anti-Semitism",
      "text": "Germany's Protestant Church and other authorities have condemned the reuse of the vacant burial plot of a Jewish music professor for a neo-Nazi.\nThe remains of Prof Max Friedlaender were moved to another site in 1980, but a tombstone still commemorates him at the cemetery outside Berlin.\nA Holocaust denier was buried there on Friday after the grave's reuse was approved.\nThe local bishop called it \"a terrible mistake\". \nBishop Christian St\u00e4blein visited the site on Tuesday.\nThe burial plot is in one of Germany's largest Protestant cemeteries, in Stahnsdorf near Potsdam.\nProf Friedlaender, who died in 1934, was from a Jewish family but was a member of the Protestant Church. He was a bass singer and musicologist who specialised in the songs of Franz Schubert.\nGerman media report that Henry Hafenmayer, the man now buried in the plot in Stahnsdorf, was a Holocaust denier and blogger linked to several neo-Nazi groups. \nNeo-Nazi supporters laid wreaths on the grave, with nationalist messages and ribbons adorned with the Nazi-era iron cross symbol. They placed a portrait of Hafenmayer in front of Prof Friedlaender's shrouded tombstone.\nThe memorial was covered by the cemetery officials as is usual practice when a grave site is reused, the Church said.\nAmong the mourners was Horst Mahler, a neo-Nazi who has spent years in jail for racist incitement, German media report.\nIn an apologetic statement, Bishop St\u00e4blein said the burial was \"a terrible mistake and shocking occurrence, in view of our history\". The bishop, who leads the Church in that part of Germany, said \"we must immediately see whether and what we can undo\".\nPictures of the funeral were posted on Flickr by RechercheNetzwerk.Berlin, an organisation campaigning against anti-Semitism.\nThe organisation says Hafenmayer published anti-Semitic propaganda on his blog, called \"End of the Lie\", and glorified Nazism.\nThe Church said that Hafenmayer's representative had originally requested a more central burial plot, which had been refused by the cemetery authorities as there were many Jewish graves in that area. \nThe selection of Prof Friedlaender's former plot appears not to have been turned down because the cemetery records recorded him as Protestant.\nPolice and officers from the department of state protection were present at the funeral, the Church said, and the cemetery authorities were aware of the dead man's neo-Nazi links. \nThe president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany said that he was shocked at what had happened.\nJosef Schuster said it was unbearable that right-wing extremists should \"haunt\" the grave of Prof Friedlaender, and in doing so they had desecrated his memory.\nThe Protestant Church itself had approved Hafenmayer's being given a plot (though not this specific one) despite his neo-Nazi connections, on the principle that everyone had the right to a final resting place, it said, but there were no Protestant ministers at the ceremony.\nJewish graves and Holocaust memorials have been vandalised previously by neo-Nazis in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.\nThe Berlin official in charge of combating anti-Semitism, Samuel Salzborn, has launched a legal action against the mourners for allegedly disturbing the peace of the dead and for racial incitement."

      "tags": "TikTok,Lidl",
      "text": "A Scottish TikToker has won a victory against one of the UK's biggest food retailers after using her platform to campaign for a batch of \"lumpy\" oat milk to be removed. \nLuna, known as @lunahtic, wanted Lidl to act on her concerns about its oat milk, and after a one-woman campaign, succeeded in having it recalled.\nHer videos highlighting the problem won millions of views.\nLidl has now recalled all its oat milk with a use-by date in the next year.\nIt said fresh batches would be available in stores soon. \nThe 23-year-old student started monitoring the Lidl Just Free oat milk situation in August when she noticed a carton she had purchased was \"lumpy\" and \"smelly\".\n\"It's good milk and I've used it for years,\" she said. \"I use four cartons every week and I had bought a big batch of it with the sell by date of 2022. But I noticed when I opened it it was full of lumps and really smelly.\n\"I thought it was just the one carton but tried a few more and they were all like that. On 15 August I contacted Lidl HQ and asked for a refund for the \u00a311.20 I had spent on the milk. \n\"They never gave me a refund, but said their quality assurance team were looking into it. This went on for ages and I eventually got a refund for one carton.\"\nBy this point, Luna was concerned that the milk was still on sale. She took to her TikTok account to vent her frustration.\n\"Lots of people agreed with me and it got lots of views. But some people said I was storing it wrong, or it was lumps of oat, or I just needed to shake the carton, so I kept going back to buy the milk to show that it was off.\"\nOne of her videos went viral, racking up more than three million views in just a few days. To illustrate her concern, she dashes into the store, buys the milk and then pours out the carton outside to show the lumps.\nShe filmed herself cleaning up the mess afterwards.  \nLuna said: \"I did it to hopefully prove to people who were sceptical. Across the country people were tagging me in their videos of this milk and I thought they shouldn't be selling that.\"\nThe oat milk mission continued, with Luna contacting Lidl again.\nShe was sent \u00a350 in vouchers for the store as a gesture to say the company was taking her concerns seriously, which she spent on items for a food bank. \nMore TikTok videos followed and more calls to Lidl HQ. Luna said she was told that the product would not be recalled because it was \"not a health hazard\". \nThe next step was to refer the issue to her local environmental health department. They agreed to investigate.\nHowever, Monday brought a breakthrough - Luna revealed to her 57,000 followers that she had been sent paperwork which suggested the milk was finally being removed from stores.\nOne Lidl employee sent her a recall notice and gave her permission to share it.\nShe said: \"This document shows that all Lidl oat milk in the UK up to the date stated on the letter has to be recalled. \n\"I spoke to my local Lidl store manager who did tell me the oat milk had been recalled. I was told that new batches of the same oat milk will be back on the shelves really soon and you can guarantee I'll be first in line.\"\nThen, on Tuesday, her report to her local authority environmental health team brought results. \nThe reply said that they had spoken to colleagues at the London Borough of Bexley, which is the primary authority for Lidl UK stores, and they would look into the complaints.\nLidl told the local authority: \"Our latest oat milk withdrawal was last Wednesday which was sent to all regions. This was due to a number of complaints we had relating to the product being lumpy/white floating bits. Was confirmed not to be a health and safety risk.\"\nA spokesman for Lidl told the BBC on Tuesday: \"At Lidl, it is never our intention for a customer to be dissatisfied in any way and we work very closely with our suppliers to ensure that the products in our stores are of the highest possible quality. \n\"Following customer feedback we have recalled the affected batch and the product will be back in stores very soon.\"\nLuna said she was delighted her efforts had paid off.\n\"It's not very often you can get the attention of big company to do things and it might seem like a small thing but a lot of people had experienced the same issue.\""

      "tags": "Germany,Afghanistan,Angela Merkel,Taliban,G20,Humanitarian aid",
      "text": "Members of the G20 group of major economies have pledged to avert an economic catastrophe in Afghanistan.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country should not be allowed to \"descend into chaos\".\nThe virtual summit came as the UN urged world leaders to put billions of dollars into the Afghan economy.\nUS President Joe Biden stressed that aid should be provided via independent international organisations and not directly to the ruling Taliban.\nBut so far the money forthcoming has largely been counted in millions, just to provide emergency food and medicine.\nPledges include a promise by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to give \u20ac1bn ($1.15bn; \u00a3850m) to Afghanistan and to neighbouring countries taking in refugees.\nMrs Merkel, who did not stand for re-election last month and will step down as chancellor once a new government is formed, reaffirmed Germany's pledge of \u20ac600m.\n\"None of us has anything to gain if the entire monetary system in Afghanistan collapses or the financial system collapses,\" she told reporters. \n\"Then humanitarian aid can no longer be provided. Of course it's never easy to draw the line, so to speak, but to look on as 40 million people descend into chaos because there's no electricity supply or financial system - that cannot and must not be the goal of the international community.\"\nBy Yogita Limaye, BBC News, Kabul\nThe takeover of this country has caused a massive shock to an economy that was just about surviving. \nBanks were closed for many days after the Taliban seized control, and while many have opened now, accessing cash is still difficult.\nMany businesses shut down because their owners fled the country fearing for their lives. Many of those who had jobs haven't received salaries for months. \nWith no cash in the market, there has been a sharp rise in prices of day to day necessities including food. An already difficult situation created by war and drought has become much worse. \nWomen who had jobs and supported their families can no longer work and are now entirely dependent on handouts. \nIn Kabul, hundreds of people are still living in the open in tents with harsher winter months fast approaching. \nDevelopment aid given by foreign countries and agencies to Afghanistan, which helped to put cash into the economy, is all but frozen. This, on the ground, means that people who worked on development projects are out of jobs. \nThe global community faces a tough decision - how to reach the Afghan people, without recognising a Taliban government.  \nThe chancellor said the Taliban must grant access to all UN bodies delivering aid, and stressed the need for the rights and girls and women to be respected.\nMrs Merkel's words were echoed by Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who was hosting the virtual summit.\nHe said G20 countries had to have contact with the Taliban but that did not mean recognition of the Islamist group's government.\nNot all G20 leaders were present - Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin sent representatives - but Mr Draghi said all participants had agreed on the need to provide more aid.\nThe leaders also discussed ways to prevent Afghanistan becoming a haven for militants such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group, and the need to provide safe passage for foreign nationals and Afghans hoping to leave Afghanistan.\nThe summit came as Western and Afghan officials met in Qatar to discuss aid, terrorism concerns and evacuation of foreigners.\nThese were the first direct talks between the two sides since US troops left Afghanistan and the Taliban took power in August.\nThe recent international moves come as Afghanistan faces what aid workers fear is a severe humanitarian crisis. \nAfghans have been describing their difficulties to the BBC.\n\"Nothing can be found, and even if it is available, it's too expensive and not affordable,\" one retired man said. \"I was paid last year and am still waiting on my salary, I have nothing to eat with my children.\"\nAnother, a government employee in the northern town of Takhar, complained that officials were lying about the payment of salaries.\n\"I've received nothing,\" he said. \"What type government is this?\u202f If an employee doesn't go to work, there would be complaints and an investigation. But if he's not being paid, how can he survive?\"\nUN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned at a donor conference last month in Geneva that the poverty rate was soaring and public services were close to collapse. \nSome 40% of the country's GDP - national output - comes from aid, according to the World Bank. \nThe US froze $10bn (\u00a37.3bn) of the country's central bank assets after the Taliban captured Kabul on 15 August.\nFor the poor in Kabul, the priority is staving off starvation, the BBC's Jeremy Bowen recently reported from the Afghan capital.

      "title": "Brexit: EU proposes fewer checks on GB-NI goods",
      "tags": "NI Brexit,European Commission,Brexit",
      "text": "The EU has released its plan for a reduction of post-Brexit checks on goods and medicines arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. \nNorthern Ireland has a special Brexit deal which keeps it in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU.\nBut it means goods arriving from Britain face checks and controls.\nThe UK government said it is studying the detail of the EU's proposals.\nThe new plan, which seeks to calm a long-running dispute over a key part of the Brexit agreement, would remove about 80% of spot checks, the EU said.\nThe EU said customs paperwork would also be cut by 50%.\nThe UK says the current arrangement imposes too many barriers.\nAt the start of the year, the new post-Brexit arrangement - known as the Northern Ireland Protocol - was introduced to help prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nIt involves keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods - but this, in turn, creates a new trade border with Great Britain. Unionists say this undermines their place in the UK.\nBrexit Minister Lord Frost said the protocol - which the UK originally agreed to - was harming the peace process in Northern Ireland and that it undermined the Good Friday Agreement. \nThe EU acknowledges that it has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses and is now attempting to ease that burden with what it calls \"a different model\".\nIt has produced \"bespoke arrangements\" covering food, customs and medicines. \nEuropean Commission Vice-President Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said he had listened to, and engaged with, those in Northern Ireland. \n\"Today's proposals are a direct, genuine response to their concerns,\" he said. \n\"We have put a lot of hard work into them to make a tangible change on the ground.\"\nHe said he looked forward to \"engaging earnestly and intensively\" with the UK government.\nSome firms in Northern Ireland affected by the protocol say supply chains are being disrupted, and while there may be opportunities, there are also some problems. \nOn Wednesday, a UK government spokesman said the next step should be a \"rapidly conducted\" round of intensive talks on both the UK and EU proposals.\n\"Significant changes which tackle the fundamental issues at the heart of the protocol, including governance, must be made if we are to agree a durable settlement which commands support in Northern Ireland,\" he said.\nA solution is needed that both safeguards the Good Friday Agreement and \"puts the UK-EU relationship on a stronger footing\", he added. \nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Ian Paisley told the BBC's Newsnight programme that Prime Minister Boris Johnson told him \"personally that after agreeing to the protocol he would sign up to changing that protocol and indeed tearing it up, that this was just for the semantics\".\n\"I do believe that the government didn't really want this to happen to Northern Ireland and they took a short term bet.\n\"The trouble is this has cost the business people of Northern Ireland \u00a3850m which we can't afford, so it's got to be fixed and it's got to be fixed fast.\"\nTalks between the EU and UK on the new proposals are now likely to go on for several weeks.\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the proposals were a \"major effort\" to address the post-Brexit trade rules between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\"Meats, whether they're chilled meats or other food stuffs, can come into Northern Ireland and if they're staying in Northern Ireland then the checks that are currently required will not be required,\" he said. \nThis would be dependent on proper sharing of data and proper labelling, he added. \nThere are also plans to give Northern Ireland politicians and other interested parties greater influence over the implementation of the protocol.\nHowever, the measures will fall short of UK demands to fundamentally change the protocol by removing the European Court of Justice (ECJ) from an oversight role.\nOn Tuesday, the UK's Brexit minister Lord Frost proposed plans for an entirely new protocol to replace the existing one.\nAs part of these plans, the UK government wants to reverse its previous agreement on the oversight role of the ECJ, which is the EU's highest court.\nThe agreement states that the ECJ has jurisdiction to rule on matters of EU law in Northern Ireland - so for example, if there was a dispute around complying with applicable EU law, the EU could take the UK to the ECJ.\nThe movement of food products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland have faced the biggest difficulties due to the EU's strict rules.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal: It is an agreement that means goods can pass freely across the Irish border. Basically, lorries don't have to stop and prove their goods follow EU rules when they go between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU).\nIt means Northern Ireland still follows some EU rules: As the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) no longer follow EU trade rules, some goods from there have to be checked when they arrive in Northern Ireland.\nBut some goods from Britain can't enter Northern Ireland at all: EU rules don't allow certain products, like chilled sausages, to enter its market. A grace period, where the rules don't apply, has been in place since January but no long-term solution has been found.\nRead more: The Northern Ireland Protocol explained\nThe EU says its new plan for food means that most products destined for consumers will not need to be physically checked when arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nA grace period, which means the protocol is not being fully implemented, currently means that supermarkets do not face a full range of controls.\nThe EU says its new proposals will go beyond this and cover more businesses.\nIt says the level of identity and physical checks will be up to 80% lower compared to other single market borders. \nHowever, it says for this to work it will need the UK to build properly equipped border posts at Northern Ireland's ports, allow access to real time trade data and implement \"only for sale in UK\" labelling.\nThe possibility also remains that some GB food products could be banned in Northern Ireland.\nThe EU maintains a \"prohibited and restricted\" list of food imports, which includes chilled meat products like fresh sausages.\nThe EU is proposing that \"national identity goods\", or those which do not have a non-GB supply chain, would be exempt, but that leaves open the possibility that some goods could be banned.\nOn customs, the EU is proposing what it calls a \"unique facilitation\" for paperwork, which it says will mean Northern Ireland importers can submit a greatly reduced amount of information.\nIt estimates this will halve the administrative burden.\nIt will also expand the concept of \"goods not at risk\" - this is an existing arrangement which Northern Ireland traders use so they do not have to pay EU tariffs on GB goods.\nThe EU says the combination of the agri-food and customs proposals will effectively create an \"express lane\" to help facilitate the movements of GB goods whose end destination is Northern Ireland.\nThe supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland has emerged as one of the most difficult issues. \nPharmaceutical distributors have warned that if the current protocol was fully implemented they would have to withdraw hundreds of products from sale in Northern Ireland.\nThe EU is now proposing to change its laws around the regulation of medicines to keep products flowing.\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d has previously said he will do \"whatever it takes\" to guarantee the supply of medicines.\nThis is a complicated area and the pharmaceutical industry will need time to assess if the plan will work.\nThe EU originally floated a version of this idea in July but the industry was unconvinced at that time.\nThe proposals for giving Northern Ireland politicians and other stakeholders a greater voice include the establishment of structured groups to provide a forum for discussion on key issues.\nIt would also see interested parties invited to some meetings of the Specialised Committee, one of the joint UK/EU bodies that oversee the protocol.\nThe EU says it also wants to create a stronger link between the Northern Ireland Assembly and the EU/UK Parliamentary Partnership Assembly.\nIt also intends to create a website to track which EU legislation is applicable in Northern Ireland.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Covid-19 pandemic has made celebrities out of scientists, who have graced the daily news headlines and gained large social-media followings. \nBut this rise in prominence has come with online abuse and even physical harassment.\nThe journal Nature surveyed scientists, who described receiving threats of violence after media appearances.\nDiscussions about vaccines or the drug ivermectin were common triggers for harassment.  \nIn the past, scientists have faced abuse when discussing climate change or previous vaccination campaigns. \nThe self-selecting survey of 321 people working in fields relevant to Covid found more than a fifth had received threats of physical or sexual violence. \nWhile this is not representative of all scientists and cannot accurately reveal the scale of abuse, it provides a glimpse into some of the personal experiences of those who came into the public eye to give information during the global disease outbreak. \nSix people who responded to the questionnaire said they had been physically attacked following media appearances.\nSome of the more extreme cases have been widely reported. Leading Belgian virologist Prof Marc Van Ranst ended up in a safehouse after being targeted by a far-right trained sniper (since found dead) who despised lockdowns and threatened to kill health professionals. \nThe UK\u2019s chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, was assaulted in a park by a 24-year-old estate agent, while two prominent German scientists were posted bottles of clear liquid labelled \"positive\" and a note telling them to drink it.\nUS infectious-diseases doctor Krutika Kuppalli, who gave national media interviews and testified to a congressional committee, told Nature she had received a death threat via a phone call to her home. \nAustralian virologist Danielle Anderson, who worked at the Wuhan Institute for Virology and was critical of the theory it might be where the virus had escaped from, received an email telling her to \"eat a bat and die\". \nProf Andrew Hill wrote a positive review of anti-parasite drug ivermectin for treating Covid but reversed his stance once he discovered data he had been basing his conclusions on was untrustworthy. \nCurrent available evidence suggests ivermectin is unlikely to be very effective for Covid - but Prof Hill has received a barrage of abuse, including accusing him of genocide, which has driven him off social media. \n\"I was sent images of Nazi war criminals hanging from lampposts, voodoo images of swinging coffins, threats that my family were not safe, that we would all burn in hell,\" he told BBC News.\n\"This was happening most days - I opened my laptop in the morning to be confronted with a sea of hate and disturbing threats.\n\"There were also threats to my scientific reputation on email.\n\"I know many other scientists who have been threatened and abused in similar ways after promoting vaccination or questioning the benefits of unproven treatments like ivermectin.\" \nUniversity of Southampton senior research fellow in global health Dr Michael Head said there had been \"a huge amount of abuse aimed at everyone contributing to the pandemic response... includ[ing] NHS front-line staff\". \nUniversity College London behavioural scientist Prof Susan Michie said \"disturbing\" online abuse would happen \"most intensively after media engagements and especially after those that address restrictions to social mixing ,the wearing of face masks or vaccination\".\nOther scientists surveyed mentioned emails being sent to their employers or their professional reputations being challenged. \nBut of those being harassed on their own social media, almost half said they did not tell their employer. \nThe Nature survey also found those targeted with the most frequent harassment were most likely to say it had affected their willingness to give media interviews in the future. \nFiona Fox, chief executive of the UK Science Media Centre, which provides scientific comment and briefings to journalists, said it was a \"great loss if a scientist who was engaging with the media, sharing their expertise, is taken out of a public debate at a time when we've never needed them so badly\".

      "text": "We all knew it was coming, but now it's official: Squid Game has become Netflix's biggest ever series launch.\nThe Korean drama was watched by 111 million users in its first 28 days, knocking Bridgerton (82 million) off the top spot.\nNetflix counts a view as anyone who's watched two minutes of an episode.\nNetflix's vice president for content in Korea, South East Asia, Australia and New Zealand says the show's success is \"beyond our wildest dreams\". \nMinyoung Kim told CNN: \"When we first started investing in Korean series and films in 2015, we knew we wanted to make world-class stories for the core K-content fans across Asia and the world.\n\"Today, Squid Game has broken through beyond our wildest dreams.\"\nThe nine-part series, which debuted in September, tells the story of a group of misfits taking part in a series of children's playground games.\nThere's a prize of 45.6bn Korean won (\u00a328m) up for grabs, which doesn't sound too bad until you realise if you lose, you get killed.\nFrom celebrities to sports stars, everyone's been talking about Squid Game.\nThe show's actors have shot to international fame - Jung Ho-yeon, who plays Sae-byeok, has gained 14 million Instagram followers since it launched on 17 September, Forbes says. \nSo what's the secret to the drama's success?\nWarning - the rest of this article contains some mild spoilers... \nSimilar in some ways to The Hunger Games, or the 2000 movie Battle Royale, the show focuses on a group of people in South Korea desperately in debt.\nThey're first tricked (then volunteer) into playing a deadly tournament of children's games, realising this may be their only chance to win the money they need to survive.\nChloe Henry is a fan of Korean shows and says Squid Game stands out from the others.\n\"It's not something that's been done before,\" the 26-year-old from Sheffield tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n\"With other shows, you can guess what's going to happen whereas this one is more 'wow' - a shock that you weren't expecting.\"\nShe feels the characters and intense acting keep you connected to the show.\n\"The actor who plays Seong Gi-hun, his emotion was so raw and it was so interesting to watch.\"\nSeong Gi-hun is a loveable gambling addict with huge debts and facing the loss of his daughter. He's the show's main character.\nChloe says the drama also gives viewers a different perception of South Korea.\n\"People in general think of South Korea as a big flash country with a lot of rich people, so it's nice to see the other side that is not really spoken about, like the struggle and poverty.\"\nKorean influence has grown massively in the UK. \nPeople here Googled Korea-related topics in October more than ever before, according to Google Trends data, and last month the Oxford English Dictionary added 26 new words of Korean origin to its latest edition to ride \"the crest of the Korean wave\".\nAs in the Oscar-winning Korean film, Parasite, the hardship seen in Squid Game is what makes it appealing to an international audience, says Dr Hye-Kyung Lee - who's researching the rise of K-drama and K-pop at King's College London.\n\"These dramas or films are entertaining, and they have something unique which can strike a chord with people around the world.\n\"They present a critique of society and social economic conditions, which people can relate to through the characters.\"\nDr Lee says other Korean dramas do touch on issues of society, economy and politics, but Squid Game has been far more direct in its approach.\n\"It's serious, the message is extreme and I think that reflects what's happening right now.\"\nThe violence, which means the show's not recommended for anyone under the age of 15, is part of Squid Game's appeal for Chloe.\n\"Other Korean shows can be quite modest, they don't show blood, nudity and they blur out weapons. \n\"It's nice to be able see things and be unexpected.\" \nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

      "title": "Brexit: UK dismissal of NI protocol solutions 'more serious'",
      "tags": "Republic of Ireland,Simon Coveney,UK government,European Union,Brexit,Sir Jeffrey Donaldson",
      "text": "Ireland's foreign minister has accused the UK of repeatedly dismissing EU proposals on the Northern Ireland Protocol before they are published.\nThis is happening again this week but it is now \"more serious\", Simon Coveney has warned. \nThe protocol is the special Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, which the UK and EU agreed in 2019.\nUnionists argue it creates a trade border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nThey say it undermines Northern Ireland's constitutional position as part of the UK.\nThe EU will bring forward proposals on Wednesday for reforming the protocol.\nThe proposals will focus on easing practical problems with the movement of goods from Britain to Northern Ireland, rather than changing oversight arrangements.\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who has threatened to pull his party out of Stormont over the protocol, said on Monday that this week was important.\n\"Let's see what people have to put on the table,\" he said. \n\"Let's see that intensive negotiation take place and then we'll make our judgements on the outcome against the tests that we have set and determine what action we should take.\"\nMr Coveney told RT\u00c9's Morning Ireland programme that the UK's dismissals were now \"more serious\", given the comprehensive compromise proposals the EU is bringing forward.\n\"Each time the EU comes forward with new ideas, new proposals to try to solve problems, they are dismissed before they are released and that is happening again this week,\" Mr Coveney said.\nHe said dismissals were being seen across the EU as \"the same pattern, over and over again\" by the UK.\nAt the weekend, Mr Coveney warned UK demands on the Northern Ireland Protocol could cause \"a breakdown in relations\" with the EU.\nHe made the comments after the UK reiterated that it wants the European Court of Justice (ECJ) removed from oversight of the deal.\nMr Coveney said this was the creation of a new \"red line\" which the EU cannot move on.\nThe European Commission said the ECJ's role in the protocol was ground that has been covered \"a million times\".\nIts chief spokesperson, Eric Mamer, told a briefing on Monday that the EU's position on this issue remained \"extremely clear\".\nHe said it was looking for solutions to the practical issues that affect the daily lives of people.\nMr Mamer said the commission wanted to be constructive and open, \"but in the framework of the agreement as it has been signed\".\nOn Tuesday, the UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost will give a speech in which he is expected to tell diplomats that removing the ECJ's role in dispute settlement is necessary to sustain the protocol.\nHe is due to say: \"Without new arrangements in this area the protocol will never have the support it needs to survive.\n\"The role of the ECJ in Northern Ireland and the consequent inability of the UK government to implement the very sensitive arrangements in the protocol in a reasonable way has created a deep imbalance in the way the protocol operates.\"\nThere are two schools of thought about how this latest negotiation is shaping up.\nThe first is that Lord Frost's hard line on the ECJ is standard pre-negotiation tactics, aimed at grinding out another concession or two.\nAfter all the Brexit process has always delivered a deal, even at times when it seemed improbable.\nThere is another view, hinted at by Simon Coveney, that maybe the UK doesn't want a deal unless it's total victory.\nUnder that scenario the UK would go through the motions before triggering Article 16.\nIt would use this to gut the protocol while calculating that the EU's ability to retaliate is limited or or at least would take a long time to amount to anything.\nWe should find out which view is right by the end of this year.\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said on Monday that his party had concerns around the jurisdiction of the ECJ.\n\"We do not believe they are fully independent when it comes to arbitrating on issues related to trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. \n\"We recognise why the government has that concern, but the government in the end, they are the negotiating party and they have to press these issues.\"\nHowever, the chief executive of Manufacturing NI, Stephen Kelly, said business needed clarity and certainty, not \"spats and ultimatums\".\nResponding to the UK's call to have the ECJ removed from oversight of the deal, Mr Kelly said that many businesses across Northern Ireland relied upon single market access enforced by the court to ensure their goods travelled freely and legally right across the EU.\nFormer Ulster Unionist Party leader and UUP MLA Steve Aiken said there were concerns particularly around governance of the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nHe said the implications of issues concerning the ECJ, which he said differentiates VAT and state aid rules and regulations, had not yet been seen.\n\"Those are real concerns for us,\" he told Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show.\nSinn F\u00e9in assembly member Declan Kearney said \"we are seeing the goal posts shift once more\" in relation to the UK's negotiation strategy.\n\"This may well be a negotiation tactic. \n\"We are now approaching the point where hopefully all of these issues can be successfully covered off and that we can in fact see the difficulties with the protocol finally eliminated, and that David Frost is simply trying to up the ante and bring some more heat into the talks process that will follow publication of the European Union proposals.\" \nSDLP assembly member Matthew O'Toole said from initial reports it appeared that the EU proposals would go \"further than most people in the UK government and even some in unionism and indeed in business were asking for earlier this year\".\n\"That is encouraging, there then needs to be a period of engagement between the UK and the EU to make those work,\" he told Radio Ulster's the Nolan Show.\n\"It is deeply disappointing, however, that the UK government has chosen to pick a fight already over proposals that have not yet been published and proposals that by all accounts are going to be substantial.\"\nTraditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said the \"big issue\" was \"the destruction\" of Northern Ireland's links \"with GB and our supply chain\".\n\"The people in the Irish Republic wouldn't accept it if two thirds of their economy laws were made in London,\" he said. \n\"Northern Ireland shouldn't have to accept the fact that two thirds of the laws governing their economy are made in Brussels. That's the constitutional issue.\""

      "text": "A British football coach has been jailed for 25 years in Dubai after four bottles of vape liquid containing cannabis oil were found in his car.\nBilly Hood from Notting Hill, west London, was arrested on 31 January, shortly after moving to the country.\nThe 24-year-old claims he was forced to sign a confession written in Arabic despite not speaking the language.\nThe Foreign Office said it was \"giving consular support to a British man who has been imprisoned\" in Dubai.\nMr Hood, who played semi-professional football for Kensington and Ealing Borough FC, told campaign group Detained in Dubai police had unexpectedly turned up and demanded to search his home and car.\nHe told the group he was taken to a \"police station and kept in an isolation cell for 14 days without any hygiene products\".\nMr Hood claimed the oil was left by a friend who had been visiting from England two weeks earlier.\nBut he claimed he was forced to sign a confession after being pressured by local law enforcement.\nThis month he was convicted by a court of drug trafficking with intent to supply.\nVaping cannabidiol (CBD) oil is legal in the UK and has become extremely popular - typically used to relieve pain, anxiety or stress.\nThe Foreign Office advise there is a \"zero-tolerance for drugs-related offences\" in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). \n\"Forced and coerced confessions are commonplace in Dubai,\" said Radha Stirling, chief executive of Detained in Dubai, who are representing the family.\nSentences for drug trafficking can include the death penalty and possession of even the smallest amount of illegal drugs can lead to a minimum four-year jail sentence.\nIn a statement to his lawyers Mr Hood said: \"I have always had a zero-tolerance on any drugs or illegal substances. \n\"For me to be accused of promoting and selling drugs in a country that has the same beliefs and values as me is very upsetting as it affects my future.\"\nMr Hood's family are appealing to the UK and UAE government to intervene in the case.\nMr Hood's mother Breda said: \"I have hidden myself away, crying and crying when I imagine what our sweet boy is going through.  \n\"It is the worst stress I've ever been through and I feel helpless.\"\nThe UAE embassy has been approached for comment.

      "tags": "Black Lives Matter,Racism,Music",
      "text": "Racism in the British music industry is \"serious, upfront and personal\", says the author of a new report about the experiences of black musicians.\n\"Prejudice is here,\" says Roger Wilson of the Black Lives in Music initiative. \"There's nothing stealthy about it.\"\nThe report finds that six in 10 black music creators have experienced racism, while 86% say they have faced barriers to their career because of their race.\nThey also earn \u00a3299 less per month, on average, than their white colleagues.\nThe report was compiled from the biggest-ever survey of black musicians and music industry professionals in the UK.\nIn total, 1,718 people responded, describing a range of discriminatory acts and \"sometimes hostile working environments\".\nOne reported \"having to repeatedly ask other artists to stop using the N-word\", while another faced \"jokes about [my] skin colour, Africa [and] persistent questioning about where I really come from\".\nTheir testimonies echo recent revelations from stars like Alexandra Burke, who said she was advised to bleach her skin to \"look whiter\".\nThe singer, who won the X Factor in 2008, said she was subsequently told she would \"have to work 10 times harder than a white artist, because of the colour of [her] skin\".\nLittle Mix star Leigh-Anne Pinnock, another X Factor winner, said she was made to feel like the band's \"token black girl\"; and that she often felt \"invisible\" at public appearances.\nEarlier this week, rapper Tinie Tempah said black artists still received less support than their white counterparts.\n\"Once you're part of a record label or a system, there are lots of complexities within that framework - what your budgets are versus someone else,\" he told the Press Association.\n\"'You're a rapper so this is your budget and you're black, but this is a folk artist who's from, like, Shropshire, and this is their budget and they haven't sold as many records as you, but we think that they're more viable, so we're going to spend more'.\n\"I would say the internet has made it easier for anyone to be an artist,\" he added. \"But then, once you have success, and once you're navigating the industry, the world is still a racist place, and people are still racist.\"\nThe Black Lives in Music initiative was established in March this year, promising a data-driven mission to amplify and empower black musicians and professionals.\nThe survey is its first major piece of work, and will make uncomfortable reading for many in the music industry.\nIt shows that black musicians \"are victims of pay disparity and lack of opportunities to progress,\" Wilson tells the BBC. \n\"And we're seeing that black women, in particular, are the worst off.\"\nThe report found 31% of black music creators believed their mental wellbeing had worsened since starting their music career, rising to 42% of black women.\nFour in 10 said they had been pigeon-holed into a genre \"which is not true to me\", A similar number reported pressure to change their name or their appearance to meet record label's expectations.\nJust 8% of black creators reported feeling satisfied with the support they received. Three-quarters reported otherwise.\nThe findings come despite increasing diversity in the music industry. A recent study by UK Music found that representation of black, Asian and other ethnically diverse people aged 16-24 was 30.6%, up from 25.9% in 2018. \nRepresentation is also rising at senior levels, although black and ethnically diverse people only fill one in five (19.9%) of those positions.\nRising star Kima Otung, whose music has featured on Love Island and been played on BBC Radio 1, said she recognised many of the stories and experiences depicted in the report.\nThe 27-year-old says she's experienced micro-aggressions, such as \"reaching out to people and being called pushy or aggressive because I was following up on an email I'd sent two weeks earlier, which is something that's pretty standard\".\nShe has decided to bypass the UK's major labels and release her music independently, after hearing horror stories about the industry.\nOtung says she is aware of record labels who say \"there's only room for one\" black artist on their roster. \n\"They'll take a chance on one black R&B artist and that's all they have space for\" she says. \"And it almost feels very experimental in nature - so they get given a very short contract or a really unfavourable contract. \n\"It's almost as if to say, 'You should feel lucky to even be here, so take these terms or leave them - because there's a whole line of black artists that will take your place immediately.'\"\nShe hopes the Black Lives in Music report will lead to a shift in perception.\n\"It's not about ostracising anyone or pointing the finger. It's about inviting people into the conversation and saying, 'Look, this kind of sucks, so what goals can we put in place for the next five years to make really sustainable change?'\"\nWilson, a musician and teacher who has worked with James Brown and Dame Shirley Bassey among others, says the goal of the Black Lives in Music campaign is to hold the music industry to the \"fantastic, impassioned statements\" they made during the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.\nIn the wake of George Floyd's death, many labels and organisations pledged grants, mentoring and charitable donations; while The Grammys dropped the marginalising word \"urban\" as a term to describe music by black artists.\nSome progress has been made since then, in the form of new initiatives like the PRS Foundation's Power Up - which gives grants, mentoring and other forms of support to black artists and executives as they work towards the next stage of their careers. \nThe record label and publisher BMG also undertook a review of its back catalogue and found \"significant differences\" in the royalty rates given to black artists. It subsequently said it would take \"measures to benefit the lowest-paid recording artists across all of its catalogues\".\nWilson says he remains optimistic about further progress. \n\"I happen to believe that the industry wants to make a change,\" he says. \"And, as a result, this report is going to, I hope, solicit some honesty in the industry, and [create] a desire to put put things right.\"\n\"It will take us time. I don't know that it's going to turn around in the next six months. But I do believe that all of these discussions will help to bring about change.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "The Rolling Stones have dropped Brown Sugar, one of their biggest hits, from their US tour. \nIt follows unease with the depictions of black women and references to slavery in the song, which reached number one in the US in 1971.\nThe band's veteran guitarist Keith Richards confirmed the decision to the LA Times but said he was confused by people who wanted to \"bury\" the track.\n\"Didn't they understand this was a song about the horrors of slavery?\" he said.\nThe 77-year-old musician concluded that he's \"hoping that we'll be able to resurrect the babe in her glory somewhere along the track\".\nSinger and co-writer Sir Mick Jagger, meanwhile, told the paper the reason for not playing the song was that it was \"tough\" to compile a set list for stadium shows.\n\"We've played Brown Sugar every night since 1970, so sometimes you think, we'll take that one out for now and see how it goes,\" he said. \"We might put it back in.\"\nOver the years, Brown Sugar has been the band's second most-played song live after Jumpin' Jack Flash, according to Setlist.fm. \nThe rock band last performed it in Miami, Florida, in 2019 - the final date of that leg of their North American tour, which resumed last month.\nThe catchy opening riff and melody propelled the song to mainstream success and often overshadowed the song's problematic references to slavery, sex, sadomasochism and heroin.\nDiscussing the song in a 1995 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Jagger said: \"I never would write that song now.\n\"I would probably censor myself. I'd think, 'Oh God, I can't. I've got to stop'. God knows what I'm on about on that song. It's such a mishmash. All the nasty subjects in one go.\"\nBut criticism of its lyrics, rumoured to be inspired by one of the singer's girlfriends, has intensified in recent times.\nLast year producer Ian Brennan criticised the band's decision to continue to \"play and profit\" from the song, which he said glorifies slavery, rape, torture and paedophilia.  \n\"The call is not for censorship or 'record burning,' but greater consciousness and sensitivity,\" Brennan told Rolling Stone.\n\"This particular case is far from nitpicking or searching into the furthest corners of someone's history for any misstep. Brown Sugar is not some obscure B-side.\"\nThe song reached number two in the UK charts when it was released, and has been streamed almost 170 million times on Spotify.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Russia,European Commission,Vladimir Putin,European Union,Oil & Gas industry,Natural gas",
      "text": "Russia has denied using energy as a political weapon, amid surging prices across Europe that have sent gas bills in many households skyrocketing.\nRussia, one of Europe's biggest natural gas providers, has been accused of intentionally withholding supplies.\nPresident Vladimir Putin said such claims were \"complete rubbish... and politically motivated tittle-tattle\".\nThe European Commission has been outlining measures member states can take to combat rising prices.\nThe wholesale price of gas has increased by 250% since January, triggering a knock-on spike in costs for consumers and businesses.\nEnergy prices have hit record highs for various reasons, including high demand for natural gas as economies recover from the Covid-19 pandemic.\nSpeaking at a Moscow energy forum on Wednesday, President Putin blamed the current crisis on Europe, saying that after a cold winter Europeans had not pumped sufficient volumes of gas into storage facilities.\nHe said it was \"very important\" to \"suggest a long-term mechanism to stabilise the energy market\".\nMr Putin stressed that Gazprom, Russia's gas giant, was supplying gas to Europe at maximum levels under existing contracts, and was ready to provide more if requested.\n\"We will increase by as much as our partners ask us. There is no refusal, none,\" he said.\nEurope's gas crisis has multiple causes: from a shortfall in renewable energy to low gas stocks after a cold winter. Plus, a surge in demand as countries emerge from the pandemic. \nBut could another factor be Russia?\nIn recent weeks Moscow has faced accusations that it has contributed to the crisis and forced gas prices higher by declining to supply additional gas to Europe. \n\"Politically motivated tittle-tattle,\" says President Putin.\nBut the International Energy Agency believes Russia could do more to increase gas availability to Europe.\nKremlin critics suspect it is using the crisis to fast track European approval for Russia's controversial new pipeline. \nWhen European regulators sign the paperwork, Nord Stream 2 will carry natural gas from Russia to Germany, bypassing Ukraine. \nOpponents of the pipeline believe it is a political project designed to increase Europe's dependency on Russian energy. Supporters insist it will provide Europe with a cheaper and more efficient supply of gas.\nOn Wednesday, Vladimir Putin insisted Nord Stream 2 was \"a commercial project\". \nThat was followed by a not so subtle hint. The president said he was \"100% certain\" that if the pipeline was functioning, that would ease Europe's energy problems.\nEarlier on Wednesday, the European Commission's energy chief, Kadri Simson, said the EU's executive was responding to calls for urgent action by unveiling an \"energy price toolbox\".\nThe toolbox outlines steps member states can take to reduce energy bills in their countries without breaching EU law. It mostly confirms the measures national governments can already use, but considers what more the Commission can do.\nMs Simson said member states were best placed to ease the burden of rising energy prices as winter approaches.\nShe urged them to consider emergency income support for vulnerable households, state aid for companies, and targeted tax reductions.\nShe also advised member states to temporarily pause bill payments where necessary, and put in place safeguards to avoid disconnections from the grid.\n\"Rising global energy prices are a serious concern for the EU,\" Ms Simson said. \"As we emerge from the pandemic and begin our economic recovery, it is important to protect vulnerable consumers and support European companies.\"\nOn top of those measures, Ms Simson said the Commission would look into the possible benefits of EU countries jointly buying natural gas.\nShe said countries could collectively buy gas to form a strategic reserve. But, like the joint scheme to buy Covid vaccines, participation would be voluntary.\nThe idea was proposed recently by governments that want more EU intervention, such as Spain.\nAll member states were encouraged to use the EU's \u20ac750bn (\u00a3636bn; $867bn) Covid-19 recovery fund to invest in clean energy to meet the bloc's climate targets.\n\"We are not facing a surge because of our climate policy,\" Ms Simson said. \"Fossil fuel prices are spiking. We need to speed up the green transition, not slow it down.\""

      "title": "Betsi Cadwaladr: Hospital restructuring blamed for amputation",
      "text": "A distraught wife says her husband faces losing both his legs due to flawed restructuring by a health board.\nVascular services were centralised by Betsi Cadwaladr health board at Glan Clwyd hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, in April 2019. \nBut it was controversial, and resulted in several high profile resignations. \nThe health board says it remains \"committed to providing a stable, high quality vascular service for north Wales\".\nIt says it has \"invested \u00a32.3m in a state-of-the art hybrid vascular theatre\" at Glan Clwyd hospital.\nEarlier this year, Arfon MS Sian Gwenllian called for the overhaul of vascular services to be undone.\nThe vascular system is made up of arteries and veins, and is the body's way of circulating blood between the heart and different organs.\nEsyllt Calley from Llanllyfni, Gwynedd, is adamant that removing specialist services from her local hospital in Bangor has been detrimental to patients like her husband.\nSince 2019, people from around north Wales have had to travel to access a centralised vascular service in Bodelwyddan.\nPete Calley, 51, is currently a patient at Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor, awaiting an operation to amputate his second leg because of complications originating from diabetes he has lived with for 22 years. \nSix years ago he had toes amputated at Glan Clwyd hospital, but Mrs Calley claims the surgery was not conducted properly which she said led to a further operation and months of rehabilitation. \nHe returned to Glan Clwyd 18 months ago needing to have his leg amputated. Mrs Calley said they had to operate three times within a week.\nMrs Calley said her husband now has Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) after undergoing several operations at the Glan Clwyd site, where vascular services are now centralised. He is refusing to return there for treatment.\n\"He's been affected so badly. Just saying the name 'Glan Clwyd' is enough to send him into a panic attack. I feel I've lost the man I married. I love my husband, but he's changed.\"\nShe said Betsi Cadwaladr health board had now agreed to fund his treatment at a Liverpool hospital.\nBreaking down in tears, Mrs Calley was adamant the restructuring of the vascular services in north Wales had affected her husband's health.\n\"I know Pete would still have his leg if it wasn't for Glan Clwyd. And he certainly wouldn't be a double amputee,\" she said.\n\"Within two years of having the vascular unit at Glan Clwyd, he's facing becoming a double amputee. In six years as a patient at Ysbyty Gwynedd, he lost no more than two toes.\n\"I just don't understand why they moved a unit that was so good.\"\nProfessor Dean Williams, who resigned from his position as head of the vascular unit in Ysbyty Gwynedd in 2019, said he had helped develop a world-class limb salvage unit at the hospital.\nHe said he had received assurances from senior staff at Betsi Cadwaladr health board that this service would remain at the Bangor site, despite centralisation at Glan Clwyd.\n\"When the centralisation went ahead, all major vascular surgery and emergency admissions were removed from Bangor,\" said Prof Williams.\n\"To have agreements thrown away, see a world-class service dismantled and then see the predicted consequences of that decision unfold in front of us was difficult and is still difficult to witness.\"\nBethan Russell-Williams, who was an independent board member at Betsi Cadwaladr, also resigned over the plans to reform vascular services, and said she had no regrets.\n\"Patient outcomes are much worse now than they were when services were available at Ysbyty Gwynedd,\" she said. \n\"More patients are having major lower limb amputations, and more patients are dying following major lower limb amputations.\"\nResponding to the allegations, Dr Nick Lyons, executive medical director of Betsi Cadwaladr, said: \"Even in this large health board area, we do not have the volume of complex vascular cases for teams to keep their skills and expertise up at each of the three acute hospitals.\" \nDr Lyons said a review conducted last year by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) found \"that the service has a robust surgical on-call arrangement and appropriate pathways for emergency and complex vascular intervention\".\n\"The RCS noted the commitment from all involved to improve the service and that 'an excellent foundation' is in place to continue the development and improvement of the vascular service in north Wales,\" he added.\nThe Welsh government said: \"We cannot comment on individual cases and this is a matter for the health board. We are in regular dialogue with the health board and will continue to monitor progress within the vascular service.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Social care,Welsh government,NHS Wales,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Pressures on Welsh hospitals are expected to continue until at least mid-October, Wales' health minister has said.\nEluned Morgan has asked people to only use A&E services and GP surgeries if absolutely necessary. \nSome health boards have already postponed routine surgery and suspended some visits.\nIt comes as Public Health Wales reports eight further deaths with Covid, and 2,317 new cases.\nIt brings the total in Wales throughout the pandemic to 5,734 deaths and 306,060 cases. \nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said on Friday that modelling suggested there could be \"100 new Covid-19 hospital admissions\" every day in Wales by the end of September as that is when experts expect the Delta-variant infection to peak.\nThe Covid infection rate in Wales has risen to 557 cases for every 100,000 people - the highest since December last year.\nMs Morgan said case numbers \"are likely to continue... until at least the end of September and then we're likely to see a levelling off\".\nBecause of the lag between people catching Covid and potentially ending up in hospital, Ms Morgan said this suggests the pressure on hospitals will \"continue at least until about mid-October\".\nMs Morgan added a \"really difficult\" decision must be made on whether to introduce vaccination passports, as England scraps their plans to do so.\nA decision is expected by next Friday on whether the passports will be made mandatory in order to gain entry to some events in Wales. They are being introduced in Scotland from 1 October.\n\"There are lots of practical and ethical issues we've got to consider around vaccine passports,\" Ms Morgan told BBC Politics Wales. \n\"Clearly, there's a hope that suggestions that we may need vaccine passports for nightclubs, for example, may help drive the numbers of young people who may want to take the vaccine up.\"\nMore than a fifth of young people aged 16-39 in Wales have yet to receive one dose of the vaccine.\n\"We know the [case] rates are incredibly high at the moment amongst young people and so that's why we're very anxious to drive those numbers up,\" Ms Morgan said.\nThe Betsi Cadwaladr health board in north Wales announced on Friday it was suspending routine operations and halted most hospital visits.\nCwm Taf Morgannwg health board has also suspended most patient visits for \"the safety of our patients and staff\" at its facilities in Merthyr Tydfil, Bridgend and Rhondda Cynon Taf.\nAt its height back in January, there were 1,643 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Welsh hospitals, compared to 441 cases earlier this week.\nBut the total number of people in Welsh hospitals because of Covid or other reasons is at its highest level since the start of the pandemic.\nThe health minister said there were \"difficulties getting people out of hospital\" because of a lack of social care staff.\nShe said she was having weekly meetings with councils and the health boards to deal with a \"quite critical\" situation.\nShe blamed Brexit, \"because we did have a lot of eastern European workers\", and people moving to work in the tourism sector over the summer.\nFewer than half of social care workers earn a \"real living wage\", according to research published by Cardiff University in August 2020. \nPaying social care staff the real living wage of \u00a39.50 an hour was a key Welsh Labour manifesto commitment, so Ms Morgan said the government was \"in the process of working with the trade unions to make sure that when we give that living wage that the money actually gets to the people on the frontline\".\nIn terms of changing the social care system, she said ministers have \"a long-term ambition\" to introduce free personal care \"but it is going to take us a while to get to that point\".\nAn independent report published in 2018 suggested an income tax rise in Wales of between 1% and 3% could be used to fund elderly social care.\nAsked if a social care levy was off the table in light of the UK government's National Insurance hike, Ms Morgan said: \"I think it would be very difficult for us to be taxing people twice for the same service.\""

      "text": "Four women and a man were killed and two others wounded when a man used a bow and arrow to attack them in Norway.\nPolice first received word of an attack in the town of Kongsberg, south-west of the capital Oslo, at 18:12 local time (16:12 GMT).\nA Danish man aged 37 has been arrested and questioned for hours overnight.\nPolice said they had previously been in contact with him over fears of radicalisation after he converted to Islam. \nThe victims were all aged between 50 and 70, regional police chief Ole Bredrup Saeverud told reporters on Thursday morning.\nHe said they were most likely killed after the police first confronted the attacker at 18:18.\nReports of the incident were \"horrifying\", said Prime Minister Erna Solberg, hours before she was due to leave office.\n\"I understand that many people are afraid, but it's important to emphasise that the police are now in control,\" she said.\nThe attacker is said to have launched the assault inside a Coop Extra supermarket on Kongsberg's west side. One of those injured was an off-duty police officer who was in the shop at the time.\nA spokesperson for the chain later confirmed a \"serious incident\" at their store, adding that none of their staff were physically injured. \nLocal police chief Oyvind Aas confirmed that the attacker had managed to escape an initial confrontation with police before an arrest was finally made at 18:47 local time, 35 minutes after the attack began.\nOne witness told local outlet TV2 she had heard a commotion and seen a woman taking cover, then a \"man standing on the corner with arrows in a quiver on his shoulder and a bow in his hand\".\n\"Afterwards, I saw people running for their lives. One of them was a woman holding a child by the hand,\" she added.\nPolice have told Norwegian news agency NTB that the attacker also used other weapons during the incident, without giving more details on what they were.\nThe suspect moved over a large area, and authorities cordoned off several parts of the town. Residents were ordered to stay indoors so authorities could examine the scene and gather evidence. Surrounding gardens and garages were searched with the help of sniffer dogs.\nThe attack was Norway's deadliest since far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik murdered 77 people, most of them at a children's Labour Party summer camp on the island of Utoya in July 2011.\nKongsberg Mayor Kari Anne Sand said it was a shocking attack that had taken place in an area where many people lived, and that a crisis team would help anyone affected.\nDescribing the town as \"a completely ordinary community with completely ordinary people\", Ms Sand said everyone had been deeply shaken by \"this very tragic situation.\"\nThe suspect was taken to a police station in the town of Drammen, where his defence lawyer, Fredrik Neumann, said he was questioned for more than three hours and was co-operating with authorities.\nThe suspect had a Danish mother and Norwegian father, he explained.\nNorway's outgoing justice minister Monica Maeland told reporters the police did not yet know whether or not it was act of terrorism and could not comment on details emerging about the suspect.\nPolice prosecutor Ann Ir\u00e9n Svane Mathiassen told TV2 that the man had lived in Kongsberg for several years and was known to police. \nThe attack came on the final day of Erna Solberg's conservative government, and a new justice minister takes over the case on Thursday under a centre-left coalition led by Labour leader Jonas Gahr Store.\nMr Store said it was a \"gruesome and brutal act\", hours before announcing his new cabinet.\nNorwegian police are not usually armed and after the attack the police directorate ordered all officers nationwide to carry firearms as an extra precaution.\nPolice were searching the Huseby area of north-western Oslo on Thursday following reports of a man being seen carrying a bow and arrow. Police stressed no-one had been hurt and there was no threat.\n\"The police have no indication so far that there is a change in the national threat level,\" the directorate said in a statement (in Norwegian).

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\nThere are more staff shortages in the care sector than before the pandemic, according to leading industry body Skills for Care. Its annual report says there are more than 100,000 jobs available with no-one to fill them - that equates to about 8.2% of posts. It was 8% before the pandemic. But it's not just the struggle to recruit staff that's an issue, employers are finding it harder to keep the staff they have, a report highlights. The government says extra funding as part of its social care reform package and a regular recruitment drive will help boost the workforce.\nMore people dining out, going on holiday and attending music festivals after all Covid restrictions were lifted in England meant the UK economy grew by 0.4% in August. The Office for National Statistics says the services sector made the biggest contribution to economic growth. Arts, entertainment and recreation grew nine per cent and there was also more demand for hotels and campsites.\nThe Covid vaccine is being offered to children aged 12 to 15 years old. Before the government made the decision there were legitimate debates about whether healthy children at much lower risk should be jabbed. Alongside these, campaigners opposed to the vaccine were spreading misinformation including a fake NHS vaccine-consent letter that was sent to schools in England. What are the misleading claims? We've investigated them.\n\"I used to think, 'will my son kill me in my sleep?'\" says Lisa whose 13-year-old son became violent in lockdown last year. She's not alone. One service supporting families in Wales has seen a rise in \"child on parent\" domestic abuse - with children as young as five referred for help.

Did that tickle you? It's lyrics from Bo Burnham's song Welcome To The Internet and one of comedian Phil Nichol's favourite funny songs.

      "tags": "Islington,Leicester",
      "text": "An MP who made threatening phone calls to a woman because she was jealous of her relationship with her partner has been found guilty of harassing her.\nClaudia Webbe, 56, a former Labour MP for Leicester East, who is now independent, was found guilty of one charge of harassment. \nWestminster Magistrates' Court heard she made several calls over two years and threatened the woman with acid. \nAfter the verdict, Webbe said she was \"deeply shocked\" and would appeal.\nThe prosecution said Webbe, of Islington, north London, made 16 calls to 59-year-old Michelle Merritt, a friend of her partner Lester Thomas, between September 2018 and April last year. \nThe court heard on one occasion she made an \"angry\" call, used a derogatory term and added: \"You should be acid.\"\nIn another she threatened to send naked photos and videos of Ms Merritt to her family and made silent calls from a withheld number, the hearing was told. \nDuring cross-examination on Wednesday, Webbe, who was suspended by the Labour party, said she had never met Ms Merritt and \"there was no reason for any falling out\".\nShe claimed a recorded phone call on 25 April in which Webbe was heard saying \"get out of my relationship\" 11 times was taken out of context. \nWebbe said it had been during a heated argument with Mr Thomas over breaching the Covid-19 lockdown with Ms Merritt.\n\"I simply called her and asked her not to break lockdown with Lester,\" she said.\n\"She was breaking the rules and I was just pointing it out. I'm the victim.\"\nWebbe claimed she was a victim of \"domestic abuse and coercive control\" and was being \"goaded and gaslighted\" during the row, which resulted in police being called after a neighbour reported her screams.\nShe confirmed she was still in a relationship with Mr Thomas and they were engaged. \nWebbe previously said: \"I have spent my lifetime campaigning for the rights of women, for challenging this type of behaviour and this is not something that is in my character and not something I would ever do.\"\nPaul Hynes QC representing Webbe read out character references from former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott.\nMs Abbott said the defendant was \"very committed to working to support women\", describing her \"warm, empathetic manner\" and added: \"I regard her as a very honest woman.\"\nWhile Mr Corbyn said she was \"very committed to ensuring the administration of justice is done\" and prepared to \"state uncomfortable truths when it matters\".\nHowever, District Judge Paul Goldspring said he had found Webbe \"untruthful\" in her evidence.\n\"Some of the things she said I believe were made up on the spur of the moment,\" he said.\n\"Some things she said in the witness box just don't bear scrutiny.\n\"In short, I find Ms Webbe to be vague, incoherent and at times illogical.\"\nHe released Webbe on unconditional bail but warned her that she could face prison when she is sentenced on 4 November. \n\"Threatening to throw acid at somebody and to send intimate photographs to family members crosses the custody threshold,\" he added.\nAfter the verdict, Webbe said: \"I am innocent and will appeal this verdict. As I said in court and repeat now, I have never threatened violence nor have I ever harassed anyone.\"\nHer lawyer, Raj Chada, added: \"The recording of the call Ms Webbe made has been taken out of context. We are sure that Ms Webbe will be vindicated at an appeal.\"\nLisa Rose from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Webbe's \"persistent nuisance behaviour caused considerable distress and alarm to her victim who became genuinely concerned for her safety\".\n\"No-one should have to endure this sort of harassment,\" she added.\nThe Labour Party called on Webbe to step down after the verdict.\nA spokesperson added: \"The Labour Party strongly condemns Claudia Webbe's actions and she should now resign.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "title": "Covid: UK's early response worst public health failure ever, MPs say",
      "tags": "NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK's failure to do more to stop Covid spreading early in the pandemic was one of the country's worst public health failures, a report by MPs says.\nThe government approach - backed by its scientists - was to try to manage the situation and in effect achieve herd immunity by infection, it said.\nThis led to a delay in introducing the first lockdown, costing thousands of lives, the MPs found.\nBut their report highlighted successes too, including the vaccination rollout.\nIt described the approach to vaccination - from the research and development through to the rollout of the jabs - as \"one of the most effective initiatives in UK history\".\nBut campaigners criticised the report for failing to focus on those who had died, saying references to practical issues, including problems with laptops, was \"laughable\".\nThe 150-page document, Coronavirus: Lessons learned to date, is from the Health and Social Care Committee and the Science and Technology Committee, and MPs from all parties.\nIt predominantly focused on the response to the pandemic in England. The committees did not look at steps taken individually by Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nThe MPs called the pandemic, which has claimed more than 150,000 lives in the UK and nearly five million worldwide so far, the \"biggest peacetime challenge\" for a century.\nSome early failings, the report suggested, resulted from apparent \"group-think\" among scientists and ministers.\nIt meant the UK was not as open to different approaches on earlier lockdowns, border controls and test and trace as it should have been.\nA woman whose twin sisters died within three days of one another after testing positive for Covid says the report from MPs uses the success of the vaccine programme to deflect from earlier failures.\nZoe Davis' sisters Katy and Emma, who were both nurses, died in April 2020.\nShe says: \"Nobody is saying that the vaccine programme hasn't been phenomenal but the frustrating thing is that's a deflection of what is actually being brought to attention and the overall message is that Covid failures have cost lives.\"\nLindsay Jackson, from Derbyshire, whose mother died with Covid, said the report confirmed her fears she had about care home visits in March 2020.\n\"I knew in my own mind the lockdown was too slow, I knew the social care sector wasn't being looked after, I knew people shouldn't have been released from hospital without tests, and this just confirms that.\"\nShe is calling for the government to move to a public inquiry now to see if anyone is culpable.\nConservative MPs Jeremy Hunt and Greg Clark, who chair the committees, said the nature of the pandemic meant it was \"impossible to get everything right\". \n\"The UK has combined some big achievements with some big mistakes. It is vital to learn from both,\" they said.\nCabinet Office minister Stephen Barclay said scientific advice had been followed and the government had made \"difficult judgements\" to protect the NHS.\nHe said the government took responsibility for everything that happened - saying the government would not shy away from any lessons to be learned at the full statutory public inquiry, expected next year.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the report was a \"damning indictment\" and showed the errors and failures of running down the NHS before the pandemic.\nHe called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to apologise to the bereaved and hold the public inquiry as soon as possible. \nWhen Covid hit, the government's approach was to manage its spread through the population rather than try to stop it - or herd immunity by infection as the report called it.\nThe MPs said this was based on dealing with a flu pandemic, and was done on the advice of its scientific advisers on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). \nBut the idea was not challenged enough by ministers in any part of the UK. Although other parts of Europe were guilty of this too, the MPs added.\nToo little was done in the early weeks to stop Covid spreading, the MPs said, despite evidence from China and then Italy that it was a virus that was highly infectious, caused severe illness and had no cure.\n\"The veil of ignorance through which the UK viewed the initial weeks of the pandemic was partly self-inflicted,\" the report said.\nAsked whether herd immunity had been a policy in the early days, Mr Hunt said he did not think there was any desire for the whole population to be infected.\nHowever, he said there was a \"fatalism that it was likely that in the end, that will be the only way that we will stop the progress of the virus\".\nDecisions on lockdowns and social distancing during those early weeks - and the advice that led to them - were described as \"one of the most important public health failures the UK has ever experienced\".\nThe advice from scientists changed on 16 March 2020 - with a lockdown announced a week later.\n\"This slow and gradualist approach was not inadvertent, nor did it reflect bureaucratic delay or disagreement between ministers and their advisers,\" the report said, describing it as a \"deliberate policy\".\n\"It is now clear that this was the wrong policy, and that it led to a higher initial death toll than would have resulted from a more emphatic early policy. In a pandemic spreading rapidly and exponentially, every week counted.\"\nA Liverpool FC and Atletico Madrid football match on 11 March - as a pandemic was declared by the WHO - and the Cheltenham Festival of Racing between 10 and 13 March, may have spread the virus.\nMr Barclay said hindsight was \"an issue\". Had the government known how much the country would be willing to endure, lockdown may have come sooner, the minister added.\nThe MPs also highlighted how ministers in England rejected scientific advice to have a two-week \"circuit-breaker\" in the autumn.\nThey said it was impossible to know whether that would have prevented the second lockdown in November, although they pointed out it had not in Wales.\nThe UK was one of the first countries in the world to develop a test for Covid in January 2020, but failed to translate that into an effective test-and-trace system during the first year of the pandemic, the report said.\nTesting in the community stopped in March 2020 and for weeks during the first peak only those admitted to hospital were tested.\nIt was not until May that the NHS Test and Trace system was launched in England, but the report described its start as \"slow, uncertain and often chaotic\".\nIt said the system was too centralised, only later making use of the expertise in local public health teams run by councils.\nBut it praised the target set by then Health Secretary Matt Hancock to get to 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, saying it played an important part in galvanising the system.\nThe greatest praise though was reserved for the vaccination programme and the way the government supported the development of a number of vaccines, including the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\nIt said the whole programme was one of the most effective initiatives in history, and will ultimately help to save millions of lives here and across the world.\nA key step, taken early on following a suggestion from chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, was to set up a task force that combined the talents of scientists, the NHS and the private sector, led by the \"bold leadership\" of venture capitalist Kate Bingham.\nThe development of treatments, such as dexamethasone, for Covid through the UK Recovery Trial was another area where the UK's response was genuinely world-leading, the report said. \nAnd the NHS and government were also credited with the way hospital intensive care capacity was increased to ensure the majority who needed hospital treatment received it.\nThe report's recommendations include comprehensive government plans for future emergencies, a bigger role for the armed forces in emergency response plans, and considering a government and NHS volunteer reserve database.\nThe MPs said the pandemic had also exacerbated existing social, economic and health inequalities which would need addressing.\nThe report highlighted \"unacceptably high\" death rates in ethnic minority groups and among people with learning disabilities and autism.\nFor ethnic minorities, there were a variety of factors, including possible biological reasons and increased exposure because of housing and working conditions. \nFor people with learning disabilities, not enough thought was given to how restrictions would have a detrimental impact on them - particularly in terms of accessing health care more generally. Do not resuscitate orders were also used inappropriately.\nThere was a lack of priority attached to care homes too at the start of the pandemic.\nThe rapid discharge of people from hospital into care homes without adequate testing or isolation was a prime example of this.\nThis, combined with untested staff bringing infection into homes from the community, led to many thousands of deaths which could have been avoided.\nScience minister George Freeman said it was too early for any proper discussion about blame or fault.\nAsked about the higher UK death toll, he said: \"A lot of that is actually to do with the very, very heavy obesity-related cardiometabolic chronic disease cohort that we've been carrying for years - that's a failure of public health in this country over decades.\"\nLobby Akinnola, of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, said Mr Freeman's comments were \"grossly offensive\", adding that \"the statutory inquiry cannot come soon enough\".\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "tags": "Human spaceflight,Blue Origin,Jeff Bezos,Star Trek,Space exploration",
      "text": "Hollywood actor William Shatner has become the oldest person to go to space as he blasted off aboard the Blue Origin sub-orbital capsule.\nThe 90-year-old, who played Captain James T Kirk in the Star Trek films and TV series, took off from the Texas desert with three other individuals.\nMr Shatner's trip on the rocket system - developed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos - lasted about 10 minutes.\nThe craft safely landed just after 10:00 local time (16:00 BST).\nThose aboard got to experience a short period of weightlessness as they climbed to a maximum altitude just above 100km (60 miles). From there they were able to see the curvature of the Earth through the capsule's big windows.\n\"Everybody in the world needs to do this,\" the Canadian actor told Mr Bezos after landing back on Earth. \"It was unbelievable.\"\nIn tears, he added: \"What you have given me is the most profound experience. I'm so filled with emotion about what just happened. I hope I never recover from this. I hope I can retain what I feel now. I don't want to lose it.\"\nMr Shatner was joined on the flight by Audrey Powers, a Blue Origin vice president; Chris Boshuizen, who co-founded the Earth-imaging satellite company Planet; and Glen de Vries, an executive with the French healthcare software corporation Dassault Syst\u00e8mes.\nThey were given a couple of days' training, although there was nothing really major for them to do during the flight other than enjoy it. The rocket and capsule system, known as New Shepard, is fully automatic.\nWhen the capsule touched down in the Texan desert, it was quickly surrounded by ground teams. Mr Bezos himself opened the hatch to check everyone inside was OK.\nAfter the immediate celebrations with family and friends, the crew then lined up to receive their Blue Origin astronaut pins.\nThis was only the second crewed outing for New Shepard. The first, on 20 July, carried Mr Bezos, his brother Mark, Dutch teenager Oliver Daemen; and famed aviator Wally Funk. \nAfterwards, Ms Funk, being 82, was able to claim the record for the oldest person in space - a title she has now relinquished to Mr Shatner.\nThe launch comes amid claims that Blue Origin has a toxic work culture and failed to adhere to proper safety protocols. The mostly anonymous accusations made by former and present employees have been strenuously denied.\n\"That just hasn't been my experience at Blue,\" countered Audrey Powers, who is responsible for mission and flight operations.\n\"We're exceedingly thorough, from the earliest days up through now as we've started our human flights. Safety has always been our top priority.\"\nWilliam Shatner may have been the first person to go from Star Trek's version of space to the real thing - but three Nasa astronauts have made the opposite journey.\nMae Jemison appeared in an episode of TV sequel Star Trek: The Next Generation, while Mike Fincke and Terry Virts turned up in the final episode of Enterprise, the Star Trek prequel series.\nAlso providing a link are Gene Roddenberry, the franchise creator, and James Doohan, the actor who played Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott in the original 1960s series and subsequent films. Both men had their ashes sent into space.\nSpace tourism is going through something of a renaissance, currently.\nThroughout the 2000s a number of high-value individuals paid to visit the International Space Station (ISS). But these flights, organised under the patronage of the Russian space agency, ceased in 2009.\nNow, the sector is being rekindled, and this time it looks more resilient, simply because there are many more private space companies chasing the business, and this should bring down prices for a wider pool of customers.\nAs well as the New Shepard trips organised by Jeff Bezos, the British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson is offering rides in his Virgin Galactic rocket plane. \nAnd then, of course, there's Elon Musk, whose Dragon capsule will send people orbital, to circle the Earth for several days - as it did for the privately funded Inspiration4 crew last month. \nWhile Mr Bezos simply invites some people to fly on New Shepard, he is selling other seats. And whereas Sir Richard Branson puts a ticket price (from $450,000; \u00a3330,000) against the journey, the Amazon founder does not disclose the fees paid by the likes of Mr Boshuizen and Mr de Vries.\nBlue Origin is planning one more crewed flight this year, with several more crewed flights planned for 2022.

      "tags": "Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry,Aberlour",
      "text": "A former pupil has said the elite Gordonstoun school should set up a trust to help those who suffered abuse access mental health treatment. \nHe said the boarding school should take responsibility for abuse he and others suffered at Aberlour House in Moray. \nIt was then considered a prep school for Gordonstoun. The schools have since merged. \nJohn Findlay told the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry he was sexually abused by a teacher in 1990 at the age of 12.\nThe inquiry is currently looking at allegations of abuse in boarding schools.\nMr Findlay - who waived his right to anonymity - told the inquiry he was boarding at Aberlour House when, after a rugby match, he needed painkillers. \nHe said an English teacher gave him what he thought was medicine and soon after the man came into his dormitory and sexually abused him.\nMr Findlay told the inquiry he could not move or speak during the attack but was conscious of what was happening.\nWhen he confronted the teacher later, he said he was told he must have imagined what happened because of the pain relief he had been given.\nThe matter was taken up with a senior official at the school and Mr Findlay said he understood that his parents agreed not to pursue police action after being assured the man would never teach again.\nHe said he discovered the man went on to teach in England where he ended up leaving in similar circumstances. After that, he went to teach at a school in Kenya. \nThe man has now died. \nMr Findlay said he still suffers from severe anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). \nMr Findlay said his parents regretted not pursuing police action, and he feels the police should have investigated irrespective of his parents' and the school's thoughts. \nHe told the BBC he did not blame his parents or the school but that his abuser should have been prosecuted. \n\"The fact he went on to teach and abuse other individuals is disgusting,\" he added. \nMr Findlay called on Gordonstoun to set up a trust to fund mental health support for former pupils who have survived abuse. \nHe said: \"Gordonstoun has the opportunity here to stand up and do the right thing and that is to look after former pupils by providing care and medical attention that's needed and prescribed with regards to mental illnesses.\" \nAberlour House and Gordonstoun had links but were separate legal entities until they merged in 1999.\nThe school has previously offered \"a very sincere apology to anyone who has suffered abuse either at Gordonstoun or Aberlour House\". \nHe is due to meet the current principal of Gordonstoun to discuss the issue next month.\nAnother witness, referred to only as Paul to protect his anonymity, told the inquiry that Gordonstoun did not listen when abuse was reported in 1989. \nThe former pupil - who says he was groomed by another teacher, later convicted of child sex abuse - told the inquiry if Gordonstoun had listened then the abuse might not have happened.\nPaul said this teacher abused him when he was a teenager, after the teacher formed a friendship with him. \nIn 2018, the teacher was jailed for grooming several pupils at Gordonstoun. He was freed after six months. \nPaul told the inquiry he had almost never spoken to anyone else about the abuse he suffered at Gordonstoun throughout his adult life, but decided to speak to the police after hearing the teacher's conduct towards other pupils was being investigated.\nHe said: \"I couldn't let someone stand up alone and go through all that.\"\nPaul said that initially his relationship with the teacher was like a friendship, and he would take part in activities the teacher ran.\nHe said other children warned him that the teacher could be \"handsy\". \nAt one point, he invited Paul to the school's swimming pool. Paul said that when he arrived the teacher removed his swimming costume and invited Paul to do the same, though he decided to leave.\nDuring another incident, Paul said the teacher groped him as he was playing a computer game.\nPaul told the inquiry: \"I tried to block it out, I can literally still see the screen in front of me... it's crystal clear.\"\nDuring his evidence session on Tuesday, Paul said he was aware of at least five other victims, three of whom were involved in the criminal case against the teacher.\nHe said: \"The most distressing, critical failure at the time was that Gordonstoun didn't listen to someone who reported abuse at the start of 1989.\n\"Had they listened, potentially the abuse that happened to me would not have happened.\"\nPaul, who is now in his 40s, said the abuse he suffered at Gordonstoun had affected the rest of his life.\nThe inquiry is due to hear evidence from Gordonstoun's current principal, Lisa Kerr, again later this week.\nMs Kerr gave evidence to the inquiry in March and apologised on behalf of the school to those who had suffered abuse, saying: \"I'd like to offer a very sincere apology to anyone who has suffered abuse either at Gordonstoun or Aberlour House.\"\nThe inquiry, before Judge Lady Smith, continues."

      "tags": "Companies,Christmas,Retailing,Shipping industry,Felixstowe,Haulage",
      "text": "One of the UK's biggest toy retailers is warning delays at UK ports will result in shortages this Christmas. \nGary Grant, boss of The Entertainer, said it would get harder to get stock to the right places at the right time.\nBarbie dolls and Paw Patrol toys are among the children's favourites he expects to run out fast.\nThe government said that Felixstowe had reported \"improved capacity over the past few days\". \nA container logjam at ports, including Felixstowe, and a shortage of HGV lorry drivers has sparked widespread concern among retailers about future stocks.\nMr Grant said his 170 shops are looking \"very full right now\". But he added that demand \"will outstrip availability\" because there aren't enough drivers to move the company's stock. \n\"There'll never be toy shops with no toys. There will be toy shops without all the toys that they would normally expect to have due to the shortages, and that is largely down to transportation and warehouse issues, rather than there being a shortage of toys.\"\nThe shortage of drivers means that shipment containers are being offloaded but left stacked on the quayside waiting for collection. The dearth of drivers also means there is a delay in returning empty containers for re-use.\nThe problems come at the busiest time of the year for retailers, when most goods are imported from Asia to sell during Christmas trading. \nThomas O'Brien, managing director of Leeds-based toy designer Boxer Gifts, which manufacturers its products in China, said there's \"plenty of stock\" but the real problem is that \"everything takes longer and is horrendously more expensive\" which means the company \"will be struggling to keep price increases to anything lower than 10%\".  \nItems that are in short supply include a sloth soft toy and the moody cow stress ball.\n\"Ironically the moody cow which we're short of is almost a nice acronym for how feel at the moment,\" he added.  \nWhile there are alternative toys, Mr O'Brien said the firm has lost six weeks of \"planning time\" to be able to re-stock at short notice. \nHe said containers shipped from Qingdao, China to Felixstowe are costing him $15,000 (\u00a311,003) rather than the normal rate of $2,500 in 2020.\nEntrepreneur Jack Griffiths, co-founder of loungewear company Snuggy, said he is expecting containers on five different ships, holdings \u00a31m worth of Christmas items, to arrive over the next week but they will now be delayed by three weeks. \n\"We're seasonal and we have to make the most of these months, 80% of our turnover comes from October to February.\"\nIn November, the business usually takes \u00a3500,000 worth of sales which Mr Griffiths said he \"probably won't be able to get in if we don't get that stock in time\". \nThe company has already run out of the SnuggyPod product which was due to arrive two weeks ago. Mr Griffiths said the product \"probably won't arrive for three weeks at Felixstowe and then it'll take three weeks to get them out of the port due to the driver issues\". He added that because the SnuggyPod is the firm's original design, there aren't any alternatives. \n\"As the weeks go by I can only see it getting worse which is just something we don't want to think about\". \nMr Griffiths anticipates he will have to get products shipped by railway and air rather than sea. It comes after \u00a3400,000 worth of his stock was delayed earlier in the year when it got stuck on the Ever Given ship which blocked the Suez Canal.\nSteve Parks, director at Seaport Freight which deals with food shipments from overseas as well as other goods, says moving products from Rotterdam port to Felixstowe is delaying goods by two to three weeks.\n\"So things like coconut milk, frozen fish and carpets are being delayed from China.\"\nWhile Mr Parks said Britain's shortfall in HGV drivers is \"largely\" to blame for the congestion at the port, other countries are experiencing problems, including the US and China.\n\"This is absolutely the worst period I have known, ever,\" he said. \"We can't get space on ships coming out of the Far East.\"\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said that fluctuating capacity at ports \"has been exacerbated by the ongoing global container and HGV driver shortages\".\n\"All ports across the UK remain open to shipping lines with Felixstowe reporting improved capacity over the past few days and the government continues to work closely with the freight industry, to tackle the challenges faced by some ports this autumn,\" the spokesperson said.\nAndrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said there was \"no need to panic buy\" but advised customers to start their normal shopping process earlier.\n\"If you see something you want, now is the time to buy as retailers have most of their Christmas stock, but we can't guarantee having supplies of everything over the next few weeks\".\n\"It's a challenge for small retailers because they don't have the cash to stockpile,\" he added.  \nThe UK's biggest commercial port Felixstowe told the BBC that it currently had 50,000 containers which were waiting to be collected, due to a shortage of HGV lorry drivers. \nOfficials at the port have asked the shipping lines to reduce their empty container stocks as \"quickly as possible\".\n\"It's not the port of Felixstowe affecting the supply chain, it's the supply chain affecting the port of Felixstowe,\" it said, adding that the problems are \"similar at all major UK ports\". \nDanish shipping giant Maersk has been forced to divert some of its larger ships from Felixstowe to ports in the Netherlands and Belgium to avoid delays. Smaller ships are then transporting the goods to the UK.\nA spokesman for the port of Rotterdam said it has been busy over the last couple of weeks, but said: \"It's more to do with Covid than anything else because of the balance of empty and full containers being in the wrong place.\"\nThe pandemic is also being blamed in part for bottlenecks at US ports. President Joe Biden will meet with major US retailers as well as the bosses of ports on Wednesday to address the issues.\nSultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chief executive Dubai-based DP World, the global logistics giant which operates out of Southampton and London Gateway, said \"nobody knows how long it's going to take\" to resolve the congestion and shipping container shortages. \n\"I think it's going to take a long time,\" he said, adding: \"The problem is complicated because you have a backlog of cargo.\"\nThe UK Ports Association trade group, said most UK ports were operating normally but that the shortage of drivers meant \"some delays\".\n\"This has meant that some freight is not being collected as rapidly as it would normally. The situation is impacting all types of ports, not just container terminals. \nIndustry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers. It has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic, Brexit and a backlog of HGV driver tests.\nThe government recently drafted in military personnel to help with the driver shortages and deliver fuel. Emergency temporary visas have also been issued to foreign drivers.\nConservative Party chair Oliver Dowden told the BBC that the government was increasing the number of people having tests and that he would \"expect that number to increase as we approach Christmas\". \nAsked about potential Christmas shortages, he told Sky news: \"The situation is improving, I'm confident that people will be able to get their toys for Christmas.\""

      "tags": "Social care,Home care,Employment,Care homes,NHS England,NHS",
      "text": "Shortages of care staff, who support older or disabled people in the community, are causing major problems for hospitals, the BBC has learned. \nNHS chief executives say rising numbers of patients are stuck in hospitals in England due to a lack of care staff. \nThe situation is \"dire\", according to NHS Providers, which represents health service trusts.\nThe government says extra funding and a regular recruitment drive will help boost the care workforce. \nCare companies are facing acute problems in recruiting and retaining staff, according to a report which suggests there are now more unfilled care jobs than before the pandemic. \nThe annual Skills for Care workforce report is based on data provided by a representative sample of employers of England's 1.54 million care workers.\nThe researchers calculate that employers were failing to fill 8% of posts before the pandemic.\nFigures obtained since suggest this had fallen to below 6% by June 2020 - but by August this year the trend had reversed with 8.2% of care sector roles unfilled. \nThis amounts to more than 100,000 posts with no-one to fill them, says Skills for Care. \nIncreasingly, care companies are forced to turn down work supporting patients as they move from hospital back to their own homes or care homes. \nThose patients have to stay in hospital longer, putting more pressure on an NHS already struggling with Covid-19 and the waiting list backlog. \n\"We've just tipped over the point where delayed discharges are a bigger problem than Covid,\" said one hospital boss who asked not to be named. \n\"Roughly 100 beds blocked and domiciliary care providers are handing dozens of [patient care] packages back to the council as they don't have staff to deliver them,\" said another. \nA third manager had 140 patients ready to leave hospital, but the carer shortage meant \"patients are dying in hospital when their choice was home, a hospice or nursing home\".\nThe anonymous comments from more than 20 hospital bosses were gathered by NHS Providers, in response to a BBC request for information. \nThe organisation's deputy chief executive, Saffron Cordery, said the delays are particularly worrying as winter is about to put extra pressure on services. \nNot being able to leave hospital when they are ready can delay a patient's recovery and rehabilitation, said Ms Cordery, while those waiting for treatment face backlogs.\n\"It's vital that government delivers its commitment to place vital social care services onto a sustainable footing.\"\nShe also highlighted the need for \"crucially - a sustainable workforce, properly valued and respected for this vitally important work\". \nCare companies say the main factors making it hard to find and keep staff are: \nIn Sheffield, Tracey Hobson, a clinical manager at Northfield Nursing Home, says: \"Recruitment is an absolute nightmare\". \n\"You wake up in the morning and you're thinking, you know, I'm not going to be able to ensure that these people get the care that they deserve, and have enough staff to do it.\"\nTracey says the sector faces a national staff shortage. She personally receives about 20 messages each day from recruitment agencies, desperate to hire her. \n\"You know, I've got a job. I'm looking after people to the best of my ability.\"\nIn Buckinghamshire, Dr Kris Owden runs Caremark Aylesbury and is also a doctor who worked on hospital wards during the pandemic. \nThe firm pays relatively well and has managed to recruit enough new staff to replace most of those leaving but Dr Owden says they are still overstretched and have to refuse up to eight new people needing care each day.\n\"For us to be in this position before the winter, before the Christmas period is terrifying,\" he said. \nHe says a properly resourced care system would take pressure off the NHS and wants to see carers paid better, with a proper career structure and recognition of their skills. \nAmong his senior staff, supervisor Charlotte Backhouse and manager Vicky Hartgill - who are both normally office-based - are having to step in and do front-line work.\nOn top of her regular job, Vicky worked through the weekend and on Monday had an 05:00 start. Although she loves seeing clients, she says she is \"shattered\". \nShe added: \"We need to be able to recruit, we need to be able to recruit in a safe way and just have a bigger workforce.\n\"We do have to pick up the phone and change times. We do have to be creative with the care that we provide - and until we can get some more people through the door to support us, that's the way things will have to stay.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: \"We appreciate the dedication and tireless efforts of care workers throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond. \n\"We are providing at least \u00a3500m to support the care workforce as part of the \u00a35.4bn to reform social care.\n\"We are also working to ensure we have the right number of staff with the skills to deliver high quality care to meet increasing demands. \n\"This includes running regular national recruitment campaigns and providing councils with over \u00a31bn of additional funding for social care this year.\""

      "text": "A law firm is seeking to launch a group action against Amazon over employee rights for delivery drivers.\nLeigh Day is claiming drivers hired via third party delivery companies to make deliveries for the online giant should be given rights enjoyed by employees. \nThe drivers are classed as being self-employed, meaning they are not entitled to minimum wage and holiday pay.\nAmazon said it was committed to ensuring drivers were fairly paid by the delivery companies they work with. \nDrivers making deliveries on behalf of Amazon for its \"Delivery Service Partners\" are not entitled to National Minimum Wage or an employment contract, Leigh Day said.\nThe law firm says it has already begun legal action on behalf of two drivers and is seeking others to join a group action. \nLeigh Day, which brought, and won, a landmark case on behalf of Uber drivers for workers' rights in February, claims at least three thousand drivers could potentially be owed more than a hundred million pounds in compensation. \nIt believes that because Amazon tells drivers how they should work, and how they fit into the business, they should have more rights.\nThe law firm claims drivers are given estimated timings between deliveries via an app which they have to meet. However, according to Amazon, the routing app provides guidance  and it is up to drivers whether to follow the suggested route.\nKate Robinson, a Leigh Day employment solicitor, said: \"It appears that Amazon is short-changing drivers making deliveries on their behalf.\n\"Drivers delivering for Amazon have to work set shifts and book time off, yet Amazon claim they are self-employed.\"\nShe added that that millions of pounds of compensation would be \"a drop in the ocean\" to Amazon.\n\"For drivers on the other hand, earning at least National Minimum Wage, getting holiday pay and being under a proper employment contract could be life-changing,\" she added.\nMs Robinson stressed that it was \"time for Amazon to stop putting profit above people\".\nLeigh Day is bringing similar claims against Uber, Addison Lee, delivery company Stuart and used vehicle marketplace BCA.\nThe law firm has been pursuing an equal pay claim on behalf of thousands of Asda staff. It is also representing clients from Sainsbury's, Tesco, Morrisons and the Co-op.\nAmazon capitalised on a surge in demand for online shopping during the Covid pandemic, with sales rising 50% to \u00a320.63bn in 2020."

      "tags": "Economics,GDP,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK economy grew by 0.4% in August as more people dined out, went on holiday and attended music festivals.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the services sector made the biggest contribution to economic growth in the first full month after all Covid restrictions were lifted in England.\nIt said arts, entertainment and recreation grew 9%, boosted by sports clubs, amusement parks and festivals.\nThere was also more demand for hotels and campsites. \nRestrictions on social distancing were eased from 19 July.\nThe ONS said the economy is now 0.8% smaller than it was before the pandemic.\n\"The economy picked up in August as bars, restaurants and festivals benefited from the first full month without Covid-19 restrictions in England,\" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS.\n\"However, later and slightly weaker data from a number of industries now mean we estimate the economy fell a little overall in July.\"\nThe ONS said economic growth fell by 0.1% in July compared with initial estimates of 0.1% growth. \nActivity in accommodation and food services rose by 10.3% in August, within which hotels and campsites recorded 22.9% growth.\nIn travel, air transport and rail both grew in August as Covid-related measures eased, however both industry are still trading far below pre-pandemic levels. \nEmma-Lou Montgomery associate director at Fidelity International, said that while August's growth \"marks a small rebound\" on July, \"the worry remains that economic growth won't even be in touching distance of pre-pandemic levels until well into next year\".\nShe said supply chain disruption risks dampening consumer confidence.\n\"This all comes in the crucial lead up to Christmas, when suppliers and retailers should be firing on all cylinders,\" Ms Montgomery said.\"But with households facing steep price rises for everyday items, from the food shop through to the gas bill, there will be little desire - or capacity - to spend, spend, spend.\"\nGrowth in the economy - everything produced, from new cars to haircuts to restaurant meals - isn't at all slow by normal standards at 0.4% in a month. But we're supposed to be bouncing back with growth of 7% this year. \nWhat's becoming increasingly clear, is that it's not a lack of demand for goods and services that's holding the recovery back but the inability of firms to supply that demand. \nA big part of the reason? Shortages. In construction, for example, where business is not growing but shrinking, firms reported to the ONS that they've got healthy order books. But they can't meet more orders, partly because of a shortage of materials in August (for example, wood and steel) and partly because of a shortage of skilled staff. \nThe ONS reports evidence that the shortage of haulage drivers is slowing down industries from pharmaceuticals to electric lighting. Exports of goods, too, are down by 13% compared with 2018. \nSome of these shortages may be due to supply bottlenecks related to the post-pandemic global surge in activity. But without doubt some, notably the ongoing shortage of lorry drivers, are in large part related to Brexit. \nElsewhere, economic growth was uneven with some sectors hit by shortages of materials. Output in construction fell by 0.2% in August and the sector remains 1.5% below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe ONS said: \"This reflects recent challenges faced by the construction industry from rising input prices and delays to the availability of construction products - notably steel, concrete, timber and glass.\"\nThe manufacturing sector expanded by 0.5% in August following a 0.6% in July. The ONS said growth was led by an increase in vehicle production \"as it continues to recover following supply side challenges predominantly caused by the global microchip shortage disrupting car production\".\nBut it said the output in the manufacture of motor vehicles remains 14.5% below a peak in February this year.\nPaul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"Such drags may have become more widespread and significant in September and October, with the fuel crisis preventing some people from getting to work.\"\nHe said Capital Economics' activity indicator \"suggests that GDP may not have increased at all in September\".\nMartin Beck, economist at professional services firm, EY,said: \"The recovery is certainly facing more headwinds.\n\"Rising inflation, driven by significant increases in energy prices, and the recent cut in Universal Credit are squeezing consumers' spending power.\""

      "tags": "Leo Varadkar,Dominic Cummings",
      "text": "Ireland's deputy PM has warned governments doing trade deals with the UK that it is a nation that \"doesn't necessarily keep its word\".\nLeo Varadkar made the comment after Dominic Cummings suggested the UK had always intended to tear up the Brexit deal it signed with the EU in 2019.\nBoris Johnson's ex-adviser said the plan had been to \"ditch the bits we didn't like\" after winning power.\nThe government said the deal had not worked as intended and must be changed. \nAnd it accused the EU of failing to protect the Good Friday peace agreement in its implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nMr Johnson fought the 2019 election on a \"Get Brexit done\" platform.\nDuring the campaign, he repeatedly claimed the withdrawal agreement he had negotiated with Brussels - including the Northern Ireland Protocol - was a \"great\" deal that was \"oven ready\".\nThe UK now wants to change the deal to allow goods to circulate more freely between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nEU officials are travelling to London later to present their proposals for the border - but they are unwilling to rewrite the protocol and their proposals are unlikely to satisfy Brexit minister Lord Frost, who laid out the UK's plans for an entirely new protocol on Tuesday.\nMr Cummings - who has turned against Mr Johnson since being removed from Downing Street at the end of 2020 - claims the prime minister never understood what the withdrawal agreement really meant.\nHe tweeted: \"What I've said does NOT mean 'the PM was lying in General Election 2019', he never had a scoobydoo [a clue] what the deal he signed meant.\n\"He never understood what leaving Customs Union meant until November 2020.\"\nWhen the prime minister did finally comprehend, said Mr Cummings, \"he was babbling 'I'd never have signed it if I'd understood it' (but that WAS a lie)\".\nAsked if Mr Cummings was correct in his assessment, Lord Frost said: \"We all understood extremely well what the deal meant, it delivered on democracy, took the UK out of the EU whole and entire, and it was a very good deal.\"\nBut he said it now had to be changed because it was \"undermining the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, not supporting it\".\n\"The problem with the protocol at the moment is that EU law, with the European Court of Justice as the enforcer, is applied in Northern Ireland without any democratic process. That has to change if we are to find governance arrangements people can live with,\" he said.\nIn a statement, the UK government said the protocol needed \"significant change\" to avoid further severe \"economic, political and societal\" disruption in Northern Ireland and to make it \"sustainable for the future\".\nMr Cummings - the former Vote Leave campaign chief - said that when Boris Johnson entered Downing Street in 2019, the country was facing the \"worst constitutional crisis in a century\" with much of what he called the \"deep state\" angling for \"Brino\" [Brexit in name only] or a second referendum.\n\"So we wriggled through with best option we could and intended to get the trolley [his nickname for Boris Johnson] to ditch bits we didn't like after whacking [Labour leader Jeremy] Corbyn. We prioritised,\" he said.\nIn July this year, Mr Cummings told the BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg the Irish government had also wanted to \"fudge things\" and \"it suited both sides to sign up to something that was not what either side had really wanted and which punted difficult questions into the future\".\nIn his latest tweets, Mr Cummings dismissed suggestions that abandoning elements of the deal would mean breaking international law.\n\"Our priorities meant e.g. getting Brexit done is 10,000 times more important than lawyers yapping re international law in negotiations with people who break international law all the time,\" he said.\nMr Varadkar told RTE television: \"I hope Dominic Cummings is speaking for himself and not for the British government.\n\"But those comments are very alarming because that would indicate that this is a government, an administration, that acted in bad faith and that message needs to be heard around the world.\n\"If the British government doesn't honour its agreements, it doesn't adhere to treaties it signs, that must apply to everyone else too.\n\"At the moment they're going around the world, they're trying to negotiate new trade agreements... \n\"Surely the message must go out to all countries around the world that this is a British government that doesn't necessarily keep its word and doesn't necessarily honour the agreements it makes.\n\"And you shouldn't make any agreements with them until such time as you're confident that they keep their promises, and honour things, for example, like the protocol.\"\nThe Taoiseach (Ireland's PM) Miche\u00e1l Martin has given his backing to EU proposals for changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol, but he urged both sides to work \"in good faith\" and focus on \"addressing disruption in trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain\".\nTheresa May's former chief of staff, Lord Gavin Barwell, has, meanwhile, warned the UK's proposal for changing the Northern Ireland protocol has \"no chance of success and is going to do even further damage to our relationship with our nearest neighbours\". \n\"My problem is if you agree something and fight an election saying what a fantastic deal this is - and then almost immediately afterwards you start to try and unpick the thing - the danger is the people you negotiating with think you didn't agree it in good faith in first place, and that makes it much more challenging when you try to renegotiate it,\" he told an Institute for Government event. \nHe said he did not like the current Northern Ireland Protocol - but argued that the UK government had to meet the EU \"half way\".

      "text": "World temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life.\nLeft unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species. \nWe face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.\nClimate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.\nThe rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. \nWhen these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.\nThe world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.\nTemperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100. \nHowever, unless further action is taken, the planet could still warm by more than 2C by the end of this century. A report in 2021 by the Climate Action Tracker group calculated that the world was heading for 2.4C of warming by the end of the century.\nIf nothing is done, scientists think global warming could exceed 4C in the future, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels and irreversible loss of plant and animal species. \nExtreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods. \nWith further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as farmland turns into desert. In other regions, the opposite is happening, with extreme rainfall causing historic flooding - as seen recently in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nPeople in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse.\nOur oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already lost half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change.\nWildfires are becoming more frequent as climate change increases the risk of hot, dry weather. \nAnd as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change.\nIn a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.\nScientists believe at least 550 species could be lost this century if action is not taken. \nClimate change has different effects in different areas of the world. Some places will warm more than others, some will receive more rainfall and others will face more droughts. \nIf temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:\nCountries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C. \nThe UK is hosting a summit for world leaders, called COP26, in November, where countries will set out their carbon reduction plans for 2030. \nMany countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.\nExperts agree that this is achievable, but it will require governments, businesses and individuals to make big changes.\nMajor changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives can limit our impact on the climate:\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nTop image from Getty Images.

At the end of the day you have to go back to your normal people, your normal market, your normal tenants who keep your bread buttered.\"\nAirbnb told the BBC they would donate all revenue from stays in Glasgow during the summit to Zero Waste Scotland.\nA spokesperson said: \"We are offering Glaswegians an incentive to start hosting in an effort to provide more accommodation during a unique event and to address a significant accommodation shortage. \n\"The expected attendance for COP26 is double that of local hotel capacity and hosting helps cities like Glasgow use existing space to scale up and welcome major events.\" \nNearly 700 households have signed up to the COP26 Homestay Network.\nOperated by the third sector, the initiative is asking people to open their doors and provide affordable or free accommodation to COP26 attendees.\nBut Jillian Evans, the head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, told BBC Scotland she had some concerns about this plan.\nShe said: \"People coming from different parts of the world, some where the vaccination programme is not the same as ours, there are risks associated with that.\n\"Then you put people in touch with one another, in folk's homes, and that increases the risk even more.\"\nA COP26 spokesperson told the BBC: \"As hosts of COP26 it is of huge importance to the UK there are a wide range accommodation options available which suit the requirement of delegates attending from around the world. \n\"We have been working with our hotel provider, MCI, to make sure this is the case.\" \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control.

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nNHS Digital is investigating why the app used in England and Wales to provide proof of a person's Covid status stopped working for a time on Wednesday afternoon. Users received error messages while trying to retrieve their QR code or record of vaccination. One person tweeted NHS Digital to say the issue had made them miss a flight. The problem appeared to be fixed after a couple of hours.\nFigures from the National Records of Scotland show the number of people dying in the nation last week was 30% higher than the average for the same week from 2015 to 2019. The increase comes at a time when deaths where Covid was mentioned in the registration have fallen for the second consecutive week. The number of deaths linked to the pandemic appears to have peaked in the week ending 27 September. \nTwo major US carriers, American and Southwest Airlines, have said they will not comply with an order from the governor of Texas which bans companies from requiring their employees to be vaccinated against Covid. Governor Greg Abbott believes getting jabbed should remain voluntary - despite US President Joe Biden saying staff of large companies must get vaccinated or face weekly testing. Texas-based Southwest said it would comply with the president's order \"to remain compliant as a federal contractor\".\nSingapore has been effectively shut off from the outside world for 21 months. But from 19 October Singaporeans will be able to travel freely to a dozen countries without quarantine and with less testing - so long as they are fully vaccinated. This caused such a demand for air tickets that Singapore Airlines' website crashed. The move to open up is part of the Singapore government's strategy to live with Covid. \"We should respect Covid-19, but we must not be paralysed by fear,\" Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said.\nFourteen-year-old Makenzy Beard from Swansea took up painting when schools closed in March 2020. A portrait of her neighbour, farmer John Tucker, went viral and she has since had interest in her work from the Middle East, US and the other parts of the UK. Three of her pieces - which were displayed in a Cardiff art gallery - have already sold with one buyer offering \u00a310,000. But Makenzy says for now she wants to continue painting as a hobby.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nJob vacancies are at a record high, rising to 1.1 million in the three months to September - in part due to the pandemic.

      "tags": "Economics,GDP,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK economy grew by 0.4% in August as more people dined out, went on holiday and attended music festivals.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the services sector made the biggest contribution to economic growth in the first full month after all Covid restrictions were lifted in England.\nIt said arts, entertainment and recreation grew 9%, boosted by sports clubs, amusement parks and festivals.\nThere was also more demand for hotels and campsites. \nRestrictions on social distancing were eased from 19 July.\nThe ONS said the economy is now 0.8% smaller than it was before the pandemic.\n\"The economy picked up in August as bars, restaurants and festivals benefited from the first full month without Covid-19 restrictions in England,\" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS.\n\"However, later and slightly weaker data from a number of industries now mean we estimate the economy fell a little overall in July.\"\nThe ONS said economic growth fell by 0.1% in July compared with initial estimates of 0.1% growth. \nActivity in accommodation and food services rose by 10.3% in August, within which hotels and campsites recorded 22.9% growth.\nIn travel, air transport and rail both grew in August as Covid-related measures eased, however both industry are still trading far below pre-pandemic levels. \nEmma-Lou Montgomery associate director at Fidelity International, said that while August's growth \"marks a small rebound\" on July, \"the worry remains that economic growth won't even be in touching distance of pre-pandemic levels until well into next year\".\nShe said supply chain disruption risks dampening consumer confidence.\n\"This all comes in the crucial lead up to Christmas, when suppliers and retailers should be firing on all cylinders,\" Ms Montgomery said.\"But with households facing steep price rises for everyday items, from the food shop through to the gas bill, there will be little desire - or capacity - to spend, spend, spend.\"\nGrowth in the economy - everything produced, from new cars to haircuts to restaurant meals - isn't at all slow by normal standards at 0.4% in a month. But we're supposed to be bouncing back with growth of 7% this year. \nWhat's becoming increasingly clear, is that it's not a lack of demand for goods and services that's holding the recovery back but the inability of firms to supply that demand. \nA big part of the reason? Shortages. In construction, for example, where business is not growing but shrinking, firms reported to the ONS that they've got healthy order books. But they can't meet more orders, partly because of a shortage of materials in August (for example, wood and steel) and partly because of a shortage of skilled staff. \nThe ONS reports evidence that the shortage of haulage drivers is slowing down industries from pharmaceuticals to electric lighting. Exports of goods, too, are down by 13% compared with 2018. \nSome of these shortages may be due to supply bottlenecks related to the post-pandemic global surge in activity. But without doubt some, notably the ongoing shortage of lorry drivers, are in large part related to Brexit. \nElsewhere, economic growth was uneven with some sectors hit by shortages of materials. Output in construction fell by 0.2% in August and the sector remains 1.5% below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe ONS said: \"This reflects recent challenges faced by the construction industry from rising input prices and delays to the availability of construction products - notably steel, concrete, timber and glass.\"\nThe manufacturing sector expanded by 0.5% in August following a 0.6% in July. The ONS said growth was led by an increase in vehicle production \"as it continues to recover following supply side challenges predominantly caused by the global microchip shortage disrupting car production\".\nBut it said the output in the manufacture of motor vehicles remains 14.5% below a peak in February this year.\nPaul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"Such drags may have become more widespread and significant in September and October, with the fuel crisis preventing some people from getting to work.\"\nHe said Capital Economics' activity indicator \"suggests that GDP may not have increased at all in September\".\nMartin Beck, economist at professional services firm, EY,said: \"The recovery is certainly facing more headwinds.\n\"Rising inflation, driven by significant increases in energy prices, and the recent cut in Universal Credit are squeezing consumers' spending power.\""

We want to provide that in the community.\n\"We're very grateful. They've given up a lot of time, been very open and honest at a time when a lot of them were feeling very unwell themselves and we hope it'll result in a very good service for them.\n\"Because of the varying nature of the condition, we need a multidisciplinary team of professionals, such as occupational therapy, dietetics, psychology, speech and language therapy, to make sure we can tailor care to individual needs.\"\nDeborah Illman-Roberts, from Prestatyn, is 38 and was working as a healthcare support worker for Denbigh District Nurses in March 2020 when she fell ill with Covid but didn't need hospital treatment.\nShe gradually got more tired throughout the year and was diagnosed with long Covid in October 2020, after her mobility started to deteriorate.\nBy January 2021, she was getting around with crutches and now also experiences severe fatigue, breathlessness and what she calls \"brain fog\", which sees her struggles to find the right words to say.\nShe said: \"Previously I was working full-time; I lived an outdoor life. Now, I can't mobilise without crutches. If I go out, I use my mobility scooter. I was an active working mum and it's destroyed that.\"\n\"Day to day, I rely on my wife to care for me. There's a lot of jobs I can't do, we've got aids around the house.\n\"There's some support groups on Facebook but nobody knows. You need answers, you want answers, you go to GPs, but they don't know the answers and can't help you.\n\"You might go for scans and blood tests, but they all come back normal. It's such an unknown.\"\nGuidance for UK health workers describes long Covid as symptoms continuing for more than 12 weeks after an infection - severe or mild - and can't be explained by another cause.\nAccording to the NHS, symptoms include:\nMs Illman-Roberts said she cried with relief when she heard about the health board's long Covid pathway and was invited to be part of it.\n\"I couldn't miss it; it's been such a long and lonely road for me and many others I speak to. To know we could maybe help future sufferers and highlight the condition is massive, it gives us hope for the future that there is help out there,\" she said.\n\"The professionals might be saying this is going to be me for good, but at my age and as a mum that's really hard to accept.\n\"So, to know there's going to be help out there to look into the condition and find out what's causing all the different symptoms, that's going to be massive for everyone and, hopefully for people that are unfortunate to have the condition, they know there's somewhere they can go for help now.\""

She said they had worked hard \"and had a good laugh along the way\". \nShe added: \"I know Robert had a lot more to give to the competition but his health of course comes first and I wish him a speedy recovery. I feel lucky to have danced with him and to call him a friend.\"\nFellow contestants also sent their best wishes, with BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker saying it had \"been wonderful to watch them enjoying every dance each week\". \nStrictly's executive producer Sarah James thanked the pair for the \"commitment, creativity and joy they brought to the show\".\nShe said they were \"so sad\" but completely understood and supported his decision, adding that everyone on Strictly sent \"love and best wishes for his continued recovery\".  \nWebb and Buswell had performed three dances together, most recently as Kermit and Miss Piggy in last weekend's Movie Week show. \nThey danced a quickstep to The Muppet Show theme, from The Muppets Movie, on Saturday night and scored 25 points from the judges. Viewers gave them enough votes to avoid the dance off, broadcast on Sunday. \nWebb, who previously became a fan favourite with a Flashdance routine on Let's Dance for Comic Relief, had said it was his health condition that made him want to sign up for Strictly. \n\"It's partly my age, and it's partly that nearly two years ago I had quite a big-deal health thing,\" he told the BBC before the live shows began. \"I had to have open heart surgery, so since then I think my attitude is basically, this is no time to be cool, sitting at the edges watching the other people do the dancing.\""

It then worked out the life expectancy for different communities, based on the death records in those places.\nIt found that while life expectancy rose in most places during the first decade of the millennium, from 2010 it began to decline in some places.\nAreas in London and the home counties still continued on the path of living longer - but life expectancy fell in some urban parts of Leeds, Newcastle, Manchester, Liverpool and Blackpool where life expectancy was below 70 for men and 75 for women.\nBy 2019, the researchers say there was a 20-year gap in life expectancy between a woman living in Camden (95.4 years) versus a woman living in one area of Leeds (74.7 years). \nAnd for men, there was a 27-year gap in life expectancy between areas in Kensington and Chelsea (95.3 years) and parts of Blackpool (68.3 years) \nAverage life expectancy in the UK is 79 years for men and just below 83 years for women, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics.\n\"Declines in life expectancy used to be rare in wealthy countries like the UK, and happened when there were major adversities like wars and pandemics,\" said Prof Ezzati. \n\"For such declines to be seen in 'normal times' before the pandemic is alarming,\" he said - and he called for action to be taken.\nThe researchers say the differences are down to poverty, insecure employment as well as reductions in welfare support and healthcare.\nThey are calling on the government to increase investments in public health in areas with lower life expectancy.\nThe government has previously pledged to tackle regional inequalities in health as part of its \"levelling-up\" agenda.\nIn a speech earlier this year, Boris Johnson addressed the differences in life expectancy, and called it an \"an outrage\".

      "text": "\"I used to think, 'will my son kill me in my sleep?'\"\nLisa said her 13-year-old son James became so violent in lockdown last year, she feared for her life - and it seems she is not alone.\nOne service supporting families in Wales has seen a rise in \"child on parent\" domestic abuse - with children as young as five referred for help.\nNick Corrigan, of Parallel Lives, said \"being locked in together\" escalated the situation for a lot of families.\n\"The amount of times I thought about the knives downstairs,\" said Lisa. \"And is he going to kill us in our sleep?\"\nWhen things were at their worst, she would insist James's two-year-old brother slept in with her for safety.\nIt was shortly after the UK went into lockdown because of the Covid pandemic in March last year, said Lisa, that his behaviour first changed, from a \"model son and caring big brother\" to a domestic abuser.\n\"He was staying in bed all the time,\" recalled Lisa, whose name has been changed to protect her identity.\n\"I wanted to get him up and make a family chicken casserole.\n\"He just got angry for no reason and went into the living room and threw the dog. Just picked the dog up and threw him.\n\"The dog squealed, and I just held it.\"\nJames, whose name has also been changed to protect his identity, used to affectionately refer to the family dog as his \"son\". \nSo the fact he could turn on his beloved pet made Lisa fear he could hurt any of them.\nLisa was one of a growing number of parents dealing with domestic violence from their children during lockdown. \nSome parents reported TVs being thrown at them while other flashpoints sometimes left parents needing hospital treatment.\nFor Lisa, her son's attack on the dog was just the beginning. His violence began to escalate and she began to feel like his \"prisoner\".\nShe became terrified that he could hurt his younger brother next. As well as being unpredictable, his violent outbursts were also becoming more controlling. \nWhen they were late to leave the house one morning, Lisa shouted upstairs to urge him to hurry up.\n\"I'd had just had an operation on my hand,\" Lisa explained. \"He swore and said, 'I'll be down in a minute'.\n\"He just ran downstairs and grabbed my hand so hard I thought he'd opened the wound. He knew I'd had an operation. He wanted to hurt me a way that maybe people wouldn't see, a way that wouldn't show a bruise.\" \nLisa soon found out James himself was being bullied by classmates. Like any mother, she was distraught and desperate to help - but James's own spiralling behaviour meant she felt she was no longer in control.\nShe said one of her darkest moments was finally begging social services to take her son away.  Lisa said she still loved James and wanted to help - but she no longer recognised who her son had become.\n\"It was all going downhill so fast,\" she said. \"I felt like I was being judged for having a child that was so aggressive, so horrid.\n\"It was as though he was letting me have parental control when he felt like it. Then if I punished him on the wrong day, I was going to get it.\"\nLisa said she was forced to lock herself and James's brother in her bedroom and dial 999 frequently but was always told things weren't bad enough to act, because James himself was living in a \"safe environment\".\nShe said she reached out to councillors, MPs, charities, social services and police, but was told nothing could be done.\nEventually, Lisa said she and James were offered a place on a course run by one of Wales's only support services for child on parent violence - and that is something she says helped \"beyond recognition\".\nParallel Lives said they saw child on parent violence referrals increase by a third since the start of the pandemic in March 2020.\nThe Home Office-funded project, overseen by the Wales Violence Prevention Unit, said it was still seeing the effects of lockdown more than a year later, with families affected across every part of society - most having never experienced any form of domestic abuse before.\n\"We've seen cases where children have thrown television sets at parents, we have seen cases where they have attacked parents with hammers, with knives from the kitchen,\" said Nick Corrigan, director of Media Academy Cymru, which runs the Parallel Lives programme.\n\"Even one instance could be fatal,\" he said.\nMr Corrigan said it was safe to assume \"being locked in together\" had escalated the situation for a lot of families.\n\"We're getting younger and younger referrals,\" he said. \"In the last week, we've had referrals for five-year-olds.\"\nThe programme coordinator said most children's aggression stemmed from an unmet need - in James's case being bullied himself was a factor.\n\"They don't wake up one morning and want to behave the way they are,\" said Megan Davies.\n\"They are showing those behaviours as a way of communication, of saying 'there's something going on, I need help'.\n\"Unfortunately, they often haven't got the vocabulary, or the mental health for whatever reason, to verbalise how they feel.\"\nThe Welsh government said the pandemic had increased the risk of child parent abuse for some families and they had given an extra \u00a35.5m to Wales' specialist violence against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence sectors to \"respond to more complex cases and greater pressure on services\".\n\"Our Wales Safeguarding Procedures promote consistent practices across Wales,\" added a spokesperson.\n\"This includes best practice guides, one of which outlines advice on child and adolescent on parent violence and abuse, setting out the importance of recognising the impact on both the parent and the child and the need to provide support for both.\"\nHome Office Safeguarding Minister Rachel Maclean said: \"The pandemic has underlined that home is not a safe place for everyone, which is why the government has provided more than \u00a328m to domestic abuse organisations to date to help them keep helplines running and vital services open.\n\"I hugely value initiatives like the Parallel Lives Programme, which is why we work closely with the South Wales Violence Prevention Unit to ensure they can continue their vital work around child to parent abuse. \n\"We also provide \u00a33m for other programmes across England and Wales which support young people experiencing domestic abuse, including those who are displaying harmful behaviours.\n\"The new Domestic Abuse Act is fundamentally transforming our response to this devastating crime and is providing greater protection for victims.\"\nWithout help, Lisa said she firmly believed her son would be in care or in jail, most likely for a crime against his family.\n\"James has learned empathy on a deeper level,\" she said. \"He now wants to help himself again.\"\nIn fact, James, who was able to continue living at home, supported Lisa in her decision to speak out about what happened last year.\nShe said both of them were now willing to do whatever it took to stop their relationship becoming so bad again - while they also hoped their story might encourage others, to know that things can get better."

      "text": "Political and business leaders in Northern Ireland, and further afield, have been giving their reaction to the EU's plan to reduce post-Brexit checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.\nThe proposals include scrapping checks on most food products being shipped to, and remaining in, Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nThe EU has also said the plan will cut customs paperwork by 50%.\nThe new plan, which seeks to calm a long-running dispute over a key part of the Brexit agreement, would remove about 80% of spot checks, the EU said.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the proposals were \"a good mark of progress\". \nThe party is seeking to recall the Northern Ireland Assembly to demonstrate support for the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nMs O'Neill said the publication demonstrates \"both in word and deed\" that the EU are living up to commitments made to business and political leaders. \nHowever, Ms O'Neill said it is now \"up to others whether or not they engage with this process\". \n\"The British government and the DUP have dishonestly promoted a false narrative that the protocol does not enjoy the support or consent of the people of the north. That is untrue. \n\"The reality is that Brexit does not command the support or consent of the assembly,\" she said. \nThe proposals are a \"starting point\", but appear to fall \"far short of the fundamental change needed\", Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Jeffrey Donaldson has said. \nMr Donaldson said the party will \"take time to study the detail of the papers produced\".\nHowever, he said there was \"no escaping the reality that the Northern Ireland Protocol has harmed Northern Ireland, both in economic and constitutional terms\".\n\"The imposition of the protocol has harmed the balances created by the Belfast Agreement and subsequent agreements and were the situation to remain unaltered would undo the political progress of the last 20 years,\" he said. \nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood has urged political leaders to embrace the new proposals. \nThe Foyle MP said the measures \"go further than expected\" and demonstrate that EU leaders are \"stretching themselves in the interests of people and businesses in Northern Ireland\". \nHe said political leaders, particularly those of unionist parties, should \"reflect on the very serious efforts made by the European Commission\" in easing challenges to trade and \"addressing their concerns about democratic deficits\". \n\"The DUP, in particular, need to decide if they're on the side of people and businesses here or in the pocket of Boris Johnson,\" he said. \n\"There is now a clear landing zone that will address the protocol challenges, allow us to maximise the opportunities and most importantly, expend political energy dealing with the crisis in our health service, our crumbling schools estate and managing the pandemic. \n\"We need to grasp that opportunity.\"\nIt would be an \"act of folly\" for opponents of the NI Protocol to \"squander the opportunity to provide certainty and stability given by the EU's proposals\", Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry MP has said.\nDr Farry said he hoped the EU's proposals could form the basis for an agreement between the UK and EU which \"addresses practical issues around the protocol in a pragmatic way\". \n\"The challenges facing Northern Ireland come from Brexit,\" he said, adding that the protocol is \"the symptom of the problem, not the cause\".\n\"It would be an act of supreme folly to squander this chance to move on and indeed to impose even more delusional red-lines,\" he said. \nIt is \"a step forward but there remains a long way to go\", according to UUP leader Doug Beattie.\n\"We were told the protocol negotiations could not be reopened, but we have now proven otherwise. This has been achieved through negotiation, not threats; through engagement not disengagement.\n\"The fact that the EU recognises that the protocol isn't working and needs substantial change is a positive development.\n\"However, I am genuinely disappointed by what I heard from European Commission Vice-President Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d and the supporting non-papers.\n\"Expectations were raised, but the proposals do not match them.\"\nThe EU's latest proposals \"utterly fail the sovereignty test\", TUV leader Jim Allister has said. \nMr Allister described the protocol as \"an instrument delivering both economic dislocation and constitutional dislocation within the UK\".\nHe said the proposals \"retain us in a foreign single market for goods, under a foreign customs code and VAT regime, ruled by foreign laws and adjudicated upon by a foreign court.\" \n\"GB would continue to be decreed a 'third country' vis-a-vis Northern Ireland's trade,\" he said, adding that this \"can never be acceptable\". \nThe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said both the UK and EU had listened to businesses and are aware of the technical solutions needed to protect trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\n\"Both sides must now grasp this opportunity to get back round the table - and agree sustainable long-term solutions that work for businesses and communities in Northern Ireland,\" CBI Europe Director Sean McGuire said.\nThe Northern Ireland Retail Consortium (NIRC) has welcomed \"signs of movement from both sides\". \nHowever, a spokesperson said if the proposals are to work they must provide \"stability, certainty, simplicity and affordability\" to Northern Ireland's business community. \nThey said the NIRC will \"reserve judgement\" on whether these requirements have been met \"until both legal and technical texts have been seen\". \n\"As an umbrella group for business, we will have meetings with both the UK Government and the European Commission to discuss these proposals in full and we look forward to understanding how they would keep NI business competitive and ensure choice and affordability for consumers,\" the spokesperson added. \nThe FSB in NI's Roger Pollen said there is now an onus on both sides to negotiate a new trade solution relatively quickly.\n\"In terms of the timescale as to when we need to get this sorted, yesterday would have been very nice,\" he said\nMr Pollen said under current arrangements many businesses in Northern Ireland are faced with \"vast amounts of bureaucracy\" when bringing goods across from GB.\nShould new arrangements be agreed by the UK and EU before Christmas, \"businesses would heave a fairly big sigh of relief\". \nSeamus Leheny, a representative of trade body Logistics UK, said companies across the UK are not concerned about the European Court of Justice's (ECJ) role in the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThe UK Government has demanded that the ECJ is removed from its role in the protocol as the arbitrator of trade disputes.\nBut Logistics UK policy manager Mr Leheny told BBC News: \"We have got 18,000 members across the UK and we haven't had any representation from any member regarding the ECJ.\n\"What people want is solutions to the protocol, they want the protocol to work and that is what we are interested in.\"\nHe added: \"What people are looking for, we are in solution mode here, and the logistics industry, we are solution seekers. We want to get these fixes that the EU have proposed.\n\"We need to see the legal text obviously to make sure the safeguards are there but people just want to build on this because they see the best way for peace in Northern Ireland is improve people's prospects and livelihoods. That's when I speak to businesses, that's what they want.\" \nEuropean Commissioner and former MEP Mairead McGuinness said the offer was a \"significant step forward\" by the EU and a \"huge opportunity\" for people in Northern Ireland. \n\"Of course there will be difficult issues and there will be a lot of debate and commentary around this,\" she told the BBC.\n\"However, I do believe that the idea of getting this resolved by Christmas is attainable and it would be very desirable.\"\nThe Shadow Minister for Task Force Europe Baroness Jenny Chapman said that \"today could be a day where we take a step forward\" in the process to achieve stability to people in NI and across the UK.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Baroness Chapman said the Labour Party would not get rid of the protocol entirely, but would instead look at the proposals \"in good faith\" and talk to businesses, leaders and elected politicians in Northern Ireland to see if they were sufficient. \n\"What isn't the right way is to be antagonistic and pick a fight,\" she added.

      "tags": "China,Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "China's carbon emissions are vast and growing, dwarfing those of other countries. \nExperts agree that without big reductions in China's emissions, the world cannot win the fight against climate change.\nIn 2020, China's President Xi Jinping said his country would aim for its emissions to reach their highest point before 2030 and for carbon neutrality before 2060. \nHis statement has now been confirmed as China's official position ahead of the COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow.\nBut China has not said exactly how these goals will be achieved.  \nWhile all countries face problems getting their emissions down, China is facing the biggest challenge. \nPer person, China's emissions are about half those of the US, but its huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions. \nChina became the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2006 and is now responsible for more than a quarter of the world's overall greenhouse gas emissions. \nIt is expected to come under intense scrutiny at the COP26 summit over its commitments to reduce these. \nAlong with all the other signatories to the Paris Agreement in 2015, China agreed to make changes to try to keep global warming at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and \"well below\" 2C.\nChina strengthened its commitments in 2020, but Climate Action Tracker, an international group of scientists and policy experts say its current actions to meet that goal are \"highly insufficient\".  \nGetting China's emissions down is achievable, according to many experts, but will require a radical shift.\nCoal has been the country's main source of energy for decades.\nPresident Xi says China will \"phase down\" coal use from 2026 - and will not build new coal-fired projects abroad - but some governments and campaigners say the plans are not going far enough. \nResearchers at Tsinghua University in Beijing say China will need to stop using coal entirely for generating electricity by 2050, to be replaced by nuclear and renewable energy production. \nAnd far from shutting down coal-fired power stations, China is currently building new ones at more than 60 locations across the country, with many sites having more than one plant.\nNew stations are usually active for 30 to 40 years, so China will need to reduce the capacity of newer plants as well as close old ones if it is to bring emissions down, says researcher Philippe Ciais of the Institute of Environment and Climate Science in Paris.   \nIt may be possible to retrofit some to capture emissions, but the technology to do so at scale is still developing, and many plants will have to be written off after minimal use. \nChina argues it has a right to do what Western countries have done in the past, releasing carbon dioxide in the process of developing its economy and reducing poverty.\nIn the short term, Beijing has ordered coal mines to increase production to avoid power shortages over the coming winter. Surging demand from heavy industry in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to shortages in several regions of the country in recent weeks.\nTsinghua University researchers say 90% of power should come from nuclear and renewables by 2050.\nIn moving towards that goal, China's lead in the manufacture of green technology, such as solar panels and large-scale batteries, may be a big help. \nChina first embraced green technologies as a means to tackle air pollution, a serious problem for many cities. \nBut the government also believes they have enormous economic potential, providing jobs and income for millions of Chinese, as well as reducing China's dependence on foreign oil and gas.\n\"China is already leading the global energy transition,\" says Yue Cao of the Overseas Development Institute. \"One of the reasons we are able to deploy cheaper and cheaper green technology is China.\" \nChina generates more solar power than any other country. That might not be so impressive given China's enormous population, but it is a sign of where the country is heading.\nChina's wind power installations were more than triple those of any other country in 2020.\nChina says the proportion of its energy generated from non-fossil fuel sources should be 25% by 2030, and it is expected by many observers to hit the target early. \nChina ranks seventh in the world for its percentage of car sales that are electric, but given its huge size, China makes and buys more electric cars than any other country by a considerable margin. \nCurrently, about one in 20 cars bought in China is electric-powered.\nBy 2035, Chinese officials and car industry representatives are predicting that almost all new vehicles sold in China will be fully electric-powered or hybrid.\nWorking out by how much the shift to electric vehicles reduces emissions is not straightforward - particularly when taking into account manufacturing and charging sources. \nBut studies suggest that emissions over the lifetimes of electric vehicles are typically below those of petrol and diesel equivalents. \nThis matters because transport is responsible for around a quarter of carbon emissions from fuel combustion, with road vehicles being the largest emitters. \nChina will also by 2025 be producing batteries with double the capacity of those produced by the rest of the world combined.\nObservers say that will enable the storage and release of energy from renewable sources on a previously impossible scale.\nGetting to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions doesn't mean that China will stop producing emissions.\nIt means China will cut emissions as much as possible and absorb what's left, through a combination of different approaches.\nIncreasing the area of land covered in vegetation will help, as plants absorb carbon dioxide.\nHere again, there is encouraging news. China is getting greener at a faster rate than any other country, largely as a result of its forestry programmes designed to reduce soil erosion and pollution.\nIt is also partly a result of replanting fields to produce more than one harvest per year, which keeps land covered in vegetation for longer. \nThe world needs China to succeed. \n\"Unless China decarbonises, we're not going to beat climate change,\" says prof David Tyfield of the Lancaster Environment Centre.\nChina has some big advantages, particularly its capacity to stick to long-term strategies and mobilise large-scale investments.  \nThe Chinese authorities are facing a colossal task. What happens next could hardly be more important."

      "text": "Same-sex marriage has been legal in the Netherlands since 2001 but it has always been assumed that it could not apply to the crown as there would have to be an heir to the throne.\nNow caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte has made clear any king or queen could also marry a person of the same sex.\nThe heir to the Dutch throne, Princess Amalia, turns 18 in December.\nMr Rutte said it was all about \"theoretical situations\" but the next queen could marry a woman.\n\"Therefore the cabinet does not see that an heir to the throne or the king should abdicate if he or she would like to marry a partner of the same sex,\" he explained in a response to a written question in parliament from his own party.\nAs King Willem-Alexander's eldest child, Princess Amalia's future has come under scrutiny, with one book over the summer raising the issue of what might happen if she chose to marry a same-sex partner.\nThe book did not speculate over the princess's personal life, and there is no indication of any wedding in the pipeline. Amalia is expected to go to university next year and she has declined the royal income she is entitled to while she is a student.\nThe question prompted two MPs from Mr Rutte's own liberal VVD party to ask whether current restrictions on royal marriage met with the \"norms and values of 2021\".\nAlthough the cabinet makes it clear that same-sex marriage is possible, what is not known is what would happen to the succession if there were children born from a same-sex royal marriage, for example via adoption or a sperm donor.\n\"It's frightfully complicated,\" Mr Rutte explained. The Dutch constitution states that the king or queen can only be succeeded by a \"lawful descendant\".\nThe prime minister said that it was purely theoretical at this stage but it would be up to parliament, which has to give approval to a royal marriage. \"Let's cross that bridge if we come to it,\" he told Dutch TV."

      "text": "A potentially risky laser treatment offered to menopausal women to rejuvenate the vagina is no better than sham or fake therapy, researchers say. \nThey tested it in a trial to see if it might ease vaginal dryness and painful sex linked to going through the change.\nNHS advisory body the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says the therapy should only be used for research. \nSome private clinics in the UK and the US, however, continue to offer it. \nLaser rejuvenation involves a probe being inserted into the vagina to heat and change or remodel the surrounding tissue. \nClinics claim kick-starting the body's healing process by purposefully injuring the tissue can increase natural lubrication and restore sexual gratification.  \nThe non-surgical treatment can be completed within a lunch hour but is not entirely risk free, officials say. \nThe US regulator has already said it is \"deeply concerned\" women can be harmed by the procedure. \nSome who have had it have experienced vaginal burns and scarring. \nThe research, described in the Journal of the American Medical Association, is one of the largest studies to independently scrutinise the therapy using the \"gold standard\" design of a clinical trial. \nNICE has been calling for this type of work, to determine if the therapy is safe and beneficial enough to recommend for wider use in the NHS.\nThe Australian researchers, not funded by the industry, randomised 85 women to receive either the laser treatment or a placebo procedure - where the probe was inserted but the required \"dose\" of the laser energy not delivered. \nNo serious side-effects were recorded - but during the year of follow-up, there was no discernible difference between the two groups in terms of symptom improvement either. \nAn accompanying editorial in JAMA likened the laser-therapy situation to the recent vaginal-mesh scare, when some women were harmed by a procedure later halted amid safety concerns. \nThe authors, Drs Marisa Adelman and Ingrid Nygaard, from the University of Utah School of Medicine, said: \"The widespread clinical use of vaginal laser therapy, followed by burgeoning reports of adverse events and FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] warnings, brought an unfortunate sense of deja vu. \n\"After a rush to market vaginal mesh products for the management of pelvic organ prolapse prior to the completion of rigorous randomised trials, these products are no longer marketed in the US.\n\"Although marketing prior to the availability of evidence demonstrating efficacy and safety may be associated with short-term profits for companies and clinicians, this approach closes any window of opportunity to actually learn what individuals, if any, benefit from the treatment, as well as those at increased risk for harms.\"\nBritish Menopause Society past-president and spokesman Tim Hillard, a consultant gynaecologist in Dorset, said: \"This is the type of study we have been waiting for. \n\"It's one of the biggest randomised trials and isn't industry funded. \n\"It really reinforces that doctors should only be offering this therapy in clinical trials to gather more evidence.\"\nNew treatments for menopause symptoms were very much needed and worth researching, Mr Hillard said.\n\"Symptoms like vaginal dryness, itching and discomfort or pain during intercourse are very common and can be very distressing for women,\" he said. \n\"It can be difficult to talk about them. \n\"Many women put up with it and don't seek advice - but there are some treatments that may help and there are specialists who can advise.\" "

      "text": "Two more UK energy firms have ceased trading amid soaring wholesale energy prices.\nPure Planet, which is backed by oil giant BP, and Colorado Energy join a number of small energy firms that have gone bust recently.\nPure Planet said it had been caught between rising costs and the UK's energy price cap, which limits what companies can charge consumers. \nThis had left its business \"unsustainable\", it said.\nCustomers of both companies will be moved to new suppliers.\nPure Planet and Colorado Energy are the latest casualties of a global spike in gas prices. \nPure Planet supplies gas and electricity to around 235,000 domestic customers, while Colorado Energy has around 15,000 domestic customers.\nEnergy regulator Ofgem will now find a new supplier for those customers, who are asked to do nothing until the transfer takes place in the coming weeks.\nThe demise of Pure Planet and Colorado Energy takes the number of customers affected by the current wave of energy company collapses across the UK to around two million.\nOfgem said on Wednesday that the unprecedented increase in global gas prices in recent weeks was putting financial pressure on suppliers.\n\"Ofgem's number one priority is to protect customers,\" said Neil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem.\n\"I want to reassure affected customers that they do not need to worry: under our safety net we'll make sure your energy supplies continue.\"\nMr Lawrence added that if customers have credit, the funds are protected, so customers will not lose the money that is owed to them.\nPure Planet said that the government and Ofgem expect it \"to sell energy at a price much less than it currently costs to buy\".\n\"This is unsustainable, and therefore, sadly we have had to make the difficult decision to cease trading,\" it said.\n\"In our case, despite being hedged until next spring, and having had the backing of BP, Pure Planet faced increasing risks and large potential losses by continuing to operate in this market,\" Pure Planet said.\n\"Sadly, this led to BP taking a decision to withdraw its support and we are no longer able to continue.\"\nBP said it had worked to support Pure Planet and give financial support through wholesale supply and other funding arrangements.\n\"However, despite considerable work over an extended period, we concluded it is no longer commercially viable for BP to continue this relationship and took this difficult decision,\" a BP spokesperson said.\nNine suppliers collapsed in September, but business and energy minister Kwasi Kwarteng has ruled out supporting struggling energy firms. Last week, he said more companies could collapse.\nThe regulator's price cap, which covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland, protects customers on default tariffs by limiting charges including how much customers pay per unit of energy.\nBut providers say they can't pass on rising wholesale gas prices to customers because of the cap.\nSuppliers that have recently gone bust include Avro Energy, People's Energy and Green Supplier Limited.\nRising prices have had reverberations throughout the supply chain.\nBBC Newsnight reported on Wednesday evening that gas shipping firm CNG has written to its energy supplier customers saying that it will no longer supply the wholesale market.\nCNG supplies roughly 46,000 small businesses, including 10-15 small domestic energy suppliers, through their wholesale business.\nNewsnight economics editor Ben Chu tweeted that CNG had recently had to supply gas to households without being paid by suppliers that have failed, including Utility Point and Avro Energy.\nThis has caused a significant amount of financial damage to CNG, Mr Chu said.\nCNG leaving the market will put further pressure on small UK energy firms and could speed up their collapse, he added.\nHave you been affected by issues covered in this story?

      "tags": "Leo Varadkar,Dominic Cummings",
      "text": "Ireland's deputy PM has warned governments doing trade deals with the UK that it is a nation that \"doesn't necessarily keep its word\".\nLeo Varadkar made the comment after Dominic Cummings suggested the UK had always intended to tear up the Brexit deal it signed with the EU in 2019.\nBoris Johnson's ex-adviser said the plan had been to \"ditch the bits we didn't like\" after winning power.\nThe government said the deal had not worked as intended and must be changed. \nAnd it accused the EU of failing to protect the Good Friday peace agreement in its implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nMr Johnson fought the 2019 election on a \"Get Brexit done\" platform.\nDuring the campaign, he repeatedly claimed the withdrawal agreement he had negotiated with Brussels - including the Northern Ireland Protocol - was a \"great\" deal that was \"oven ready\".\nThe UK now wants to change the deal to allow goods to circulate more freely between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nEU officials are travelling to London later to present their proposals for the border - but they are unwilling to rewrite the protocol and their proposals are unlikely to satisfy Brexit minister Lord Frost, who laid out the UK's plans for an entirely new protocol on Tuesday.\nMr Cummings - who has turned against Mr Johnson since being removed from Downing Street at the end of 2020 - claims the prime minister never understood what the withdrawal agreement really meant.\nHe tweeted: \"What I've said does NOT mean 'the PM was lying in General Election 2019', he never had a scoobydoo [a clue] what the deal he signed meant.\n\"He never understood what leaving Customs Union meant until November 2020.\"\nWhen the prime minister did finally comprehend, said Mr Cummings, \"he was babbling 'I'd never have signed it if I'd understood it' (but that WAS a lie)\".\nAsked if Mr Cummings was correct in his assessment, Lord Frost said: \"We all understood extremely well what the deal meant, it delivered on democracy, took the UK out of the EU whole and entire, and it was a very good deal.\"\nBut he said it now had to be changed because it was \"undermining the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, not supporting it\".\n\"The problem with the protocol at the moment is that EU law, with the European Court of Justice as the enforcer, is applied in Northern Ireland without any democratic process. That has to change if we are to find governance arrangements people can live with,\" he said.\nIn a statement, the UK government said the protocol needed \"significant change\" to avoid further severe \"economic, political and societal\" disruption in Northern Ireland and to make it \"sustainable for the future\".\nMr Cummings - the former Vote Leave campaign chief - said that when Boris Johnson entered Downing Street in 2019, the country was facing the \"worst constitutional crisis in a century\" with much of what he called the \"deep state\" angling for \"Brino\" [Brexit in name only] or a second referendum.\n\"So we wriggled through with best option we could and intended to get the trolley [his nickname for Boris Johnson] to ditch bits we didn't like after whacking [Labour leader Jeremy] Corbyn. We prioritised,\" he said.\nIn July this year, Mr Cummings told the BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg the Irish government had also wanted to \"fudge things\" and \"it suited both sides to sign up to something that was not what either side had really wanted and which punted difficult questions into the future\".\nIn his latest tweets, Mr Cummings dismissed suggestions that abandoning elements of the deal would mean breaking international law.\n\"Our priorities meant e.g. getting Brexit done is 10,000 times more important than lawyers yapping re international law in negotiations with people who break international law all the time,\" he said.\nMr Varadkar told RTE television: \"I hope Dominic Cummings is speaking for himself and not for the British government.\n\"But those comments are very alarming because that would indicate that this is a government, an administration, that acted in bad faith and that message needs to be heard around the world.\n\"If the British government doesn't honour its agreements, it doesn't adhere to treaties it signs, that must apply to everyone else too.\n\"At the moment they're going around the world, they're trying to negotiate new trade agreements... \n\"Surely the message must go out to all countries around the world that this is a British government that doesn't necessarily keep its word and doesn't necessarily honour the agreements it makes.\n\"And you shouldn't make any agreements with them until such time as you're confident that they keep their promises, and honour things, for example, like the protocol.\"\nThe Taoiseach (Ireland's PM) Miche\u00e1l Martin has given his backing to EU proposals for changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol, but he urged both sides to work \"in good faith\" and focus on \"addressing disruption in trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain\".\nTheresa May's former chief of staff, Lord Gavin Barwell, has, meanwhile, warned the UK's proposal for changing the Northern Ireland protocol has \"no chance of success and is going to do even further damage to our relationship with our nearest neighbours\". \n\"My problem is if you agree something and fight an election saying what a fantastic deal this is - and then almost immediately afterwards you start to try and unpick the thing - the danger is the people you negotiating with think you didn't agree it in good faith in first place, and that makes it much more challenging when you try to renegotiate it,\" he told an Institute for Government event. \nHe said he did not like the current Northern Ireland Protocol - but argued that the UK government had to meet the EU \"half way\".
