      "text": "Sabina Nessa was killed on a \"five-minute\" walk to meet a friend at a pub, police believe. \nOfficers said the 28-year-old teacher was attacked as she walked to The Depot bar in Kidbrooke Village, south-east London, from her home on Astell Road at about 20:30 BST last Friday.\nHer body was found by a member of the public in Cator Park the next morning. \nPolice have launched a murder inquiry, and a man was arrested and released under further investigation.\nA vigil is due to be held in Ms Nessa's memory on Friday evening.\nDet Insp Joe Garrity said: \"Sabina's journey should have taken just over five minutes but she never made it to her destination. \n\"Our investigation is making good progress and specialist officers remain at the crime scene carrying out intensive searches and enquiries.\n\"We know the community are rightly shocked by this murder - as are we - and we are using every resource available to us to find the individual responsible.\"\nMs Nessa's cousin Zubel Ahmed has previously said she was a \"beautiful soul\" and appealed for help to find whoever was responsible for the \"horrific crime\".\nHe said her parents were \"absolutely shocked\" and \"inconsolable still, understandably so, to hear of their daughter being taken away from them by some cowardly man\".\nDescribing his cousin, Mr Ahmed said she \"was the most caring person - kindest, sweetest girl you could meet\".\n\"She's been teaching for two years. Loves teaching, loves kids, she's got a couple of cats at home. She was just a beautiful soul.\"\nThe area where she was found remains cordoned off and flowers have been left at the site.\nInformation sheets advising women on how to stay safe at night have been handed out by a community group in response to the death.\nThe handout suggests pedestrians stick to busy places with good lighting.\nRoyal Greenwich's Safer Spaces team has been distributing personal alarms to women.\nThe borough have issued over 200 alarms to women and vulnerable residents over the last two days particularly in the Kidbrooke area.\nAdvice on the sheet, printed from the Met Police website, also includes the suggestions that pedestrians should face oncoming traffic and conceal their jewellery.\nFriday's vigil has been organised by a Kidbrooke community group.\nIt is being supported by Reclaim the Streets who said it was angry and heartbroken\" by the killing and called on the government to do something about \"an epidemic of violence unfolding in front of our eyes\".\nMs Nessa, who was originally from Sandy in Bedfordshire, lived in Lewisham, south-east London.\nShe had been a year one teacher at Rushey Green Primary school in Catford for about a year.\nA post-mortem examination into the cause of the 28-year-old's death was inconclusive, the Met said.\nA man in his 40s who was arrested on suspicion of murder was later released.\nOfficers have asked for any potential witnesses to contact them, and for drivers to check dash-cam footage they might have.

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,COP26,United Nations,Climate change",
      "text": "A climate summit of world leaders in 40 days' time will be the \"turning point for humanity\", PM Boris Johnson has said in a speech to the United Nations.\nHe warned that global temperature rises were already inevitable, but called on his fellow leaders to commit to major changes to curb further warming.\nFour areas needed tackling - \"coal, cars, cash and trees\", he said.\nCountries must take responsibility for \"the destruction we are inflicting, not just upon our planet but ourselves\".\n\"It's time for humanity to grow up,\" he added ahead of the UK hosting the COP26 summit in Glasgow.\nThe prime minister also said it was time to listen to the warnings of scientists. \"Look at Covid if you want an example of gloomy scientists being proved right.\"\nSetting the tone for November's meeting, he said countries must make \"substantial changes\" by the end of the decade if the world is to stave off further temperature rises.\n\"I passionately believe that we can do it by making commitments in four areas - coal, cars, cash and trees,\" he said.\nMr Johnson praised China's President Xi Jinping for his recent pledge to stop building new coal-fire energy plants abroad.\nBut he called on the country - which produces 28% of global greenhouse gas emissions - to go further and end its domestic use of coal, saying the UK was proof that it could be done.\nThe UK used coal to generate 25% of its electricity five years ago - but that is now down to 2%. Mr Johnson said it would be \"gone altogether\" by 2024.\nBut Labour's shadow energy secretary Ed Miliband accused the UK government of \"facing both ways\" on climate change, urging other nations to take action while it considered plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria and cut money for improving home insulation.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's World at One that a UK trade deal had also allowed Australia to renege on their climate commitments.\n\"It undermines our moral standing as the host. I want the prime minister to succeed, but I'm afraid he's left it very late and he's not handled this presidency well,\" he said.\nIn his speech, the prime minister also said he did not see a conflict between the green movement and capitalism, saying: \"The whole experience of the Covid pandemic is that the way to fix the problem is through science and innovation, the breakthroughs and the investment that are made possible by capitalism and by free markets.\"\n\"We have the tools for a green industrial revolution but time is desperately short,\" he added.\nElsewhere, the prime minister made a series of calls for action to his fellow leaders, including:\nAmid the serious warnings, Mr Johnson also attempted to strike a humorous note at points, including saying Kermit the Frog had been wrong when he sang It's Not Easy Bein' Green.\nThe prime minister reiterated that the world must curb the rise in global average temperatures to 1.5C - the stricter of the two targets set by the UN in the 2015 Paris agreement.\nHowever, the world is already 1C hotter compared with pre-industrial levels.\n\"If we keep on the current track then the temperatures will go up by 2.7 degrees or more by the end of the century,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\"And never mind what that will do to the ice floes... we will see desertification, drought, crop failure, and mass movements of humanity on a scale not seen before, not because of some unforeseen natural event or disaster but because of us, because of what we are doing now.\n\"And our grandchildren will know that we are the culprits and... that we were warned and they will know that it was this generation that came centre stage to speak and act on behalf of posterity and that we missed our cue and they will ask themselves what kind of people we were to be so selfish and so short sighted.\"\nBoris Johnson is fashioning himself as a leader on climate change.\nHe has set a benchmark by phasing out sales of most new conventional vehicles by 2030. \nThe international alliance he's formed to get rid of coal power is gathering support - though not yet enough.\nAnd by setting aggressive targets to cut carbon emissions overall (78% by 2035) he is encouraging others to follow.\nYet, in his own backyard, the prime minister is stumbling.\nHe previously pledged \"never to be lagging on lagging\". But his plan for insulating homes is badly delayed - along with other vital initiatives on issues including aviation, farming and financing the low carbon revolution.\nRecent research showed his government had imposed less than a quarter of the policies needed to clean up the economy.   \nAnd some policies - like not opposing a coal mine in Cumbria,cutting taxes on flying and building HS2 - will send emissions up when they are supposed to be going down.\nAt COP26, leaders from 196 countries will be asked to agree action to limit climate change and its effects, like rising sea levels and extreme weather.\nA recent report from UN scientists warned that global temperatures have risen faster since 1970 than at any point in the past 2,000 years."

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The United States is lifting its decades-old ban on imports of British lamb, Boris Johnson has announced. \nThe PM, who is in the US for talks with UN leaders and President Joe Biden, said the ban was \"unjustified\".\nBut he admitted the UK was now focused on making \"incremental steps\" on US trade access, rather than aiming for a full agreement. \nMr Biden appeared to play down the chances of a wider deal during a meeting with Mr Johnson on Tuesday.\nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said the Biden administration \"is not doing free trade deals around the world right now\".\nBut he added he had \"every confidence that a great deal is there to be done\".\nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner mocked the lack of movement, saying the PM had made \"absolutely zero progress\" on a trade deal during his US trip.\nThe United States has banned British lamb imports since 1989, following the first outbreaks of BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease. \nA similar ban on British beef imports, imposed in 1996, was lifted in September last year. \nThere is no indication yet of when the US will start accepting lamb and lamb products from the UK, and an official announcement has not been made.\nThe US Department for Agriculture has been consulting on lifting the ban since 2016 - and there were originally hopes it would be lifted the following year.\nAt the time, the UK government estimated the change would be worth an extra \u00a335m a year to the UK economy. \nAnalysis by Damian Grammaticas , BBC political correspondent \nWhen it comes to trade, the big deal that's emerged from Boris Johnson's visit to Washington is that there's to be no deal happening any time soon. \nThat's significant, and a setback for Boris Johnson's government. \nIn March 2020, just a few weeks after the UK had left the EU, the then-Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the day marked a \"crucial step in beginning the formal negotiations for a free-trade agreement with our largest bilateral trading partner, the United States.\" \nToday it all looks different. The United States, Boris Johnson told us, is not doing deals. \nSo whilst Ms Truss predicted a \"\u00a33.4 billion lift to the economy\" from a US-UK deal, today we had an \"incremental step\" but a tiny one by comparison - a possible opening for lamb exports. \nA US deal was by far the biggest prize when it came to the promise of post-Brexit trade deals. But under this US administration, it's not happening any time soon.\nMr Johnson said the ban was \"totally unjustified\" and \"discriminating on British farmers and British lamb\".\nThe National Sheep Association industry group welcomed the news, adding it had always seen the US as a \"potentially important market\".\nIts chief executive Phil Stocker cautioned, however, that \"we shouldn't expect to see any sudden surge in volumes going to the US\".\nHe added that Brexit had made it more difficult to sell into the EU - the UK's lamb largest export market - and it was \"important to work on any market that gives us future potential\".\nMr Johnson cited the lifting of the ban as an example of \"practical steps to help our exports\" the UK was taking, pending progress on wider trade talks. \nDowning Street has pointed to the resolution of the Airbus-Boeing trade dispute, as well as the lowering of whisky tariffs and the decision to lift the ban on British beef.\nSecuring a trade deal with the United States has been a priority for many Brexit-backing politicians, following the UK's departure from the EU. \nBut on Tuesday, Mr Biden appeared to downplay the chances of an agreement soon, adding he would discuss the issue \"a little bit\" with Mr Johnson during his trip to the White House. \n\"We're going to have to work that through,\" the US president added. \nThe US is already a significant UK trading partner, accounting for \u00a31 in every \u00a36 of British trade.\nThe BBC understands the government is considering whether to join an existing trade arrangement between the US, Canada and Mexico - known as the USMCA. \nHowever, Downing Street denies this and says it focus remains on a UK-US trade deal.\nIf a USMCA arrangement was pursued, it would limit the UK's ability to sell services. \nEconomists say the overall gains from joining it could be less than 0.1% of the UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - a measurement of the size of the economy."

      "tags": "France,Emmanuel Macron,Aukus,Joe Biden",
      "text": "France and the US have made efforts to end a row which started last week with the announcement of a defence pact between the US, UK and Australia.\nThe Aukus pact cost France a submarine contract worth billions of dollars.\nIn a 30-minute phone call on Wednesday, the French and US presidents agreed to try to find a way forward.\nThe US acknowledged that the situation would have benefited from \"open consultations\", and France agreed to send its ambassador back to Washington.\nIn a carefully worded joint statement, the two governments said US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron would \"open a process of in-depth consultations, aimed at creating the conditions for ensuring confidence\".\nThe two leaders are set to meet in Europe at the end of next month.\nAnalysts have described Aukus as probably the most significant security arrangement between the three nations since World War Two.\nBut the pact angered the French government, with Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian describing it as a \"stab in the back\". \nFrance considers the Asia-Pacific region to be of key strategic and economic importance, with 1.65 million French citizens on islands including La R\u00e9union, New Caledonia, Mayotte and French Polynesia.\nFrance recalled its ambassadors to Washington and Canberra for consultations in protest over the Aukus deal.\nWhile the ambassador to Washington will now return to his post, it is not clear if the ambassador to Canberra will do the same. \nIn the statement on Wednesday, Mr Biden reaffirmed the importance of French and European engagement in the Asia-Pacific region\nThe BBC's Washington correspondent Nomia Iqbal described Wednesday's statement as a non-apology from the Americans: an apology to the French for the lack of consultation, but not for the policy itself (Aukus). \nUS Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Mr Le Drian are expected to hold a bilateral meeting on Thursday on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, according to a US official.\nMeanwhile, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he and the other Aukus leaders were a \"bit taken aback by the strength of the French reaction\" and said it was time for \"some of our dearest friends\" to \"prenez un grip\".\nPresident Macron sent out his foreign minister to do the dirty stuff. Presumably he told Jean-Yves Le Drian not to feel too diplomatically restrained - to let the anger out.  Hence the minister's remarks about \"lying\" and stabs in the back. \nAnd hence the return accusations of French \"petulance\" and toys thrown out of prams. \nThe division of labour inherent in the French system means that the president is now free to rise above the name-calling and - in a true embodiment of French national interest - take the high road to reconciliation. \nWith the Americans, anyway. The Australians will have to wait.\nWashington played along by admitting things could have been handled differently, giving a nod to European defence and agreeing to boost support in North Africa. The French ambassador goes back to Washington next week. They're talking again, but much trust has gone. \nYou may also be interested in: "

      "tags": "Companies,Ofgem,Energy industry,Kwasi Kwarteng,CO\u2082 shortage",
      "text": "The cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills, the boss of the energy regulator Ofgem has told the BBC.\nIt comes as energy firm Green said it was on the brink of collapse due to soaring wholesale gas prices.\n\"As underlying costs rise, pressure on bills does go up\", Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem chief executive said.\nThe government has said it is looking at lending money to bigger firms to help them take on stranded customers.\nIf an energy firm collapses, customers are automatically switched to a tariff provided by the new supplier. This is a tariff agreed with the regulator Ofgem, but it may well be more expensive than the deal they had with the former company which went bust.\nMr Brearley said protecting customers of failed energy firms was the regulator's \"number one priority\".\nHowever, he said it was too early to predict how expensive it would be to ensure that they were transferred to other suppliers in an orderly way.\nPeter McGirr, founder and chief executive of Green, told the BBC it had appointed a restructuring firm in an attempt to survive the current crisis.\nMr McGirr said the firm was in \"deep, deep trouble and our heads are unlikely to bob back to the surface\".\nGreen has 180 staff based in Newcastle upon Tyne and has 250,000 UK customers.\nMr McGirr said the appointment of Alvarez and Marsal was currently on an \"advisory and restructuring\" basis, but admitted Green could fall into administration within weeks.\n\"We need to try to hold on long enough to get some support\", he added.\nThe company has been in discussions with the government and energy regulator Ofgem, but has not been offered any support.\nMr McGirr said he believed the larger energy suppliers had too much influence in the crisis talks being held with government and said the big companies had an interest in more of the smaller suppliers going to the wall.\nAsked whether these costs would be met by the taxpayer, or spread across all energy customers' bills, he said: \"We have to first of all make sure that customers are transferred and looked after and then as we see the market evolve we will understand better the cost implications.\"\nCustomers on some tariffs are protected from sudden hikes in wholesale gas prices through the energy price cap, which limits how much firms can charge per unit of gas.\nThe price cap covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland.\nMr Brearley said it was too early to predict how much the energy price cap would rise next year.\nSo far, four energy firms have gone to the wall, including People's Energy and Utility Point, and four more are expected to follow in the coming days.\nIndustry sources fear there may be as few as 10 energy suppliers left by the end of the year, down from 70 in January.\nBut Mr Brearley predicted that a number of small suppliers would survive the current crisis, as well as larger ones, maintaining a diverse market with plenty of choice for consumers. \nWhen asked if Ofgem was \"asleep at the wheel\" and should have prevented suppliers from making promises to customers which they wouldn't be able to keep if prices rose, Mr Brearley replied: \"No - we have always protected customers interests and we work very closely with the companies.  \n\"We work closely with all companies to assess their financial position. And if they need to exit the market we have well-rehearsed systems and processes to manage that.\" \nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng earlier denied that failed energy companies would get government bailouts, saying: \"I do not think it's the right thing for taxpayers' money to be injected into companies that have been badly run.\"\nHowever, he said the government was exploring the possibility of lending money to bigger energy firms to help them absorb the cost of taking on new customers from companies that had gone bust.\n\"If we do have this policy, they will be expected to pay back the loans,\" he added.\nMr Kwarteng also warned many UK households could face a \"very difficult winter\", with fuel prices surging and the \u00a320-a-week temporary uplift in universal credit due to end in October.  \nThe government and Ofgem have both dismissed suggestions that the cap on energy prices would be lifted ahead of an agreed 12% rise in October, saying that keeping it was the \"clear and agreed position\". \nThe price cap is reviewed twice a year. It applies only to standard variable or default tariffs. These types of tariff are typically the most expensive plan that a supplier offers. \nWhen fixed energy deals expire, as they generally do after one or two years, customers are likely to be put on these tariffs.\nRead more about the next best steps to take here.\nMr Brearley said the industry had seen \"an unprecedented rise in gas prices\".\n\"They are almost four times what they normally are and that would put any industry under strain,\" he added.\nThe government and Ofgem say the UK does not have gas supply problems because of a diverse range of sources \"that can more than meet demand\".\nHowever, energy bills are facing particular pressures in Great Britain because of a dip in renewable energy supplies due to low wind, as well as the outage of a power cable supplying electricity from France.\nThe International Energy Agency has called on Russia to supply more gas to Europe, saying \"it could do more to increase gas availability to Europe and ensure storage is filled to adequate levels\", in preparation for the winter.\nIt added: \"Based on the available information, Russia is fulfilling its long-term contracts with European counterparts - but its exports to Europe are down from their 2019 level.\n\"This is also an opportunity for Russia to underscore its credentials as a reliable supplier to the European market.\"\nStacey Stothard followed all the advice. Aware that energy prices were rising, she shopped around to find a decent fixed deal for her gas and electricity.\nShe saved \u00a3300 - or so she thought. \nHer new energy supplier went bust and now she will be switched automatically to another one, and she is facing much higher bills, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds more a year.\n\"It is just like watching the meter go up and up,\" she says. \"I did the right thing - not going for the cheapest deal, but choosing a company with a decent customer service record.\""

      "text": "The environment secretary has said the government is looking at different options on how to fix labour shortages in the food sector.\nGeorge Eustice said the government was considering whether changes could be made to the Seasonal Agricultural Workers' Scheme (SAWS).\nSAWS is a quota-based scheme that allows farmers to recruit overseas.\nTrade bodies have warned of panic-buying this Christmas unless action is taken to address the lack of staff.  \nThose shortages have been made worse by Covid and Brexit.\nMr Eustice acknowledged \"the reality that there is an acute labour shortage at the moment across the UK economy\".\nThe SAWS scheme saw 30,000 temporary workers admitted to the UK this year to fill vacancies in agriculture - mostly working on fruit and vegetable farms - helping with the picking and packing of produce. \nSpeaking on a visit to an agricultural show in Northern Ireland, Mr Eustice said there are \"some real concerns about how we'll deal with that spike in demand in the two weeks up to Christmas\".\n\"We have SAWS and we're looking at options as to how we can change the focus of that and we hope to be able to say something on this shortly,\" he continued. \nWhen asked if he would be looking at changes to visas to address workforce shortages, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday: \"If that was actually the solution, I'm sure we would move to it quickly and I don't rule out anything.\"\nThe National Farmers' Union (NFU) has called for another emergency visa to allow firms to recruit from outside the UK.\nEarlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he does \"not believe people will be short of food\" this autumn and winter, amid reports of some gaps on supermarket shelves.\nGovernment sources told the BBC discussions were ongoing to \"look at where the gaps are\".\nAsked if that meant action might be taken before Christmas they indicated \"realistically, yes, before Christmas\". \nEarlier this month, Mr Eustice said the government wanted to monitor whether workers who may be made redundant when the furlough schemes finish at the end of September could instead enter the labour market where there are shortages. Those include areas such as lorry driving or meat processing.\nHowever, he said if that did not happen \"then the beauty of a controlled immigration system is you can take steps to allow people to come in on temporary visas should you want\". \nNFU head Minette Batters wrote to the prime minister on Wednesday, warning that the food and farming sector is on a \"knife edge\" because of labour shortages across the entire supply chain.\nThe letter, signed on behalf of a number of food and drink trade bodies, called for the introduction of a Covid-19 recovery visa to open up new recruitment opportunities.\n\"Without it, more shelves will go empty and consumers will panic buy to try to get through the winter,\" Ms Batters wrote.\nReferring to an earlier NFU report, Ms Batters said that there were an estimated 500,000 unfilled vacancies in the industry.\nDue to the shortages, some farmers have resorted to giving fruit and vegetables away rather than let it rot in their fields."

      "text": "Andrew Monk, a City chief executive, is not a fan of government proposals for new staff to have the right to ask to work from home.\n\"People abuse it,\" and are less productive, at least in financial services, he told the BBC.\nHis view is that a lot of people who ask for flexible working want to work part-time but on a full-time salary.\nThe government, however, says that allowing flexible working makes businesses more productive.\nIt is proposing that from the first day of employment new starters can request flexible working, rather than having to wait at least six months, as is the case at the moment.\nUnder the proposals people can request flexible working such as job sharing, flexi-time, or working from home. Employers won't have to agree to the request.\nNevertheless, any legislation is \"setting a tone that is almost making people think they can do part-time work but on full-time salaries\", Mr Monk told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.\nHe is chief executive of investment firm VSA Capital, which employs about 20 people in the City of London.\n\"Pretty much we are all back at work, because I think that's what we need to be in our particular industry,\" he says. \"Obviously it varies from industry to industry, but in financial services it's more important to be in the office because its a very live industry\".\nSome big firms, including accountancy giants PwC and Deloitte, have gone the other way from VSA Capital, however, and have embraced flexible working.\nMr Monk said: \"What you'll find is that audit work is taking significantly longer than it used to take, and of course when things take longer, it means they cost more as well, because these people tend to charge by the hour.\"\n\"Actually, although they are all working from home and say it's all fine, it's not fine.\"\nMr Monk said the time it takes for firms to set up a stock market flotation has jumped from three months on average to six.\n\"London is very lucky - we have a financial centre that is the pride of the world, and you have to work long hours,\" he said. \"But we're also paid very high salaries, and so you can't expect to be paid a good salary and then not work hard.\"\nThe number of people working from home jumped dramatically during coronavirus lockdowns in the UK, and may businesses are gearing up to let employees work from home at least some of the time.\nHowever, some big City firms, such as Goldman Sachs, are opposed to working from home, with its boss David Solomon labelling it as an \"aberration\".\nChancellor Rishi Sunak has also warned that working from home can damage young people's careers.\nHowever, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said: \"Empowering workers to have more say over where and when they work makes for more productive businesses and happier employees.\n\"It was once considered a 'nice to have', but by making requests a day one right, we're making flexible working part of the DNA of businesses across the country.\"\nKate Hulley, the owner and manager of cardboard box manufacturer Belmont Packaging, recently switched her factory to a four-day week.\n\"We've never looked back,\" she told the BBC Radio 5Live's Wake Up to Money programme. \"Productivity went up.\"\nThe firm compressed the week, doing the same amount of hours in four days. \"It has worked extremely well. The customers haven't seen any difference in service.\"\nStephen Warnham, head of content at UK jobs site Totaljobs.com, earlier told the BBC that firms competing for staff needed to trust people \"to work in the way that best gets the job done\".\nAs part of a survey of 200,000 staff worldwide, published in March this year, Totaljobs found that nine in 10 employees wanted partial flexibility to choose where they work.\n\"From a legislative perspective this is long overdue as a third of employers we speak to are already doing this anyway, so it is a really critical change,\" said Mr Warnham.\nThe Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy also said that flexible working leads to a workforce that is more productive and highly motivated, pointing to a 2017 study by HSBC.\nThere have been a number of studies which indicate that employees are more productive if they are allowed to work flexibly, including a remote working experiment in China.\nSome people find it easier to focus without distractions from colleagues in the office.\nMore recently, a University of Southampton study of work during Covid lockdowns suggested that 90% of people thought their productivity had stayed the same or improved by working from home."

[a procedure] which did the opposite of what it promised,\" Evangelista explained.\nShe said the side effect she experienced \"has not only destroyed my livelihood, it has sent me into a cycle of deep depression, profound sadness and the lowest depths of self-loathing. In the process I have become a recluse.\"\nIn her social media post, the star said she wanted to tell her story publicly in order to move on with her life, and suggested she would be suing the company she said was responsible. \nThe company which Evangelista claims to have used has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment.\n\"I'm so tired of living this way,\" she continued. \"I would like to walk out my door with my head held high, despite not looking like myself any longer.\"\nThe non-surgical procedure, which has grown in popularity in recent years, uses cold temperatures to reduce fat deposits in certain areas of the body.\nDescribing the \"very rare but serious side effect\" she had experienced, Evangelista said it \"means the fat cells in the treatment site grow larger rather than smaller\", adding: \"It's not fully understood why this occurs.\"\nEvangelista rose to fame in the 1990s as one of a group of emerging supermodels, gracing high-end catwalks around the world and the cover of leading fashion magazine Vogue.\nShe also appeared in a George Michael music video alongside Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford and Christy Turlington. \nThe model has kept a low profile in recent years, rarely posting new images of herself on social media.\nIn the few pictures she has posted, her face is often partially obscured by a headscarf or hat.\nStars including Gwyneth Paltrow and stylist Karla Welch showed their support in the comments underneath Evangelista's post, as did designers Jeremy Scott and Brandon Maxwell.\n\"You are and always will be a supermodel, now adding super role model of courage to your glorious resume,\" wrote Scott, while Paltrow posted a red love heart emoji.\nMaxwell posted: \"I have always recognised you as someone who was physically beautiful, yes, but more importantly you really shone bright from within... In your darkest moments may you never forget the light you have sparked in so many, and continue to.\"\nFellow model Karen Elson said: \"Sweet Linda. I love you dearly, you are so brave and wonderful.\"\nYou may also be interested in:\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Waiting times,Welsh government,Breast cancer,NHS Wales,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The worst ever performance figures have again been recorded by hospital A&E units in Wales, reflecting the enormous pressure on emergency care in the NHS.\nThe Grange hospital in Cwmbran, which has been open less than a year, had the worst performance on record of any Welsh hospital.\nOnly 40.7% of people were seen within four hours at its A&E unit\nFigures also show another record-breaking month for people on NHS waiting lists.\nThose waiting more than nine months were at record levels.\nThe figures also show the Welsh Ambulance Service recorded its second worst response times to the most critical calls since new targets were introduced in 2015.\nThe figures show that in August, accident and emergency departments in Welsh hospitals recorded their worst ever performance figures with just 68.7% of patients spending less than four hours before being admitted, transferred or discharged.\nThis was down from 69.8% in July which was itself a record.\nThis dropped to 40.7% at the \u00a3350m Grange, which was worse than the 41% at Wrexham Maelor hospital in February 2020, just before the pandemic.\nThe target is that 95% of patients should wait no longer than four hours in A&E.\nThe figures also show in August 7,982 people had to wait more than 12 hours in urgent care departments - the highest number recorded, up from 7,084 the month before.\nThe target is that nobody should be waiting that long.\nThe performance by the Welsh Ambulance Service with response times to its \"red\" priority calls was the second worst on record.\nOnly 57.6% of these immediately life-threatening calls arrived on scene within eight minutes. The target of 65% has not been met for over a year.\nThe figures covering July 2021 show:\nThere has also been a fall in performance over the month relating to cancer patients waiting to start treatment.\nOverall in Wales, 62% of people started treatment within 62 days of cancer first being suspected; the target is 75%.\nBut this is down from 67% in the previous month. In Cwm Taf Morgannwg, only half of people with suspected cancer started treatment within the 62-day period. The figure also dropped over the month from 67% to 55% in Swansea Bay.\nThe Welsh government said although those waiting the longest continued to be at a record high, a higher proportion were waiting less than 26 weeks and the median waiting time fell slightly.\nIt announced plans to invest almost \u00a325m in new PET-CT scanners to improve access to diagnostic technology and another \u00a325m funding to improve delivery of urgent and emergency care services. \n\"The system is under huge pressure at the moment and that pressure is worse than anything we've seen at any point during the pandemic,\" said Health Minister Eluned Morgan.\n\"Of course, we are determined to try to work through the enormous backlog that has been built up during the pandemic, but it's very difficult to do that when the pressure on the system is coming at us from so many directions.\"\nMs Morgan said the Welsh government had published its Covid recovery plan in March, and had made \u00a3240m additional funding available for health boards across Wales.\nBut she added: \"I think we have to be honest with people, and I do think people do have to brace themselves for the fact that this is not something we are going to be able to turn around.\"\nShe said her predecessor in the job, Vaughan Gething, was \"very clear that it would take at least five years to clear the backlog built up during the pandemic\".\nThe Welsh Conservative's health spokesman Russell George said:  \"This is not the new normal. Not long before the pandemic, the Labour-run NHS was regularly breaking all the wrong records.\n\"Among the Covid-related issues affecting public services, there are deep-rooted problems that have not been tackled in the devolution era.\"\nThe Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents health boards, said the health service was \"working relentlessly\" to ensure those waiting would be seen as soon as possible.\n\"Although average waiting times for treatment remain above pre-pandemic levels, we are seeing a downward trend,\" said Darren Hughes, director.\nBut he added that Covid was continuing to have a \"significant impact\" and rising cases had compounded existing pressures, meaning some difficult decisions were having to be made. \nThe Royal College of Surgeons said the figures would be \"distressing for patients who continue to be left suffering in pain\" but that cancelling surgery, with a difficult winter ahead, must be a \"last resort\".\n\"It will be imperative to plan ahead for this winter to keep surgical services up and running,\" said Sue Hill, its director and a vascular surgeon.\n\"It is critical that Covid-light surgical hubs receive the investment and staff they need to tackle this growing backlog and support patients throughout the winter.\"\nRichard Pugh, Head of Partnerships for Macmillan Cancer Support in Wales, said: \"People are simply not getting vital cancer treatments in time.\n\"Wales desperately needs a detailed plan for managing our cancer care services out of this crisis.\"\nVice President of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine Wales, Dr Suresh Pillai, said: \"We are heading into what will likely be the most difficult winter ever with consistently deteriorating performance, high numbers of patients, burned out staff, and an ambulance service on the brink of a crisis. \n\"It is only September and the military have already been called upon and drafted in to assist the Welsh Ambulance Service.\"\nDiana Goldstraw, 64, from Swansea, has been told she will have to wait four years to get a hip replacement.\nShe said she broke down in tears in the waiting room when she was given the news.\nShe said: \"I've been very, very upset because I can't do many of the things I want to do and am used to doing, like walking up the Brecon Beacons, I bought a bike last year that's never been used, I can't go out walking with my friends.\n\"My hip can be very unstable and on Saturday I couldn't walk at all. \n\"It is horrendous. I've always been a runner, a cyclist and a very keen hill walker. I've had to finish work.\"\nMs Goldstraw said this will be her second hip replacement, she had the first in 2015 when living in the Midlands and said that was done within six months.\n\"I feel that my life is on hold for four years,\" she said. \nJanet Harris, from Llanmaes, Vale of Glamorgan, has been on a waiting list for breast reconstruction surgery for two years.\n\"About 10 minutes after I was given a diagnosis of breast cancer and told I needed a mastectomy this [reconstructive reconstruction] was offered, with this as an end goal, and end point,\" she told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"It is as much as anything the distress that one lives with - there are issues with body image and things which I think tend to be considered as secondary but they're not.\n\"It is impossible to move on and find closure on bad experiences.\"\nAlyson Thomas, chief executive of the Community Health Councils in Wales, said longer waiting lists meant increased demand on GPs, while there were people waiting in hospital because support was not ready in the community.\n\"We know there are far too many people well enough to leave hospital after having treatment but they are still in hospital because the social care that they need after leaving hospital is not available because of the pressures in social care,\" she said.\n\"It is very important that the health and care system work together to tackle the pressures across the whole system.\""

      "text": "A woman with Down's syndrome has lost her High Court challenge over a law that allows abortion up to birth for a foetus with the condition.\nHeidi Crowter, 26, from Coventry, brought the case against the government in July, saying the legislation did not respect her life.\nHer legal team had argued the rules were unlawfully discriminatory.\nThe government maintained there was no evidence the law discriminated against Down's.\nAs two senior judges dismissed the case earlier, Ms Crowter said she would seek to appeal against the judgement, adding \"the fight is not over\".\nUnder current legislation for England, Wales and Scotland, there is a 24-week time limit for abortion, unless \"there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped\", which includes Down's syndrome.\nThe judges found that section of the Abortion Act was not unlawful, and it aimed to strike a balance between the rights of the unborn child and of women.\nMs Crowter, who is married and campaigns under her maiden name, said: \"We face discrimination every day in schools, in the work place and in society. And now thanks to this verdict the judges have upheld discrimination in the womb too.\" \nShe added on Twitter: \"The judges might not think [the law] discriminates against me, the government might not think it discriminates against me, but I am telling you I feel discriminated against.\" \nLord Justice Singh and Mrs Justice Lieven said at the outset of their judgement: \"The issues which have given rise to this claim are highly sensitive and sometimes controversial.\n\"This court cannot enter into those controversies; it must decide the case only in accordance with the law.\"\nThey said they had heard evidence showing some families would \"positively wish to have a child\" even knowing it would be born with severe disabilities.\nBut the judges also said there was clear evidence not every family would react the same way and the ability to provide for a disabled child would \"vary significantly\".\nThey added while scientific developments had improved, some conditions would only be found late in a pregnancy, after 24 weeks.\nThe judges concluded the legislation was a matter for Parliament \"which can take account of different interests and viewpoints, rather than in litigation\".\nMs Crowter's lawyers had claimed the legislation was unlawfully discriminatory as it was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.\nBut at the hearing in July, the government said not only was there was no evidence of discrimination, provisions were in place to discourage it.\nSpeaking in the summer, Ms Crowter said the law was offensive, and she wanted to challenge people's perception of Down's syndrome so that they saw \"just a normal person\".\nShe also said then her stance was not a campaign against women's right to choose.\nMs Crowter brought the case with another two parties - a child who has Down's, identified in the proceedings only as A, and M\u00e1ire Lea-Wilson, 33, from Brentford, London, whose son Aidan has the condition.\nMs Lea-Wilson said she had two boys and felt the judgement \"effectively says that my two sons are not viewed as equals in the eyes of the law\".\nShe added she did not regret bringing the case as it had helped raise awareness of the issues, and said she too would appeal against the judgement.\n\"Equality should be for everyone regardless of the number of chromosomes they have,\" she said.\nSpeaking in July, British Pregnancy Advisory Service told the BBC there was \"a relatively small number of abortions every year\" taking place after 24 weeks.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit.\nIt aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough.\nThe agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade:\nEmissions\nIt was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a greenhouse gas which causes climate change.\nThis is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a \"climate catastrophe\". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. \nCoal\nFor the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.  \nHowever, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to \"phase down\" rather than \"phase out\" coal after a late intervention by China and India. \nDeveloping countries\nThe agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy.\nThere's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (\u00a372bn) a year by 2020 was missed.\nWhile some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the \"start of a breakthrough\", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. \nFossil fuel subsidies\nWorld leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas.\nHowever, no firm dates have been set.\nA flurry of other announcements were made:\nThe world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, pledged to cooperate more over the next decade in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy.\nChina has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. \nLeaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - promised to stop deforestation by 2030.\nThis is seen as vital, as tress absorb vast amounts of CO2. \nSimilar initiatives haven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed.\nA scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030 was agreed by more than 100 countries. \nMethane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. \nThe big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.\nFinancial organisations controlling $130tn agreed to back \"clean\" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries.\nThe initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets.\nHowever, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. \nMost commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed.\nOnly a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. \nCOP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 Paris Agreement. \nSix years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming \"well below\" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.\nCOP stands for \"Conference of the Parties\", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. \nThe goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach net zero by mid-century.\nNext year's COP27 summit is in Egypt.\nTop image from Getty Images.

      "tags": "Film",
      "text": "Notting Hill director Roger Michell has died at the age of 65, his publicist has announced.\nIn statement issued to the Press Association, he said it was with \"great sadness\" that the director's family confirmed he died on Wednesday.\nNotting Hill, a 1999 romantic comedy which starred Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, became one of the highest-grossing British films of all time.\nMichell was also known for movies including Venus and My Cousin Rachel.\nIn 2011, he directed Harrison Ford, Diane Keaton and Rachel McAdams in Morning Glory, a film set behind the scenes of a fictional TV breakfast show.\nHis cause of death has not yet been announced.\nMichell was born in South Africa to a British father, and his family later returned to the UK. \nHe studied at Cambridge University, then became assistant director at the Royal Court Theatre, working alongside the likes of Slumdog Millionaire director Danny Boyle, before going on to become resident director at the Royal Shakespeare Company.\nHis 1995 BBC film adaptation of Jane Austen's Persuasion won the Bafta for best single drama, and he soon caught the eye of producer Richard Curtis who asked him to direct Notting Hill.\nThe tale of an ordinary English book shop owner falling in love with a superstar American actress won the audience award for most popular film at the Baftas in 2000, and scored three Golden Globe nominations.\nIn an interview with Zavvi last year, Michell reflected on the legacy of his most famous film.\n\"Whilst making it I realised it had to be pretty successful or it would be a failure as the previous film, Four Weddings, had been such a huge success if we didn't do better than that it would be like a failed second album,\" he said.\n\"But I am surprised and delighted 20 years on people are still talking about it and celebrating it.\"\nOn its release, the film took $262m (\u00a3168m) at box offices worldwide - beating the $256m (\u00a3164m) total made by Four Weddings And A Funeral in 1994.\nMichell went on to say that it would be difficult to revisit the same story. \"I think that will be a tough one,\" he added.\n\"The world has changed so much. I would like to have another go at a rom-com but they are really hard to do. It's much harder to do comedies than serious films.\"\nMichell directed Ben Affleck and Samuel L Jackson in the 2002 thriller Changing Lanes, and also worked with Daniel Craig in the 2003 film The Mother.\nHis theatre credits include Nina Raine's Consent, Harold Pinter's The Homecoming and Dylan Thomas' Under Milk Wood.\nHe won another Bafta in 2015 for his two-part TV drama The Lost Honour of Christopher Jefferies - the true story of his old schoolteacher who was accused of murder but was found innocent.\nThe Telegraph's film critic Robbie Collin said: \"Truly horrible news about Roger Michell. Yes, Notting Hill was the big one, but there was so much more. Loved Le Week-End especially, which is so sharp and compassionate on British middle age. And his still-to-be-released The Duke might be his very best.\"\nIndieWire's David Ehrlic added: \"Ugh, i had dinner with Roger Michell at Telluride less than three weeks ago. He was kind and gregarious and so honest about the ups & downs of his directing career (proud of Endless Love, excited about a doc he was making). Notting Hill is a masterpiece. RIP.\"\nThe director is survived by his four children, Harry, Rosie, Maggie and Sparrow - from his two marriages to the actresses Kate Buffery and Anna Maxwell Martin."

      "text": "The family of a primary school teacher who was killed in a south-east London park say they have been left \"devastated\" by her death.\nThe body of Sabina Nessa was found by a member of the public in Cator Park, Kidbrooke, on Saturday morning. \nMs Nessa's cousin Zubel Ahmed said the 28-year-old was a \"beautiful soul\" and appealed for help to find whoever was responsible for the \"horrific crime\".\nA vigil is due to be held in her memory on Friday evening.\nThe Met Police believe Ms Nessa was attacked and died the previous evening, at a time when the park would have been busy.\nMr Ahmed said the family understood she had been on her way home \"when she was attacked from behind.\"\nHe said her parents were \"absolutely shocked\" and \"inconsolable still, understandably so, to hear of their daughter being taken away from them by some cowardly man\".\nDescribing his cousin, Mr Ahmed said she \"was the most caring person - kindest, sweetest girl you could meet\".\n\"She's been teaching for two years. Loves teaching, loves kids, she's got a couple of cats at home. She was just a beautiful soul.\"\nThe area where she was found remains cordoned off and flowers have been left at the site.\nInformation sheets advising women on how to stay safe at night have been handed out by a community group in response to the death.\nThe handout suggests pedestrians stick to busy places with good lighting.\nAdvice on the sheet, printed from the Met Police website, also includes the suggestions that pedestrians should face oncoming traffic and conceal their jewellery.\nFriday's vigil has been organised by Reclaim the Streets who said they were \"angry and heartbroken\" by the killing and called on the government to do something about \"an epidemic of violence unfolding in front of our eyes.\"\nMiss Nessa, who was originally from Sandy in Bedfordshire, lived in Lewisham, south-east London.\nShe had been a year one teacher at Rushey Green Primary school in Catford for about a year.\nA post-mortem examination into the cause of the 28-year-old's death was inconclusive, the Met said.\nA man in his 40s who was arrested on suspicion of murder has been released under further investigation.\nOfficers have asked for any potential witnesses to contact them, and for drivers to check dash-cam footage they might have. \nThe Met believe the attack happened around 20:30 BST on 17 September at a time where the park \"was likely being used by many people.\"\nDet Supt Luke Marks said: \"This did not happen in the middle of the night - people would have been in and around the park at the time.\n\"We have extra officers in the area conducting high-visibility patrols, and anybody in London, regardless of gender, should be able to go out in an evening and not be concerned about being the victim of violent crime.\"\nMs Nessa was described by colleagues as \"kind, caring and dedicated\". The school's headteacher Lisa Williams said: \"She had so much life ahead of her and so much more to give and her loss is desperately sad.\n\"As a school we are supporting each other through this very difficult time, and we will be providing specialist support to those who need it.\"\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan also paid tribute, saying he had been left \"heartbroken\" by her death.\n\"The perpetrator of this despicable crime must be caught and brought to justice which is why I want to encourage anyone who may have been in the park around the time of the incident, and may have relevant information, to contact the police,\" he added.\nSafeguarding minister Rachel Maclean told the House of Commons: \"Every woman who loses their life is one woman too much and we are devastated to hear of the loss of the life of Sabina Nessa. Our hearts go out to the family.\nShe added that the government was \"passing legislation, setting out actions and tackling these horrific crimes and we are determined to see a reduction in them\". "

      "title": "Covid debt: A baby, job loss - and now eviction",
      "tags": "Renting,Eviction,Landlords,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Tenants are being evicted due to rent arrears built up during the Covid pandemic, despite the government saying no-one should lose their home as a result of the crisis. \nOne-third of hearings monitored in England and Wales over the summer explicitly cited the pandemic as the reason for the arrears, an investigation has found. The average hearing lasted just 10 minutes. \n\"We had a few safety nets, but they weren't enough for Covid,\" says Marshall Kinder-Maiss, 27. \nThree weeks before the UK went into lockdown in March 2020, he and his partner Joanne thought their dreams had come true. After 18 months of trying to conceive a child, Joanne had just given birth to a baby boy, Roman. To support his growing family, Marshall, a chef, decided to leave his job at a Nando's restaurant in Liverpool to take a better-paid role with a city-centre cafe. \nMarshall had a week off between his old job and his new one. And that was the week when Covid restrictions were introduced. Marshall's new job offer was withdrawn. And as he had left his former employer, he wasn't eligible for the government's furlough scheme.\nThe couple's income plummeted. Until their claim for Universal Credit was processed, their only money was Joanne's maternity pay of \u00a3150 a week. When the couple were both working full-time, they used to take home around \u00a32,000 a month. Their \u00a3450-a-month rent quickly became unaffordable as overdrafts were maximised to pay for living expenses. They've struggled to pay rent ever since. \n\"It was not how it was supposed to be,\" says Joanne, 24. \"It makes me feel a bit sick. We both grew up coming from poverty so we tried our best to get out of that. We've always been working people, and now I just feel like our son has been born into the exact same situation.\n\"All of our peers - they're not in this position. So it's a bit humiliating to be honest.\" \nThey are now \u00a34,000 in rent arrears and have been served with an eviction notice. They must leave the house by 11 October. \nIn March 2020, former Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick tweeted that \"no-one should lose their home as a result of the coronavirus epidemic\". A ban on bailiff evictions was introduced in England and Wales. This ended in England in May this year, and in Wales the following month. \nTo investigate the impact of this, The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) sent reporters to 30 county courts in England and Wales throughout July and August. \nOf the 555 cases involving either private or social housing landlords, 270 ended in a possession order. A third of those, 88 cases, explicitly mentioned the impact that Covid had had on their finances.   \nCourt bailiffs were \"swamped\" following the end of the eviction ban, lawyers told the BBC.\nMarshall and Joanne have decided not to go to Liverpool County Court to challenge their landlord's legal action. They have been advised by their legal representative that it would be \"pointless\". \nThey have been served with a Section Eight order, used when a tenant breaks the terms of the rental agreement. This acts as a mandatory ground for repossession if the landlord can prove that the tenant has arrears of at least two months. \nLast year, MPs on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee recommended changes in the law to give judges discretion in deciding each individual case. The government chose to ignore the recommendation. \nOn Monday, the BBC visited Wandsworth County Court - a crumbling three-storey building in south London - to witness possession orders being rapidly handed down, some within just five minutes. \nThe individuals or families in question will be forced out of their homes in just two weeks' time. \nOnly one tenant appeared in person during the session. She told the court she had been unable, during the pandemic, to find her usual agency work as an executive PA. This left her unable to afford the \u00a31,600 a month rent on her one-bedroom flat in Hammersmith, west London. \nShe had racked up \u00a324,000 in rent arrears. The court ordered her to leave her property by 4 October. In addition to her rent arrears, she must pay \u00a3604 in interest, and the landlord's \u00a33,000 legal costs. \nThe woman, who did not want to be named, told the BBC she would stay with a friend for the first two weeks. She has no idea where she will live after that. \n\"I don't know what to do. I've found a job, but my credit history is so bad, I doubt I'll find a place,\" she said.\nMarshall and Joanne say they have the same problem.\nMarshall found a new job three months ago, working for a food delivery firm, and is now looking for a second job to supplement his wage. But they don't have any savings to pay a deposit, and their credit rating is now poor.   \nAnd they face fierce competition for a new home, says Joanne. \n\"They're really sought after because there are a lot of evictions, so people are desperate to get a house.\"\nMarshall says he phones the council an average of once a week to enquire about social housing, but has been told there are others whose need is greater. \nThe couple say they definitely plan to pay back their arrears once they are able to. \nThe average tenant in the cases analysed by the TBIJ had \u00a36,500 worth of rent arrears. But a judge at another London court told the BBC he had come across one set of tenants with arrears of \u00a3190,000 in recent weeks. Some tenants had \"undoubtedly taken advantage\" of the evictions ban, he said, in effect to live rent-free.\nLandlady Michelle Dighton, 41, believes this is the case with a tenant in one of her rental properties. \nShe is owed more than \u00a325,000 in rent arrears as she says her tenant -  in Croydon, south London - hasn't paid rent since October 2019. She says that she delayed serving an eviction notice, hoping to resolve the situation amicably. \nBut when the government introduced the eviction ban, Michelle found herself stuck. Legal delays have further prevented the mother-of-two from sending round the bailiffs. \n\"I have to pay a mortgage and service fee for the flat, but I'm not getting any income from it.\"\nAdvice for tenants from the Citizen's Advice Bureau:\nMichelle says, as a tenant herself, she understands why the government introduced the eviction ban, \"but the courts can't distinguish between those who can't pay and those who won't pay\". \n\"My tenant's arrears have nothing to do with Covid,\" she thinks.\nAlthough the majority of tenants whose cases were monitored by TBIJ were served a Section Eight eviction notice, a fifth were served a Section 21 notice. Section 21 is a controversial part of the 1988 Housing Act which allows landlords to evict people without giving a specific reason.  Often called \"no fault\" or \"revenge\" evictions, the Conservatives promised to scrap them in their 2019 manifesto. \nMinisters said they will outline their proposals \"in due course\".\nIn a statement, the new Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: \"Our \u00a3352bn support package has helped renters throughout the pandemic, and prevented a build-up of rent arrears. We also took unprecedented action to help keep people in their homes by extending notice periods and pausing evictions at the height of the pandemic.\n\"As the economy re-opens, it is right that these measures are now being lifted and we are delivering a fairer and more effective private rental sector that works for both landlords and tenants.\"\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \"Here in Wales, we have made significant additional help available for tenants, including additional funding for Discretionary Housing Payments and grants to clear Covid-related rent arrears. This support goes far beyond any support UK government have provided.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nFor the first time in 40 years, when current records began, life expectancy for men in the UK has fallen. That's the conclusion from new estimates by the Office of National Statistics, which found life expectancy at birth for the three years up to 2020 was 79 years, falling back to levels seen in 2012-14. Women's life expectancy was mostly unchanged at just below 83. Falls in life expectancy are rare but the pandemic caused them across most of Europe and the US on a scale not seen since World War Two, research suggests. Experts expect to see further falls in the next year or so before life expectancy begins to recover.\nHospital A&E units have once again set the worst-ever performance figures for waiting times, as Covid pressures continue to weigh on the NHS. In the worst affected hospital, only 40.7% of patients were seen in four hours. Other waiting lists continue to grow, with record levels of people waiting nine months or more for surgery or other treatments. And the Welsh Ambulance Service recorded its second worst response times to critical calls since new targets were introduced. It comes as a Welsh government scientist warned that children may be more susceptible to common winter illnesses this year, as lockdowns prevented them building up immunity.\nAthletes for Team USA will have to be vaccinated against Covid-19 to compete in the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics. The US Olympic committee said the health and well-being of all athletes is its \"top priority\". Vaccination was not required before the Tokyo Olympics this year, and around 100 of the 613 US athletes had not had the jab. US swimmer Michael Andrew faced criticism for his decision not to be vaccinated and for failing to wear a face mask during interviews. The Winter Olympics begin on 4 February, but the US vaccination requirement will begin in November, with exemptions considered on a case-by-case basis.\nThe chief executive of an investment firm has said staff \"abuse\" work-from-home arrangements, as he criticised government plans to allow new employees to have the right to ask for flexible working from day one. Andrew Monk from VSA Capital told the BBC that people in financial services are less productive working from home. And he said the legislation is \"setting a tone that is almost making people think they can do part-time work but on full-time salaries\". Some big firms such as accountancy giants PwC and Deloitte have embraced flexible working and the government says it can make businesses more productive.\nAbout 250 people gathered at Stonehenge as the sun rose on the first official day of autumn. Marking the autumn equinox, druids, pagans and other visitors were allowed access to the stone circle again for the first time since the pandemic began. Solstice celebrations in June and December and equinox gatherings in March and October are normally some of the only occasions when people are allowed to get close to the stones. Despite the pandemic ban, unofficial gatherings still took place earlier this summer. Jess Trethowan from English Heritage, which manages the monument, said the autumn sunrise had \"felt really magical\".\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nAs students start the new term at university, here's what you need to know about everything from Fresher's Week to face-to-face teaching.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The US is to donate 500 million more doses of the Pfizer vaccine to developing nations from next year.\nPresident Joe Biden made the pledge at a virtual Covid-19 summit on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, promising an \"arsenal of vaccines\".\nThe additional jabs will see the total US commitment on vaccine sharing exceed one billion jabs.\nExperts say some 11 billion doses are required to vaccinate at least 70% of the global population.\nThe World Health Organisation has set a minimum target of 40% vaccine coverage in every country by the end of 2021.\nBut the goal is unlikely to be met. \nWhile many high-income countries have now given at least one shot to more than half their populations, only 2% of people in low-income countries have had their first dose, according to data from the University of Oxford.\nAnalysis by Stephanie Hegarty, BBC population correspondent\nIt's a big pledge but it'll be met with a fair share of scepticism from countries still waiting to vaccinate even 2% of their population.\nThe US had already pledged 580m doses but delivered only 160m of those so far.\nSo what's different now? Well, global production has picked up in the past few months and there are doses available.\nRich countries could have 1.2bn spare doses by the end of the year, even if they run booster campaigns, according to science analytics firm Airfinity. 241m of those could go to waste if they're not donated. But these need to be sent very soon.\nCovax, the WHO-backed scheme to help distribute vaccines fairly, has told the BBC that too many of the donations it's receiving have come in small quantities, at the last minute and with little time left before they expire.\nThat makes their job of getting them to where they are needed very hard. If Biden want to meet this ambitious goal of vaccinating the world by this time next year, that will have to change.\nThe White House's Covid summit comes as research shows rich countries are still holding surpluses of vaccines, many of which could soon be thrown out.\nIn June, members of the G7 - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - pledged to donate one billion doses to poor countries over the next year.\nPresident Biden pledged 580m at the time, of which the US has delivered only 160m so far.\nThe donated vaccines are routed through Covax, the global scheme supported by the WHO to get doses where they're needed most. \nCovax purchases and then sells vaccines at low-cost to middle income countries and donates to poor countries.\nIn the US - where more than 76% of adults have received at least one dose - criticism that the country is doing too little to help the rest of the world has grown.\nOn Friday, a panel advising the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended booster shots - third doses - of the Pfizer vaccine for people 65 and over.\nThe WHO has previously called on wealthier nations to hold off on providing boosters until vaccination rates go up in lesser developed countries.\nLast week, in a letter to Mr Biden, eight lawmakers of his own party wrote: \"Clearly, there is an inequitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccine doses, and it is getting worse.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Ofgem,UK economy,Energy service companies",
      "text": "Nearly 1.5 million customers have been hit in just two weeks by energy firms collapsing under soaring gas prices.\nAvro Energy and Green ceased trading on Wednesday and their 830,000 combined customers face being switched to a new, potentially more expensive, provider.\nGreen's boss, Peter McGirr, told the BBC he had done nothing wrong and said bigger firms would soon face problems.\nHowever, the government has cooled on the idea of loans to the industry, says BBC business editor Simon Jack.\nMr McGirr predicted: \"You will see larger suppliers feeling the pain as well and they will come cap in hand for a bailout.\"\nHe criticised the government for supporting US fertiliser firm CF Industries to restart its fertiliser factory, which produced carbon dioxide used in the food industry as a by-product, while allowing energy firms to fail.\nIts closure had raised fears over food supplies and the nuclear industry.\n\"Why do they need a bailout and we don't?\" he asked.\nHe apologised to staff and customers, but said: \"I don't think we did anything wrong as a supplier.\"\nSmall business minister Paul Scully told the BBC that the government had not treated CF Industries and Green in the same way because there were \"different solutions to different problems\".\nHe said there was \"a mature system\" in place to deal with the collapse of energy firms, \"protecting customers both in continuity of supply and prices\".\nMr McGirr's comments came amid signs of a change of direction in government policy on the energy crisis.\nThe BBC's Simon Jack says that while the government had been talking of state-backed loans for larger energy firms, that idea is now \"very much on the back burner\" and its intention is to \"tough this one out\".\nThe BBC has been told that ministers believe the current system for managing the failure of energy companies, which allows companies to recoup losses through an industry-wide levy, is working satisfactorily, even though it will add costs to millions of customers' bills.\nOur business editor says ministers do accept that the existing system of reallocating customers would not work if one of the bigger challenger firms went bust. \nIn that case, the government has the power to appoint a special administrator, in what would be a quasi-temporary nationalisation.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is having daily calls with the chief executive of Ofgem to monitor which firm might be next, a government spokesperson said.\nIt is not yet clear which supplier will take on the 580,000 customers from Avro Energy, the biggest firm to fail so far. Regulator Ofgem has also not yet appointed a new provider for Green customers either.\nAll affected customers will still receive energy while a new supplier is appointed by Ofgem.\nNeil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem, said its \"number one priority is to protect customers\".\nThe regulator's price cap, which covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland, protects customers on some tariffs by limiting how much firms can charge per unit of gas.\nBut providers have complained that they are unable to pass on rising costs to customers because of the cap on energy bills.\nThe plight of Avro customers is a good illustration of what may befall hundreds of thousands of people in the coming weeks.\nAn Avro customer in a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity, who got a fixed rate deal in August, would have been paying \u00a31,087 a year, according to price comparison site Uswitch. In March, they could have got a deal costing \u00a3920 a year.\nNow Avro has collapsed, they are likely to be paying \u00a31,277 a year at their new supplier from 1 October, in line with Ofgem's price cap.\nThe price cap does not mean it is impossible to pay more than \u00a31,277 a year. It is a cap on the price, not the final bill.\nThat figure is an illustration of the cap's effect on a gas and electricity customer's annual bill, assuming they have an average level of energy consumption. So, a household with heavy energy use will have a higher annual bill.\nPrice comparison site Uswitch has acknowledged there is currently no point in energy customers shopping around.\nJustina Miltienyte, the site's energy policy expert, said: \"Rising wholesale costs are putting a big strain on suppliers, which has had a knock-on effect on the value of the deals available in the market.\n\"What we're able to offer is constantly changing and will vary by customer. \n\"If you are coming to the end of your fixed deal, our advice is to hold tight, stay put and be rolled over on to your supplier's standard variable rate. Your supplier may try to offer you a new fixed deal, but this is unlikely to be the best option right now. \n\"However, people can leave their contact details so we could contact them once the situation improves. They can still head to Uswitch.com to compare deals across the whole of the energy market.\"\nOne Green customer, 52-year-old Sara Pilgrim of North Lincolnshire, switched to the firm just a week ago.\n\"My contract switched on the 16 September. I went from E.On. I was with Npower, who transferred to E.On,\" she told the BBC. \n\"When my contract was due to renew a couple of weeks ago, E.On had really hiked their prices up.\n\"I went around and looked at different companies. Green weren't the lowest, but I decided to go with them.\n\"How can they have been allowed to take on new contracts that close to them going bust? They must have known something was going on six days ago.\n\"I'm just angry really that they've been allowed to do that. You know if you have to cease trading. That's my gripe really, that they've been allowed to take on new contracts so close to them ceasing trading.\"\nSince wholesale gas prices have started to spike, a number of firms have collapsed.\nPeople's Energy, Utility Point, PfP Energy and MoneyPlus Energy ceased trading in September.\nThese smaller companies, including Avro Energy and Green Supplier Limited, account for more than 5% of the UK energy market - about 1.5 million customers. \nRead more about the next best steps to take here.\nOther small companies could fold in the coming days and weeks.\nIgloo, for example, has said it is working with restructuring consultants Alvarez & Marsal, although it told the BBC it had not appointed administrators. Bulb, the UK's sixth largest energy company with 1.7 million customers, is also seeking additional financing.\nDame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, told the BBC there had been a big increase in people seeking their help.\n\"We're seeing people come to us because they're seeing family finances being really squeezed,\" she added.\nSmaller providers launched in recent years have been overwhelmed by a spike in the cost of wholesale gas prices as economies have reopened from lockdowns and high demand from Asia pushed down supplies to Europe.\nGas prices are rising all across Europe, but Britain has also been affected by lower winds than usual - denting renewable energy supplies - as well as a recent fire at a National Grid site in Kent.\nIn the UK, firms had already been hit by a jump in costs even before the recent spike. From more than 70 suppliers in 2018, there are just over 30 now.\nIndustry sources fear there may be as few as 10 suppliers left by the end of the year."

      "tags": "Archaeology,Palaeontology,Genetics,University of Cambridge,Alaska,New Mexico,Bournemouth University,United States,Canada",
      "text": "Humans reached the Americas at least 7,000 years earlier than previously thought, according to new findings.\nThe topic of when the continent was first settled from Asia has been controversial for decades.\nMany researchers are sceptical of evidence for humans in the North American interior much earlier than 16,000 years ago.\nNow, a team working in New Mexico has found scores of human footprints dated to between 23,000 and 21,000 years old.\nThe discovery could transform views about when the continent was settled. It suggests there could have been great migrations that we know nothing about. And it raises the possibility that these earlier populations could have gone extinct.\nThe footprints were formed in soft mud on the margins of a shallow lake which now forms part of Alkali Flat in White Sands. The research has been published in the journal Science.\nA team from the US Geological Survey carried out radiocarbon dating on seeds found in sediment layers above and below where the footprints were found. This gave the researchers remarkably precise dates for the impressions themselves.\nBased on their sizes, scientists think the tracks were made mainly by teenagers and younger children travelling back and forth - along with the occasional adult.\nThey offer a fascinating window into what life was like for these early occupants of what is now the South West US.\nThe scientists don't know for sure what the teenagers were doing, but it is possible they were helping the adults with a type of hunting custom seen in later Native American cultures. This was known as the buffalo jump and involved driving animals over a shallow cliff edge.\nThe animals \"all had to be processed in a short period of time,\" explained Dr Sally Reynolds, co-author from Bournemouth University. \"You'd have to start fires, you'd have to start rendering the fat.\" The teenagers could have been helping out by collecting firewood, water or other essentials.\nThe age of the discovery is key, because there have been countless claims of early human settlement in the Americas. But virtually all are disputed in some way.\nIt often comes down to a debate over whether stone tools found at an ancient site are in fact what they appear to be, or are simply rocks broken through some natural process - such as falling from a cliff.\nThe proposed artefacts at early locales are sometimes less clear-cut than the exquisitely crafted spear-points found in North America from 13,000 years ago onwards. This leaves the door open for doubt about their identity.\n\"One of the reasons there is so much debate is that there is a real lack of very firm, unequivocal data points. That's what we think we probably have,\" Prof Matthew Bennett, first author on the paper from Bournemouth University, told BBC News.\n\"Footprints aren't like stone tools. A footprint is a footprint, and it can't move up and down [in the soil layers].\"\nWhile the nature of the physical evidence here is harder to dismiss, the researchers had to ensure the dating evidence was - quite literally - watertight.\nA potential complication flagged up by the journal during the early stages of review was the \"reservoir effect\". This refers to the way that old carbon can sometimes get recycled in aqueous environments, interfering with radiocarbon results by making a site seem older than it is.\nHowever, the team members say they have accounted for this effect and believe it is not significant here.\nProf Tom Higham, a radiocarbon dating expert at the University of Vienna, said: \"They've undertaken some checks on the dates of material from near to the footprint location and found that fully terrestrial samples (charcoal) produced ages similar to those of the aquatic species they dated from nearer to the footprints. \n\"They've also argued, I think justifiably, that the lake must have been shallow at the time people walked there, mitigating the effect of reservoir effects introduced by old carbon sources.\" The consistency of the results and the support from a different dating technique applied to the site both supported the validity of the results, he added.\n\"I think taken together this is a 21,000-23,000-year-old sequence,\" Prof Higham told BBC News.\nThe controversies in early American archaeology have much to do with the historical development of the field.\nDuring the second half of the 20th Century, a consensus emerged among North American archaeologists that people belonging to the Clovis culture had been the first to reach the Americas.\nThese big game hunters were thought to have crossed a land bridge across the Bering Straits that connected Siberia with Alaska during the last ice age, when sea levels were much lower.\nAs the \"Clovis First\" idea took hold, reports of more ancient settlement were dismissed as unreliable and some archaeologists actually stopped looking for signs of earlier occupation.\nBut in the 1970s, this orthodoxy was challenged.\nIn the 1980s, solid evidence turned up for a 14,500-year-old human presence at Monte Verde in Chile.\nAnd since the 2000s, other pre-Clovis sites have become widely accepted - such as the 15,500-year-old Buttermilk Creek Complex in central Texas and the 16,000-year-old Cooper's Ferry site in Idaho.\nNow, the footprint evidence from New Mexico suggests humans had made it to the North American interior by the height of the last Ice Age, when massive ice sheets covered much of what is today Canada. This would have blocked entry to humans crossing from Asia, perhaps suggesting that humans arrived even earlier when a path - or \"corridor\" - through the ice was open.\nGary Haynes, an emeritus professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, said: \"I cannot find fault with the work that was done or with the interpretations - the paper is important and provocative.\n\"The trackways are so far south of the Bering land connection that we now have to wonder (1) if the people or their ancestors (or other people) had made the crossing from Asia to the Americas much earlier, (2) if people moved quickly through the continents after each crossing, and (3) if they left any descendants.\"\nDr Andrea Manica, a geneticist from the University of Cambridge, said the finding had important implications for the population history of the Americas.\n\"I can't comment on how reliable the dating is (it is outside my expertise), but firm evidence of humans in North America 23,000 years ago is at odds with the genetics, which clearly shows a split of Native Americans from Asians approximately 15-16,000 years ago,\" he told BBC News.\n\"This would suggest that the initial colonists of the Americas were replaced when the ice corridor formed and another wave of colonists came in. We have no idea how that happened.\"\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "tags": "Haiti,US immigration,Texas,United States,Migration",
      "text": "The US special envoy for Haiti has resigned in protest over the deportation of Haitian migrants.\nThe decision to return migrants fleeing an earthquake and political instability was \"inhumane\", senior diplomat Daniel Foote said in a damning letter.\nLast weekend, the US started deportation flights from a Texas border town, where about 13,000 migrants had gathered under a bridge. \nThey have been waiting in a makeshift camp in temperatures of 37C (99F).\nLocal officials have struggled to provide them with food and adequate sanitation.  \nSince Sunday, the US has returned to Haiti 1,401 migrants from the Texas camp on the border with Mexico. \nIn his resignation letter, Mr Foote said Haiti was a \"collapsed state\" that \"simply cannot support the forced infusion of thousands of returned migrants lacking food, shelter, and money without additional, avoidable human tragedy\".\nWhite House spokeswoman Jen Psaki responded in a press conference: \"Special Envoy Foote had ample opportunity to raise concerns about immigration during his tenure. He never once did so.\"\nMs Psaki also described images from the border - showing horse-mounted US officers corralling the migrants - as horrific and said horses would no longer be used in the area. \nThe widely shared pictures, taken by an AFP photographer earlier this week, have evoked grim comparisons to US slavery and the country's historical mistreatment of black people. \nThat led to pressure on President Joe Biden's administration, and prompted calls from within his Democratic Party to give the Haitians asylum rather than fly them back to their home country.\nMany Haitians left after a devastating earthquake struck the country in 2010. A large number of those in the camp had been living in Brazil or other South American countries and travelled north after being unable to secure jobs or legal status.\nThis year has brought further hardship for the impoverished country. In July, President Jovenel Mo\u00efse was assassinated - and in August it suffered another deadly earthquake.\nMr Foote said Haitians needed \"immediate assistance\", and criticised the US and other countries for interfering in the country's politics.\n\"What our Haitian friends really want, and need, is the opportunity to chart their own course, without international puppeteering and favoured candidates but with genuine support for that course,\" he said.\nMr Foote has served in the role since Mo\u00efse's assassination in July.\nA state department spokesperson thanked the ambassador for his work, and insisted that the US remained \"committed to supporting safe, orderly, and humane migration throughout our region\".\nBut in a later statement, a department spokesperson hit back at Mr Foote's claim he had been ignored by officials.\n\"It is unfortunate that, instead of participating in a solutions-oriented policy process, Special Envoy Foote has both resigned and mischaracterised the circumstances,\" Ned Price said.\nPresident Biden has been accused of having an incoherent policy on migration. On the campaign trail, he vowed to reverse President Donald Trump's policies - which he deemed too harsh - and he put Vice-President Kamala Harris in charge of the issue in March. \nBut critics say they have failed to come up with a concrete plan for the near future, with the numbers of migrants coming into the country reaching record highs.\nOn the US side of the Mexican border in Del Rio, teams of police and National Guard agents have \"completely blocked off\" the area, according to immigrant rights activist Jenn Budd, who is at the scene. \n\"You cannot breathe here without law enforcement knowing what you're doing,\" Ms Budd, a former Border Patrol agent, told the BBC. \n\"They're cleaning it up and getting rid of everything, and they have shut down access to the river itself.\"\nOn the Mexican side of the river, migrants in a camp in Ciudad Acu\u00f1a are voicing concern about potential expulsions. \"I have nothing in my country. What are they going to do?\" one tearful Haitian woman asked an AFP reporter. \nSeparately, nearly 19,000 mostly Haitian migrants are in Colombia, waiting to cross the border with Panama on the journey to the US, officials say.\n\"We want them to let us cross, from here to Panama, before the United States closes its border,\" one migrant said. \"They are going to take away our dreams. I come from Peru, I've been struggling.\"\nAs monthly border-crossings continue to surge, Joe Biden has been caught between conservatives who say he is weak on undocumented migrants and liberal activists who view his policies as too much like those of his predecessor, Donald Trump.\nNow the criticism of Biden's actions are coming from inside his own administration - a development that could encourage more to speak out.\nThe images of uniformed border patrol agents on horseback accosting black Haitians have drawn comparisons to dark chapters of slavery and discrimination in American history. Immigration activists say the border episode provides evidence of the harsher treatment dark-skinned migrants receive in this country.\nThe US has a process by which it can give undocumented migrants \"temporary protected status\" from deportation if government officials determine that it would not be safe to return them to their home country.\nHaitians, as well as citizens from a handful of Central American countries, enjoy this protection - and it's cited as one of the reasons migrants brave the hazardous journey to the US, even though new arrivals do not qualify for the protections.\nInstead, the Haitians at the border are being sent back to a homeland where, according to Daniel Foote in his resignation letter, they face inhumane treatment and grave danger."

They must have known something was going on six days ago,\" she told the BBC.\nPrice comparison site Uswitch has acknowledged there is currently no point in energy customers shopping around.\nJustina Miltienyte, the site's energy policy expert, said: \"If you are coming to the end of your fixed deal, our advice is to hold tight, stay put and be rolled over on to your supplier's standard variable rate.\"\nOfgem's price cap protects customers on some tariffs by limiting how much firms can charge per unit of gas.\nBut providers have complained that this means they are unable to pass on their rising costs to customers.\nIn the past two weeks, the number of firms which have collapsed account for more than 5% of the UK energy market.\nOther small companies could fold in the coming days and weeks.\nIgloo, for example, has said it is working with restructuring consultants Alvarez & Marsal, although it told the BBC it had not appointed administrators. \nBulb, the UK's sixth largest energy company with 1.7 million customers, is also seeking additional financing.\nDorset-based Utility Point, which had already ceased trading, said it had now gone into administration. Its 220,000 customers have been transferred to EDF. \nRead more about the next best steps to take here.\nGas prices are rising all across Europe, but Britain has also been affected by lower winds than usual - denting renewable energy supplies - as well as a recent fire at a National Grid site in Kent.\nIn the UK, firms had already been hit by a jump in costs even before the recent spike. From more than 70 suppliers in 2018, there are just over 30 now.\nIndustry sources fear there may be as few as 10 suppliers left by the end of the year.\nHas your energy firm collapsed?

      "text": "Police are investigating leaks of information about the Scottish government's inquiry into harassment allegations against Alex Salmond. \nOfficers told the BBC they were dealing with two complaints of what could be \"unlawful disclosure\". \nNews that two female civil servants complained about Mr Salmond's behaviour first appeared in the Daily Record in August 2018. \nInvestigations by the Scottish government and the information commissioner failed to establish how the paper got hold of the details. \nEarlier this year, Mr Salmond said he was referring the matter to Police Scotland. \nA Police Scotland spokesman has now confirmed the force is \"investigating two complaints regarding the potential unlawful disclosure of information\". \nIn a statement, Mr Salmond welcomed the confirmation of the police investigation. \nHe added: \"I have always believed that if you find the sources of the criminal leaks then you find the truth\".\nThe Scottish government said it was unable to comment on any live police investigations.\nIt is understood the investigation into the second leak concerns the publication of the Scottish government's report into the Salmond case which appears in a new book. \nBreak-Up by journalists David Clegg and Kieran Andrews was published by Biteback earlier this month. \nAn internal government investigation was set up in 2018 after two female civil servants made formal complaints about Mr Salmond's behaviour, dating back to when he was first minister.\nSome of the complaints were upheld in a decision report written by Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans, the Scottish government's most senior civil servant, who said they were \"well founded\".\nHowever these findings were set aside when Mr Salmond successfully challenged the newly-devised complaints handling procedure in court. \nThe government conceded that the probe had broken rules and been \"tainted by apparent bias\" because the investigating officer had had some prior contact with the complainers.\nThe former first minister was awarded costs of more than \u00a3500,000, and was later cleared of all charges in a separate criminal trial. \nDetails of the investigation were published in the Daily Record newspaper after they were revealed by what Mr Clegg called an \"anonymous whistleblower\", and further extracts from Ms Evans' report were later published in the book he penned with Mr Andrews.\nAn inquiry into the leak was carried out by the Information Commissioner's Office, the body with statutory responsibility for investigating such matters.\nIts report said it had \"sympathy with the hypothesis that the leak came from an employee of the Scottish government\", given the timing and the limited number of people who had access to the findings.\nHowever it said a forensic examination of government computers and interviews with staff had not provided an \"electronic trail to follow\" or any witnesses.\nIt concluded that \"there was insufficient evidence to point to any specific suspect and to allow the investigation to move forward\".\nHowever Mr Salmond continued to insist that there \"absolutely should be a police investigation of the matter\", saying he believed the leak had been \"politically inspired\".\nA Holyrood inquiry committee found the Scottish government's handling of the original complaints had been \"seriously flawed\" when its report was published on 23 March.\nThe committee's report noted concerns about the disclosure, saying it had been \"damaging\" for both Mr Salmond and the women who complained.\nIt added: \"Confidentiality of an investigation is of paramount importance, and the leaking of such information is extremely serious.\"\nBoth Ms Evans and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon have apologised for the mistakes that were made during the probe, while insisting it was right and proper to investigate the complaints.\nWork to develop a new independent system for investigating complaints against ministers and former ministers is due to be completed by the end of the year."

      "text": "Millions of low income families are facing a squeeze on their finances from October, a charity has said.\nA combination of rising energy and consumer goods prices, coupled with benefits cuts, will add an extra \u00a3710 in costs for poorer households, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation warned.\nThe report comes amid debate about plans to end the uplift in Universal Credit payments.\nThe government said it has schemes in place to protect consumers.\nThe charity worked out the impact of rising costs on a lower-income couple with two young children, with one adult working full-time with gross earnings of \u00a320,000 per year.\nIt said the \u00a3710 poor households would need to find would include an extra \u00a33 per week for energy assuming a pre-payment meter, \u00a38 in other costs and \u00a32.50 per week in National Insurance contributions.\nOn top of this, they will be losing a \u00a320-per-week increase in Universal Credit (UC), which the government introduced last year as a temporary measure and is due end in October.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC on Tuesday the UC cut could make it \"a very difficult winter\" for low income families, and said he was speaking to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey \"a great deal\" on the subject.\nPeter Matejic, deputy director of evidence and impact at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: \"Millions of low-income families are incredibly anxious about how on earth they are supposed to make ends meet from next month.\n\"Ministers rightly recognise this is shaping up to be a very difficult winter, yet there is little sign of them taking the decisive steps that are necessary to avoid real hardship for low-income families.\"\nWholesale gas prices have soared in recent months due to high demand and a reduced supply.\nCustomers are buffered from steep wholesale gas price rises by the energy price cap, which is the maximum price they can be charged.\nBut from 1 October, customers on standard tariffs could see an increase of \u00a3139, from \u00a31,138 to \u00a31,277 a year.\nAnd people with pre-payment meters could see an increase of \u00a3153, from \u00a31,156 to \u00a31,309.\nAbout four million UK households use pre-payment meters. These customers are more likely to be vulnerable and living in fuel poverty, and are more likely to self-disconnect if they are in debt, according to Ofgem.\nA government spokesperson said: \"Protecting consumers is our top priority which is why Energy Price Cap will remain in place.\n\"We are supporting vulnerable and low-income households further through initiatives such as the Warm Home Discount, Winter Fuel Payments and Cold Weather Payments.\nThe spokesperson added that the uplift to Universal Credit \"was always temporary, to help claimants through the economic shock of the toughest stages of the pandemic\". \n\"It's right that the government should focus on helping people back into work and supporting those already employed to progress and earn more.\"\nMartin Lewis, the founder of Moneysavingexpert.com, said in advice published online that energy prices have \"exploded\" and that \"urgent damage limitation is needed\".\nHe said that alongside hikes to gas prices, electricity prices from gas-powered generation may also rise.\nFrom 1 April next year, the price cap could jump again to a \"stomach-churning\" \u00a31,450 per year for typical use, he said. Consumers coming off a cheaper energy deal \"will pay substantially more\", he said.\nMr Lewis said he was \"very concerned about how those on lower incomes will cope with these horrific new energy prices\" adding that they face \"the perfect price storm\".\nThere are emergency coronavirus measures ongoing for those who are struggling, and are having to \"choose between heating and eating\", he said.\n\"Your supply won't be cut off - disconnections have been suspended, while prepayment customers can get emergency credit to ensure the lights stay on,\" he said.\nPeople can apply on a case-by-case basis to suppliers for payment reviews, breaks, or reductions.\nIt is also possible to get \u00a3140 towards bills through the Warm Home Discount, government scheme."

      "tags": "Keir Starmer,Labour Party",
      "text": "Sir Keir Starmer has published an 11,500 word essay on what he stands for and how he wants to change the UK, ahead of his party's conference.\nThe Labour leader says the country is at a crossroads after the pandemic and is \"crying out for change\".\nIf elected prime minister, he says he would create \"a society built on everyone's contribution\".  \nSir Keir has faced criticism from some in Labour that he lacks vision and voters don't know what his values are.\nHe is due to deliver his first in-person conference speech to party members since becoming leader last year, in Brighton next week.\nIn his essay The Road Ahead, published by the Fabian Society think tank, he sketches out many of the themes that are likely to feature in his speech, saying he wants Labour to be \"Britain's bricks and mortar\".\n\"People want to emerge from lockdown into something better,\" writes the Labour leader.\n\"They want to see a contribution society: one where people who work hard and play by the rules can expect to get something back.\n\"Where you can expect fair pay for fair work, where we capture the spirit that saw us through the worst ravages of the pandemic and celebrate the idea of community and society; where we understand that we are stronger together.\"\nSpeaking about his own background, as the son of parents who \"worked with their hands\" who was able to go to university and reach the top of the legal profession, Sir Keir writes: \"There are two fundamental things we need to fix in this country: insecurity and inequality of opportunity.\n\"Does a working-class child in Britain today have the same opportunities my generation did? It is hard to think they do.\"\nSir Keir's essay has multiple objectives.\nHe wants to silence critics who accuse him of lacking vision or direction, to create dividing lines with his political opponents - and to suggest that his values are in touch with those of the majority of voters.\nHe sets out 10 \"simple key principles\" for a future Labour government, which would \"always put hard-working families and their priorities first\".\nThe pamphlet is peppered with the phrase \"security and opportunity\".\nThis is, in part, to convince voters that a future Labour government would tackle the insecurity many people feel at work.\nBut it is also designed to play to his perceived strengths and his life story.\nLabour's target voters are unlikely to devour the entire tract.\nBut the forthcoming conference will provide Sir Keir with both the opportunity - and the challenge - of distilling his message.\nIn the pamphlet, Sir Keir attacks Prime Minister Boris Johnson as \"utterly unserious and completely unprepared for the great challenges of our time\".\nAnd he accuses both the Conservatives and the SNP of being in thrall to nationalism.\nBy contrast, he argues, Labour should be \"proudly patriotic\" but \"reject the divisiveness of nationalism\".\nHe repeats his call for the party to embrace the achievements of the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown governments - but says Labour has to change to stand a chance of returning to power. \n\"The Labour Party at its best does not wait around for the public to decide we are right. Instead, it adapts and updates. It does not look backwards - it marches forwards,\" he writes.\nConservative party co-chairman Oliver Dowden said: \"If this is Starmer's 'big vision' then he should have gone to Specsavers. \n\"Labour are talking to themselves about themselves. They're all essays and no action.\"\nSpeaking to ITV's Robert Peston, former Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the document \"looks like the sermon on the mount written by a focus group\".\n\"I can't see anything in this document that is going to inspire,\" he added.\nLabour MP Liam Byrne - who failed to unseat Conservative Andy Street as West Midlands mayor in May's elections - has set out his own plan to return his party to power.\nIn an article for Prospect magazine, the former minister says Sir Keir needs to target Tory voters with \"an evocative tale of how we build our future with pride in our past, fed by roots in industry and community\"."

But harmful particles are also released into the air in other ways - or formed in the air in reaction with other chemicals. \nParticle sources include paints, cleaning fluids, and solvents. Add to that car tyres wearing on the road, or brakes - meaning that even electric cars can't offer a perfect solution. \nHow many people know that farm slurry also gives off gases that contribute to deaths in cities?\nThat's why the new advice is so challenging to governments. If you live in a city, it's very hard to escape pollution, however hard you try.\nThe new guidelines, released on Wednesday, halve the recommended maximum for exposure to tiny particles called PM2.5s. \nThese are produced by burning fuels in power generation, domestic heating and vehicle engines.\n\"Almost 80% of deaths related to PM2.5 could be avoided in the world if the current air pollution levels were reduced to those proposed in the updated guideline,\" the WHO said. \nIt is also cutting the recommended limit for another class of microparticles, known as PM10s, by 25%.\nOther pollutants singled out in the guidelines include ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide. \nAir pollution is linked to conditions such as heart disease and strokes. In children, it can reduce lung growth and cause aggravated asthma. \n\"Improving air quality can enhance climate change mitigation efforts, while reducing emissions will in turn improve air quality,\" the WHO says."

Millions of Americans who received Moderna and Johnson & Johnson jabs will have to keep waiting for further booster approval.\nIn the UK, the government has announced that it will offer boosters to everyone over 50 and to other vulnerable people as it heads towards the winter months.\nGermany, France and the Czech Republic have announced similar plans for older or vulnerable people. In Israel, boosters are already being offered to children as young as 12.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has called on wealthier nations to hold off on providing booster shots until vaccination rates go up in lesser developed countries.\n\"There are countries with less than 2% vaccination coverage, most of them in Africa, who are not even getting their first and second dose,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last week. \n\"And starting with boosters, especially giving it to healthy populations, is really not right.\"\nAt a UN speech on Wednesday, Mr Biden pledged to donate 500 million vaccine doses to poorer countries in 2022. Despite the lofty promise, a fraction of the donations that have been pledged by richer countries have actually been delivered to those in need."

Only once the EC has agreed these amendments, will the directive be enacted.\nThe EC hopes that will happen in 2022 - after which member states usually have two years to enact the rules into national law, and manufacturers will have 24 months to change their charging ports.\n\"We gave industry plenty of time to come up with their own solutions, now time is ripe for legislative action for a common charger. This is an important win for our consumers and environment and in line with our green and digital ambitions,\" Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager said."

      "text": "Angry scenes broke out at Haiti's main airport after migrants were deported to the country from the US. \nOn Tuesday, migrants at the airport in Port-au-Prince rushed back towards the plane they had arrived on, while others threw shoes at the jet. \nLast weekend, the US started flying out migrants from a Texas border town which has seen an influx in recent weeks. \nAbout 13,000 would-be immigrants have gathered under a bridge connecting Del Rio in Texas to Ciudad Acu\u00f1a in Mexico.\nSeparately reports have emerged of thousands - mostly Haitians - stranded near the border between Colombia and Panama.\nChaos unfolded at Haiti's Toussaint Louverture airport as one man attempted to re-board the aircraft. The plane's crew rushed to close the jet's doors in time, Reuters news agency reports. \nVideo footage taken at the airport shows people scrambling for their personal belongings after their bags were dumped out of the plane. \nThere are reports that some migrants were not told they would be returning to Haiti. \nAccording to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), there were two separate incidents at the airport on Tuesday. \nA source told NBC News that the pilots on board one of the flights were assaulted on arrival in Haiti and three US immigration officers were also injured. \nIn a separate incident in Texas, a group of Haitians reportedly fought Border Patrol agents and attempted to escape after realising they were being deported. \nAt the time, the migrants were being transported on a bus from the town of Brownsville to Del Rio. \n\"When the migrants found out they were going to be sent back to Haiti, they took the bus over and they fled,\" Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council, said at a news conference late on Tuesday. \nThe removal of migrants has been criticised by Partners In Health, an NGO that has been working in the country. \n\"During a challenging and dangerous period for Haiti, it is unthinkably cruel to send men, women and children back to what many of them do not even call 'home' anymore.\"\nAbout 4,000 people have either been deported or moved to other processing centres, according to DHS. \nFrom Thursday, flights could be ramped up to as many as seven a day, according to the Washington Post. \nQuoting an unnamed US official, the Associated Press also reported on Tuesday that authorities are also releasing Haitian migrants into the US \"on a very, very large scale\".\nThe official added that many of the migrants have been given notices to appear at immigration offices within 60 days. The official said this approach requires less processing time than having them appear before an immigration court. \nThe migrants have been waiting in a makeshift camp in temperatures of 37C (99F). \nLocal officials have struggled to provide them with food and adequate sanitation.  \nMost of those at the camp are Haitians, but there are also Cubans, Peruvians, Venezuelans and Nicaraguans present.\nMeanwhile the Colombian government has said that around 19,000 migrants - mainly from Haiti - are stranded near the border with Panama. Migrants often cross into Panama and proceed on foot as part of a long journey north towards the United States. \nHowever, a senior Colombian official said that many migrants are now stranded near the border as a result of an agreement between the two countries restricting the number of migrants crossing the Gulf of Urab\u00e1 into Panama to just 250 people a day. \nHe added that many migrants have been risking their lives by trying to cross the gulf illegally at night on substandard boats.\nMany Haitians left the country after a devastating earthquake in 2010, and a large number of those in the camp had been living in Brazil or other South American countries and travelled north after being unable to secure jobs or legal status.\nThis year has brought further hardship for the impoverished country. In July, Haiti's president was assassinated - and in August it suffered another deadly earthquake."

That meant they couldn't pass on the cost of soaring gas prices.\nIf your energy provider goes bust, you still receive gas and electricity. \nBecause of its size, Bulb has been put into an arrangement called \"special administration\". \nThe company is being run as normal by administrators Teneo, until a buyer can be found or its customers can be moved elsewhere. In the short-term, it means Bulb customers haven't been been transferred to another provider, and don't have to do anything. \nThe accounts held by the other failed firms are automatically moved to a new supplier by energy regulator Ofgem.\nYou can't choose the provider and may end up on a more expensive tariff.\nOfgem has sent customers to the following suppliers: \nOfgem and Citizens Advice both recommend making a note or taking a photo of your meter reading and downloading any bills, while waiting for your new supplier to get in touch.\nThere's no need to cancel direct debits.\nIf you're in credit, the balance will be added to your account with your new supplier. However, this may take several weeks.\nIf you're in debt to a company which has stopped trading, you still have to pay the money you owe. You will be contacted by its administrators, or the supplier which takes over its business.   \nIt's unlikely. \nUsually, consumers are encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise. \nBut at the moment better offers simply aren't available. In particular, people already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nThose coming to the end of fixed deals will be moved on to higher standard tariffs.\nA tariff set at the price cap limit - the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard deal - will be the most competitive.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, the Energy Saving Trust says simple changes to our homes and energy habits could help offset the current price rises.\nThe price cap sets the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The level of the cap is reviewed every six months.\nIt's the reason energy suppliers haven't been able to pass on all of the recent wholesale gas price increases.\nAbout 15 million households in England, Wales and Scotland saw a 12% rise in their energy bills on 1 October, when a higher price cap took effect.\nOfgem has now said it will review how the price cap is calculated to make sure it accurately reflects the risks faced by companies. \nIt will publish its conclusions in February, and a new price cap will be announced before it is implemented in April 2022.\nIn Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market, a number of suppliers have also announced price increases in recent months.\nA worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies has meant gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia have risen dramatically. \nSupplies of renewable energy in Great Britain were also reduced by the least windy summer since 1961. \nA fire at a National Grid site in Kent closed a power cable supplying electricity from France. \nRising gas prices also led to a shortage of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is widely used in the food and drink industry."

      "text": "Food industry bodies have warned of panic-buying this Christmas unless action is taken to address labour shortages.\nThe National Farmers' Union (NFU) called for an emergency visa to allow firms to recruit from outside the UK.\nUK farmers, hauliers and shops have been struggling with shortages that have been made worse by Covid and Brexit.\nThe government said that the UK has a \"highly resilient food supply chain\".\nThe head of the NFU, Minette Batters, wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday warning that the food and farming sector is on a \"knife edge\" due to a shortage of workers across the entire supply chain.\nThe letter, signed on behalf of a number of food and drink trade bodies, urged the government to introduce a Covid-19 recovery visa to open up new recruitment opportunities as a matter of urgency.\n\"Without it, more shelves will go empty and consumers will panic buy to try to get through the winter,\" Ms Batters wrote.\n\"That is why we must have an urgent commitment from you to enable the industry to recruit from outside the UK over the next 12 months to get us through the winter and to help us save Christmas.\"\nShe said it is \"a travesty that this is happening in parallel with UK food producers disposing of perfectly edible food as it either cannot be picked, packed, processed or transported to the end customer\".\n\"Every day there are new examples of food waste across the industry, from chicken to pork, fruit and vegetables, dairy and many other products. The food is there, but it needs people to get it to the consumers,\" Ms Batters said.\nThe letter was signed on behalf of other groups such as the British Frozen Food Federation, the British Meat Processors Association, Dairy UK and the Food and Drink Federation.\nThere was a report in The Grocer that Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket chain, had warned the government that panic-buying this Christmas could be worse than during lockdown.\nHowever, Tesco later said: \"We have good availability, with deliveries arriving at our stores and distribution centres across the UK every day.\n\"While the industry-wide shortage of HGV drivers has led to some distribution challenges, we're working hard to address these and to plan for the months ahead, so that customers can get everything they need.\"\nSome farmers have resorted to giving fruit and vegetables away rather than let it rot in their fields.\nThe NFU has said that only 11% of seasonal workers in the 2020 season were UK residents.\nRobert Newbery from NFU East Midlands said earlier this month: \"Brexit is certainly having an impact. The people that could move freely within Europe before now can't.\"\nIn response to the NFU's call for support, the government increased the number of visas available under the Seasonal Worker Pilot (SWP) from 10,000 in 2020 to 30,000 this year.\nThere are also labour shortages in meat production, with a shortfall of abattoir workers and butchers.\nThe Association of Independent Meat Suppliers told the BBC in August the industry had about 14,000 job vacancies.\nIt said Covid, the UK's exit from the European Union (EU) and perceptions over career paths had caused a looming \"recruitment crisis\".\nHauliers and food firms have also been warning of a chronic shortage of lorry drivers, which they also ascribe to the pandemic and Brexit.\nA government spokesperson said that the UK's supply chain is \"highly resilient\" and has coped well when faced with recent pressures.\nThey pointed out that the government earlier this year expanded its Seasonal Workers Pilot to 30,000 visas for workers to come to the UK for up to six months. \n\"We continue to work closely with industry to understand labour demand and supply, including both permanent and seasonal workforce requirements,\" they said.\nSeparately, the government has said it has taken action to prevent supermarket shortages with a deal to restart production at CF Industries, the UK's biggest producer of carbon dioxide.\nThe gas is widely used by the food industry to prolong shelf life.\nRestarting production at the carbon dioxide plants is set to cost taxpayers tens of millions of pounds, after the government agreed to meet the full operating costs for three weeks."

An investigation is under way. \nThe MoD has apologised and said extra support was being offered to them.\nIn the latest data breach to be uncovered, defence officials sent an email that had the email addresses and some names of 55 people which could be seen by everyone who was sent the message.\nThe recipients - at least one of whom is from the Afghan National Army - were told UK relocation officials had been unable to contact them and they were asked to update their details.\nAn MoD spokeswoman said: \"We have been made aware of a data breach that occurred earlier this month by the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (Arap) team. \n\"This week, the defence secretary instigated an investigation into data handling within that team.\n\"Steps have now been taken to ensure this does not happen in the future.\" \nIt comes just a day after the defence secretary apologised for a separate breach involving the email addresses of dozens of Afghan interpreters who worked for British forces.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said it had been \"an unacceptable level of service\" that had let down thousands of members of the armed forces and veterans.\nMore than 250 people seeking relocation to the UK - many of whom are in hiding - were mistakenly copied into the email.\nTheir email addresses could be seen by all recipients, showing people's names and some associated profile pictures.\nMr Wallace said an investigation had been launched and one official suspended. \nDefence sources told the BBC that Mr Wallace did not know about this second breach when he spoke in the Commons on Tuesday.\nFormer Conservative defence minister Johnny Mercer, who served in Afghanistan, said he feared there may be more to come.\n\"I've been concerned from the start as to how these individuals have been treated - the whole thing was such a rush to the door when Kabul fell that these mistakes were inevitable,\" he said. \n\"I personally think we've taken out people we really shouldn't have, and failed to bring out the majority of those we should - I think we are only beginning to learn the scale of what has gone on here.\"\nOn Tuesday, Labour shadow defence secretary John Healey welcomed the defence secretary's apology but told the Commons that action now mattered most.\nAdditional reporting by Marie Jackson."

We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience,\" a spokesperson from Esso added. \nHowever, supermarket Morrisons, which operates 338 petrol stations across the UK, said it was not seeing any similar issues at the moment. \nCo-op runs 130 petrol stations in the country, and said it has a \"full complement\" of fuel delivery drivers. \nTesco also said that they have a \"good availability of fuel\" and both Sainsbury's and Asda said there are no current issues in their fuel supplies. \nDowning Street has said people should continue buying fuel as normal.\nA spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was no shortage of fuel in the UK, adding: \"We obviously recognise the challenges faced by the industry and we're taking steps to support them.\"\nHe pointed to changes made by the Department for Transport to make it quicker for HGV drivers to get their licences and said that this is a problem several countries are facing.\nGrant Shapps also told the BBC's Question Time on Thursday that he believed the shortages had also been caused because of working conditions that \"hadn't been pleasant\" and that higher salaries offered to drivers was something the government was \"happy to see\".\nHe also said that improvements in the availability of tests were \"coming in prior to Christmas\u2026 so these are things that will resolve the issues in the lead up to Christmas\".\nThe temporary closures come just months after BP had to close a \"handful\" of its UK sites in July because of lorry driver shortages. At the time, BP said its supply chain issues had also been exacerbated by the closure of a distribution terminal due to staff being told to isolate.\nPaul Cheema has run a petrol station in Coventry since 2013, and says he's never experienced a situation like this before.\n\"We used to be able to put orders in for next day delivery. Now we have to do it a week in advance, but we're ordering blind. We don't know how much fuel we're going to sell in that time. If we'll have enough, or even too much,\" says Paul.\n\"Last week we put in an order for a delivery to arrive today. That was pushed back until tomorrow, and now we've been told it won't arrive until Saturday.\"\n\"So that means we won't have any unleaded petrol to sell tomorrow,\" he said.\nPaul says that fuel delivery delays have been happening all summer, but it's been particularly bad in the last couple of weeks. \n\"We're a petrol station. We should have availability 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I'm not blaming our fuel supplier. It's not their fault. It's the bigger driver shortage problem behind it.\"\nHe sells thousands of litres of unleaded every day, so the cost implications for him are huge.\n\"There could be a 40% impact on sales with this week's delivery problems. If I haven't got any liquid in the ground, I'm not making money. I can't operate the site at a loss.\"\n\"If I haven't got fuel to sell, that customer isn't coming into my petrol station shop either, so I'm losing money there too,\" says Paul.\nThe Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents petrol station operators across the UK, said that some sites across the UK were seeing delivery delays, but that they were largely confined to London and the South East, and were \"temporary by nature\".\nGordon Balmer from the PRA said that petrol station closures were rare, and that the fuel supply chain was resilient enough to cope.\n\"Fuel demand is still only at 92% of pre-pandemic levels so we believe there should be ample stock available at refineries and delivery terminals throughout the UK.\"\nMany businesses have been complaining about the UK's shortage of lorry drivers, which is still causing serious supply chain problems.\nThe coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and tax changes have all contributed to a lack of qualified drivers. Industry bodies estimate there is a shortfall of about 100,000 workers.\nLogistics UK, which represents the haulage industry, said it was \"aware of reports that petrol supplies are currently being affected\" by the lack of drivers.\n\"The driver shortage is a very serious issue that needs urgent government and industry action to resolve, however, we urge people not to panic buy; the logistics industry is resilient and has proven capable of supporting shops, families and businesses during Covid-19, border closures and the first stages of Brexit, and will continue to serve the needs of the nation,\" the industry body said."

      "text": "People in parts of Wales are facing a \"crisis of access\" to GPs, according to a patients' watchdog. \nThe Community Health Council (CHC) said many were left waiting for up to an hour on the phone to speak to someone.\nWhen they finally get through, they are often told there are no available appointments, it added.\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) said doctors were trying to ease the problem by using modern technology such as video calling.\nBut the union admitted an ongoing problem had been made worse by the pandemic. \nOne health board estimated demand for appointments was up 20% in some places.\nGeoff Ryall-Harvey, of the North Wales CHC, said he feared people were getting \"extremely frustrated\".\nSome surgeries, he said, had banned queueing outside because of Covid. \nBut with some GPs not having an online booking system, he said this had meant long waits on the phone for some.\nMr Ryall-Harvey said: \"People are being told all the appointments are gone, even at 08:10 in the morning when the lines have just opened. \n\"It's one thing to be told that there are no appointments left, but for this to happen several days on the run means there's a very real crisis of access for people in some areas. \n\"Part of the problem goes back before the Covid pandemic. There has been a steady decline in the number of GPs working in Wales.\"\nBecca Martin, of Wrexham, tried to make a GP appointment for her 67-year-old father Steve when he developed a urine infection in June.  \nBut she said it was \"incredibly difficult\" and by the time they managed to get one, his condition had become so bad he was taken straight to hospital. \n\"My mum was on the phone for over an hour at one point,\" Ms Martin said.\n\"That's not unusual - I've heard many cases of people on the phone for upwards of an hour trying to get through.\"\nAfter being repeatedly told there were no appointments and to call back the next day, Ms Martin said her mother told the surgery she \"was fearful for his life and she thought he was going to die\". \n\"By that point it was too late and he was blue-lighted to hospital because he'd deteriorated too much,\" she explained.\nMany Welsh GP surgeries are run independently, contracting services to the local health board. \nBetsi Cadwaladr health board estimated that in practices it managed, demand for appointments had increased by up to 20%. \nDr Phil White, chairman of the Welsh GPs Committee at the BMA, which represents doctors, said problems were developing before Covid with more GPs being lost to early retirement. \nBut he said GP surgeries are often in buildings with small waiting rooms, which were not safe for large number of often vulnerable people.\n\"But video consultations, phone consultations and e-mail consultations have escalated considerably over the past 12 months,\" he added.\nThe Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents the organisations that make up NHS Wales, said the health service was facing \"unprecedented demand\".\n\"More people are needing to access primary care with services under more pressure now than they were at the height of the pandemic,\" said director Darren Hughes, adding leaders were doing \"all they can to address these issues\"."

      "tags": "A&E,NHS Scotland,Coronavirus pandemic,Humza Yousaf",
      "text": "Scotland's Health Secretary Humza Yousaf says the NHS is facing the \"biggest crisis\" of its existence.\nThere's a shortage of beds, the demand for ambulances is soaring and waits in accident and emergency departments are getting longer.\nOn top of that, Covid-19 admissions have been rising fast as the number of infections in Scotland spiralled at the end of the summer.\nHere are five charts illustrating the enormous pressures currently being felt by NHS Scotland.\nThe efficient operation of the NHS is highly dependent on the ability to move patients out of hospitals once they've been treated.\nIf a treated patient remains in hospital then it can prevent another being admitted - a phenomenon known as \"bed blocking\".\nDelayed discharges dropped at the start of the pandemic as the NHS suspended much of its routine services to focus on Covid-19 patients.\nThe figure began to rise again last summer before reaching a plateau this winter.\nHowever, the number of delayed discharges began to rise sharply in the three months up to July - the most recent month there are figures for - and this trend is likely to have continued over the summer.\nThere are a number of reasons why treated patients might be delayed in hospital.\nIn July there were 42,364 \"delayed bed days\", with two-thirds being for \"health and social care reasons\".\nEarlier this week Prof Michael Griffin, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, said there were real problems getting patients out of hospitals and into social care because of a \"care home workforce crisis\"\nIt's not just care homes that have workforce issues.\nThe NHS was also hit by Covid-related absences as the number of cases spiralled across Scotland last month.\nRecent changes to self-isolation rules have kept absences lower than the peak of the outbreaks in spring 2020 and this winter, but they still doubled between mid-August and mid-September.\nLast week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the ambulance service was \"operating at its highest level of escalation\".\nThe Scottish government has now enlisted the help of the Army, fire service, British Red Cross and taxi firms to ease the pressure.\nPublic Health Scotland publishes monthly figures on Scottish Ambulance Service incidents, comparing them with pre-pandemic levels.\nFor much of the year, ambulance incidents were down on 2018-2019, but began rising in the summer and are now higher than the pre-pandemic average.\nThe head of the Scottish Ambulance Service, Pauline Howie, recently apologised to patients for the longer waits, saying her staff were working under \"unprecedented pressure\" dealing with big increases in Covid and non-Covid calls.\nThis data spells out the problem facing the NHS - too much demand and not enough capacity. \nBringing the army in will help to free up some clinical staff to work on urgent calls. That might ease some of the pressure getting people to hospital, but nursing leaders warn the staffing situation is \"desperate\".\nEven if you find more beds, they say there are not enough nurses to care for patients.\nIt's the same getting people home at the end of their treatment. Those working in social care say they too face a staffing crisis.\nIt also takes time to find space in care homes or to assess and adapt people's homes so that they can return safely. \nThese are long-standing issues for the health service but Covid has shown just how little give there is in the system. \nAccident and emergency departments are often thought of being a \"barometer\" for the rest of the NHS, acting as the hospital's front door for many patients.\nOne way to measure emergency department performance is waiting times - and it's obvious from these figures that all is not well.\nThere's a big drop in waiting times when the pandemic first hit in March 2020, as lockdown was introduced and emergency departments were suddenly much less busy.\nBut the number of patients waiting more than four hours in A&E began rising sharply in April.\nThe figure is now higher than it has ever been in the last six years and shows no sign yet that it is starting to go down.\nThere is strong evidence that vaccination has weakened the link between Covid infection and serious illness.\nFewer people need hospital treatment, and those that do spend shorter periods in hospital.\nBut the link has not been eliminated and people are still being admitted.\nThe number of infections rose rapidly at the end of August and into September, and that rise was reflected in hospital admissions.\nAverage admissions are not at the same level we saw in January this year - but they're not far off the peak in April 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic.\nHowever, the most recent figures show the first indication that daily admissions may have peaked and could now be starting to fall."

Kelly's lawyer has compared him to civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr in the closing argument of the singer's sex-trafficking trial.\nDeveraux Cannick said both men held the government to account and he urged jurors to be courageous. \nThe singer, 54, denies all charges against him in the federal case.\nThe prosecution ended its argument with a simple message: \"Convict him\", after saying he should pay for the \"pain he inflicted on each of his victims\". \nR. Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is accused of grooming and sexually abusing women and underage girls.\nThe charges include one count of racketeering and eight counts of illegally transporting people across state lines for the purpose of sex.\nOver the past five weeks, the jury in Brooklyn, New York, has heard from a number of men and women who said the star stripped them of control, enforcing draconian rules over when they could eat, sleep and go to the bathroom, and pressured them into sexual acts, which he would often videotape.\nProsecutors have portrayed him as a predator who exploited his fame to attract fans into his circle, where he would demand strict obedience or else punish them. \n\"For decades, the defendant recruited and groomed women, girls and boys for his own sexual gratification,\" Elizabeth Geddes, a lawyer for the prosecution, told the jury. \"With the help of his inner circle, he slowly isolated his victims, set rules and exacted punishment.\"\nShe continued: \"It is time to hold the defendant responsible for the pain he inflicted on each of his victims. It is now time for the defendant to pay for his crimes. Convict him.\"\nNine women and two men have appeared in court, saying R. Kelly sexually abused them.\nThe defence lawyer said R. Kelly was living a \"playboy life\" because his record label painted him as a sex symbol. \"Where's the crime in that?\" said Mr Cannick, dismissing alleged victims as groupies. \n\"You heard about a man who treated these women like gold,\" Mr Cannick added. \"He bought them bags more expensive than cars.\"\nHe invoked King's \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\" speech: \"Somewhere I read of the freedom of assembly. Somewhere I read of the freedom of speech. Somewhere I read of the freedom of the press.\" \nKing upheld the Constitution to try to make the government \"be true to what's on paper\", he said, adding: \"That's all Robert is trying to do.\"\nOn Wednesday, R. Kelly declined to testify in his own defence. \nCourt reporters said he was shaking his head during the prosecution's final arguments.\nThe jury is expected to retire to consider its verdict later on Thursday.\nIf convicted, R. Kelly faces up to 15 years in prison."

Only once the EC has agreed these amendments, will the directive be enacted.\nThe EC hopes that will happen in 2022 - after which member states usually have two years to enact the rules into national law, and manufacturers will have 24 months to change their charging ports.\n\"We gave industry plenty of time to come up with their own solutions, now time is ripe for legislative action for a common charger. This is an important win for our consumers and environment and in line with our green and digital ambitions,\" Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager said."

We'll have another update for you this evening.\nPeople are being evicted from their homes following rent arrears built up during the pandemic, despite the government saying no one should lose their home as a result of the crisis. A third of county court hearings about evictions in England and Wales over the summer were coronavirus-related, according to an investigation. Marshall Kinder-Maiss, 20, his partner Joanne and their baby son Roman face this situation after a ban on bailiff evictions ended earlier this year. They've been advised going to court would be pointless. The government says as the economy is re-opening, it's delivering a fairer and more effective private rental sector.\nUS drug regulators have approved Pfizer booster vaccines for people over 65, those who are vulnerable and anyone in front-line jobs. They can only have it if they have had the last jab six months ago. The move still needs to be approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention but reports suggest it will be given the go-ahead quickly. Approval would mean President Joe Biden will deliver on his promise that booster vaccines would be available from this month.\nThere's a group of people - about five million or so - who are worrying scientists and politicians. They are the ones who've been invited to have the Covid vaccine but haven't yet had the first dose. One 34-year-old says she thought she had built up the courage to do it a few times \"but then I saw something on social media which scared me and I couldn't\". So how can you persuade those people to have the jab? Health correspondent Anna Collinson has taken a look.\nGemma had coronavirus and recovered but when she went for a patch test with the same hair dye she'd been using for years she suffered a reaction. Her case isn't unique. Hairdressers across the UK are reporting some clients having new allergic reactions to hair dye after contracting the virus. Scientists are looking at whether there's a link. Watch to find out more.\nIf you're sniffly, feeling under the weather or ill and you've ruled out coronavirus it probably means you have a cold. \"We are mixing in a way that we haven't been mixing over the past 18 months,\" says Dr Philippa Kaye, a London-based GP. She says there has been a rise in the number of coughs and colds and viral infections because coronavirus restrictions have eased.

      "text": "World temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life.\nLeft unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species. \nWe face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.\nClimate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.\nThe rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. \nWhen these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.\nThe world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.\nTemperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100. \nHowever, unless further action is taken, the planet could still warm by more than 2C by the end of this century. A report in 2021 by the Climate Action Tracker group calculated that the world was heading for 2.4C of warming by the end of the century.\nIf nothing is done, scientists think global warming could exceed 4C in the future, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels and irreversible loss of plant and animal species. \nExtreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods. \nWith further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as farmland turns into desert. In other regions, the opposite is happening, with extreme rainfall causing historic flooding - as seen recently in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nPeople in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse.\nOur oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already lost half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change.\nWildfires are becoming more frequent as climate change increases the risk of hot, dry weather. \nAnd as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change.\nIn a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.\nScientists believe at least 550 species could be lost this century if action is not taken. \nClimate change has different effects in different areas of the world. Some places will warm more than others, some will receive more rainfall and others will face more droughts. \nIf temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:\nCountries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C. \nThe UK is hosting a summit for world leaders, called COP26, in November, where countries will set out their carbon reduction plans for 2030. \nMany countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.\nExperts agree that this is achievable, but it will require governments, businesses and individuals to make big changes.\nMajor changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives can limit our impact on the climate:\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nTop image from Getty Images.

      "tags": "Television",
      "text": "Matthew Strachan, the composer who co-wrote the theme music for Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?, has died at the age of 50.\nHe wrote the quiz show's theme and dramatic incidental music with his father Keith.\nIt became well-known around the world thanks to the programme's many international versions.\nStrachan also composed for The National Lottery and EastEnders, and created a series of fake 1970s porn soundtracks.\n\"Matthew was loved by his family and he will be sadly missed,\" Keith Strachan told the BBC.\n\"He was a warm, funny and talented human being.\"\nThe father-and-son team wrote a total of 95 pieces of music for the show over eight days in 1998.\nThey went on to win them the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers' award for the the most-broadcast piece of music on US TV for 10 years in a row, earning them a place in the organisation's hall of fame.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio London in 2014, Strachan recalled the \"unusual circumstances\" in which he was called in to write the iconic score.\nHe said: \"... A non-broadcast pilot had been made of the show and it was very unsuccessful, it just didn't work.\n\"The executive producer of the show pulled into a lay-by one morning and called the entire creative team and said 'we're going to have to throw the entire thing out and start again from scratch because if we don't ITV are just going to turn their back on this'\".\nStrachan said he and his father were called into a meeting, and after watching the show and talking to the director, it was \"eventually decided that there needed to be 95 pieces of music... to cover every eventuality of what happens in the show\".\nHe added: \"There's a piece of music for every event, there's a piece of music for when the lights go down, then there's an underscore for the questions\u2026[it's] the idea that it should be quite subliminal.\n\"And then we came up with the bright idea - which made a rod for our own backs - of putting up the music a semi-tone every time there was a new question, to sort of raise the stakes a bit - but that increased our workload... we were working 24 hours a day to get this thing done.\"\nReflecting on why the programme was a \"particularly good piece of television\", he said: \"The format is great, it's very simple, it's very intimate and there's inherent tension in the thing which is why I think all that lighting and the music works for it.\"\nCleverly, the father and son recorded every piece of music in multiple keys - so that every time a new question was posed, the music would move up a semi-tone, subconsciously raising the stakes.\nStrachan's other works included the music for BBC Radio 4's Home Front and for some of Jasper Carrott's BBC comedy shows, including police spoof The Detectives.\nHe also created the alter-ego Klaus Harmony, \"the Mozart of Porn\", who released several albums of \"erotic masterpieces\" that had supposedly soundtracked cheap 1970s exploitation films.\nWith song titles like Cream The Oink, Kosmik Ladywave, Rempenmeister and Jesus, You Really Do Mean Diamonds, Don't You, the albums gained a cult following.\n\"He could have done anything [after Millionaire] but he did that,\" wrote his friend and fellow composer Daniel Pemberton on Twitter. \"Matthew made records called things like Wundercrotchen and Funky Sexy Shop. That's what he wanted from life. \n\"I loved it. It says a lot about being a composer that money is rarely the goal - deep down, all most of us really want to do is just make music.\"\nWriter Dirk Maggs also paid tribute, remembering Strachan on Twitter as a \"dear friend and massive talent\" who had been \"gentle, kind, talented and wickedly funny\".\nComposer Kevin Sargent added that Strachan had been \"a talented, clever, funny man whose most famous work redefined the genre of the TV game show\".\nAccording to his company biography, Strachan also wrote scores for musicals and penned two mystery novels with wife Bernadette under the pseudonym MB Vincent.\nEarlier this year he was charged with arson after setting fire to his home.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Meat,Stockton-on-Tees,Food industry,Soft drinks,CO\u2082 shortage",
      "text": "The British food industry will be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with a US company to restart production in the UK.\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from \u00a3200 per tonne to \u00a31,000.\nThe government has agreed to pay out tens of millions of pounds to CF Industries to reopen a plant in the UK. \nThe closure had raised fears over food supplies and the nuclear industry.\nUS-owned CF Industries recently shut two UK sites that produce 60% of the country's commercial carbon dioxide supplies, because of a sharp rise in gas prices.\nFarms, food producers and supermarkets have warned that a shortage of carbon dioxide will lead to significant disruption to the manufacture and supply of fresh produce. \nThe Times also reported that ministers were concerned that the UK might have to close its six advanced gas-cooled nuclear reactors, which also use CO2. \nThe government announced late on Tuesday night that it would meet the full operating costs to run CF Industries' Billingham plant in Teesside for three weeks. The costs are expected to be in the \"low tens of millions\" and will be below \u00a350m.\nMr Eustice said that the deal with CF Industries \"will be not a loan, it will be a payment to underwrite some of their fixed costs\".\nAt the end of the three-week period, it is hoped that the price of carbon dioxide will have risen sufficiently to make it economically viable for CF Industries to keep production running. \nMr Eustice said the food industry would have to accept \"a big, sharp rise\" carbon dioxide prices from \u00a3200 to \u00a31,000 a tonne.\n\"The critical thing was to get the production up and running expeditiously. That's why we've needed this government intervention,\" he said.\n\"But we've had meetings with the food industry. They all recognise that the price of carbon dioxide is going to increase substantially and when that price increases, then the market signal will be then for these plants to continue producing.\"\nMr Eustice insisted that the rise in cost would not have a \"significant impact\" on food prices. \nHe said that while food prices were increasing \"due to global commodity prices, oil prices and also other factors such as labour shortages\", carbon dioxide was \"a tiny proportion\" of the industry's overall costs. \nCF Industries had halted two of its fertiliser factories - which produce carbon dioxide as a by-product - because of gas prices.\nCF Industries' Billingham plant will need up to three days to start producing new CO2. \nThe company told the BBC it had \"no estimate\" on when its second UK plant at Ince in Cheshire would  resume production. \nThe British Meat Processors Association said the deal to open CF Industries' Teesside plant was a \"huge relief\" and said it was now \"focused on re-establishing supplies before Friday this week, which is when around 25% of pork production was in danger of shutting down\".\nAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, welcomed the decision, but said the timetable to restart CF Industries' factory and begin producing carbon dioxide \"will still be tight\".\nHe told the BBC's Today programme: \"Our understanding is that provided that carbon dioxide starts to get through to food producers by the end of the week, then we can avert major and significant disruption in our stores.\"\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the \"exceptional short-term arrangement\" would ensure industries that rely on a stable supply of CO2 \"have the resources they require to avoid disruption\".\nHe said: \"With regards to the CO2 situation, it was abundant, it was very cheap and I think a lot of people were surprised at what happened.\" \nThe government intends to publish the letter from Mr Kwarteng to Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, which sets out the terms of the taxpayer support.\nCommenting on the three-week deal, Mr Kwarteng said: \"In a critical intervention you have to have a way of exiting the arrangement.\n\"It is not a case of just trying to nationalise it or supporting it indefinitely, and that is why in the critical period we needed to have a short term arrangement I am confident that we can get other sources of CO2 in that period. \nMr Eustice said that the shortage of carbon dioxide had been caused by a \"perfect storm\" of circumstances where CF Industries had shut its two plants because \"an increase in gas price means they are not profitable\", while two other providers had closed their sites for maintenance.\nBut the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said the current difficulties showed how exposed the UK is, because of its reliance on such a small number of carbon dioxide producers. \n\"Over many years, we have had a major consolidation of the industry resulting in sectors like food and drink, nuclear and health being reliant on a very small number of very large suppliers,\" the BMPA said.\n\"If a market-based solution is to be found, it will likely involve longer-term higher prices for CO2, which will be sustainable for some, but not all users of the gas.\"\nIan Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, also called on the government to support other fertiliser producers and help food producers to look for alternatives to CO2.\nMr Will, who flew from the US to the UK on Sunday to meet Mr Kwarteng, said: \"We look forward to working with Secretary Kwarteng and the UK government on developing a longer-term solution, including the development of alternative suppliers of CO2 for the UK market.\"\nThe BBC understands that the deal with CF Industries has been drafted so that other companies who stop production because of high commodity prices will not be able to ask the government for similar help. \nNorwegian firm Yara has also cut production at a number of European factories, including one in Hull.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson urged people not to worry about putting food on the table this winter, amid rising energy and food bills and a cut to universal credit.\nWholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January, with a 70% rise since August alone, leading to calls for support from the industry and the collapse of some smaller energy firms.\nMr Opie added that the government should also take action on other issues affecting food retailers in recent weeks, such as the shortage of HGV drivers, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and many drivers returning to the European Union after Brexit.\nThe government has been keen to stress that this is very much an emergency measure, time-limited, and with a cap on the amount it is prepared to pay. \nIt had to do something. Food producers were warning that shortages would become apparent within days, at a time when supply chains have already been disrupted by other issues, such as a lack of lorry drivers. \nBut the fact remains that it has agreed to give a large US-owned company tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, just to operate one of its own plants. That isn't a particularly good look - and it has cast a glaring spotlight on the vulnerability of a key part of the economy. \nNow there is a three-week window for government, supermarkets and food producers to come up with a \"sustainable market-based solution\". In practice, that's likely to mean users paying more for their CO2, a cost which will ultimately be borne by consumers. "

      "text": "Householders in the UK will find out in the next few weeks how much their gas bills are likely to increase in the coming year.\nThe energy regulator is due to announce the new energy price cap - the maximum amount that suppliers can charge in Great Britain.\nIt's expected to rise steeply, because global wholesale prices have gone up so much.\nEvery six months, Ofgem, the energy regulator, reviews the maximum price that suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThis is called the energy price cap. \nAbout 15 million households saw their energy bills increase by 12% when it was last updated in October. \nThe next review is due at the beginning of February, and the new cap will come into effect in April. Industry predictions suggest gas prices could go up by as much as 50%.\nThere is a separate energy market in Northern Ireland, with two gas suppliers, and prices have risen sharply for consumers there too.\nThere's been a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies over the past year.\nAs a result, wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. At the end of December, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about \u00a32,000 next year.\nReasons for the increase include:\nThere are a number of technical and geopolitical issues at play as well, which mean many countries across Europe are grappling with the same problems.\nHowever, the UK is hit relatively hard-hit because it is one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas. Around 85% of homes have gas central heating, and it also generates a third of the country's electricity. \nStorage capacity in the UK is also lower than in some other European countries.\nSince wholesale gas prices started to spike, more than 20 retail energy suppliers have collapsed in the UK. \nThis is largely because the energy price cap prevented retailers from passing on higher wholesale prices to their customers.\nSeveral smaller companies, with fewer reserves, could not weather this.\nFailed firms include Bulb Energy, with 1.7 million customers. Because of its size, it was put into \"special administration\", and is now run by the government, through Ofgem.\nNearly four million customers have been affected. Many households saw their energy prices rise when their supplier went bust, and they were switched over to a more expensive deal with another supplier.\nThe government faces calls from energy companies, the opposition, and even some of its own MPs, to do more to prevent prices from rising too much.\nSuggestions include:\nIn the past, consumers have been encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise.\nBut at the moment better offers - including fixed deals - are simply not available.\nPeople already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, householders are being encouraged to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.\nThe Energy Saving Trust says that simple changes to our homes and habits could offset the current price rises.\nMany companies face a considerable rise in their bills. That could mean they have to: \nEnergy-intensive industries are particularly exposed, but the problem affects every company that has to pay energy bills - even if it is just to heat an office or shop."

      "tags": "Social media,Viral posts,NFTs,United States,Utah",
      "text": "A young girl who became an internet sensation when a photo of her went viral is now selling an NFT for thousands of dollars at auction.\nNFTs are unique digital tokens which are often attributed to art that has no physical representation.\nChloe Clem, now 10, became famous in 2013 when her mother shared her unimpressed reaction to a surprise Disneyland trip online.\nThe image has become a popular meme for expressing concern.\nAn NFT provides a digital certificate of ownership for the piece, but bears no copyright. Therefore the winner of the auction will own the digital token representing the meme, but not the meme itself.\nNFTs are usually bought in cryptocurrencies, so the transaction is recorded on a publicly available ledger called the blockchain.\nThe digital artworks have come under fire recently due to environmental concerns, as vast amounts of energy are required to mine cryptocurrencies, process transactions and maintain the blockchain.\nIn September 2013, Chloe's mother Katie uploaded a video featuring her two daughters reacting to the Disneyland surprise.\nOne of the girls, Lily, started crying, she said, \"but then the camera panned over and Chloe made her cute little buck-toothed side-eye face and the internet did the rest.\"\nThe video has been watched more than 20 million times, while the image of Chloe's reaction became an internet sensation.\n\"I opened up Tumblr and there were just pages and pages of Chloe's face,\" her mother told the BBC. \n\"It was very weird, very overwhelming. I had my family, friends sending me these memes - till this day they still send me the memes of Chloe they see on the internet.\"\nWithin weeks, a Buzzfeed article had declared Chloe \"the patron saint of Tumblr\" and \"the queen and goddess of the internet\". \nNow the Utah family has decided to auction off the image as an NFT. Bids start at 5 Ethereum - a form of cryptocurrency worth roughly $15,000 (\u00a311,000).\nMs Clem said that after learning about the NFT market, selling the meme was a \"no brainer\".\n\"It's a cool opportunity, especially if there's a Chloe fan out there who loves this meme they'll be able to own it. Even Chloe has said 'that's pretty cool' - it's a typical 10-year-old thing to say.\"\nThe market for ownership rights to digital art has boomed recently after several multi-million-dollar NFT sales.\nIn March, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey sold his first ever tweet for the equivalent of $2.9m to a Malaysia-based businessman.\nAnd in April, the woman featured in the so-called Disaster Girl meme sold it for $500,000. Weeks later, another image called the Overly Attached Girlfriend meme sold for $411,000.\nIn August, however, a fan of British graffiti artist Banksy was tricked into buying a fake NFT by a hacker, off the artist's website. Luckily for him, the hacker returned most of what he paid - more than $336,000.\nMs Clem says she would like to use any money made from the sale to help pay for her daughters' education.\n\"Chloe is like, 'I'd like to buy a horse, I'd like to build a Walt Disney World,' but I'd just like to put her through college,\" she says.\nChloe has amassed over 500,000 followers on Instagram, and has even featured in a Google advert in Brazil. \n\"We've been able to travel to Brazil and do all these amazing things,\" Ms Clem says. \"[But] at the end of the day I'm just a stay at home mom with my girls.\""

      "tags": "Keir Starmer,Labour Party",
      "text": "Sir Keir Starmer has published an 11,500 word essay on what he stands for and how he wants to change the UK, ahead of his party's conference.\nThe Labour leader says the country is at a crossroads after the pandemic and is \"crying out for change\".\nIf elected prime minister, he says he would create \"a society built on everyone's contribution\".  \nSir Keir has faced criticism from some in Labour that he lacks vision and voters don't know what his values are.\nHe is due to deliver his first in-person conference speech to party members since becoming leader last year, in Brighton next week.\nIn his essay The Road Ahead, published by the Fabian Society think tank, he sketches out many of the themes that are likely to feature in his speech, saying he wants Labour to be \"Britain's bricks and mortar\".\n\"People want to emerge from lockdown into something better,\" writes the Labour leader.\n\"They want to see a contribution society: one where people who work hard and play by the rules can expect to get something back.\n\"Where you can expect fair pay for fair work, where we capture the spirit that saw us through the worst ravages of the pandemic and celebrate the idea of community and society; where we understand that we are stronger together.\"\nSpeaking about his own background, as the son of parents who \"worked with their hands\" who was able to go to university and reach the top of the legal profession, Sir Keir writes: \"There are two fundamental things we need to fix in this country: insecurity and inequality of opportunity.\n\"Does a working-class child in Britain today have the same opportunities my generation did? It is hard to think they do.\"\nSir Keir's essay has multiple objectives.\nHe wants to silence critics who accuse him of lacking vision or direction, to create dividing lines with his political opponents - and to suggest that his values are in touch with those of the majority of voters.\nHe sets out 10 \"simple key principles\" for a future Labour government, which would \"always put hard-working families and their priorities first\".\nThe pamphlet is peppered with the phrase \"security and opportunity\".\nThis is, in part, to convince voters that a future Labour government would tackle the insecurity many people feel at work.\nBut it is also designed to play to his perceived strengths and his life story.\nLabour's target voters are unlikely to devour the entire tract.\nBut the forthcoming conference will provide Sir Keir with both the opportunity - and the challenge - of distilling his message.\nIn the pamphlet, Sir Keir attacks Prime Minister Boris Johnson as \"utterly unserious and completely unprepared for the great challenges of our time\".\nAnd he accuses both the Conservatives and the SNP of being in thrall to nationalism.\nBy contrast, he argues, Labour should be \"proudly patriotic\" but \"reject the divisiveness of nationalism\".\nHe repeats his call for the party to embrace the achievements of the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown governments - but says Labour has to change to stand a chance of returning to power. \n\"The Labour Party at its best does not wait around for the public to decide we are right. Instead, it adapts and updates. It does not look backwards - it marches forwards,\" he writes.\nConservative party co-chairman Oliver Dowden said: \"If this is Starmer's 'big vision' then he should have gone to Specsavers. \n\"Labour are talking to themselves about themselves. They're all essays and no action.\"\nSpeaking to ITV's Robert Peston, former Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the document \"looks like the sermon on the mount written by a focus group\".\n\"I can't see anything in this document that is going to inspire,\" he added.\nLabour MP Liam Byrne - who failed to unseat Conservative Andy Street as West Midlands mayor in May's elections - has set out his own plan to return his party to power.\nIn an article for Prospect magazine, the former minister says Sir Keir needs to target Tory voters with \"an evocative tale of how we build our future with pride in our past, fed by roots in industry and community\"."

      "text": "Parents forced to give up their babies for adoption in the 1950s, 60s and 70s are being asked to come forward to give evidence to a new investigation. \nThe Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights is to hold an inquiry into the forced adoption of babies of unmarried mothers during those years.\nCommittee chair Harriet Harman says it is a matter that affects the human rights of thousands of women. \nOne mother said she was told: \"You won't be seeing this baby again.\"\nThe affected mothers said they were made to hand over their babies by doctors, nurses, social workers and churches. \nThe Scottish government is also examining the issue of forced adoptions after reports by the the BBC. Birth mothers have held a series of meetings with Scottish government officials to discuss the issue.\nNews of the inquiry comes after the BBC reported on the issue earlier this year. In the five months since, dozens of other birth mothers, birth fathers and their children have come forward to tell their stories.\nYvonne Labrum was 19 when she became pregnant with Andrew Conant's baby in 1974. He was 18 and had just left the Navy. The couple were in a relationship.\nYvonne says her father was extremely angry and banned Andrew from seeing her.\nBut she says the worst moment came when she'd given birth and she had to deal with maternity hospital staff and a social worker appointed to her case.\n\"It all had to be kept hush-hush,\" says Yvonne. \"You're not married, therefore you're not keeping the baby. Which really hurt me. \n\"I was treated with contempt. They took my baby from me and wouldn't let me hold her.\"\nShe had given birth to a daughter, later named Liz Harvie. \n\"I needed stitches after my delivery, but I was left alone in a room for two hours without stitches,\" she says. \"I was like a slab of meat on a table.\"  \nAndrew, meanwhile, was refused entry to the hospital and it was decades before he met his own daughter. \nYvonne says a few days after the birth, a social worker put pressure on her to sign an adoption consent form, but then tricked her when it was time to hand the baby over.\n\"She (the social worker) asked to hold my baby and said she would hand her back. But she didn't. She just said 'you won't be seeing this baby again' and walked out,\" says Yvonne. \nIt would be another 29 years before Yvonne and Andrew would be reunited with Liz.\nAndrew says: \"It hurt not seeing my baby daughter. I've had other children and they have all missed out on having a relationship with Liz.\"\nLiz was told she was adopted and had a happy upbringing - but she was always anxious to trace her birth parents and try to understand why they had given her up. \n\"I was confused and angry, yes, that I had been put up for adoption,\" she says. \"I felt abandoned.\"\nIt was Liz who instigated the search for Yvonne and Andrew, bringing them together for a reunion.\nThey have all now given their backing to a campaign seeking to get an official apology for forced adoption. \nLiz says while this \"wouldn't take away the pain, it would certainly help\". \nIt's not known how many babies were taken from their birth parents in this way.\nAround 500,000 babies were adopted in England and Wales between 1945 and 1975, according to the Office for National Statistics. \nAcademics have suggested that the majority of these babies would have been born to unmarried parents, given the taboo of getting pregnant outside of wedlock that existed at the time.\nDozens of other unmarried birth mothers who were involved in forced adoptions have told the BBC what they went through.\nOne said a midwife refused her pain relief during birth and called her \"wicked\" for getting pregnant. \nAnother said she was left alone on a hospital bed for four hours unable to reach her screaming baby. And one woman claimed her social worker used coercion to get her to sign an adoption consent form.\nThe UK government says it accepts that forced adoptions did take place, but that the blame lies with society and its attitudes at the time. It adds that adoption services are much better now.\nLabour MP Harriet Harman says her committee is calling for birth mothers, birth fathers and their children to come forward with a view to giving evidence, either written or in person. \nShe says this is a matter that affects the human rights of thousands of women and that the committee wants to hear as wide a range of evidence as possible."

      "text": "Ex-Labour MP Keith Vaz should be ashamed of his behaviour towards a House of Commons staff member, a report on his conduct has said.\nMr Vaz's \"sustained and unpleasant bullying\" of Jenny McCullough had an \"enduring psychological impact\" on her, a panel of independent experts says.\nThe panel says Mr Vaz - who stood down as an MP in 2019 - should never be given a Parliamentary pass again.\nHe has rejected the ruling and says he is considering legal action.\nMs McCullough says she was subjected to verbal abuse and attempts to undermine her position, when she worked as a clerk for the Home Affairs Committee, chaired at the time by Mr Vaz.\nThe former minister likened her to prostitutes, told her she could not do her job effectively because she was \"not a mother\", and threatened to take photographs of her drinking alcohol to show to her boss, according to the report.\nParliament's standards commissioner has already rebuked Mr Vaz, with the independent panel - set up last year to rule on allegations about MPs' behaviour - being brought in to decide on sanctions.\nThe panel's chair, Sir Stephen Irwin, said Mr Vaz's bullying \"was hostile, sustained, harmful and unworthy of a Member of Parliament\", adding \"he should be ashamed of his behaviour\".\nOn a trip to Russia in 2008, the report said Mr Vaz insisted on taking a member of his own staff against advice and told Ms McCullough this was because she was \"not competent\".\nMr Vaz then threatened to take photos of her drinking alcohol and show them to her manager.\nThe report said there was evidence the photos were taken and \"the implication of the threat was that she was liable to drink to excess so as to affect her performance\".\nThe panel found \"there was no substance to this\" and deemed it a \"psychological threat\".\nOn the same trip, Mr Vaz accused her of not being able to do her job effectively because she \"wasn't a mother\" and forced her to reveal her age in order to undermine her performance.\nMs McCullough moved to a different team following the trip. Mr Vaz then told her after a meeting with some prostitutes, that they had \"reminded him of\" her.\nThe panel said that if the former Leicester East MP had currently held a Commons pass \"it would have been appropriate to remove it\" and his eligibility for one \"should never be restored\".\nFormer MPs are entitled to passes to the Parliamentary estate - but Mr Vaz had his taken off him after a separate breach of the Commons code of conduct.\nThe panel also rejected claims from Mr Vaz's medical adviser that he was too ill to participate in its inquiry, after reviewing \"publicly available material demonstrating his ongoing public media and political activity\".\nMr Vaz's office said: \"He has never seen the report, nor has he had the chance to question any witnesses or provide a response.\"\nThe statement rejected the panel's claim that Mr Vaz had refused to cooperate with them, saying the former MP had been told he was no longer required to take part and an interview that had been due to take place at his home was cancelled.\n\"The Parliamentary Commissioner, Kathryn Stone, gave the complainant the right of appeal but failed to offer Mr Vaz the same right which is a fundamental breach of the process leaving the decision open to judicial review,\" the statement continued.\n\"This is a deeply fractured process which has cost the taxpayer thousands of pounds. The total overall cost now stands at \u00a31m.\"\nThe statement said Parliament's complaints and grievance process was \"riddled with flaws\", adding: \"As a direct result of the protracted and debilitating process, Mr Vaz was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy for which he was hospitalised and for which he is still undergoing treatment. This matter is now in the hands of solicitors.\""

      "text": "A climate summit of world leaders in 40 days' time will be the \"turning point for humanity\", PM Boris Johnson has said in a speech to the United Nations.\nHe warned that global temperature rises were already inevitable, but called on his fellow leaders to commit to major changes to curb further warming.\nFour areas needed tackling - \"coal, cars, cash and trees\", he said.\nCountries must take responsibility for \"the destruction we are inflicting, not just upon our planet but ourselves\".\n\"It's time for humanity to grow up,\" he added ahead of the UK hosting the COP26 summit in Glasgow.\nThe prime minister also said it was time to listen to the warnings of scientists. \"Look at Covid if you want an example of gloomy scientists being proved right.\"\nSetting the tone for November's meeting, he said countries must make \"substantial changes\" by the end of the decade if the world is to stave off further temperature rises.\n\"I passionately believe that we can do it by making commitments in four areas - coal, cars, cash and trees,\" he said.\nMr Johnson praised China's President Xi Jinping for his recent pledge to stop building new coal-fire energy plants abroad.\nBut he called on the country - which produces 28% of global greenhouse gas emissions - to go further and end its domestic use of coal, saying the UK was proof that it could be done.\nThe UK used coal to generate 25% of its electricity five years ago - but that is now down to 2%. Mr Johnson said it would be \"gone altogether\" by 2024.\nBut Labour's shadow energy secretary Ed Miliband accused the UK government of \"facing both ways\" on climate change, urging other nations to take action while it considered plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria and cut money for improving home insulation.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's World at One that a UK trade deal had also allowed Australia to renege on their climate commitments.\n\"It undermines our moral standing as the host. I want the prime minister to succeed, but I'm afraid he's left it very late and he's not handled this presidency well,\" he said.\nIn his speech, the prime minister also said he did not see a conflict between the green movement and capitalism, saying: \"The whole experience of the Covid pandemic is that the way to fix the problem is through science and innovation, the breakthroughs and the investment that are made possible by capitalism and by free markets.\"\n\"We have the tools for a green industrial revolution but time is desperately short,\" he added.\nElsewhere, the prime minister made a series of calls for action to his fellow leaders, including:\nAmid the serious warnings, Mr Johnson also attempted to strike a humorous note at points, including saying Kermit the Frog had been wrong when he sang It's Not Easy Bein' Green.\nThe prime minister reiterated that the world must curb the rise in global average temperatures to 1.5C - the stricter of the two targets set by the UN in the 2015 Paris agreement.\nHowever, the world is already 1C hotter compared with pre-industrial levels.\n\"If we keep on the current track then the temperatures will go up by 2.7 degrees or more by the end of the century,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\"And never mind what that will do to the ice floes... we will see desertification, drought, crop failure, and mass movements of humanity on a scale not seen before, not because of some unforeseen natural event or disaster but because of us, because of what we are doing now.\n\"And our grandchildren will know that we are the culprits and... that we were warned and they will know that it was this generation that came centre stage to speak and act on behalf of posterity and that we missed our cue and they will ask themselves what kind of people we were to be so selfish and so short sighted.\"\nBoris Johnson is fashioning himself as a leader on climate change.\nHe has set a benchmark by phasing out sales of most new conventional vehicles by 2030. \nThe international alliance he's formed to get rid of coal power is gathering support - though not yet enough.\nAnd by setting aggressive targets to cut carbon emissions overall (78% by 2035) he is encouraging others to follow.\nYet, in his own backyard, the prime minister is stumbling.\nHe previously pledged \"never to be lagging on lagging\". But his plan for insulating homes is badly delayed - along with other vital initiatives on issues including aviation, farming and financing the low carbon revolution.\nRecent research showed his government had imposed less than a quarter of the policies needed to clean up the economy.   \nAnd some policies - like not opposing a coal mine in Cumbria,cutting taxes on flying and building HS2 - will send emissions up when they are supposed to be going down.\nAt COP26, leaders from 196 countries will be asked to agree action to limit climate change and its effects, like rising sea levels and extreme weather.\nA recent report from UN scientists warned that global temperatures have risen faster since 1970 than at any point in the past 2,000 years."

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The United States is lifting its decades-old ban on imports of British lamb, Boris Johnson has announced. \nThe PM, who is in the US for talks with UN leaders and President Joe Biden, said the ban was \"unjustified\".\nBut he admitted the UK was now focused on making \"incremental steps\" on US trade access, rather than aiming for a full agreement. \nMr Biden appeared to play down the chances of a wider deal during a meeting with Mr Johnson on Tuesday.\nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said the Biden administration \"is not doing free trade deals around the world right now\".\nBut he added he had \"every confidence that a great deal is there to be done\".\nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner mocked the lack of movement, saying the PM had made \"absolutely zero progress\" on a trade deal during his US trip.\nThe United States has banned British lamb imports since 1989, following the first outbreaks of BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease. \nA similar ban on British beef imports, imposed in 1996, was lifted in September last year. \nThere is no indication yet of when the US will start accepting lamb and lamb products from the UK, and an official announcement has not been made.\nThe US Department for Agriculture has been consulting on lifting the ban since 2016 - and there were originally hopes it would be lifted the following year.\nAt the time, the UK government estimated the change would be worth an extra \u00a335m a year to the UK economy. \nAnalysis by Damian Grammaticas , BBC political correspondent \nWhen it comes to trade, the big deal that's emerged from Boris Johnson's visit to Washington is that there's to be no deal happening any time soon. \nThat's significant, and a setback for Boris Johnson's government. \nIn March 2020, just a few weeks after the UK had left the EU, the then-Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the day marked a \"crucial step in beginning the formal negotiations for a free-trade agreement with our largest bilateral trading partner, the United States.\" \nToday it all looks different. The United States, Boris Johnson told us, is not doing deals. \nSo whilst Ms Truss predicted a \"\u00a33.4 billion lift to the economy\" from a US-UK deal, today we had an \"incremental step\" but a tiny one by comparison - a possible opening for lamb exports. \nA US deal was by far the biggest prize when it came to the promise of post-Brexit trade deals. But under this US administration, it's not happening any time soon.\nMr Johnson said the ban was \"totally unjustified\" and \"discriminating on British farmers and British lamb\".\nThe National Sheep Association industry group welcomed the news, adding it had always seen the US as a \"potentially important market\".\nIts chief executive Phil Stocker cautioned, however, that \"we shouldn't expect to see any sudden surge in volumes going to the US\".\nHe added that Brexit had made it more difficult to sell into the EU - the UK's lamb largest export market - and it was \"important to work on any market that gives us future potential\".\nMr Johnson cited the lifting of the ban as an example of \"practical steps to help our exports\" the UK was taking, pending progress on wider trade talks. \nDowning Street has pointed to the resolution of the Airbus-Boeing trade dispute, as well as the lowering of whisky tariffs and the decision to lift the ban on British beef.\nSecuring a trade deal with the United States has been a priority for many Brexit-backing politicians, following the UK's departure from the EU. \nBut on Tuesday, Mr Biden appeared to downplay the chances of an agreement soon, adding he would discuss the issue \"a little bit\" with Mr Johnson during his trip to the White House. \n\"We're going to have to work that through,\" the US president added. \nThe US is already a significant UK trading partner, accounting for \u00a31 in every \u00a36 of British trade.\nThe BBC understands the government is considering whether to join an existing trade arrangement between the US, Canada and Mexico - known as the USMCA. \nHowever, Downing Street denies this and says it focus remains on a UK-US trade deal.\nIf a USMCA arrangement was pursued, it would limit the UK's ability to sell services. \nEconomists say the overall gains from joining it could be less than 0.1% of the UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - a measurement of the size of the economy."

      "tags": "FBI,Wyoming,Missing people,Florida,United States",
      "text": "The FBI has issued a federal arrest warrant for Gabby Petito's boyfriend for his \"use of unauthorized devices\" following her death.\nThe indictment says Brian Laundrie used a debit card and PIN number for accounts that did not belong to him between 30 August and 1 September.\nMs Petito's body was found on Sunday inside a park the couple had visited.\nMr Laundrie is currently missing. His family say he was last seen on 14 September.\nOfficials are searching for him at a Florida nature reserve. \nThe couple had been travelling for several weeks before 23-year-old Mr Laundrie returned home to Florida alone with their white van on 1 September. He did not contact police or the Petito family on his return.\nMs Petito's family reported her missing 10 days later. On Sunday, the body of the 22-year-old was found in the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. The coroner ruled her death a homicide but gave no indication as to how she died.\nThe indictment issued on Wednesday by the US District Court of Wyoming says Mr Laundrie obtained over $1,000 (\u00a3730) with the debit card transactions.\n\"While this arrest warrant allows law enforcement to arrest Mr Laundrie, the FBI and our partners across the country continue to investigate the facts and circumstances of Ms Petito's homicide,\" FBI Special Agent in Charge Michael Schneider said in a statement.\nMr Laundrie's lawyer, Steve Bertolino, told Fox News that it was his \"understanding that the arrest warrant [was] related to activities occurring after the death of Gabby Petito and not related to her actual demise\".\nMr Laundrie's family reported him missing over the weekend. They claim he left for a hike and never returned. He is considered a \"person of interest\" in the disappearance but had refused to speak with investigators before disappearing.\nThe search for Mr Laundrie has focused on a 24,000-acre nature reserve near his home in North Port, Florida. Police are using dogs, drones, and all-terrain vehicles for the search, which officers say is complicated by difficult, swampy terrain.\nEarlier this week, investigators also searched the Laundrie family home. Agents were seen removing several boxes from the house and towing away a silver Ford Mustang.\nIt is still unclear what happened when Ms Petito went missing. Two weeks earlier, on 12 August, police in the southern Utah town of Moab were called to a possible domestic violence incident involving the couple.\nPolice released bodycam footage which showed Ms Petito crying and complaining about her mental health to officers. She also said the couple had been arguing more frequently.\nThe officers recommended they spend the night apart but did not file any charges.\nMs Petito last video-called her mother on 24 August to say she was leaving Utah and heading to the Teton mountain range in Wyoming, according to Rick Stafford, the family's lawyer."

      "text": "In the run up to this trip Boris Johnson and Joe Biden had already shared a big political and diplomatic moment - a new security pact with Australia to share nuclear submarine propulsion technology.\nThe prime minister confessed to a huddle of hacks on the train from Washington back to New York that they also shared surprise at the level of French outrage when that emerged.\nIn their Oval Office talks it is understood they spoke of their astonishment, and how the tension could be soothed, but neither saw them inviting France to join the pact as a solution.\nWhen asked if he understood why Emmanuel Macron might be hurt, the prime minister seemed to compare leaving France out of the pact to some kind of awkward break up saying, it was \"a very human thing to delay the frank conversation until the last possible moment. I don't know if anyone has been in that situation in their emotional life but it's very human to put it off\".\nThat came on top of Mr Johnson resorting to Franglais to tell the French to \"donnez moi un break\" - give me a break - and relax about the whole thing. The manner of his appeal makes that seem not quite so likely.\nIrrespective of the Gallic outrage, which some on the UK side suggested might perhaps be rather overblown to maximise the chances of compensation, for Downing Street the security deal and the president and the prime minister's talks on that subject are an important achievement.\nAlong with the United States promise of billions extra to help developing countries go green, there are markers of a relationship in good health.\nRemember, on the way to the US Mr Johnson put the chances of achieving his goal of a cheque for $100bn to fight climate change by next month as just \"six out of 10\".\nPresident Biden's announcement this week, was not something No 10 was sure would happen at this stage.\nIt takes the UK a long way to meeting that that total, and officials hope the American vow will unlock other finance from other nations.\nRemember too how, so often on big foreign trips, a slight, or a stumble can send things into a terrible spin - Gordon Brown's attempt to see President Obama which ended awkwardly in a kitchen and Donald Trump grasping Theresa May's hand.\nAnd of course, Mr Johnson himself is not exactly a stranger to a gaffe or a glitch. But as I write, shortly before he and the press pack fly back there hasn't been any major slips or surprises - at least not that we know about yet.\nThe very obvious lack of progress on a big trade deal however is much less comfortable for Downing Street.\nIt does matter that the trade pact Mr Johnson himself used to talk up so enthusiastically is nowhere to be seen.\nIt's not a surprise that the Biden White House isn't keen but it became very plain this week that the chances are faint and far in the future. \nAdditionally there's frustration among some senior Conservatives that suggestions were made that it would be easy to start with. \"I told colleagues ever since 2016 just how difficult a trade deal would be but of course they didn't want to listen,\" one of them said. \nPresident Biden obviously still places huge importance on how the UK seeks to resolve problems with the EU over Northern Ireland. \nBut there's no doubt that No 10 regards these frantic few days as a success.  \nWhen Mr Biden won the White House there were nerves in some quarters that the relationship could be awkward, and the differences profound. \nPresident Biden and Mr Johnson certainly are contrasting political characters. But this week has provided plenty of diplomatic evidence that they can do business when it counts. "

      "text": "Boris Johnson has told the French president to \"donnez-moi un break\" and get over his anger about a new military pact between the UK, US and Australia.\nSpeaking to reporters in Washington, he said it was time for \"some of our dearest friends\" to \"prenez un grip\".\nParis is angry after Australia signed the Aukus pact to build nuclear-powered submarines, pulling out of a major contract with France in the process.\nMr Johnson insisted they were \"not trying to shoulder anybody out\".\nThe Aukus agreement, announced last week, is widely seen as an effort to counter China's influence in the contested South China Sea.\nFrance has expressed anger at the pact, which ends a $37bn (\u00a327bn) deal signed by Australia in 2016 for France to build it 12 conventional submarines.\nSpeaking later on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said he and other leaders had been a \"bit taken aback by the strength of the French reaction\".\n\"We all want to reach out, everyone wants to reach out to Paris and try to sort something out,\" he told reporters on a flight to New York ahead of a speech later at the UN General Assembly. \nThe BBC has been told that the prime minister and US President Joe Biden both expressed \"astonishment\" at France's reaction during their meeting at the White House on Tuesday. \nThe pair discussed how to reassure the French side, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said, but decided not to invite France or any other country to join the pact - but to look at ways of increasing collaboration in the Indo-Pacific region. \nBoth the UK and the US believed, she added, that Australian leader Scott Morrison had warned France ahead of the announcement, but were unsure of the exact manner of those conversations.\nIn the days after the deal was announced, French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described the move as a \"stab in the back\".\nFrance's defence minister then called off talks with her UK counterpart, Ben Wallace, who tried to reassure France saying that there had been no intent to \"upset or drive a wedge between us and France\".\nAnd in a rare step among allies, French President Emmanuel Macron ordered the recall of the French ambassadors to Washington and Canberra.\nHowever, France's ambassador will now return to the US following a call between Mr Macron and US President Joe Biden on Wednesday. \nDuring the call, the two leaders agreed that the situation \"would have benefitted from open consultations among allies on matters of strategic interest to France and our European partners, \" a joint statement said.\nWhite House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the half-hour call was \"friendly\", and Mr Biden hoped it was a step towards \"returning to normal\". \nOn his visit to the US this week, Mr Johnson said the deal was \"fundamentally a great step forward for global security. It's three very like-minded allies standing shoulder to shoulder creating a new partnership for the sharing of technology.\n\"It's not exclusive. It's not trying to shoulder anybody out,\" he added. \nAnalysts have described the Aukus alliance as probably the most significant security arrangement between the three nations since World War Two.\nThe pact will focus on military capability, separating it from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance which also includes New Zealand and Canada.\nWhile Australia's submarines is the big-ticket item, Aukus will also involve the sharing of cyber capabilities and other undersea technologies.\nMr Johnson is understood to have learned French while attending school in Brussels and, during his time as foreign secretary, he was known to venture into French during press conferences.\nHe has deployed the \"donnez-moi un break\" phrase previously on several other issues, including over his 2019 decision to suspend Parliament, and a 2016 warning from a French minister that Brexit could lead to border controls in Calais.

Cash tips, on the other hand, are legally the property of staff.\nAs well as requiring all employers to pass on all tips, service charges and gratuities in full without any deductions, the new legislation will introduce a code of practice, which will set out exactly how tips should be distributed fairly.\nWorkers will also get the right to request information on their boss's tipping record, in case they want to bring a claim to an employment tribunal.\nWhile the move was welcomed by the Living Wage Foundation, it said that the focus should be on improving wages in lower-paid sectors instead.\nIts interim director, Graham Griffiths, said: \"If this work is to be truly valued we need to see more people lifted onto a real Living Wage. \n\"To build a stronger and more dynamic economy, our focus should be on increasing the number of businesses doing the right thing and committing to pay a Living Wage\".\nKate Nicholls, UKHospitality chief executive, added the new rules would strengthen the sector's ability to create jobs.\nBut she pointed out: \"For hospitality businesses, though, customers tipping with a card incurs bank charges for the business, and many also employ external partners to ensure tips are fairly distributed among staff. \n\"With restaurants, pubs and other venues struggling to get back on their feet... we urge the government to continue to work closely with the sector as it introduces this legislation to ensure this works for businesses and employees.\"\nHave you worked somewhere that kept your tips?

Britain's biggest baker Warburtons has confirmed that the company is facing challenges recruiting lorry drivers and that the shortage is causing some disruption to its supply chain. \nThe baker delivers to around 18,500 stores and says it can't deliver to a number of them. \n\"The national driver shortage continues to place a strain on the Warburtons distribution network but we are working incredibly hard to maintain a good level of service for our customers nationwide.\"\nReports in several newspapers have suggested that the government is considering getting soldiers to drive fuel tankers under emergency plans.\nWhen questioned about this on BBC Breakfast, Mr Shapps said: \"If it can actually help, we will bring them in.\"\nHowever, he said there would be \"technicalities\" as to whether military personnel could switch to driving civilian vehicles.\nThe AA said that most of the UK's forecourts were working as they should.\n\"There is no shortage of fuel and thousands of forecourts are operating normally with just a few suffering temporary supply chain problems,\" said AA president Edmund King.\n\"Fridays and the weekend always tend to be busier on forecourts, as drivers either combine filling up with shopping runs, prepare for weekend trips or refuel for the start of the new working week.\"\nMr King said drivers should not fill up outside their normal routines, because even if the occasional petrol station was temporarily closed, others just down the road would be open.\n\"It is now clear that there have been occasional delays over recent weeks that have been managed with hardly anyone noticing. This was a manageable problem.\"\nThere are about 8,380 petrol stations in the UK, according to the Petrol Retailers Association. Of these, about 1% are believed to be closed at the moment.\nIt is understood that about 50 to 100 BP forecourts are affected by shortages, while Esso said \"a small number\" of its Tesco Alliance retail sites had been hit.\nHelena Wright, transport manager for Norfolk-based firm W's Transport, told the BBC her company had sold two lorries after advertising for HGV drivers and not getting a single applicant.\n\"Normally we would have people on record to call who had left their details,\" she said. \"This is the first time for our firm that that's happened, but it's a problem that has been a long time coming.\n\"I've got a lot of drivers that are over the age of 50, 55 and looking to retire and we are not attractive as an industry for the younger generation.\"\nShe said younger people were not prepared to spend four to five nights a week away from home and were not ready to put up with \"inhumane\" conditions.\nThe Road Haulage Association (RHA) has urged the government to relax visa restrictions for foreign workers in the short term to ease the driver shortage.\nBut Mr Shapps told the BBC he did not want UK lorry drivers to \"drop out\" because of being \"undercut\" by cheaper EU labour.\nHe said there were \"systemic problems\" in the haulage industry that needed to be resolved, pointing out that the profession was \"99% white male\" with an average age of 55, facing poor conditions and wages.\nNow, he said, pay was rising and there was \"a gradual increase\" in new drivers.\nWhile the UK does not lack petrol and diesel at refineries, getting it to forecourts has been difficult in some areas.\nIt is the latest problem caused by driver shortages, which have already led to supply squeezes in other industries, including supermarkets.\nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: \"The supply issues affecting a small number of petrol forecourts shouldn't impact the prices drivers pay to fill up. \n\"But unfortunately the price of oil, which has the biggest influence on what drivers pay at the pumps, is continuing to rise at the moment. \n\"This may lead to fuel prices going up in the coming days, which would be yet more bad news for drivers, as a litre of unleaded is already over 21p a litre more expensive than a year ago.\"\nThe RHA's Rod McKenzie told BBC Breakfast more lorry drivers were leaving the profession each week than joining it.\nHe said: \"It's as simple as this: everything we get in Britain comes on the back of a truck. \n\"So if there is a shortage of HGV drivers - and there is by 100,000 - then it is inevitable that we are not going to get all the things we want when we want them.\"\n\"It is not a case of running out - and people should not panic buy,\" he added.\nHe warned there would be glitches \"because the supply chain on which we all depend is creaking\".\nSupermarket Iceland - which is about 100 drivers short - joined Morrisons and Ocado in calling for the government to add HGV drivers to the list of shortage occupations.\nThat would allow foreign workers to apply for skilled worker visas to fill the current gaps.\n\"I think the solution - even if it's temporary - is very, very simple,\" said Iceland managing director Richard Walker. \"Let's get HGV drivers on to the skilled worker list.\"\nThe RHA's Mr McKenzie said that on top of a historic shortage of drivers, the industry had lost 20,000 European drivers because of Brexit, while the pandemic had forced 40,000 driver training tests to be cancelled.\nIn a recent RHA survey of 616 hauliers, retiring colleagues and Brexit topped the list of reasons behind the driver shortages.\nRespondents also cited tax changes to rules known as IR35, which have made it more expensive for hauliers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK.\nBusinesses across the food, fuel and construction sectors have been warning about driver shortages for months.\nBP temporarily closed a number of petrol stations earlier in summer, when driver shortages also caused short-term supply problems for McDonald's, Nandos, and the pub chain Wetherspoons.\nSpeaking on BBC Question Time on Thursday, Mr Shapps suggested visa changes would not solve the problem, but said nothing had been ruled out.\nBut shadow justice secretary David Lammy said visas were needed in various sectors, telling Mr Shapps: \"You promised that immigration would come down and you know that it will need to go up if we are to deal with these problems.\"\nConservative MP Andrew Bridgen said there was \"an endemic problem with retention and recruitment\" in the industry.\n\"We're actually not short of HGV drivers per se - we've got 600,000 people who are qualified to drive those big trucks, but only 300,000 people chose to work in the industry,\" he told the BBC. \nMr Bridgen suggested the industry needed to modernise and improve working conditions to retain young drivers.\nIn recent weeks, the Department for Transport has made it quicker for HGV drivers to get their licences, but the RHA criticised the changes as a risk to road safety."

      "tags": "British Armed Forces,War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,British Army,Ministry of Defence",
      "text": "Compensation payments for hundreds of civilian deaths linked to the British armed forces have been revealed for the first time.\nThe Ministry of Defence paid out \u00a3688,000 for 289 civilian deaths between 2006-14, an average of \u00a32,380.\nBut in one case, a family was paid just \u00a3104.17, less than others received for the deaths of a herd of donkeys.\nThe MoD said compensation was set by legal principles, including past and future losses and local customs.\nAlmost 7,000 compensation claims paid out by the British military during combat operations in Helmand, in Afghanistan, up until 2014 were analysed by the charity Action on Armed Violence (AOAV).\nThe youngest casualty was a three-year-old boy who, according to records, was \"killed by shock\" during a British mine clearance operation. At least 16 children were among the 289 civilian deaths. \nUsing data obtained under Freedom of Information requests, this is the first attempt to scrutinise the impact of British military forces on civilian lives in Afghanistan in this way.\nMurray Jones from AOAV said: \"The fact that a charity has had to scrutinise this data, rather than the British military themselves, is hugely concerning.\"\nCompensation payments for civilians killed varied widely. In February 2008 a family received just \u00a3104.17 for a confirmed fatality and property damage. \nThere is no more detail given, but it is the lowest recorded sum for a civilian death.\nIn contrast, British forces paid out \u00a3110 for a lost mobile phone in Camp Bastion, \u00a3662 for the death of six donkeys after they \"wandered on to a rifle range \", and \u00a3240 for damage caused to a property by an armoured vehicle.\nOther payments linked to civilian deaths include \u00a3586.42 for the death of a 10-year-old boy in December 2009. \nBritish forces also paid out \u00a34,233.60 for four children \"shot and killed by ISAF (International Security Assistance Force)\" in the same month. There is no record of this incident in the English language media.\n\"So few of these deaths were reported on at the time that these casualties could easily be forgotten,\" said Mr Jones.\nOne payment for an incident which did receive media attention was significantly higher. Five Afghan children injured by stray bullets fired from a British army Apache helicopter received \u00a37,204.97. \nOverall, \u00a3397,000 was paid out by the British for 240 injuries - an average of \u00a31,654.\nThe largest single payment awarded was \u00a354,347 for a single fatality in Kabul in 2007. No more details of the incident are recorded.\nThe records show that the majority of claims for compensation were rejected. In total 885 claims of death and 285 claims of injury were denied by the MoD.  \nAOAV said: \"It's likely that the deaths recorded are an underestimation of deaths caused by British forces.\"\nThe US military also paid out more than 1,600 \"condolence payments\" between October 2006 and September 2014 for deaths, injuries and property damage.\nThe payments cost the US nearly $4.9m, according to a report by the Center for Civilians in Conflict.\nThe MoD said the amount of compensation paid is \"determined by legal principles which consider the degree of injury and both past and future losses; settlements also reflect local customs and practice\".\n\"Every civilian death is a tragedy and the UK always seeks to minimise the risk of civilian casualties through our rigorous targeting process, but that risk can never be removed entirely,\" an MoD spokesperson said."

      "text": "The head of Africa's health agency has warned that the UK's policy of not accepting Covid-19 vaccine certificates from the continent could increase vaccine hesitancy.\nDr John Nkengasong said the UK's stance was confusing and had far-reaching implications for vaccination campaigns. \nHe warned that some people would question why they should get a jab if it was not accepted internationally.\nMany Africans are furious, and have called the policy discriminatory.\nThere has also been an outcry in India, which produces most of the AstraZeneca vaccines distributed in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n\"We do not understand why the UK has taken this position\" said Dr Nkengasong, head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).\nHe told a news briefing it was \"a message that creates confusion within our population... creating more reticence, reluctance for people to receive vaccines\".\nHe also questioned why the UK was sending vaccines to Africa but would not recognise those who have had them as being vaccinated. \n\"This message doesn't really speak to solidarity and co-operation that we all believe are the cornerstone and ingredients for us to emerge from this pandemic together,\" he said.\nDr Richard Mihigo, from the World Health Organization's Africa region, said countries should now find a way of coming up with a mutual system that would recognise vaccine certificates from different countries. \nLast week the UK government removed several countries from its so-called \"red list\", from where travellers would need to quarantine if they visited England. \nHowever, it said those who had been vaccinated  in most countries outside the UK, EU and US would still need to quarantine because the UK would not accept the certificates. The other UK nations - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - set their own health policies.\nInitially, the UK refused to recognise the AstraZeneca vaccines produced in India, even though they are exactly the same as those made in Europe. On Wednesday, it said those vaccines were approved but it still does not accept the certificates from most countries.\nThe British High Commission in Kenya says it is working with the government there on a system to recognise each other's vaccine certificates.\nLess than 4% of people in Africa are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, compared to around 54% in the US and 65% in the UK.\nA shortage of vaccines is a problem in most African countries but in some, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Africa, vaccine hesitancy is a major issue and the government is trying to persuade more people to get jabs."

      "tags": "BP,Fuel,Oil & Gas industry,Haulage",
      "text": "BP has warned it has had to \"temporarily\" close some of its petrol stations due to a shortage of lorry drivers.\nThe oil firm said only \"a handful\" of sites were affected by the fuel supply issues, which have led to a lack of unleaded and diesel fuel.\nThere are around 1,200 BP branded petrol stations around the UK, of which 300 are operated by BP themselves.\nThe company said it was working hard to address the issues.\nSupply chain delays had been \"impacted by industry wide driver shortages across the UK\" and that the company was working hard to address the issues, BP said in a statement.\n\"We continue to work with our haulier supplier to minimise disruption and to ensure efficient and effective deliveries,\" the company added.\nOther petrol station operators have been approached by the BBC for comment.\nEsso said that a \"small number\" of its 200 Tesco Alliance retail sites have been affected.\n\"We are working closely with all parties in our distribution network to optimise supplies and minimise any inconvenience to customers. We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience,\" a spokesperson from Esso added. \nHowever, supermarket Morrisons, which operates 338 petrol stations across the UK, said it was not seeing any similar issues at the moment. \nCo-op runs 130 petrol stations in the country, and said it has a \"full complement\" of fuel delivery drivers. \nTesco also said that they have a \"good availability of fuel\" and both Sainsbury's and Asda said there are no current issues in their fuel supplies. \nDowning Street has said people should continue buying fuel as normal.\nA spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was no shortage of fuel in the UK, adding: \"We obviously recognise the challenges faced by the industry and we're taking steps to support them.\"\nHe pointed to changes made by the Department for Transport to make it quicker for HGV drivers to get their licences and said that this is a problem several countries are facing.\nGrant Shapps also told the BBC's Question Time on Thursday that he believed the shortages had also been caused because of working conditions that \"hadn't been pleasant\" and that higher salaries offered to drivers was something the government was \"happy to see\".\nHe also said that improvements in the availability of tests were \"coming in prior to Christmas\u2026 so these are things that will resolve the issues in the lead up to Christmas\".\nThe temporary closures come just months after BP had to close a \"handful\" of its UK sites in July because of lorry driver shortages. At the time, BP said its supply chain issues had also been exacerbated by the closure of a distribution terminal due to staff being told to isolate.\nPaul Cheema has run a petrol station in Coventry since 2013, and says he's never experienced a situation like this before.\n\"We used to be able to put orders in for next day delivery. Now we have to do it a week in advance, but we're ordering blind. We don't know how much fuel we're going to sell in that time. If we'll have enough, or even too much,\" says Paul.\n\"Last week we put in an order for a delivery to arrive today. That was pushed back until tomorrow, and now we've been told it won't arrive until Saturday.\"\n\"So that means we won't have any unleaded petrol to sell tomorrow,\" he said.\nPaul says that fuel delivery delays have been happening all summer, but it's been particularly bad in the last couple of weeks. \n\"We're a petrol station. We should have availability 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I'm not blaming our fuel supplier. It's not their fault. It's the bigger driver shortage problem behind it.\"\nHe sells thousands of litres of unleaded every day, so the cost implications for him are huge.\n\"There could be a 40% impact on sales with this week's delivery problems. If I haven't got any liquid in the ground, I'm not making money. I can't operate the site at a loss.\"\n\"If I haven't got fuel to sell, that customer isn't coming into my petrol station shop either, so I'm losing money there too,\" says Paul.\nThe Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents petrol station operators across the UK, said that some sites across the UK were seeing delivery delays, but that they were largely confined to London and the South East, and were \"temporary by nature\".\nGordon Balmer from the PRA said that petrol station closures were rare, and that the fuel supply chain was resilient enough to cope.\n\"Fuel demand is still only at 92% of pre-pandemic levels so we believe there should be ample stock available at refineries and delivery terminals throughout the UK.\"\nMany businesses have been complaining about the UK's shortage of lorry drivers, which is still causing serious supply chain problems.\nThe coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and tax changes have all contributed to a lack of qualified drivers. Industry bodies estimate there is a shortfall of about 100,000 workers.\nLogistics UK, which represents the haulage industry, said it was \"aware of reports that petrol supplies are currently being affected\" by the lack of drivers.\n\"The driver shortage is a very serious issue that needs urgent government and industry action to resolve, however, we urge people not to panic buy; the logistics industry is resilient and has proven capable of supporting shops, families and businesses during Covid-19, border closures and the first stages of Brexit, and will continue to serve the needs of the nation,\" the industry body said."

      "tags": "A&E,NHS Scotland,Coronavirus pandemic,Humza Yousaf",
      "text": "Scotland's Health Secretary Humza Yousaf says the NHS is facing the \"biggest crisis\" of its existence.\nThere's a shortage of beds, the demand for ambulances is soaring and waits in accident and emergency departments are getting longer.\nOn top of that, Covid-19 admissions have been rising fast as the number of infections in Scotland spiralled at the end of the summer.\nHere are five charts illustrating the enormous pressures currently being felt by NHS Scotland.\nThe efficient operation of the NHS is highly dependent on the ability to move patients out of hospitals once they've been treated.\nIf a treated patient remains in hospital then it can prevent another being admitted - a phenomenon known as \"bed blocking\".\nDelayed discharges dropped at the start of the pandemic as the NHS suspended much of its routine services to focus on Covid-19 patients.\nThe figure began to rise again last summer before reaching a plateau this winter.\nHowever, the number of delayed discharges began to rise sharply in the three months up to July - the most recent month there are figures for - and this trend is likely to have continued over the summer.\nThere are a number of reasons why treated patients might be delayed in hospital.\nIn July there were 42,364 \"delayed bed days\", with two-thirds being for \"health and social care reasons\".\nEarlier this week Prof Michael Griffin, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, said there were real problems getting patients out of hospitals and into social care because of a \"care home workforce crisis\"\nIt's not just care homes that have workforce issues.\nThe NHS was also hit by Covid-related absences as the number of cases spiralled across Scotland last month.\nRecent changes to self-isolation rules have kept absences lower than the peak of the outbreaks in spring 2020 and this winter, but they still doubled between mid-August and mid-September.\nLast week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the ambulance service was \"operating at its highest level of escalation\".\nThe Scottish government has now enlisted the help of the Army, fire service, British Red Cross and taxi firms to ease the pressure.\nPublic Health Scotland publishes monthly figures on Scottish Ambulance Service incidents, comparing them with pre-pandemic levels.\nFor much of the year, ambulance incidents were down on 2018-2019, but began rising in the summer and are now higher than the pre-pandemic average.\nThe head of the Scottish Ambulance Service, Pauline Howie, recently apologised to patients for the longer waits, saying her staff were working under \"unprecedented pressure\" dealing with big increases in Covid and non-Covid calls.\nThis data spells out the problem facing the NHS - too much demand and not enough capacity. \nBringing the army in will help to free up some clinical staff to work on urgent calls. That might ease some of the pressure getting people to hospital, but nursing leaders warn the staffing situation is \"desperate\".\nEven if you find more beds, they say there are not enough nurses to care for patients.\nIt's the same getting people home at the end of their treatment. Those working in social care say they too face a staffing crisis.\nIt also takes time to find space in care homes or to assess and adapt people's homes so that they can return safely. \nThese are long-standing issues for the health service but Covid has shown just how little give there is in the system. \nAccident and emergency departments are often thought of being a \"barometer\" for the rest of the NHS, acting as the hospital's front door for many patients.\nOne way to measure emergency department performance is waiting times - and it's obvious from these figures that all is not well.\nThere's a big drop in waiting times when the pandemic first hit in March 2020, as lockdown was introduced and emergency departments were suddenly much less busy.\nBut the number of patients waiting more than four hours in A&E began rising sharply in April.\nThe figure is now higher than it has ever been in the last six years and shows no sign yet that it is starting to go down.\nThere is strong evidence that vaccination has weakened the link between Covid infection and serious illness.\nFewer people need hospital treatment, and those that do spend shorter periods in hospital.\nBut the link has not been eliminated and people are still being admitted.\nThe number of infections rose rapidly at the end of August and into September, and that rise was reflected in hospital admissions.\nAverage admissions are not at the same level we saw in January this year - but they're not far off the peak in April 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic.\nHowever, the most recent figures show the first indication that daily admissions may have peaked and could now be starting to fall."

      "text": "Labour says it would cap the amount of property overseas investors can purchase in new developments, in a bid to help first-time buyers.\nUnder plans to be outlined at its annual conference, the party would also give first-time buyers \"first dibs\" on new builds for six months.\nIt will also pledge to reform rules governing how developers contribute towards affordable housing. \nAnd it will pledge to give councils new powers to buy land for homes. \nThe conference, starting in Brighton on Saturday, will give party leader Sir Keir Starmer his first chance to set out his stall to members in person.\nIt comes amid an ongoing policy review, where the party will decide how much of its policy offering it should change from the Jeremy Corbyn era.\nIn a speech on Sunday, Labour's shadow housing secretary Lucy Powell will set out the party's plans to build \"more truly affordable homes\".\n\"Our country is facing a housing crisis with the link between hard work and getting on the housing ladder broken for many,\" she will say. \nShe is expected to accuse the Conservatives of becoming the \"party of speculators and developers\", treating property \"as a commodity, not the bedrock of stable lives and life chances\".\nAnd in a move to occupy traditional Tory territory, she will call Labour the \"party of home ownership\".\nShe will pledge to change England's planning rules, so that half of the homes in new developments cannot be sold to foreign investors. \nThe party says this will help first-time buyers by preventing properties being sold off-plan to developers before local residents can buy them. \nThe policy is an evolution of the party's position at the 2019 election under Jeremy Corbyn, when it proposed a new tax on foreign buyers. \nIn its 2019 manifesto, the party also promised first-time buyers \"first dibs\" on new housing - but did not specify for how long. \nMs Powell will also recommit to several Corbyn-era housing policies, including linking the definition of \"affordable\" homes to average wages, not rents.\nThe party is critical of the government's current definition, which allows affordable rents to be set at up to 80% of the local market rate.\nShe will also set out plans to allow local authorities to buy land more cheaply from private owners when completing a compulsory purchase. \nCouncils are currently not allowed to buy such land at agricultural value - instead having to factor in the prospect of future planning permission, which makes it more expensive.\nLabour believes changing this could enable councils to buy more land for affordable housing, and give them a stronger hand with developers. \nThe party had proposals in this area under its previous leadership, when it proposed setting up a \"sovereign land trust\" to buy property.\nIt will also renew its criticism of rules under which developers negotiate with councils to build affordable homes, or contribute cash towards them.\nThe party has criticised the current system as too lax and favourable to developers. \nThe government itself plans to replace the current system with a new levy as part of its wider proposals to change the planning system in England. \nA Conservative spokesman said Ms Powell's housing speech \"amounts to a series of rehashed and failed policies from Jeremy Corbyn or Sadiq Khan\".\n\"It once again goes to show Labour under Keir Starmer have absolutely nothing new to offer our country,\" he added.

      "title": "Covid-19: Life expectancy is down but what does this mean?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic,Life expectancy",
      "text": "Life expectancy for men in the UK has fallen for the first time in 40 years, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates.  \nLife expectancy at birth in the three years to 2020 was 79 years for men, falling back to a level last seen in 2012-14. \nFemale life expectancy was virtually unchanged, at just below 83. \nNormally, life expectancy in the UK and around the world increases over time - and falls are rare. \nBut the Covid-19 pandemic saw life expectancy fall across most of Europe and the USA in 2020, on a scale not seen since the World War Two, according to research from Oxford University. \nAnd experts say further reductions may be seen in the next year or so, before life expectancy starts to recover.   \nBut what will happen in the longer term, as the effects of healthcare disruption become evident? \nBefore Covid struck, life expectancy at birth in the UK was increasing, although at a much slower rate after 2011 compared with the preceding decades. \nBut the new figures show male life expectancy fell by seven weeks between 2015-17 and 2018-20 - the first such drop since current records began, in 1980.\nDespite the name, these life expectancy figures, known as \"period life expectancy\", do not predict an actual lifespan.\nInstead, they show the average age a newborn would live to if current death rates continued for their whole life.\nAnd as Covid death rates are unlikely to continue long-term, the new estimates do not mean a boy born in 2020 will have a shorter life than one born in 2019. \nBut they do provide a snapshot of the effect of the pandemic that can be compared over time and between countries and different populations. \nLooking at 2020 itself, rather than the three-year average, the ONS found life expectancy for men had fallen by 1.2 years and for women by 0.9, reflecting the higher Covid-19 death toll for men. \nThe UK is far from alone in seeing these large drops in life expectancy for 2020.  \nAn analysis of 29 countries across Europe, the US and Chile, shows falls in almost all of them, often reversing years of improvements. \nAnd the US suffered the biggest decreases, with a fall of more than two years for men, according to researchers at the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science, at the University of Oxford.\nThe pandemic had a \"very sizeable and unprecedented impact\" on death rates and life expectancy, Dr Ridhi Kashyap, associate professor of social demography and one of the study's lead authors, says.\nAnd losses of more than a year are particularly unusual. \n\"This is something that we really don't have since World War Two for most of Western Europe - and since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in the 1990s, in Eastern Europe,\" Dr Kashyap says. \nAnd in many countries, life expectancy fell even below the 2015 figure, already a bad year due to a strong flu season.  \nGiven the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic, a widespread fall is unsurprising, co-lead author Dr Jose Manuel Aburto says. \nBut, he says: \"What is surprising is the magnitude of the fall.\" \nThe US was particularly hard hit as Covid death rates increased in the working-age population, rather than being limited to the older population, a pattern repeated in several Eastern European countries and to some extent in Scotland, Dr Aburto says. \nBut females in Finland and both sexes in Denmark and Norway showed slight improvements, while losses were small in countries such as Estonia and Iceland. \nOnce the pandemic is over and \"its consequences for future mortality are known, it is possible that life expectancy will return to an improving trend in the future\", ONS statistician Pamela Cobb says.\nAnd there may even be a bounceback in the first year or so after it ends, due to what demographers call the \"survivorship effect\". \n\"Essentially what this means is you've lost a large section of your more frail population, then you have a healthier surviving population and you would expect mathematically there to be fewer deaths in the period that follows,\" Stuart McDonald, co-founder of the Covid-19 Actuaries Response Group, says.\nBut thinking about the long-term picture, there are a \"whole range of factors that we are trying to understand\". \nFuture waves of the virus, long Covid, economic disruption and delays to treatment for cancer and other serious illnesses all have the potential to keep UK life expectancy down, he says. \nOn the other hand, vaccinations, improved knowledge of mass-infection control and an increased focus on healthcare may help it recover. \n\"Does life expectancy get back on to its original track and continue increasing or does it increase from the lower point? I'm going to hedge, I think it's a bit of both,\" Mr McDonald says \n\"But my view, and the emerging consensus in the actuarial profession is that, even on a long-term basis, this is a net negative, meaning slower growth.\" \nQuantifying impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic through life expectancy losses: a population-level study of 29 countries will be published in the International Journal of Epidemiology. The data is available for exploration here. "
