      "title": "Sarah Everard: How Wayne Couzens planned her murder",
      "tags": "Policing,Violence against women,Sarah Everard murder",
      "text": "Met Police officer Wayne Couzens has been sentenced to a whole-life term for the murder of Sarah Everard, in a case that sparked national outrage and calls for more action to tackle violence against women. \nCouzens admitted the kidnap, rape and murder of the 33-year-old marketing executive when he appeared in court several months ago.\nBut it was only during his sentencing that the full details of his crimes emerged. \nMs Everard was walking home from a friend's house in Clapham, south London, at about 21:30 BST on 3 March when she was abducted. \nCouzens' choice of victim was random, but the attack was planned. \nIn his sentencing remarks, Lord Justice Fulford said there had been \"significant planning and premeditation\" by Couzens.\nThe police officer had \"long planned to carry out a violent sexual assault on a yet-to-be-selected victim\" who he intended to coerce into his custody, noted the judge. \nCouzens spent at least a month travelling to London from Deal, Kent, where he lived, to research how best to carry out his crimes. \nSeveral days before the attack, he booked a hire car, which he would use for the abduction, as well as a roll of self-adhesive film advertised as a carpet protector on Amazon.\nAfter finishing a 12-hour shift at the US embassy that morning, Couzens, a parliamentary and diplomatic protection officer, went out \"hunting\" for a lone, young woman to kidnap and rape, the prosecution said.\nThe court heard how Couzens used the knowledge he had gained from working on Covid patrols in January and his Metropolitan Police-issue warrant card to trick his victim under the guise of a fake arrest for breaching coronavirus guidelines. \nThe 48-year-old, who had been a police officer since 2002, handcuffed her before bundling her into the car and driving away. \nThe abduction was witnessed by a couple travelling past in a car - but they believed they had seen an undercover police officer carrying out a legitimate arrest, so did not intervene. \nThe whole kidnapping took less than five minutes.\nCouzens then drove to Dover in Kent, where he transferred Ms Everard to his own car, before travelling to a remote rural area nearby. \nIt was there that he raped and murdered his victim - strangling her with his police belt. \nBy 02:31 Couzens had left the scene and was spotted at a service station buying drinks. \nHe visited the site where Ms Everard's body was dumped twice, leaving just before dawn. \nThe next day, as the search for her escalated, Couzens bought petrol, which he used to burn her body inside a fridge. \nHe also purchased two green rubble bags, which he used to dump the remains in a pond near an area of woodland he owned in Hoads Wood, Ashford. \nA week after she disappeared, Ms Everard's body was found in a woodland stream, just metres from land owned by Couzens.\nMeanwhile, Couzens returned to normal life, carrying out mundane activities like calling a vet about his dog. \nDays later, he even took his wife and two children on a family trip to the woods where he had burnt his victim's body. \nHowever, on the 8 March, the day he was due to return to work, he reported in sick. \nThe following day he was arrested at his home in Deal.\nIn a brief police interview, he told a false story about being threatened by an Eastern European gang, claiming they had demanded he deliver \"another girl\" after he had underpaid a prostitute a few weeks before. He then claimed he kidnapped Ms Everard, drove out of London and handed her over to three men in a van in a layby in Kent, while she was alive and uninjured.\nBut after Ms Everard's body was discovered in a pond just 130 metres from land owned by Couzens, he was charged. \nCouzens has since been sacked by the Met, but the force is still facing questions over whether chances were missed to prevent his predatory behaviour. \nAfter Ms Everard's murder, the police watchdog announced it was probing alleged failures by the Met to investigate two indecent exposure incidents linked to Couzens in February. \nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct is also investigating alleged failures by Kent Police to investigate a flashing incident linked to Couzens in 2015. \nCouzens transferred to the Met in 2018, from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, where he had worked since 2011. \nTwo years later he began working for the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command as an authorised firearms officer at diplomatic premises around central London.\nIn July, appearing by video link from Belmarsh high security jail, Couzens pleaded guilty to murder at the Old Bailey. \nOn Wednesday he appeared in court again - this time in person - for a two-day sentencing hearing. \nThere, he faced Ms Everard's mother, father and sister, who described to the court the torment of losing their loved one in such horrendous circumstances. \nHer father, Jeremy, demanded that Couzens looked at him as he told the murderer he could never forgive him for taking away his daughter. \nHer mother, Susan, said she was \"tormented\" at the thought of what her \"precious little girl\" had endured. \n\"I go through the sequence of events. I wonder when she realised she was in mortal danger,\" she told the court. \n\"Burning her body was the final insult. It meant we could never again see her sweet face and never say goodbye.\n\"Our lives will never be the same. We should be a family of five, but now we are four. Her death leaves a yawning chasm in our lives that cannot be filled.\""

      "text": "Annual house price growth of 10% or more has been recorded for each of the past five months, according to data from the Nationwide.\nThe UK's largest building society said that prices in September were up 10% compared with a year earlier, a slight slowdown from 11% in August.\nThe double-digit rise was driven by recent activity in Wales and Northern Ireland, the lender said, with London still seeing the slowest growth.\nThe typical home now costs \u00a3248,742.\nRapidly rising house prices continues to create financial problems for potential first-time buyers, despite record low mortgage rates being offered by lenders.\nA recent report by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that people in tourist hotspots - which have become increasingly popular for relocating buyers - were at risk of being priced out of buying a home in the areas where they worked.\nNationwide bases its house price estimates on its mortgage data, and Robert Gardner, the building society's chief economist, said that property values had continued to rise more quickly than earnings, which meant affordability was becoming more stretched.\n\"Raising a deposit remains the main barrier for most prospective first-time buyers. A 20% deposit on a typical first-time buyer home is now around 113% of gross income - a record high,\" he said.\nKarthik Srivats, co-founder of mortgage lender Ahauz, said: \"First-time buyers have been caught totally by surprise over the past year as the market has taken off. \n\"They have seen their budgets hammered in real terms and, while they have been helped by low rates and government support over the past year, gains in property values across the country have more than outweighed that leg up.\"\nThe stamp duty threshold in England and Northern Ireland will return to normal levels from Friday, after a holiday was temporarily put in place in last year, before being gradually reduced from July this year. \nThere was a flurry of activity in June as buyers rushed to complete purchases before the deadline."

She will be sentenced on 15 December. \nSussex Police said officers had responded to reports of a single-vehicle collision on the B2135 near Partridge Green at about 06:20 BST on Tuesday. \nPrice was taken to hospital following the crash. \nAfter being confronted by police at the scene, she was heard saying: \"I took drugs, I should not be driving, I admit it all,\" the court was told.\nA drugs test gave a positive reading for cocaine, prosecutor Debbie Jones told the court.\nJoe Harrington, Price's defence solicitor, said: \"As I understand it, she had been drinking, she was lonely, and she decided to go and see a friend who lived a relatively short distance away and that is when the incident happened.\n\"She has had a lot of personal problems recently. \n\"Currently she is in the process of bankruptcy proceedings, so her house may be repossessed.\n\"So, quite a lot going on in this lady's life, a really difficult period.\"\nChair of the bench Julie Hutton gave Price an interim driving ban, warning her: \"We regularly send people to prison for driving whilst disqualified.\"\nPrice was told that her sentence would be deferred until 15 December on the condition that she have treatment at the Priory Centre, and not commit any further offences.\nShe was told she must also engage with the probation service.\nMs Hutton told her: \"On that basis, Ms Price, you are free to go and good luck at the Priory.\" \nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "tags": "Companies,Ofgem,UK economy,Oil & Gas industry",
      "text": "Three more energy suppliers have gone bust amid the surge in wholesale gas prices, the regulator Ofgem has said.\nEnstroga, Igloo Energy and Symbio Energy said they would stop trading on Wednesday.\nThe trio are the latest companies to go under as soaring gas prices have made price promises by suppliers to customers undeliverable.\nTogether, the suppliers represent less than 1% of the UK market with a total of about 233,000 customers, Ofgem said.\nEnstroga supplies gas and electricity to about 6,000 domestic customers, while Igloo has about 179,000. Symbio Energy has roughly 48,000 in the UK and a small number overseas.\nThe three energy supplies follow six others which have collapsed in recent weeks. A total of nearly 1.73m customers have been affected in September.\nOfgem said customers of Enstroga, Igloo and Symbio would continue to receive energy supplies and any credit to their accounts would be protected.\nAffected customers will be switched to a new tariff by Ofgem and be contacted by their new supplier, the regulator said.\nIt has advised people to take a meter reading and to wait until a new supplier has been appointed before looking to switch to another energy firm.\nOfgem added that consumers will also be protected by the energy price cap, which limits how much firms can charge per unit of gas, once switched to a new tariff.\nNeil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem, said: \"Ofgem's number one priority is to protect customers. \n\"I want to reassure customers of Enstroga, Igloo Energy and Symbio Energy that they do not need to worry.  \n\"Ofgem will choose a new supplier for you and while we are doing this our advice is to wait until we appoint a new supplier and do not switch in the meantime. You can rely on your energy supply as normal.\"\nOn Monday, Ofgem announced Shell Energy had been appointed as the new supplier for 255,000 gas and electricity customers of Green, which collapsed last week.\nGreen ceased trading on the same day as another supplier, Avro, whose 580,000 customers have been moved to Octopus Energy.\nJonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, previously told the BBC the cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills.\n\"As underlying costs rise, pressure on bills does go up,\" he said.\nMr Brearley has rejected claims from the industry the current crisis represents a failure to adequately regulate the market. \nThe government has said it is looking at issuing loans to bigger energy firms to help them take on stranded customers.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said the government would \"not be bailing out failed companies\" and added he does \"not expect supply emergencies\".\nConsumers' attention may have been drawn to the queues for petrol this week, but this news is evidence the gas crisis is far from over.\nIt is a crisis that many more suppliers are not expected to survive. The pressure on them is increasing as wholesale gas prices are continuing to go up.\nMeanwhile, tens of thousands of customers of these three collapsed companies will now wait to be moved automatically onto new, dedicated - but undoubtedly more expensive - tariffs.\nMillions more face price rises on Friday, when Ofgem's higher price cap for variable tariffs kicks in.\nAs more and more suppliers fold, the cost of dealing with their customers will mean further price rises for everyone in the future are inevitable."

      "text": "The owner of a travel agency says she has resorted to cashing in her pension to pay her staff as furlough ends.\nAnn Jones, who owns Menai Travel, in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, said: \"I don't want to lose my staff, they are like family and help run the business.\"\nThe UK's furlough scheme ends on Thursday.\nIt comes ahead of the \u00a320-a-week boost to universal credit, introduced in response to the pandemic, is due to officially end on 6 October.\nIt was introduced in March 2020 and helped pay the wages of 11.6 million workers after large parts of the economy were shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nAt the end of July it was still supporting the incomes of about 1.6 million workers, the latest HMRC figures show.\nMs Jones told BBC Radio Wales she was \"not happy\" the scheme was ending and has been protesting to try and get the scheme extended throughout the winter.\nShe said she had barely made any revenue in the last two years. \n\"It's not an easy life being in the travel industry,\" she said.\nShe said if the government continued to ease travel restrictions \"things will get moving again\", adding: \"It's going to take all winter for me to start seeing some proper revenue coming into the business.\"\n\"The government said they've given specific support for every industry - they've given it to the airlines, but not small high-street travel businesses,\" she said.\n\"It is heart-breaking for me to build up my business over the years... I just feel I'm just a number to them and not a person.\"\nLiz Lewis, from Creigiau, Cardiff, organises education trips abroad for a coach company and said with no sign of foreign trips for pupils returning she was uncertain about her next steps.\nShe said furlough had been \"a lifeline\", adding: \"There is some anxiety around what the future holds.\"\n\"Without those high-value trips, it would be difficult to operate really and the company might not be able to afford how it's staffed at the moment.\"\nMs Lewis, who was on flexi-furlough working three hours a week, said she may have to take redundancy if there is no capacity for her company to bring her back full-time. \nThat would have \"financial implications\" for her, with one daughter studying in London and the other at a ski academy in Austria.\nBut she said she was \"optimistic things will be okay\" after seeing other colleagues move into roles outside of travel after redundancy.\nJonathan Greeatorex is owner of The Hand at Llanarmon hotel near Llangollen, where all 25 staff are now back at work. \nHe told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers furlough had been a lifeline. \n\"I remember those dark days in March 2020 when Rishi Sunak announced furlough and I'm not going to lie, I burst into tears with relief,\" he said.\n\"I had single mums looking at me saying 'Jonathan how am I going to put food on the table? How am I going to pay my rent?' And it genuinely was a lifeline.\"\nHe said he feared other industries, including travel were \"staring down the barrel of a jobs Armageddon\" as furlough ends before they have been able to financially recover from the pandemic. \nSave the Children in Wales raised concerns over the impact on families and said the UK  government should make the \u00a320 increase to Universal Credit permanent. \nIts head Melanie Simmonds said:  \"The end of the furlough scheme will spell more uncertainty and financial worry for many families across Wales. And it's coming at a time when lots of parents are facing rising energy bills, higher prices for food and transport, and the extra spending on essentials like heating and warm clothes that comes every autumn. This is all leading to a perfect storm of falling incomes and rising costs.\" \nNatasha Harper runs the foodbank and community hub at Rhyl's Good News Family church in Denbighshire. \nShe said they have seen an increase in demand for their support and one service user has told her: \"'I'm going to be \u00a317 worse off each month and there's nowhere else I can pinch that \u00a317 from.\" \n\"That's the reality that we're seeing daily,\" she said. \nShe said the cut in the universal credit uplift would hit hard. \"We've had families come to us and say 'we wanted to put that in our savings pot' but the reality has been they've had to use that. \n\"So that cut of \u00a320 a week for us is nothing, it's a couple of coffees, but for them it's like a week's food. And these are not isolated incidents. We're going to see a massive influx of people in need.\"\nHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) figures show 54,700 were still on furlough in Wales in July - that breaks down to 25,900 women and 28,700 men.\nIn June last year, 378,400 jobs in Wales were furloughed and 108,000 self-employed workers were supported.\nA HM Treasury spokesperson said: \"We deliberately went long with our support to provide certainty to people and businesses over the summer; and that support is continuing with reduced business rates and cuts to VAT in place until March 2022, and the furlough scheme running until the end of September.\n\"The Universal Credit uplift was always intended to be a temporary measure to help households through the pandemic, but we are continuing to support people and ensure they have the skills and opportunities they need to get great jobs.\""

      "text": "The government has advised councils not to use the phrases \"panic\" or \"panic buying\" about fuel supply problems, documents seen by the BBC reveal. \nSlides prepared by the Cabinet Office's Behavioural Science Team also advised against using language that morally judges people buying petrol.\nA Green Party council leader called the recommendations \"nonsensical\". \nThe government said it worked \"closely with councils... on communications to encourage a co-ordinated response.\"\nThe advice sent to local authorities from central government comes after days of long queues at petrol stations which began after fears a lorry driver shortage would hit fuel supplies triggered a surge in demand. \nOn Wednesday the government deployed a reserve tanker fleet to boost deliveries and Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng insisted the situation was \"stabilising\".\nIn a power point presentation marked \"official sensitive\" the Cabinet Office warns against using the terms \"panic\", \"panic buying\" and \"stockpiling\".\nThe document - labelled \"considerations for local authorities\" - explains that people don't recognise their own behaviour as \"panic buying\" and that the use of such phrases can cause panic which can become contagious. \nInstead it recommends using phrases like \"filling up earlier than usual\" or \"changed patterns in demand\".\nOther tips include avoiding language that morally judges those queuing for petrol as \"framing all individuals who stock up as 'selfish' or 'irrational' is likely to receive some backlash\".\n\"Framing people buying excess fuel as 'taking away from those who need it/ the NHS etc.' is likely to lead to them feeling like their freedom has been threatened, leading them to more readily engage in 'panic buying' behaviour,\" the document says.\nThe advice also says councils could encourage petrol stations to take down signs saying \"abuse will not be tolerated\" - which could lead customers to expect confrontation on arrival. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio Sussex, Ph\u00e9lim Mac Cafferty, the Green Party leader of Brighton and Hove City Council said the recommendations amounted to asking councils to \"help the government cover up the fuel crisis\". \n\"Instead of guidance to help us, help our communities navigate the fuel crisis, we have been given platitudes. \n\"This is beyond not good enough.

He has been sentenced to a whole-life prison term.\nSpeaking outside the Old Bailey, where Couzens was sentenced, Dame Cressida said she was \"absolutely sickened\" by the case - adding that it had \"brought shame on the Met\" and \"rocked\" the organisation.\nCouzens' actions were a \"gross betrayal of everything policing stands for\", she said, and had \"eroded the confidence that the public are entitled to have in the police\".\nShe said: \"I absolutely know that there are those who feel that their trust in us is shaken. I recognise that for some people a precious bond of trust has been damaged.\"\nDame Cressida said she realised what had happened to Sarah Everard and other women in London and elsewhere recently had \"raised important questions about women's safety\".\nShe committed to \"keep working with others to improve women's safety and reduce the fear of violence\".\n\"There are no words that can fully express the fury and overwhelming sadness that we all feel about what happened to Sarah. I am so sorry.\"\nThe Met has announced that it will no longer deploy plain-clothes officers on their own, and will instead send them in pairs.\nDeputy Commissioner Sir Stephen House said there would be \"occasions\" where that was not possible - such as when a pair of officers were split up - and noted that off-duty officers not in uniform \"put themselves on duty\" when they come across an incident. \nIn other moves to allay concerns, the Met said it would deploy 650 new officers into busy public places, including those where women and girls often lack confidence that they are safe\u202f\nCouzens, who had been a police officer since 2002, transferred to the Met in 2018 from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, where he had worked since 2011.\nHe was sacked by the Met in July after pleading guilty, but the force is still facing questions over whether chances were missed to prevent his predatory behaviour.\nAfter Ms Everard's murder, the police watchdog announced it was probing alleged failures by the Met to investigate two indecent exposure incidents linked to Couzens in February.\nIn a statement, the Met said it received an allegation of indecent exposure some 72 hours before Sarah was abducted. That crime was allocated for investigation but by the time of Sarah's abduction it was not concluded, the force said.\u202f \nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct is also investigating alleged failures by Kent Police to investigate a flashing incident linked to Couzens in 2015.\nA Scotland Yard review into how Couzens became a police officer in London found that it missed that his car had been linked to an allegation of indecent exposure. \nHe passed vetting processes.\nThe Met said it had asked the policing watchdog to pay \"particular attention to our vetting practices\" in its inspection of the force.\u202f\nBut the force added that \"vetting is a snapshot in time and unfortunately, can never 100% guarantee an individual's integrity\".\nA \"complete overhaul\" of vetting procedures was needed, Ms Sandhu, a former Met chief superintendent, told BBC Radio 4's World, adding that she did not have trust in the Met commissioner to make the necessary changes. \nMeanwhile, Ms Harman, who is chairwoman of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, said it was \"not possible\" for Dame Cressida to \"rebuild the shattered confidence of women in the police service\". \nThis month, it was announced that Dame Cressida - the first woman to lead London's police force - will serve an extra two years in her role and remain in post until 2024.\nDays before the announcement, a number of high-profile figures wrote an open letter accusing her of \"presiding over a culture of incompetence and cover-up\".\nMs Patel said there were \"serious questions\" that needed to be answered by the Metropolitan Police - but backed Dame Cressida. \nSpeaking at the Home Office, the home secretary said: \"From the very day that Sarah went missing, I have been, clearly, in contact with the Metropolitan Police and putting forward some questions around the conduct of the potential suspect at the time and all the requirements and checks that should have been put in place.\"\nWhen asked if Dame Cressida should resign, she said: \"I will continue to work with the Metropolitan Police and the commissioner to hold them to account as everybody would expect me to do.\""

      "tags": "Labour Party Conference",
      "text": "It's been a rollercoaster ride by the Brighton seaside for Labour, as the party enjoyed its first full conference in two years.\nHere are some things we didn't know a week ago.\nThere have been a lot of headlines this week about rows between the leadership and the left.\nSir Keir may have largely avoided direct confrontation with his Corbynite critics, but he did manage to push through rule changes which will have a big effect on how the party governs itself.\nThen came Wednesday's speech. Sir Keir faced down hecklers in the hall and told them that under his leadership, Labour would never stand on a manifesto that wasn't a serious plan for government.\nOld hands watching the speech detected shades of former leader Neil Kinnock - who famously took on the far left Militant tendency at a Labour conference in 1985.\nWe've heard stories about his family before, but Sir Keir looked back at his upbringing in his main conference speech. \nHe spoke about his mum's illness - she was diagnosed with Still's disease when he was young - and he recalled going into the intensive care unit to visit.\n\"Mum's bed was a riot of tubes and temperature devices. I could sense the urgency in the conversation of the four nurses on my mum's bed. I knew without being told that they were keeping her alive. I can hardly convey to you the emotion of seeing your mum in that condition,\" he said.\nHe went on to praise the nurses who looked after her.\nAnd he spoke movingly about his dad, a tool maker, who, he said, gave him a \"deep respect for the dignity of work\".\nPatience was wearing thin in some Labour circles over Sir Keir Starmer's apparent determination not to reveal policies until the next election.\nThis week has seen some big announcements, although there is still a long way to go before we get the full picture.\nShadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves had most of the blockbusters - including a pledge to spend \u00a328bn a year on greening the economy.\nShe also promised to scrap business rates and replace them with... something that has yet to be decided.\nSir Keir meanwhile announced plans for a major investment in education - to be funded by taxing private schools - as well as mental health services and to insulate 19 million homes in England to save energy.\nCries of \"Oh Jeremy Corbyn\" regularly rang out in Brighton this week - and Sir Keir was barracked during his speech by left-wingers who believe he has trashed his predecessor's radical legacy.\nHe had some put-downs ready for them, saying he was about \"changing lives\" not \"shouting slogans\". \nHe appears very comfortable with the fact that he will never be loved by many party members, in the way that Corbyn is.\nMr Corbyn himself was much in evidence at fringe events and Q&A sessions - despite still being suspended from the Parliamentary party, a situation which shows little sign of being resolved.\nHe publicly backed Andy McDonald, the sole surviving member of his shadow cabinet, who dramatically quit his role on Monday in protest at Sir Keir's leadership and his failure to back a \u00a315-an-hour minimum wage.\nAngela Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, ensured the word \"scum\" floated to the top of the social media pond after an outburst at a party event on Saturday night.\nIn a masterclass in how to keep a furore going, she doubled down on the attack on Boris Johnson, saying she would apologise for calling the prime minister \"scum\" if he said sorry for his past controversies.\nOK, so some shadow cabinet colleagues - including Sir Keir - seemed less than impressed by her choice of language, but it went down a lot better among party members in Brighton.\nA GMB delegate got a round of applause on Tuesday when he read out the Oxford English Dictionary definition of scum: \"A very bad or immoral person or group of people\" - an accurate description of the government, he said.\nConference was rounded off with a final volley from Ms Rayner, who said she understood people being upset by her language and said she was just \"bombastic\"."

      "text": "A cafe table where JK Rowling wrote sections of her Harry Potter books has been salvaged from a huge fire, which devastated the building.\nThe blaze on Edinburgh's George IV Bridge last month badly damaged flats and businesses including The Elephant House cafe.\nThe cafe's owner David Taylor said he was \"immensely relieved\" to find the table used by Rowling among the rubble.\nHe said the table had suffered water and smoke damage but would be restored.\nThe Elephant House cafe was one of two used regularly by Rowling when she was writing the stories of the boy wizard in the mid-90s.\nShe wrote in The Elephant House cafe in 1996 and 1997, after her first Harry Potter book was published, and often sat at the antique wooden table.\nThe enduring popularity of the Harry Potter series has led to the Elephant House being a popular stop-off for fans of the series.\nBut Mr Taylor told BBC Scotland it will be about a year before he can reopen.\nIt is believed the fire started in the Patisserie Valerie cafe next door - which also has a basement that runs underneath The Elephant House cafe.\nThe alarm was raised shortly after 06:00 on 24 August by a cleaner at The Elephant House.\nA firefighter was taken to hospital following the blaze, flats were evacuated and the street was closed for a week.\nThe front room of Elephant House was gutted in the blaze and the back room, which included Rowling's table, was damaged by smoke and water.\nMr Taylor said he had only just been allowed to enter the cafe because temporary internal structural work was being constructed to make it safe to be inside.\nHe said: \"Thankfully I've found JK Rowling's table among the rubble and although it is water and smoke damaged it was in the back room so it can be saved.\n\"It is going to the restorers on Thursday and I'm just so relieved this bit of history has been retained.\"\nHe said a valuable signed Harry Potter book was still missing.\n\"There are piles of rubble everywhere so I'm hoping it is under one of them,\" he said. \"I've started the search.\"\nMr Taylor, who has owned the independent cafe for 25 years, said the JK Rowling table, which he bought in an antique shop, had been there since he opened.\nHe said: \"To be out of business for about a year is just devastating and to say I'm upset is an understatement, it's very sad.\"\nThe Elephant House takes its name from hundreds of elephant paintings, chairs and object d'art.\nIn July, JK Rowling told Simon Armitage on his podcast, The Poet Laureate has gone to his shed, how she used to write in the now defunct Nicolson's, which was co-owned by her brother-in-law, and the Elephant House. \n\"That was a lovely space with a really great view of the castle,\" she said.\n\"I met the owner years later and he said 'You never come in any more',\" Rowling said.\n\"In a dream world I would still go in there but it is just not humanly possible to go in there anymore and write. \n\"I had to stop writing in cafes. I really loved it but I just couldn't anymore.\" "

      "text": "An activist who was deceived into a relationship with an undercover police officer has won a tribunal case for breaches of her human rights.\nKate Wilson met Mark Kennedy while he was posing as an environmental campaigner in Nottingham in 2003.\nIt later emerged Mr Kennedy had sexual relationships with as many as 10 other women during his deployment.\nThe tribunal said the case revealed \"disturbing and lamentable failings at the most fundamental levels\".\nEarlier this year the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) at the Royal Courts of Justice heard Mr Kennedy had been sent to infiltrate the Sumac Centre in Nottingham in 2003.\nShortly after arriving Mr Kennedy, calling himself Mark Stone, started a relationship with Ms Wilson which lasted for two years before an amicable split when she moved to Spain.\nIn 2010, she learned his real name and that he was actually a married police officer.\nMs Wilson's legal action against the Met and the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) cited breaches of her right to freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment, her right to privacy and right to freedom of expression.\nThe Met and NPCC accepted Mr Kennedy's actions amounted to a breach of those rights but had denied other officers, apart from Mr Kennedy and his cover officer, knew or suspected that Ms Wilson was in a sexual relationship with the officer.\nHowever, Ms Wilson argued there was \"widespread indifference, or express or tacit encouragement\" for undercover officers to begin intimate relationships while they were deployed.\nIn a ruling, the IPT found the Met's claims that undercover officers (UCOs) knew sexual relationships were banned were \"materially undermined by the sheer frequency with which [Kennedy] (and other UCOs) did conduct sexual relationships without either questions being asked or action being taken by senior officers\".\n\"We are driven to the conclusion that either senior officers were quite extraordinarily naive, totally unquestioning or chose to turn a blind eye to conduct which was, certainly in the case of [Kennedy], useful to the operation,\" the tribunal added.\nThe IPT also found the Met and NPCC's failure to guard against the risk of UCOs entering into sexual relationships with women amounted to unlawful discrimination against women.\nThe tribunal concluded: \"This is not just a case about a renegade police officer who took advantage of his undercover deployment to indulge his sexual proclivities, serious though this aspect of the case unquestionably is.\n\"Our findings that the authorisations under [the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000] were fatally flawed and the undercover operation could not be justified as 'necessary in a democratic society' ... reveal disturbing and lamentable failings at the most fundamental levels.\"\nIn a statement, Ms Wilson said: \"The events in my case happened years ago, however the failure of the police to protect women from sexual predators within their own ranks, and police attempts to criminalise protesters, are both still very live issues today.\n\"We need to tackle the misogyny and institutional sexism of the police, and there needs to be a fundamental rethink of the powers they are given for the policing of demonstrations and the surveillance of those who take part.\"\nA statement from the Met and NPCC said: \"We accept and recognise the gravity of all of the breaches of Ms Wilson's human rights as found by the tribunal, and the Met and NPCC unreservedly apologise to Ms Wilson for the damage caused, and the hurt she has suffered from the deployment of these undercover officers.\"\nIt said the force reiterate previous apologies made to Ms Wilson in 2015 and 2017, adding: \"As those apologies made clear, the Met and NPCC acknowledge that the sexual relationship was wrong, it was an abuse of police power and violated Ms Wilson's human rights.\n\"It caused Ms Wilson significant trauma, and demonstrated failures in the way Kennedy was supervised and managed.\"\nThe statement added the Met accepted the panel's findings and \"are carefully considering the detail of the judgment to see whether any further learning can be taken to add to the changes already implemented since 2010, to the training, supervision and legal oversight of UCOs\".\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Britney Spears",
      "text": "Britney Spears has said she is \"on cloud nine right now\", in what appears to be a response to a judge suspending her father as her conservator.\nThe singer posted a video of her having a flying lesson, shortly after news that Jamie Spears' role was suspended.\nSpears' lawyer Mathew Rosengart said it was his \"hope and expectation\" the conservatorship would be fully terminated at a hearing on 12 November.\nThrough his own lawyer, Jamie Spears called the ruling \"disappointing\".\nCher and Dionne Warwick were among those welcoming the judge's decision.\n\"This will be the start of a new life Brit,\" wrote Cher on Twitter, while Warwick uploaded a video in which she expressed her \"full support\".\n\"My heart goes out to Britney Spears,\" said the veteran soul star. \"I feel her pain. How in the world could anyone endure what she has been enduring?\"\nLaToya Jackson added: \"A huge congratulations to Britney Spears!!!\"\nIn the court hearing in Los Angeles, Judge Brenda Penny formally ended the conservatorship arrangement the star has had with her father since 2008.\nShe left in place a separate conservatorship with John Zabel, an accountant chosen by the singer's legal team.\nJudge Penny ruled the singer's care be turned over to Mr Zabel \"forthwith\", saying it was \"in the best interest of the conservatee\".\nSpears' lawyers have requested a new hearing be held in the next 30 to 45 days to decide whether to end the conservatorship altogether, and Mr Rosengart added: \"Britney doesn't believe a mental evaluation is necessary, and I certainly don't.\"\nPandora Sykes, who hosts BBC Sounds' Pieces of Britney podcast, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was \"really good news\" that the conservatorship would remain in place for the time being.\n\"If it had been terminated... there wouldn't be any opportunity for Britney's team to gain access to Jamie's correspondence,\" she said.\nA recent documentary alleged that a private security film employed by Mr Spears had placed his daughter under constant surveillance.\n\"By suspending him they can look into all of this before they then hopefully move to terminate [the conservatorship] in November,\" Sykes continued.\nIn her Instagram post, Spears told 'JL' - the initials of her sister Jamie-Lynn - that she was \"bringing the ship home\".\nHer sister used the same expression in a recent post about the North Atlanta Knockouts, a girls' softball team.\nJamie Spears was appointed as his daughter's guardian in 2008 amid concerns over her mental health.\nEarlier this year, Britney Spears made explosive claims that he had abused his position, claims her father and his team have repeatedly denied.\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, Mr Spears' lawyer said he loved his daughter \"unconditionally\" and had \"tried to do what is in her best interests\".\n\"These facts make the outcome of yesterday's hearing all the more disappointing, and frankly, a loss for Britney,\" continued Vivian L Thoreen.\n\"The court was wrong to suspend Mr Spears, put a stranger in his place to manage Britney's estate, and extend the very conservatorship that Britney begged the court to terminate earlier this summer.\n\"Despite the suspension, Mr Spears will continue to look out for the best interests of his daughter and work in good faith towards a positive resolution of all matters.\"\nFans around the world who have supported Spears through the #FreeBritney campaign have expressed much delight about this week's developments. \nA rally was held outside the court on Wednesday, while fans also gathered in London's Trafalgar Square.\nSupporters outside the LA courtroom \"celebrated wildly\" when the news broke, the Press Association said. \nMusician Benjamin Elgar reacted by saying it was \"good news\" Mr Spears had been suspended and not terminated \"so they can have time to investigate more, everything that's been going on\".\nHe added: \"She's going to be free after everything that has been happening, all her fans and media and all the documentaries that came out really made a lot of pressure on the court to speed up the process.\"\nSales worker Alex Garcia said that when the news was announced, \"we were screaming our heads off. Everything we worked for, it's here.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "tags": "Fuel,Motoring",
      "text": "Traffic app Waze is asking UK users to tell it which petrol stations have fuel available, amid the UK's shortage of petrol at the pump. \nUsers of the app are receiving push notifications asking them to \"help your community stay informed\". \nThis data is then plugged into the app's live map for others to see which stations are open. \nSimilar measures have been criticised as fuelling panic buying and adding to the problem. \nMany local Facebook groups and apps such as Nextdoor have been flooded in recent days with messages from people offering advice about which petrol stations have fuel.\nWaze, a subsidiary of Google, said the feature to show fuel stocks was not new but the company \"has made the decision to push 'notify users' to encourage its use\". \n\"Fears of disruption to fuel supply have created bumper-to-bumper traffic at petrol stations,\" Waze UK manager Ru Roberts said. \n\"In some areas, speeds have slowed to as low as 3km/h (1.9mph) as drivers rushed to fill their cars.\"\nThe push notifications \"will enable motorists to guide others to forecourts which have remaining supplies, saving unnecessary journeys to those which have already run out,\" he said. \nThe government maintains there is no national fuel shortage - and any regional issues are fuelled by extreme demand.\nEarlier this week, Brian Madderson, who chairs the Petrol Retailers' Association, told BBC News: \"One of the reasons for this is social media. \n\"As soon as a tanker arrives at a filling station, people on social media are advising that a tanker has arrived and then it's like bees to a honey pot.  \n\"Everyone flocks there\u2026 within a few hours, it is out again.\" \nWaze's app is most often used to crowdsource live traffic data, so it can tell users about sudden road closures and traffic jams. \nBut now its data showed which areas of major population centres had the worst traffic around fuel stations, the company said. \nFor example:\nIts internal data also showed in some areas - such as Liverpool, Luton, and Manchester - the distance driven had actually increased on some days, in part due to people searching for petrol."

      "tags": "Contact tracing,Schools,Caernarfon,Coronavirus testing,Newport,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Testing children who do not have Covid symptoms should end amid fears of a \"huge strain\" on schools.\nDr David Tuthill, officer for Wales for the Royal College of Paediatricians, questioned whether asymptomatic testing was doing \"more harm than good\".\nLatest figures showed more than half of positive cases are among children and under-19s.\nThe Welsh government said regular testing was essential to support face-to-face learning.\nLaura Doel, director of teaching union NAHT Cymru, said school leaders were forced to \"take some matters into their own hands\" due to the a \"clear failing\" of the Test, Trace, Protect (TTP) system. \nMs Doel said schools were \"struggling\" to cope with contact tracing.\n\"Unfortunately, members are waiting days, in some cases weeks, before they hear from TTP, which is putting a huge strain on schools,\" she said.\n\"The result being that we have high numbers of staff absences, high numbers of learners unable to attend school because they're contracting Covid and unless somebody steps in and addresses the problem we're only going to see further disruption to education.\"\nPublic Health Wales figures for Wednesday showed that 51.5% of positive Covid cases occurred in under-19s.\nSwansea Bay University Health Board has revealed that almost as many under-15s had been in hospital with Covid in the past three months as had been throughout the pandemic.\nBut Dr Tuthill said that serious illness to children as a result of Covid remained rare.\nHe said there were currently more cases among children who were \"now the unvaccinated reservoirs and Covid is going to spread more in that age group\".\n\"But Covid itself rarely produces serious illness in children,\" he added.\nHe said the \"real problem\" was children suffering with their mental health due to clubs and schools being closed during the first wave of the pandemic. \nVaccinating 12 to 15-year-olds from next week \"should reduce the spread of Covid and help children stay in school\", he added.\nThe Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has called for a halt to testing children who do not have symptoms.\nDr Tuthill said children \"obviously shouldn't be in school\" if they have a high fever and runny nose, but if that is not the case, \"are we doing more harm than good?\"\n\"I think we may have to move into another phase now where we may say: 'OK, Covid's going to be here for the long term - if we're protecting, with the vaccinations, vulnerable people, those on immunosuppressants, the elderly, should we now start being less worried and stop testing asymptomatic children'?\"\nA mother-of-two from Newport said TTP was \"failing\" them.  \nShe wanted to remain anonymous as she did not want her experience to reflect badly on the school, which she said was \"only following government guidance.\"\n\"In my son's primary school class, there have been five cases. When the first case was discovered, the child's parent contacted the school but we didn't get contacted by TTP for five days, by which time it had spread.\n\"If we had known straight away we could have had our children tested immediately. We didn't know anything about it when my son had contact with my elderly parents during the five days. \n\"We were very lucky that my son later tested negative. People are fed up with testing, it's relentless and the children are fed up with it.\"\nMererid Mair, a mother of two boys who go to a high school in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, said: \"My own children worry that their friends are ill, worry that they're going to catch Covid and are going to pass it on to nan and tad - it's a difficult situation to be in.\"\nShe added that safety measures in schools last term were not that \"restrictive\" and would welcome the reintroduction of some again.\nThe Welsh government said testing helped identify anyone who was infectious.\n\"It's important that staff and pupils take part in regular testing and report their results online to make it as effective as possible,\" a spokesman added.\nIt said reviews were every three weeks \"to ensure we are only asking people to regularly test when it is absolutely essential to supporting face-to-face education to continue for the majority of learners\"."

      "title": "Furlough scheme ends with almost 1 million left in limbo",
      "tags": "Job Retention Scheme,Employment,UK economy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The furlough scheme closes on Thursday, with uncertainty ahead for people who have not yet fully returned to work.\nNearly one million workers were expected to be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation.\nOf those on furlough in late July, about half on the scheme were able to work some of the time, the HMRC says.\nSince the start of the pandemic, it has helped pay the wages of 11.6 million workers.\nBut many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment as it ends.\nThe chancellor said he was \"immensely proud\" of the near \u00a370bn scheme, but now was the right time to close it, despite calls for further support from some badly-hit companies. \nThe travel sector has suffered more than most during the pandemic, with businesses being affected by changing restrictions and lower consumer confidence.\nMark Andrew, the director of Animal Aircare, which helps pets travel overseas via Gatwick Airport, said some of his staff may be made redundant if business does not improve.\nThe firm has not yet had to lay off staff, which Mr Andrew said was \"purely down to furlough\".\n\"Furlough ending means there's a real question mark for our business. We're still waiting for Gatwick to pick up... it seems the airline industry is not buoyant enough yet,\" he said.\nAlthough the end of the scheme comes amid a record number of job vacancies, Fidelity International's investment director, Maike Currie, told the BBC that \"no-one really knows what is next\".\n\"I think what we can be certain of is that we'll see under-employment, where employees return to work but possibly not on a full-time basis and that they might need to supplement their income.\"\nFurlough was introduced in March 2020 after Covid-19 forced large parts of the UK economy to close.\nOfficially known as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, it saw the government pay towards the wages of people who could not work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of \u00a32,500.\nAt first it paid 80% of their usual wage, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%.\nThere have been big recruitment drives for hospitality staff, HGV drivers and warehouse workers as businesses get back on their feet.\nLatest official figures show the UK's economy grew by 5.5% between April and June - revised up from the initial estimate of 4.8%.\nThe uplift was largely driven by household spending rebounding after lockdowns, although many firms are now being held back by current labour shortages.\n\"Any hope that the end of the furlough scheme might be the magic wand to solve the supply chain crisis is likely to be wishful thinking,\" said Susannah Streeter, from Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThere is likely to be a big mismatch of skills and experience between those leaving the furlough scheme and the jobs on offer, she added.\nChief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke told the BBC: \"We think there are probably two million fewer people unemployed than would have been the case if this scheme hadn't been introduced. \n\"I think it's done an enormous amount to shield our economy and our society from the worst of Covid.\"\nThe scheme has also been praised by the Resolution Foundation think tank as a \"great success\".\nIts senior economist Dan Tomlinson said furlough had been \"as critical to fighting the Covid crisis as nationalising the banks was to fighting the global financial crisis\".\nBut the foundation's recent research suggested that a small rise in unemployment was a \"real risk\" for those still on the scheme as it ends, particularly older workers or those in the travel sector.\nWhen the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme started, it was described as a bridge over the pandemic uncertainty. \nIt has succeeded in keeping the official unemployment numbers at less than half pre-pandemic expectation. For that reason it has proven value for money, despite costing over \u00a368bn.\nBut there is now some uncertainty over the fate of the million or so workers still having their wages subsidised. \nNew analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies points to regional differences, with London workers for example the most likely still to be furloughed. Older workers are also disproportionately still on the scheme.\nIndustries that are yet to return to normal, such as the airport sector, had called for the scheme to be kept in some form. Unions also argue that the UK should follow Germany in maintaining a form of the scheme for future crises. \nCertainly a precedent has been set in that the government is willing to spend billions on wage increases if large-scale increases in unemployment are avoided. \nAlthough a million vacancies do not map on to the same number still on furlough, it is clear that many industries are having to welcome back more furloughed workers. Partly out of fear of being caught out by worker shortages later down the line.\nFor many of those returning to work, conditions will not be the same as pre-pandemic.\nJess Pitman was furloughed from her job as marketing manager at a travel firm two weeks after the scheme was introduced.\nThe company she works for specialises in organising trips abroad to raise money for charities, but travellers cancelled their plans when Covid hit.\nThe firm's payroll has been reduced from 27 to just five and the 29-year-old will return to work part-time, topping up her income with freelance work.\n\"I feel really torn about the end of furlough, and I'm really sad for the travel industry as a whole,\" Jess said.\n\"I know a lot of people in the industry will be made redundant... I think we'll lose a lot of talented people, which is really disappointing.\"\nA spokesperson for the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) warned that companies in the sector still face \"extreme difficulties\" because of continued travel restrictions.\nAbta called for sector-specific support for smaller firms in particular, who have lost two summers of sales, as well as those which specialise in destinations still subject to red list rules.\n\"The government needs to look at how it can support these businesses... through a package of tailored financial support,\" the spokesperson added.\nElsewhere, the Federation of Small Businesses also cited concerns over a \"colder environment\" for business.\nEmployers and workers alike will have to cope with the end of the furlough scheme, as well as the scrapping of an incentive for hiring apprentices, rising energy bills and the planned cut to Universal Credit in October.\nHowever, the Treasury said generous support was being provided through its \"Plan for Jobs\", which it said was part of a \u00a3400bn spending package.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said he was \"immensely proud of the furlough scheme, and even more proud of UK workers and businesses whose resolve has seen us through an immensely difficult time\".\nAre you using the furlough scheme?

      "tags": "Fuel,Haulage",
      "text": "There has been no improvement in petrol supplies at independent petrol stations since Wednesday, according to industry body the Petrol Retailers Association.\nThe PRA, which represents independent fuel retailers, said that more than a quarter (27%) of its members' were still out of fuel on Thursday.\nThat was better than the 37% which were out of fuel on Tuesday, but demand remained higher than usual, it said.\nHowever the AA said it saw signs that the pressure was starting to ease.\nThe PRA, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,300 petrol stations, said Thursday's figures were based on responses from 1,500 stations.\n\"Trying to calm this down appears to be a monumental task at the moment,\" said PRA chairman Brian Madderson.\n\"The surge in demand appears to be continuing,\" he said. \"There's been no easing off of the pressure from drivers wanting to refuel whenever they can, wherever they can.\"\nThe UK has been grappling with a fuel crisis that has caused huge queues outside some petrol stations, and forced customers to drive round multiple sites in search of supplies.\nWhile the government and industry said there was enough fuel at UK refineries, a shortage of drivers has slowed the transport of fuel to petrol stations.\nThe government said it was seeing the \"first signs\" of demand for fuel stabilising, and stressed there was no shortage of fuel.\nThe AA also said it saw signs that the pressure on fuel pumps was starting to ease.\nThe motoring group said that the number of call-outs from drivers who had run out of fuel had initially increased sharply and was \"in the hundreds\" over the weekend. But it said those numbers were now falling rapidly.\nAlthough some queues remain in London, the South East and some other built-up areas, AA president Edmund King said daily improvements were now visible.\n\"We believe we have turned the corner,\" he said.\nThe PRA told the BBC that it had also received \"anecdotal\" evidence that the problems were more acute in London and the South East. It said that Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales appeared to be \"mostly ok\".\nThe PRA's Mr Madderson said he had written to the government this morning to warn them that the price of petrol and diesel at the pump was likely to rise, after a rise in the price of Brent Crude oil. A fall in the value of the pound against the dollar would also push up prices for UK customers, he said.\n\"Those two [factors] have already started to impinge on wholesale prices, which have gone up - in the last three nights - by nearly 3p a litre,\" he said. \nGovernment plans to use the army to address some of the delivery problems in the coming days would help to ease the problems, Mr Madderson said, but the main thing that was required was a change in public behaviour.\n\"Let's just try and calm it down please,\" he said. \nHe said he understood that the army could be helping with deliveries by the weekend. \nThe majority of sites completely out of stock were BP franchisees, Mr Madderson said, adding the PRA was talking to BP about the issues they were facing.\nBP told the BBC it was \"working flat out to keep our petrol stations stocked and restock them when they run out\".\nLong queues and frustrated customers have led to multiple reports on social media of abuse of service station staff.\nBBC broadcast engineer Simon Hardwick tweeted: \"Chatting with a member of staff at a supermarket petrol station, who said they are getting deliveries but within a few hours they sell out again. He also mentioned the abuse he's been receiving from members of the public.\"\nIndustry leaders have condemned physical and verbal abuse suffered by service station employees during the crisis.\nGordon Balmer, the executive director of the PRA, said the abuse was \"completely unacceptable\".\n\"It is important to remember that fuel stocks remain normal at refineries and terminals, and deliveries have been reduced solely due to the shortage of HGV drivers\", he added.\nThe haulage industry said an existing shortage of lorry drivers had been made worse by a number of factors, including the pandemic, Brexit, an ageing workforce, and low wages and poor working conditions.\nIn an attempt to limit disruption, the government has confirmed that 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers can receive temporary UK visas, with the scheme ending on Christmas Eve.\nThe Road Haulage Association said, however, the recent move \"barely scratches the surface\", adding that only offering visas until Christmas Eve \"will not be enough for companies or the drivers themselves to be attractive\".\nA spokesman for the government said it had taken \"immediate action\" to increase the numbers of HGV drivers.\n\"We recognise the challenges facing industry and streamlined the testing process in July to boost the number of drivers,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, petrol station group EG said its workers would get a 5% pay rise for \"heroic\" work since the start of the Covid pandemic.\nThe wage increase takes the minimum rate for over-18s to \u00a39.50 per hour at EG Group, which was founded by the Asda-owning Issa brothers.\nMohsin and Zuber Issa, the billionaire co-founders and co-chief executives of the group, said: \"Our colleagues have pulled out all the stops and been nothing short of heroic during often very difficult times since the start of the pandemic.\n\"It is due to their hard work and dedication that EG has continued to be a growth business, performing strongly over the past 12 months.\n\"We are grateful to each and every one of them for their contributions and are therefore making a total reward package available to them which we believe is among the best in the country.\"\nEG Group was founded in 2001 and has more than 45,000 staff working in more than 6,200 sites in Europe, the US and Australia."

      "tags": "Keir Starmer,Labour Party",
      "text": "Sir Keir Starmer has said Labour will never again go into an election without a \"serious plan for government\", in a speech to his party conference.\nHe said the country faced a \"big moment\" that \"demands leadership\" - and as prime minister he would provide it.\nSir Keir set out new policies on mental health, education and housing, but it was also a highly personal speech about his own background and values.\nHe got a standing ovation, but was heckled by some left-wingers.\nSir Keir told those barracking him in the Brighton Centre that he was about \"changing lives\" not \"shouting slogans\", to cheers from other delegates.\nAfter a week dominated by rows with the left, Sir Keir urged activists to come together to beat the Conservatives, at a time when energy bills are rising, petrol supplies are running short and the economy is recovering from the pandemic.\n\"These are big issues, but our politics is so small,\" he told delegates. \"So our politics needs to grow to meet the scale of the challenge.\"\nThe 89-minute speech was Sir Keir's first chance to address a full Labour conference since becoming party leader 17 months ago, as last year's event was held largely online because of Covid.\nAddressing a packed auditorium, he said he would \"not stand for the record levels of knife crime that we have in this country today\" and called Labour a party of \"patriots\".\nHe spoke at length about his background, focusing on his previous career as a human rights lawyer and his mother's years of suffering from Still's disease, a form of inflammatory arthritis which severely restricts mobility.\nSir Keir described his parents as \"the two rocks of my life\", saying his father, a toolmaker, had given him a \"deep respect for the dignity of work\".\nHe contrasted his life with that of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whom he described as a \"trickster\", a \"trivial man\" and a \"showman with nothing left to show\".\nWith Labour having lost four general elections in a row, the last one by the biggest margin since the 1930s, Sir Keir attempted to distance himself from the policies of ex-leader Jeremy Corbyn.\nWhile he did not mention his more left-wing predecessor by name, he said: \"We will never under my leadership go into an election with a manifesto that is not a serious plan for government.\n\"It will not take another election defeat for the Labour Party to become an alternative government in which you can trust.\"\nBy contrast, Sir Keir paid tribute to the party's 13 years in power under prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, saying they had cut child and pensioner poverty, taken on more teachers and nurses and reduced hospital waiting times.\n\"You want levelling up?,\" he asked. \"That's levelling up.\"\nAt the start of his speech Sir Keir was repeatedly shouted at by one woman in the audience, but replied: \"I normally get heckled by the Tories at this time of the week, so this doesn't bother me.\"\nSir Keir Starmer deliberately took his time to spell out his vision to voters that Labour has lost. \nIn an effort to connect with them, he spoke in personal terms about his parents and their influence on his political beliefs, revealing more about what drives him. \nPersistent hecklers in the hall were a reminder that support for Sir Keir within Labour is far from unanimous, but they may not hurt his attempt to show he's closing the door on the Corbyn era. \nThere were some policy announcements, but the main message to voters was an appeal to look again at Labour after four election defeats in a row. \nThe speech was also a challenge from Sir Keir to his party to change if wants to win again.\nIt was the longest, most detailed argument he has yet made that he is the man to lead it back into Downing Street.\nMoving on to policies, he announced that a Labour government would upgrade 19 million homes so that they reach a minimum \"Band-C\" energy efficiency level, providing grants for low-income households to achieve this and low-interest loans for others.\nThe changes would include better insulation, double glazing and new heating systems, saving households \u00a3400 a year in bills on average, he promised.\nOther pledges in the speech included:\n\"I can see the ways in which we can remake this nation and that's what we get to do when we win,\" Sir Keir said.\n\"So let's get totally serious about this - we can win the next election.\"\nSir Keir's speech ended a five-day conference which saw him get backing for changes to the way the party elects its leaders, against fierce opposition from the left, who feel they are being marginalised.\nOn Monday, shadow employment secretary Andy McDonald quit Labour's front bench, saying he had been ordered to argue against raising the minimum wage to \u00a315 an hour.\nThe next day, the conference backed a motion calling for this to be party policy, although this is not binding on the leadership.\nAnd delegates voted in favour of nationalising the UK's energy industry, despite Sir Keir ruling this out.\nThe leader also angered the left when he pushed through changes to the way Labour elects its leaders.\nReacting to Sir Keir's speech, left-wing Labour activist group Momentum said it had \"identified a lot of problems but offered very few solutions\".\n\"We all know that the NHS crisis is bad, but what will our party do about it? We are no clearer on that than we were this morning,\" it added.\nThe trade union Unite said there \"wasn't much\" in it about the cost of living and workers' rights.\nBut Christina McAnea, general secretary of the union Unison, said the Labour leader had demonstrated \"vision\" and shown the party \"could bring hope to the many families forgotten by this government\", adding: \"This is a serious plan for change\".\nConservative Party co-chairman Oliver Dowden said: \"As Labour's chaotic conference comes to an end, it is clear Sir Keir Starmer's party is more divided than ever and has no plan.\n\"Labour spent five days talking to themselves about themselves instead of to the country.\""

They will now be independently valued before being offered to museums for sale.\nTenby Museum & Art Gallery and Scolton Manor Park & Museum are looking to acquire the brooches.\nThe age of the brooches mean they could have been worn around the time freedom fighter William Wallace was executed by the English, or as the bubonic plague swept through Europe. \nMr Johnston found his silver brooch from the 12th to 13th centuries on 10 March 2019, in a field in Penally. \nEloise Chapman, from Tenby Museum & Art Gallery, said the museum had nothing like Mr Johnston's find in its collection. \n\"This lovely little brooch will provide an insight for our visitors into medieval fashion and everyday life in the Tenby area,\" she said.\nMr Higgs found his brooch, which dates back to the 13 to 14th centuries, on 24 April 2019, in Ambleston.\nDr Mark Redknap, from National Museum Wales, said: \"Silver brooches decorated with niello were popular across medieval Wales and this small example may have fastened clothing made of fine cloth.\" \nHe said that through the Treasure Act \"we are building a more accurate picture of fashion in the medieval period\".\nThe Treasure Act allows for the sale price to be shared among the finder and the owner of the land."

      "text": "Annual house price growth of 10% or more has been recorded for each of the past five months, according to data from the Nationwide.\nThe UK's largest building society said that prices in September were up 10% compared with a year earlier, a slight slowdown from 11% in August.\nThe double-digit rise was driven by recent activity in Wales and Northern Ireland, the lender said, with London still seeing the slowest growth.\nThe typical home now costs \u00a3248,742.\nRapidly rising house prices continues to create financial problems for potential first-time buyers, despite record low mortgage rates being offered by lenders.\nA recent report by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that people in tourist hotspots - which have become increasingly popular for relocating buyers - were at risk of being priced out of buying a home in the areas where they worked.\nNationwide bases its house price estimates on its mortgage data, and Robert Gardner, the building society's chief economist, said that property values had continued to rise more quickly than earnings, which meant affordability was becoming more stretched.\n\"Raising a deposit remains the main barrier for most prospective first-time buyers. A 20% deposit on a typical first-time buyer home is now around 113% of gross income - a record high,\" he said.\nKarthik Srivats, co-founder of mortgage lender Ahauz, said: \"First-time buyers have been caught totally by surprise over the past year as the market has taken off. \n\"They have seen their budgets hammered in real terms and, while they have been helped by low rates and government support over the past year, gains in property values across the country have more than outweighed that leg up.\"\nThe stamp duty threshold in England and Northern Ireland will return to normal levels from Friday, after a holiday was temporarily put in place in last year, before being gradually reduced from July this year. \nThere was a flurry of activity in June as buyers rushed to complete purchases before the deadline."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\nIt was introduced during the first lockdown, it\u00a0helped pay millions of wages after coronavirus restrictions meant large parts of the economy closed but now, after 18 months, the UK's furlough scheme is ending. Furlough - or the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme as it's officially known - was brought in by the government and has been praised for protecting millions of jobs. But some firms say they still need support because business hasn't returned to normal. The government says there's support in its Plan for Jobs.\nNext summer's GCSE and A-level grades in England will be wound back to a \"mid-point\" between 2019 and 2021, as part of government plans to return them to pre-Covid levels over the next two years. It's been announced that exams will take place but with an option of teacher-assessed grades and pupils will get notice of exam topics in some subjects to help with revision.\nGP appointments largely stopped taking place face-to-face due to coronavirus. The government wants them to return in England, they are and 57% of appointments were in person in July. But that's well below the 80% seen before the pandemic. We've spoken to a GP and patients to find out what they think.\n\"A happiness coach is someone that helps you to see how to look at things going on around you from a positive point of view,\" says Sadie Mills, who hired one during Covid. It's a trend that's been fuelled by the pandemic but what do happiness coaches do and does it work?

We are getting the party ready for the next election,\" he said.\nBut it is Mrs Foster's decision to stay away from Thursday night's event that will gather most comment.\nIt is another sign of the hurt the former first minister still feels at the way she was treated by some of the party's elected representatives, although she remains close to many grassroots members.\nThe race to succeed her as MLA for Fermanagh and South Tyrone is nearing completion with candidates being interviewed this week.\nThen Mrs Foster will resign her assembly seat and depart the Stormont stage."

That information would have been enough to establish that Couzens was the owner.\nSpeaking to reporters at Scotland Yard, Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said Kent Police had investigated the report and took no further action.\nHe explained: \"One of a number of checks that forms part of the vetting process may not have been undertaken correctly when he joined the Met. \n\"This check related to a vehicle that was registered to Couzens that was linked to an allegation of indecent exposure that was reported to Kent Police in 2015.\"\nThe assistant commissioner said the review into the vetting of Couzens concluded that even if that information had been known, it would not have changed the outcome.\nHowever, the reasons for this remain unclear.\nThe statement the Met issued on Thursday night added: \"We want the public to have confidence in our vetting and are taking extra measures to ensure our processes are the best they can be and address any potential weaknesses.\u202f\n\"Vetting is a snapshot in time and, unfortunately, can never 100% guarantee an individual's integrity.\"\nMeanwhile, two senior Met officers told London Assembly's Police and Crime Committee they were not aware of rumours that Couzens was nicknamed \"the rapist\" by colleagues.\nHowever, HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Tom Winsor said the nickname was known by some officers.\nSir Tom, who in his role has responsibility for the inspection of police forces, told the BBC Couzens \"also had allegedly a reputation in terms of drug abuse, extreme pornography and other offences of this kind\"."

      "tags": "North Korea missile tests,North Korea",
      "text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has said he is willing to restore a vital communication hotline with South Korea, in a possible offer of reconciliation. \nHe also accused the US of proposing talks without changing its \"hostile policy\" towards the North. \nPyongyang severed the hotlines in August this year in protest against South Korea-US military drills.  \nMr Kim's latest comments came during Pyongyang's annual parliament session.\n\"The US is touting 'diplomatic engagement'... but it is no more than a petty trick for deceiving the international community and hiding its hostile acts,\" a report by state news outlet KCNA said. \nBut Mr Kim appeared to extend a conditional olive branch towards South Korea.\nHe wants to restore the communication lines by early October, but that is dependent on the \"attitude of the South Korean authorities\" and whether their relationship starts to improve or continues its \"present state of worsening,\" KCNA reports.\nMr Kim's latest comments echo those his sister made earlier last week, where she said the North was willing to resume talks with the South if it ended its \"hostile policies\".\nIn a statement, Kim Yo-jong said South Korea needed to drop its \"double-dealing attitudes\" and \"hostile stand of justifying [its] own acts while faulting our... right to self-defence.\"\nShe added that face to face discussions to \"declare the significant termination of war\" could only be done once those conditions are met.\nNorth and South Korea are technically still at war because no peace agreement was reached when the Korean War ended in 1953.\nCommunication hotlines between the two have been cut - and restored - several times over the past few years. \nIn 2020, after a failed summit between the North and South, Pyongyang blew up an inter-Korean border office that had been built to improve communications.\nWhy has Kim Jong Un decided to pursue peace with Seoul now?\nThere are a few reasons to consider.\nFirst, the joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea are over for this year. The time for sabre-rattling is done.\nSeoul's President Moon tried to nudge the door for talks when he called on both sides to talk about officially ending the Korean war at the United Nations General Assembly. This appears to have had an impact. \nOr at least it was perfectly timed for Pyongyang to once again open its diplomatic playbook.\nNorth Korea's economy is in a dire state. Mr Kim will be keen for sanctions relief. He had hoped to make a deal with then US President Donald Trump in Hanoi, but that fell through, and Covid-19 border closures have exacerbated an already bad situation.\nThere's a clock ticking too. The South Korean presidential elections are on the horizon. At least for now, Mr Kim knows who he is dealing with and he knows President Moon favours engagement. There's no guarantee that the next occupant of the Blue House will be so keen to talk.\nAnalysts have also believed for many years that Pyongyang is keen to separate Washington and Seoul. Showing a willingness to talk to South Korea but not the US may be a ploy. \nOr North Korea might hope their new friends in Seoul will go to Washington to push for sanctions relief and other concessions on their behalf.\nSo what happens next? Well, as two separate analysts put it to me earlier this week, we could be in for a busy time on this peninsula.\nMr Kim's comments come as North Korea goes into the second day of its annual parliamentary session, the Supreme People's Assembly. \nThe rubber-stamp parliament session also saw various changes, including the appointment of Kim Yo-jong - to a position in the State Affairs Commission - her highest position yet. \nEarlier this week, North Korea test-fired its third missile this month - a new hypersonic missile.\nObservers say it is a sign that the North has no intention of slowing down its arms development. \nThe US has been calling for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, and Pyongyang's relationship with President Joe Biden's administration has so far been fraught with tension.\nBut Pyongyang seems determined to prove it will continue to develop new weapons systems, saying they are needed for its own self-defence.\nThe North has also repeatedly accused South Korea of double standards over military activities.\nSouth Korea recently tested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile, which it said was needed as deterrence against North Korea's \"provocations\"."

      "text": "A Met Police officer who murdered Sarah Everard after kidnapping her under the guise of an arrest has been sentenced to a whole-life prison term.\nWayne Couzens abducted the 33-year-old as she walked home from a friend's house in south London on 3 March.\nDuring the sentencing of Couzens, the judge said the case was \"devastating, tragic and wholly brutal\".\nMs Everard's family said they were relieved by the fact that Couzens would die in jail.\nAddressing reporters outside the Old Bailey following his sentencing, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said she recognised that a \"precious bond of trust\" had been damaged by Couzens, who had \"brought shame on the Met\". \nDescribing him as a \"coward\", she said his crimes were \"a gross betrayal of everything policing stands for\", adding: \"I am so sorry.\"\nAn ongoing Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) review of how Couzens became a Met officer has found that vetting procedures missed that two of his previous cars had been linked to allegations of indecent exposure.\nSpeaking to the London Assembly's Police and Crime Committee earlier on Thursday, two senior Met officers said they were not aware of rumours that Couzens was nicknamed \"the rapist\" by colleagues.\nHowever, HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Tom Winsor said the nickname was known by some officers. \nSir Tom, who in his role has responsibility for the inspection of police forces, told BBC Radio 4's the World at One: \"Yes, I did know that. And he also had allegedly a reputation in terms of drug abuse, extreme pornography and other offences of this kind.\"\nWhat Couzens' colleagues knew or suspected about him remains the subject of the IOPC investigation. \nWhen sentencing Couzens earlier on Thursday, Lord Justice Fulford described the circumstances of the kidnap, rape and murder as \"grotesque\", telling him he had \"betrayed\" his family. He said Ms Everard was \"an intelligent, resourceful, talented and much-loved young woman, still in the early years of her life\".\nThe judge told 48-year-old Couzens: \"Notwithstanding your guilty pleas, therefore, I have seen no evidence of genuine contrition on your part, as opposed to evident self-pity and attempts by you to avoid or minimise the proper consequences of what you have done.\"\nHe said the seriousness of the case was so \"exceptionally high\" that it warranted a whole-life order.  \n\"The misuse of a police officer's role such as occurred in this case in order to kidnap, rape and murder a lone victim is of equal seriousness as a murder for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause,\" he told the Old Bailey. \"All of these situations attack different aspects of the fundamental underpinnings of our democratic way of life.\" \nReacting to the sentencing, Ms Everard's family said they were pleased with the full-life term, adding that although \"nothing can make things better, nothing can bring Sarah back... knowing he will be imprisoned forever brings some relief.\n\"Sarah lost her life needlessly and cruelly and all the years of life she had yet to enjoy were stolen from her. Wayne Couzens held a position of trust as a police officer and we are outraged and sickened that he abused this trust in order to lure Sarah to her death. The world is a safer place with him imprisoned.\n\"It is almost seven months since Sarah died and the pain of losing her is overwhelming. We miss her all the time. We hold her safe in our hearts.\"\nLucy Manning, BBC special correspondent, from the Old Bailey:\nAs Wayne Couzens was told he would spend the rest of his life in prison, he kept his head down as he has throughout his time in the dock. He was shaking as he was sentenced.\nThe Everard family looked on. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick was in court to hear the sentence. Her officer a convicted murderer and rapist.\nMr Justice Fulford told Couzens his offences were \"warped, selfish and brutal\". The judge said Sarah \"was simply walking home\".\nAfter Couzens was sentenced, police officers who investigated the murder hugged the Everard family. But as her parents and sister said yesterday, all they want is Sarah back and no punishment will ever compare to the pain and torture Couzens had inflicted on them.\nLord Justice Fulford paid tribute to the dignity of Ms Everard's family, whose statements in court on Wednesday \"revealed the human impact\" of Couzens' offending, which he said \"was both sexual and homicidal\".\nThe judge added that Couzens had eroded public confidence in the police in England and Wales.\nIn a letter she wrote before Dame Cressida spoke to reporters, senior Labour MP Harriet Harman called on the Met Police commissioner to resign. Ms Harman said women's confidence in the police \"will have been shattered\" and it would be impossible for Dame Cressida to oversee the changes needed to rebuild trust. \nHome Secretary Priti Patel said there were \"serious questions\" for the Metropolitan Police regarding the Couzens case, adding that the force \"will be held to account\". \nShe described the crimes as \"sickening\" and said it was right that this \"monster\" had been given a whole-life sentence.\nWhen Parliament abolished the death penalty more than 50 years ago, it promised the British people that the worst of the very worst offenders would be locked up in jail for the rest of their lives. \nSince then a series of complex rules for judges has evolved in order for a \"whole-life order\" (WLO) to be imposed.\nThe law says a WLO should \"normally\" only be considered if an offender has murdered more than once, killed a police or prison officer, abducted and sadistically killed a child, or where the motive was ideological. \nWhile MPs did not envisage such a serious crime as this when they wrote the law, they said judges could impose a WLO in other unthinkable cases where the seriousness of the crime was exceptionally high. \nLord Justice Fulford concluded the misuse of a constable's role to deceive, kidnap, rape and murder Sarah Everard was as bad as terrorism. It was not only a crime of appalling and prolonged suffering for the victim, but it undermined trust in the police - part of the bedrock of a safe society. \nAnd that is why the law allowed the judge to order Couzens will never be released.\nThe Old Bailey sentencing hearing had been told how Couzens used his Metropolitan Police-issue warrant card and handcuffs to abduct Ms Everard as she walked from Clapham to her Brixton home on the night of 3 March.\nThe firearms-trained parliamentary and diplomatic protection officer, who had clocked off from a 12-hour shift at the US Embassy that morning, drove to a secluded rural area near Dover where he raped Ms Everard.\nShe had been strangled with Couzens' police-issue belt by 02:30 GMT the following morning.\nCouzens, who was married with two children, then burned the marketing executive's body in a refrigerator in an area of woodland he owned in Hoads Wood, near Ashford, before dumping the remains in a nearby pond.\nOn 9 March, he was arrested at his home in Deal, Kent, after police connected him to the hire car he used to abduct Ms Everard. Her remains were found by police dogs the next day.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"sickened\" by the details that had emerged during sentencing.\n\"Our police are there to protect us - and I know that officers will share in our shock and devastation at the total betrayal of this duty. People must be able to walk on our streets without fear of harm and with full confidence that the police are there to keep them safe.\"\nJohn Apter, national chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said Couzens was \"an absolute disgrace to the police service\" and he was \"ashamed he was ever a police officer\".\n\"I am proud to carry a warrant card, but this vile individual's abuse of that authority has cast a shadow on all those who work within policing. He has brought disgrace to our uniform.\n\"The way he took advantage of Sarah's trust makes me feel sick to the stomach.\""

      "text": "Singer Gloria Estefan has revealed she was sexually abused by a family member when she was nine years old.\nThe Cuban-American pop star, 64, said she was molested while at music school by someone her mother trusted.\n\"Ninety-three per cent of abused children know and trust their abusers. And I know this because I was one of them,\" she said.\nShe spoke about the abuse for the first time in a Facebook Watch show alongside her grown-up daughter and niece.\nTV personality Clare Crawley also appeared on the episode of Red Table Talk: The Estefans, and spoke about how she was abused by a priest.\nMs Crawley said she had been abused by a \"counsellor\" while at Catholic school, and had been \"the victim of a predator\".\n\"I wanted to deal with this subject matter because it is so important to try to prevent. I also did not want to sit here quietly while you share and are brave,\" Ms Estefan told her.\nMs Estefan, who sang such hits as Conga and Rhythm is Gonna Get You, said on the programme a distant relative had exploited her mother's trust to molest her. \n\"You've waited for this moment a long time,\" Ms Estefan's niece, Lili, 54, told her. \"I have,\" the singer replied.\n\"He was family, but not close family. He was in a position of power because my mother had put me in his music school and he immediately started telling her how talented I was and how I needed special attention, and she felt lucky that he was focusing this kind of attention on me,\" she said.\nMs Estefan, who was born in Cuba but moved to Miami with her family when she was a toddler, said the abuse started \"little by little and then it goes fast\".\nThe three-time Grammy Award-winner said she was aware that she was in a \"dangerous\" situation, but could not ward the man off.\n\"I told him, 'This cannot happen, you cannot do this.' He goes: 'Your father's in Vietnam, your mother's alone and I will kill her if you tell her,'\" Estefan said.\n\"I knew the man was insane and that's why I thought he might actually hurt my mother.\"\nThe anxiety made her lose chunks of hair, she said, and eventually she told her mother about what was happening.\nAlthough her mother informed the police, they advised her not to press charges because she would \"go through worse trauma having to get on a stand and testify\"."

I have seen up close his commitment and dedication to the NHS and its staff, and indeed the toll that the role has taken on him personally.\"\nAt the Stormont health committee earlier, Mr Swann said he was concerned about the threat of violence by anti-vaxxers towards a number of people working in and for his department.\n\"What concerns me now is not just the level of opposition, it is also now the level of threat of violence that is actually being insinuated and targeted against a number of people both working in the health department and also in the vaccination programmes,\" he said.\n\"We are now seeing a different level of antagonism.\"\nIn a tweet, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said that Mr Swann is \"doing his best in difficult circumstances\" and that \"threats of this nature are a disgrace\".\n\"People can differ on policy but threatening a minister or any public representative has no place in our society,\" said the Lagan Valley MP. \nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the threats should be \"utterly condemned\"."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow. \nThe mental health of children and young people has not improved since last year's lockdown, with girls more affected than boys, a survey by NHS Digital suggests. It found one in six children in England had a probable mental disorder in 2021 - similar to 2020, and up from one in nine in 2017.\nThere has been no sign of improvement in petrol supplies at independent petrol stations, industry body the Petrol Retailers Association says, adding that more than a quarter (27%) of its members' petrol stations were out of fuel today due to delivery issues. The industry body represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,300 stations. The haulage industry says an existing shortage of lorry drivers has been made worse by a number of factors, including the pandemic, Brexit, and low wages.\nScotland's vaccine passport scheme - which will require people to prove they've had two doses of vaccine in order to enter clubs and other large events - will start on Friday as planned after a judge refused a legal challenge from nightclubs seeking to delay it. The industry lodged a legal challenge, saying the system was \"discriminatory\" and \"disproportionate\" but Lord Burns said it was an attempt to address \"legitimate issues\" of the pandemic in a \"balanced way\".\nThe rate of in-person GP consultations in England has changed little since the winter lockdown, data shows, with just 58% of patients seen face-to-face in August - the first full month following the ending of restrictions. That compares with 54% in January and over 80% before the pandemic. \nThe latest Bond movie has finally reached UK cinemas today after repeatedly being postponed due to the pandemic. No Time to Die is the 25th Bond movie and Daniel Craig's final outing as James Bond. Naomie Harris, who plays Moneypenny for the third time, said she is \"really hoping that it does entice people back into into cinemas and they feel comfortable doing that because it's such a special movie\".\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nHow long are children, struggling with mental health problems during the pandemic, waiting for treatment?\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Female police officers fear reporting male colleagues as they worry they will be abandoned if they need help on duty, says a former senior officer.\nEx-Met Ch Supt Parm Sandhu said female officers fear being \"kicked in\" while dealing with street violence.\nAnd a police watchdog inspector has admitted she would be concerned to approach a lone male officer at night.\nThey were speaking after Wayne Couzens was jailed for kidnapping, raping and killing Sarah Everard while an officer.\nThe 48-year-old abducted Ms Everard, 33, under the guise of an arrest as she walked home from a friend's home in south London on 3 March.\nSpeaking to Radio 4's The World at One, Ms Sandhu called the police service \"very sexist and misogynistic\".  \nShe told how she had been \"vilified\" after reporting an incident involving a male colleague.\nIn an environment dominated by male officers, any objections were often cast aside and the behaviour dismissed as \"banter\", the former senior officer said.\nMs Sandhu, who served in the Met for 30 years, said: \"A lot of women will not report their colleagues.\n\"What happens is that male police officers will then close ranks and the fear that most women police officers have got is that when you are calling for help, you press that emergency button or your radio, they're not going to turn up and you're going to get kicked in in the street.\n\"So you have got to be very careful which battles you can fight and which ones you can actually win.\"\nShe added that women officers who are married to male police officers \"won't report domestic violence either because of the same sort of issues\".\nMs Sandhu also called for change at the top - saying police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick \"cannot move with the times\".\nMeanwhile, Zoe Billingham, a senior inspector with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, told the BBC's Woman's Hour programme: \"We cannot dismiss Wayne Couzens as a one-off or an aberration.\"\nAsked if she would feel safe going to a male police at night with a problem, Ms Billingham replied: \"At this moment in time, like any other woman, I have concerns and reservations.\"\nAlso speaking on Radio 4, Labour MP Harriet Harman, chairwoman of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, called for \"a cultural change in the police service\".\nMs Harman said she had written to Home Secretary Priti Patel setting out 10 points that she believed need to be acted on immediately to regain women's trust in the police.\nAfter Ms Everard's murder, the police watchdog announced it was probing alleged failures by the Met to investigate two indecent exposure incidents linked to Couzens in February.\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is also investigating alleged failures by Kent Police to investigate a flashing incident linked to Couzens in 2015.\nMs Billingham told the BBC it was a \"watershed moment for policing\".\n\"What Wayne Couzens did to Sarah Everard has struck a hammer-blow to the heart of policing legitimacy in England and Wales, and it needs to be treated as such,\" she said. \nMs Billingham, who is responsible for inspecting 15 police forces including Kent - where Couzens previously worked - called for more vetting, screening and scrutinising of would-be police officers.\nShe referred to a 2019 report, led by her, which looked at police who abused their position for sexual purposes and said the report highlighted how - at the time - proper vetting did not take place when officers transferred between forces. \nThe outgoing inspector said she was not confident that the systems currently in place at police forces are enough to prevent another atrocity.\n\"There is an epidemic of violence against women and girls, and within policing male violence against women and girls is not prioritised enough, it's not taken seriously enough,\" she said.\nAlso speaking on Thursday, Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Tom Winsor said he had heard Couzens was known as \"the rapist\" by other officers at times during his career.\n\"Yes, I do know that,\" he said. \"And (he) also had allegedly a reputation in terms of drug abuse, extreme pornography and other offences of this kind.\"\nHe said there appeared to be a \"culture of colleague protection\" within the police service and warned that police officers were failing to raise concerns about colleagues who exhibit \"damaging or worrying\" characteristics.\nFollowing his sentencing, Dame Cressida called Couzens' actions \"a gross betrayal of everything policing stands for\". \n\"This man has brought shame on the Met. Speaking frankly, as an organisation we have been rocked.\""

      "tags": "Department for Education,Ofqual,Exams",
      "text": "GCSE and A-level grades in England will be returned to pre-Covid levels over the next two years, the government has announced.\nNext summer's results will be wound back to a \"mid-point\" between 2019 and 2021, after two years of unusually high grade inflation.\nMinisters say exams will happen but the option of teacher-assessed grades will be kept in reserve.\nPupils will get notice of exam topics in some subjects to aid revision.\nAnd there will be a choice of questions in some arts subjects, as well as materials such as formulae for maths and science subjects.\nThese modifications aim to protect pupils against lost learning due to the Covid pandemic.\nEducation Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says he is putting \"fairness at the heart\" of his plans for exams in 2022 and the year after.\nLast summer, exams were cancelled for the second year in a row due to the pandemic, and grades were again awarded by teachers. \nThis led to the proportion of pupils passing and scoring higher grades rising significantly for the second year in a row.\nBetween 2019 and 2021, the proportion of GCSEs, for example, awarded the top grades 7 to 9, rose nearly 12 percentage points to 28.9%. \nUsually the share of grades is held steady, by a system of comparable outcomes designed to maintain standards from one year to the next. Exam boards use statistics and predictions to maintain fairness in the system.\nChief regulator Dr Jo Saxton said: \"As we return to summer exams, in 2022 exam boards will set the grade boundaries based on a profile that reflects a mid-point between 2021 and pre-pandemic grading.\n\"This will provide a safety net for students, to reflect the disruption this cohort have experienced already in their course and recognising the fact that, because of the pandemic, most A-level students won't have taken public exams before.\n\"Our aim is to return to a pre-pandemic grade profile. \n\"But we don't think it would be fair on 2022's students to do it all in one go, given the disruption they have experienced. We will aim, therefore, to return in broadly two steps.\"\nDr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: \"The government and Ofqual are picking an arbitrary number out of the air in order to determine how many of each grade will be issued next summer. \n\"Such a random act undermines their argument that exams are the fairest way to assess students. \n\"Whilst last summer's system wasn't perfect, the grades at least were a reflection of what students themselves had done, rather than simply reflecting how much better or worse they were than their peers,\" she said.\nMinisters also confirmed a set of adaptations to exams including a choice of questions in English Literature, history, ancient history and geography.\nTeachers will also get information on the focus of exam content so they can guide students on what to revise - but not until February.\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, called for information on exam content to be shared earlier. \n\"It would also enable teachers to do the very best for each of their students, ensuring they cover as much of the specification as possible, and that they are well prepared for the exams and assessments,\" he said. \nBut Ian Bauckham, interim chairman of exams watchdog Ofqual, said that if exam topics were announced too early it could discourage students from covering as much content as possible. \nGiving three to four months notice was \"the right balance to strike\", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \nMr Zahawi\u202fsaid: \"We are committed to rigorous standards being fairly applied, and exams are the fairest way to assess students, which is why they will take place next year.\""

      "text": "With the jeers of Greta Thunberg ringing in their ears, climate ministers are holding final talks before a key UN conference in Glasgow. \nThe Swedish activist criticised the efforts of politicians to tackle climate change as \"30 years of blah, blah, blah\".\nBut despite the mockery, ministers say some progress is being made on a range of issues. \nThe meeting in Italy's financial capital Milan lasts until Saturday.\nEarlier this week Greta Thunberg lambasted the efforts of political leaders at a youth climate summit. \nShe was one of 400 young people who came to Milan to formulate a response to rising temperatures that will be presented to ministers here on Thursday.\nMs Thunberg will also meet Italy's prime minister Mario Draghi.\nOfficials believe that despite the criticism about the slow pace of progress, the wheels are beginning to move on a number of fronts. \nLast week at the UN General Assembly, announcements from China and the US on coal and climate finance, helped improve the prospects for the upcoming UN conference, known as COP26.\nNegotiators meeting at this \"pre-COP\" event are under pressure to clear the way for their bosses, the world's presidents and prime ministers who will meet in Glasgow at the start of COP26 in early November.\nOne of the big issues holding up progress is the question of money. \nDespite significant new promises, the wealthy nations are still around $20bn short of the long-promised $100bn a year that's meant to help poorer countries cope with rising temperatures.\n\"Isn't it ridiculous, that in the midst of a trillion dollar emergency response economy that we're seeing right now, we are haggling over a $20bn price tag to essentially unleash hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions of dollars of developing country investments,\" said the head of UNDP Achim Steiner.\nMr Steiner is a senior leader in the UN and has been a close observer of the climate talks process for many years. \n\"Time is running out, and we can't find a way in which we can finance this? It's just not acceptable,\" he told BBC News.\nWhile ministers will look to make progress on cash and other outstanding questions in their discussions here over the next few days, they will be heartened by new research showing that the 1.5C temperature threshold can be kept in sight at a relatively low cost over the next decade.\nThe report comes from the Energy Transitions Commission, a group made up of leaders from the energy industry, finance and climate advocacy.  \nThey outline six actions that could be taken by companies and countries which would go beyond the carbon cutting plans and would limit warming to 1.5C.\nThe key steps include:\n\"The 1.5C threshold is absolutely technologically possible at costs which the global economy could easily absorb,\" said Adair Turner, the chair of the Energy Transitions Commission.\n\"We broadly know the categories of what is possible. We have provided, we think, a robust quantification of what's possible. And there are specific initiatives which could be taken in addition to country's carbon cutting plans, which would get us there.\"\n\"And we need them because we're running out of time.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."

Because of the woman's age, the court is expected to sit for no more than two hours a day. A doctor was due to examine her to decide whether she should remain in custody.\nA group representing Nazi survivors and relatives of the dead expressed outrage that she had been able to escape. \"It shows incredible contempt for the rule of law and survivors,\" said the International Auschwitz Committee.\nThe case is seen as unprecedented as Irmgard Furchner was a civilian worker at Stutthof.\nShe had worked as a typist in the office of Stutthof camp commandant Paul-Werner Hoppe, near the modern-day Polish city of Gdansk, which was invaded by the Nazis at the start of the war and known as Danzig.\nFor two years before the end of the war in 1945, she was said to have known key details of what went on at the concentration camp.\nDuring Hoppe's 1954 trial she revealed how he had dictated messages to her but claimed she knew nothing of the Nazi murders at Stutthof.\nSome 100,000 people were held at Stutthof, which was notorious for atrocious conditions and 65,000 are estimated to have died.\nStutthof had gas chambers, and people were killed at the camp by gassing, shooting and lethal injection as well as death and starvation. More lost their lives on death marches from the camp as World War Two neared its end.\nThose killed at Stutthof include many Jews as well as non-Jewish Poles and captured Soviet soldiers.\nThursday's case marks one of the last ever Nazi trials, largely because few defendants are still alive. The trial is taking place in a juvenile court as the defendant was under the adult age at the time.\nIn March, a former Stutthof camp guard was declared unfit to stand trial, while last year another camp guard, Bruno Dey, was found guilty of complicity in the murder of more than 5,000 prisoners. He was given a suspended jail term."

      "tags": "Gangs,Prisons,Ecuador",
      "text": "Desperate families have gathered at a jail in Ecuador which police are trying to bring under control after fighting left at least 118 inmates dead. \nThe battle first broke out on Tuesday, with prisoners using explosives and firearms on each other.\nFamilies are seeking news on loved ones but with some victims decapitated or dismembered, identifying the bodies could take days.\nThe gang-related violence is the worst in Ecuador's history. \nWhat is happening inside the Guayas prison complex, also known as the Litoral Penitentiary, is unclear. \nOfficials said on Wednesday the jail was back under their control, but early on Thursday neighbours said they had heard explosions and gunshots.\nLate on Thursday, police regained control of the prison following a major operation involving 900 officers and army soldiers. the authorities said.\nPolice commander Tannya Varela told Reuters the death toll could rise further as security forces work their way through the jail. \n\"We have not yet completed the intervention in the penitentiary, so it is possible that there are other bodies inside, and some of the injured could die from their wounds,\" she said. \nThe fight first broke out on Tuesday when inmates from one wing of the prison crawled through a hole to gain access to a different wing, where they attacked rival gang members.\nPolice managed to get six cooks, who were trapped in the wing where the fight happened, to safety and only two police officers were injured. \nEcuador's prison director, Bol\u00edvar Garz\u00f3n, said that police had entered the prison on Tuesday and found 24 bodies. \nAccording to Mr Garz\u00f3n, there was renewed shooting inside the prison overnight Tuesday into Wednesday and as police went through the prison wings one by one, they found scores more bodies, bringing the death toll to 116. \nWith security forces inside and outside of the jail, families of inmates face an anxious wait.\nSome of the relatives said they had been sent photos and video from inside the prison but had been given no official confirmation as to whether their family member was among the victims. \nNewspaper El Comercio reported that one woman had recognised her husband in one of the videos. She said he was one of those who had been decapitated.\nBy Blanca Moncada Pesantes, Guayaquil\nWhen Ecuador's President Guillermo Lasso announced that the death toll had risen to 116 from the initial 24, dozens of families rushed to the forensic laboratory where the bodies of the victims are being taken. They want to find out where their loved ones are and if they are still alive.\nThey have yet to get an answer and their anxiety only increased as explosions could again be heard coming from Guayaquil's biggest prison, a sign that the gang war inside - said to be linked to the drugs trade - had not been brought under control.\nAmong them is Zenaida Moreira, 50, whose 23-year-old son was sent to the prison two years ago for stealing chairs from a school.\nMs Moreira fears the worst after having seen videos of the carnage inside the jail. \n\"I don't know if one of the bodies I saw was his. I saw a decapitated head, the face is similar to his, but the authorities are not saying anything.\"\nRead full story here\nThe fact that only two police officers have been injured but more than 100 inmates killed strongly suggests this is a war among inmates rather than an attempt at a prison uprising. \nLocal media are reporting that the brutal killings could have been ordered from outside the prison mirroring a power struggle between Mexican cartels currently under way in Ecuador.\nThe Litoral Penitentiary holds inmates from Los Choneros, an Ecuadorean gang which is thought to have links with Mexico's powerful Sinaloa drugs cartel.\nBut another Mexican criminal group, the Jalisco New Generation cartel (CJNG), is also trying to forge alliances with Ecuadorean gangs to seize control of drug smuggling routes leading from Ecuador to Central America from its Sinaloa rivals.  \nThe decapitations and the brutal nature of the violence seen inside the Litoral prison are hallmarks of the Mexican cartels, which often kill their rivals in the most gruesome ways to spread further terror.\nThis most recent prison fight is the deadliest in the history of Ecuador's prison system but there have been a number of brutal confrontations in the past year.\nIn February, 79 prisoners were killed in simultaneous fights at four jails, one of them Litoral Penitentiary.\nEcuador is a transit country for cocaine smuggled from neighbouring Peru and Colombia, and the powerful Mexican drug cartels are said to operate through local gangs.\nInside jails there are problems with overcrowding and a shortage of guards. Police are often met with prisoners who are heavily armed. \nAfter the latest incident, President Lasso declared a state of emergency in the prison system, which allows officials to suspend certain rights and use the military to regain control. \nHe also said support would be provided to inmates' relatives.

      "text": "The government has announced \u00a3500m of grants to help families struggling with the cost of living as other support schemes are withdrawn.\nRising prices - including spiralling energy bills - are making it harder for those on low incomes to make ends meet.\nThe end of furlough and the \u00a320 weekly top-up to universal credit will also remove support provided during Covid.\nLabour said the money \"falls well short of what is needed\".\nLocal councils in England will distribute the grants, which the government says will help millions of households pay for essentials like food and bills.\nThe cash will be made available in October. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive up to \u00a379m of the \u00a3500m.\nWork and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said that the government had helped millions of people over the pandemic.\n\"Many are now back on their feet but we know that some may still need further support. \n\"Our targeted Household Support Fund is here to help those vulnerable households with essential costs as we push through the last stages of our recovery from the pandemic.\"\nThe fund replaces the Covid-19 local support grant programme, which was designed to support those most in need across England with the cost of food, energy (heating, cooking, lighting), water bills (including sewerage) and other daily needs.\nThe new fund will run over winter and those in need of support should contact their local council, the government said.\nHouseholds struggling with the cost of food, heating, water and other essentials will be eligible for support.\nLast week, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng warned that many UK households could face a \"very difficult winter\", with fuel prices surging and the uplift in universal credit ending.\nFollowing widespread criticism from charities, opposition parties and some Conservative MPs, the government decided to offer additional support to the poorest families. \nThe government said the fund would bolster support from the Warm Home Discount which gives a \u00a3140 rebate on energy bills each winter to more than 2.2 million low-income households and the Cold Weather Payment which provides \u00a325 extra a week for poorer households when the temperature is consistently below zero.\nBut former Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, has told the BBC the announcement is an attempt to placate the \"concern\" among Tory MPs at the squeeze on household budgets.\n\"It shows me there is a realisation\" by ministers that \"there is a problem, but the scale isn't understood\", he said. \nHe said the benefits system was the best way to deal with the issue rather than providing more funding for local councils.\nAnd Labour's shadow child poverty secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC: \"What the government's announced today, I'm afraid, is a pretty thin veneer really.\n\"It's designed to give the impression that they're going to tackle the cost of living crisis, but in reality [...] it falls well short of what is needed.\"\nWith talk of a cost of living crisis increasing, this money is designed to help the most vulnerable through the winter months.\nIn the Treasury, there is an acknowledgement that a mixture of factors - inflation, energy prices, fuel prices among other things - will make the coming weeks challenging for some.\nThe cash though is designed to last five months and cover as many as 4 million people in England. \nSome are questioning why ministers are going ahead up ending the universal credit uplift at the same time. \nOpposition parties are still calling for a rethink - though that has been ruled out by government. \nHouseholders are facing a rise in energy bills as the cost of wholesale gas soars, and inflation saw a sharp increase in the year to August.\nRecent analysis by the Resolution Foundation think tank suggested that a typical low-income family with children could see their income fall by more than \u00a320 a week over the next six months.\nRemoving the universal credit top-up will be a \"catastrophic cut\" that could cause people's mental health problems to spiral, the charity Mental Health UK warned on Tuesday.\nVisits to its online mental health and money advice services have almost doubled in a year - from 30,760 in August 2020 to 60,214 last month.\nHousing charity Shelter has also warned that more expensive bills and the reduced benefit are creating a \"perfect storm\" for homelessness to rise this winter."

And your future is literally being stolen before your eyes.\"\nSome young activists had interrupted a previous speech by Italian Prime Minister Draghi. \nMr Johnson said he understood their actions. \n\"I saw the protesters earlier on. And frankly, you have every right to be angry with those who aren't doing enough to stop it.\"\nAll the senior politicians who've addressed this meeting say that lessons have been learned and that action on climate is now happening. \nMr Johnson pointed to the COP26 meeting in Glasgow at the start of November as a pivotal moment in tackling the issue. \nIf significant changes could be agreed on some key areas, COP26 would mark \"the beginning of the end of climate change.\"\nTo get there, Mr Johnson said, would need major progress on phasing out coal, ending the use of petrol and diesel cars, and planting \"trillions of trees\".\nA long-standing promise of cash for developing countries would have to be honoured, he said.\nTo signal that actions speak louder than words on climate, Mr Johnson's government today announced that it would require businesses bidding for major government contracts to commit to achieving net zero emissions. \nThe UK is believed to be the first country in the world to put such a measure in place. \nSteps like this might not be quite what youth activists are demanding. \nTheir proposals to leaders include giving young people \"meaningful participation\" in all decision making on climate change. \nThey are calling for the end of fossil fuels by 2030, as well as transparent climate finance systems and responsible and sustainable tourism.\n\"We are going completely in the wrong direction and unfortunately speeding into the wrong direction,\" Nisreen Elsaim from Sudan told the conference.\n\"I'm afraid that not only you, the old generation, but us will be the last generation to witness that planet as it is.\"\nAs the young people depart the stage here in Milan, environment ministers and key negotiators are arriving, hoping to see progress on some key issues.  \nThe aim is to clear the decks so that the presidents and prime ministers who arrive in Glasgow in November will be able to concentrate on a few major political decisions. \nWhile there is some sense of optimism, much more \"blah\" will be needed if Glasgow is going to be a success. \nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc"

We loved being a part of Sarah's world and expected her to have a full and happy life. \n\"The closest we can get to her now is to visit her grave every day.\"\nCouzens' two-day sentencing hearing has been told that Ms Everard's ordeal could be summarised as \"deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation, fire\".\nHe had worked on Covid patrols in January, the court heard, and so would have known the appropriate formal terms regarding potential breaches.\nMrs Everard said: \"In the evenings, at the time she was abducted, I let out a silent scream: 'Don't get in the car, Sarah. Don't believe him. Run.'\"\nThe family of Sarah Everard were dignified as they described losing a daughter, a sister and even future generations of children.\nMs Everard's sister Katie, mother Susan and father Jeremy all read out victim impact statements. Ms Everard's father and sister both directly addressed Couzens - who had his head bowed - demanding he look at them as they spoke.\nJeremy Everard told him: \"I can never forgive you for what you have done, for taking Sarah away from us\u2026 she was handcuffed and unable to defend herself. \n\"You burnt our daughter's body - you further tortured us - so that we could not see her again. You murdered our daughter and forever broke the hearts of her mother, father, brother, sisters, family and friends.\"\nKatie Everard asked Couzens: \"What could she have thought she had done wrong? What lies did you tell her? \n\"When did she realise that she wasn't going to survive the night?\"\nA week after she disappeared, Ms Everard's body was found in a woodland stream in Ashford, Kent, just metres from land owned by Couzens.\nHer body and clothes had been put inside a refrigerator and set alight before being moved in builders' bags.\nThe court heard that a couple of days after burning Ms Everard's body, Couzens took his wife and two children on a family trip to the woods.\nThe Metropolitan Police has released footage from an interview with Couzens in his home on 9 March where he claimed not to know Ms Everard after being shown her picture.\nMs Everard's sister Katie described packing up her younger sister's \"whole life\" when collecting her possessions from the Brixton flat she never returned to: \"Washing was left hanging and packages were waiting to be opened when she got home.\n\"But she never got home because a predator - you - was on the loose. Prowling the streets for hours looking for his prey.\n\"My only hope is that she was in a state of shock and that she wasn't aware of the disgusting things being done to her by a monster.\n\"I want to speak to her and hug her and hear her laugh and go out for dinners and drinks and dancing.\n\"All those conversations we can never have. There were so many things I wanted to share with her - trips abroad, being each other's bridesmaid, meeting her babies and being an aunty, growing old together and seeing who got the most wrinkles.\n\"You took her life. Children that will never be born. Generations that will never exist. \n\"Her future no longer exists.\"\nCouzens, who could be given a whole-life term, has admitted kidnap, murder and rape. He will be sentenced on Thursday."

      "text": "Greg Gilbert - the lead singer of indie band Delays - has died from cancer aged 44. \nHis wife Stacey Heale made an announcement on social media, saying he had \"gently slipped away into the stars\".\nFans and fellow musicians rallied to help Mr Gilbert when he was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer in 2016.\nIn August it was announced he had been taken off treatment and was receiving pain relief at a hospice.\nGreg's brother Aaron, who plays keyboards in the band, said in a statement on social media \"he was my brother and best friend\".\nHe added: \"Greg died surrounded in the endless love that us and all of you have given him on this journey, and we will never be able to fully express how much it meant to him and all of us to have you by our side lifting us up like a winged army. \n\"Your messages, your encouragement and your compassion have been our oxygen for the last five years. \n\"Thank you for sharing our grief, and for making it easier to carry at times while you were firefighting battles of your own, and thank you for making Greg such a special person in your lives. I'm so glad we all existed at the same time.\"\nAfter the NHS had said it could only offer further chemotherapy, a crowdfunding appeal launched by his wife called Give4Greg raised more than \u00a3215k for alternative treatment, doubling its initial target in 48 hours. \nFormed in Southampton in 2001 and originally called Corky, Delays have released four albums to date including their well-received debut Faded Seaside Glamour.\nThe band originally consisted of Gilbert, drummer Rowly, bassist Colin Fox and guitarist Dan Hall, who left before Gilbert's brother Aaron was invited to join.\nThroughout his illness, Gilbert documented his illness and treatment on social media through poetry and art.\nThe miniature, photorealistic biro sketches he created following his diagnosis were displayed at Southampton City Art Gallery in 2019, to complement its show Leonardo da Vinci: A Life in Drawing.\nMs Heale said: \"Greg was an extraordinary human - not of this world, I'm sure of that.\n\"His wonder at the world and creativity is something I've never seen in anyone else.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Department for Education,Ofqual,Exams",
      "text": "GCSE and A-level grades in England will be returned to pre-Covid levels over the next two years, the government has announced.\nNext summer's results will be wound back to a \"mid-point\" between 2019 and 2021, after two years of unusually high grade inflation.\nMinisters say exams will happen but the option of teacher-assessed grades will be kept in reserve.\nPupils will get notice of exam topics in some subjects to aid revision.\nAnd there will be a choice of questions in some arts subjects, as well as materials such as formulae for maths and science subjects.\nThese modifications aim to protect pupils against lost learning due to the Covid pandemic.\nEducation Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says he is putting \"fairness at the heart\" of his plans for exams in 2022 and the year after.\nLast summer, exams were cancelled for the second year in a row due to the pandemic, and grades were again awarded by teachers. \nThis led to the proportion of pupils passing and scoring higher grades rising significantly for the second year in a row.\nBetween 2019 and 2021, the proportion of GCSEs, for example, awarded the top grades 7 to 9, rose nearly 12 percentage points to 28.9%. \nUsually the share of grades is held steady, by a system of comparable outcomes designed to maintain standards from one year to the next. Exam boards use statistics and predictions to maintain fairness in the system.\nChief regulator Dr Jo Saxton said: \"As we return to summer exams, in 2022 exam boards will set the grade boundaries based on a profile that reflects a mid-point between 2021 and pre-pandemic grading.\n\"This will provide a safety net for students, to reflect the disruption this cohort have experienced already in their course and recognising the fact that, because of the pandemic, most A-level students won't have taken public exams before.\n\"Our aim is to return to a pre-pandemic grade profile. \n\"But we don't think it would be fair on 2022's students to do it all in one go, given the disruption they have experienced. We will aim, therefore, to return in broadly two steps.\"\nDr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: \"The government and Ofqual are picking an arbitrary number out of the air in order to determine how many of each grade will be issued next summer. \n\"Such a random act undermines their argument that exams are the fairest way to assess students. \n\"Whilst last summer's system wasn't perfect, the grades at least were a reflection of what students themselves had done, rather than simply reflecting how much better or worse they were than their peers,\" she said.\nMinisters also confirmed a set of adaptations to exams including a choice of questions in English Literature, history, ancient history and geography.\nTeachers will also get information on the focus of exam content so they can guide students on what to revise - but not until February.\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, called for information on exam content to be shared earlier. \n\"It would also enable teachers to do the very best for each of their students, ensuring they cover as much of the specification as possible, and that they are well prepared for the exams and assessments,\" he said. \nBut Ian Bauckham, interim chairman of exams watchdog Ofqual, said that if exam topics were announced too early it could discourage students from covering as much content as possible. \nGiving three to four months notice was \"the right balance to strike\", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \nMr Zahawi\u202fsaid: \"We are committed to rigorous standards being fairly applied, and exams are the fairest way to assess students, which is why they will take place next year.\""

I'm devastated. John and Lacey came into our lives and brought so much love and happiness and were adored by myself and their big sisters, forever loved and remembered.\"\nHe described his 13-year-old son as \"absolutely my mini-me\".\n\"Loving, fiery, funny and passionate with the most beautiful caring heart you could find,\" he said. \"Behind his tough exterior, he was the most loving son you could wish for. His love for his mum was amazing. He just wanted everyone to be happy.\"\nHe said his 11-year-old daughter was \"my TikTok queen, creating dance after dance\".\n\"Lacey also had another obsession, since Jack Grealish joined Man City she has become totally besotted with him, with a room full of Jack Grealish photos. Man City was her new favourite team,\" he said.\nConnie had been sleeping over at the house due to her friendship with Lacey.\nConnie's father, Charles Gent, said: \"I can't believe I'm even having to say this, or these words even cross my lips. The pain is indescribable. I wake up every morning hoping this has all been a terrible nightmare, but it's not. It's the unbearable reality that my little girl has gone.\n\"This by far is the hardest thing I've ever had to go through; it still doesn't even feel real.\"\nHer mother, Kerry Shelton, said: \"Anyone who knows Connie knows just how special she is. Connie had an amazing imagination and was always ready to put on a show, especially at Christmas when she would write plays to act out with her brothers and sister.\n\"At birthdays, Halloween or at any given chance Connie would be organising, making or baking. She always made things so special.\"\nTerri Harris's parents, Angela Smith and Lawrence Harris, issued a joint statement that described her as \"our daughter, our world, our everything\".\n\"From the day she was born, she was our princess and remained so until she was cruelly taken from us,\" they said.\n\"She was an amazing mum; her babies were her world. Terri and the children were well-respected in the community and known to many of the local shopkeepers and residents.\"\nThey said Terri was born and raised in East London until she was 17, when she moved to Sheffield with her mother, travelling to Essex when she could to be with her father. \n\"Terri would put herself out not just for her family and friends but anyone who needed her help,\" they said. \"She absolutely loved her work as a care worker and would go above and beyond for the people she cared for.\"\nMr Bendall, 31, of Chandos Crescent, is due to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 26 November.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

He will be sentenced in September.\nTwo officers are under investigation for possible breaches of professional standards in relation to the alleged flashing offence in London, said to have happened in a fast-food restaurant.\nIn total, the IOPC said 12 gross misconduct or misconduct notices had so far been served on police officers from several forces relating to the Couzens case.\nOne IOPC investigation is examining allegations that a probationary Met constable, who was at a cordon around a scene of investigation in the case, shared an \"inappropriate graphic\" with colleagues via social media. Three officers have been served with gross misconduct notices in relation to that allegation.\nThe IOPC is also looking into allegations that officers from several different police forces breached standards of professional behaviour by sharing via a messaging app information that was linked to the prosecution of Couzens.\nOne officer has been served with a gross misconduct notice and another six have received misconduct notices.\nAdditionally, the IOPC is examining the circumstances around Couzens sustaining head injuries in custody, on 10 and 12 March, while he was being held on suspicion of Ms Everard's murder.\nIt said all officers in that inquiry were being treated as witnesses.\nCouzens joined the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) in March 2011, leaving to work for the Met in September 2018.\nHe was initially based in Bromley in south-east London then moved to the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, where his primary role was uniformed patrols, mainly at a range of embassies in the central London.\nThe CNC said Couzens served for eight months at Sellafield in Cumbria before transferring to Dungeness, Kent, where he was based for the rest of his service.\nBefore joining the CNC, he was with Kent Police. \nThe CNC said Couzens underwent an \"enhanced level of vetting\" and had no records of complaints or misconduct made against him."

But increasingly the animals are drawn to cities, where they live off rubbish discarded by humans. \nTheir numbers have exploded across Europe, with the latest estimates now surpassing around 10 million across the continent. \nAs they have become more aggressive and more of a nuisance, many cities have employed a variety of strategies to cull their numbers. In Berlin, urban hunters have killed thousands of the animals but the problem persists.\nLast year police officers in Rome sparked outrage after they shot a family of wild boar that had wandered into a children's playground with tranquiliser darts and gave them lethal injections.\nYou may also be interested in:"

      "text": "Police could not have prevented an IRA mortar attack that killed a police constable in Newry, County Down in 1992, a report has concluded.\nBut the police ombudsman found there were failures in the investigation into Colleen McMurray's murder.\nOne of those thought to have been involved was a police informant but they were never treated as a suspect.\nHer family accused the Provisional IRA and the British government of being \"joint participants\" in her murder.\nThe PSNI said it was \"truly sorry\" for the shortcomings the ombudsman found in the police investigation.\nMrs McMurray, 34, was a passenger in a police car hit by a mortar bomb as it travelled along Merchants Quay.\nHer colleague, Paul Slaine, survived, but lost both his legs.\nMrs McMurray's family said she \"served all the communities without fear or favour and knew the risks involved in being an RUC police officer at that time\" but they \"strongly contend\" that her murder could have been prevented.\nThey are calling on Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis to establish a judge-led statutory inquiry into the murder as soon as possible.\nThe ombudsman's office has been looking into the case since 2004.\nIts investigators interviewed more than 90 witnesses, included 35 retired police officers.\nThe report said the original Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) investigation was undermined by its own Special Branch division, which did not provide information about potential suspects.\nThis included Person A, an IRA member who had been recruited as an informer shortly before the attack.\nHe was regarded as an explosives expert and was involved in the development of the technology used to trigger the mortar using a photographic flashgun.\nPerson A later claimed publicly that he had provided his handlers of prior warning of the attack.\nHowever, having assessed the intelligence evidence, ombudsman Marie Anderson is \"of the view\" that he gave no information which \"could have prevented or forewarned of\" the attack.\nShe added: \"(RUC) Special Branch had significant intelligence about Person A's possible role in the development of the detonation technology and possible links to previous IRA activity.\n\"In my view, he ought to have been treated as a suspect but I have not been able to identify any legitimate reason why this did not happen.\"\nMs Anderson said her report identified further investigative failings.\nThey included \"deficiencies in suspect and arrest strategies\".\nAlthough a number of arrests were made, no individuals have ever been made amenable for constable McMurray's murder.\nPSNI Assistant Chief Constable Mark McEwan apologised for what the police ombudsman identified as \"shortcomings in the handling of information and the subsequent police investigation\".\n\"As we have previously stated the practice and policies that govern intelligence matters and police investigations today are unrecognisable from what was in place at the time of the attack. \n\"I acknowledge the fact that the ombudsman has recognised this in her report. \n\"I also acknowledge that the ombudsman has recognised the operating context at the time; the lack of a legislative framework and the operational dangers faced by police officers serving their community.\"  \nHe added: \"Sadly it remains the case that no person has been brought to justice for this terrible crime and today, with the publication of the police ombudsman's report, when details of this brutal attack are fresh in people's minds, I would make a renewed appeal for the people who know who did this to come forward to us with information.\"\nMrs McMurray's husband, Philip, and her family said that the 17-year wait for the report has compounded the family's grief.\n\"The findings in this report, whilst welcomed in part, do not go far enough. It is clear that Special Branch held intelligence on key suspects involved in the murder of Constable McMurray.\n\"The families are of the view, because there was collusion between the PIRA and British Security Forces which is politically difficult for both the Provisional IRA and the British state to allow to be investigated.\"\nDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson welcomed the report but said that \"further questions remain\".\n\"This was a brutal PIRA [Provisional IRA] murder which robbed a family of their daughter and a husband of his wife. They had been married for just 18 months,\" he said.\n\"It also left Paul Slaine seriously disabled for the rest of his life, having lost both his legs in this mortar attack. \n\"The need for answers is unquestionable given what both families have endured.\"\nSir Jeffrey said he understood why the family would call for a judge-led inquiry, and said that victims' \"access to justice must never be closed down\".\nIf this was a one-off report then it would be more shocking, but it falls within what has become an established pattern around the murky world of intelligence gathering and the use of agents during the Troubles.\nThere will be many people that feel that the PSNI, because of its historical relationship with the RUC, are not well positioned to conduct historical investigations into these crimes.\nThese crimes remain unsolved, and in any other society would need full investigation.\nOf course, we know that the government is advancing legacy ideas that would close down all investigations and all prosecutions."

They stayed for no longer than 15 minutes,\" Amanda recalled.\n\"At that moment we were rendered incapable of any competent action or rational thought, it was paralysing. And then that was it, they left. We saw nobody else at all and haven't since. We weren't even asked to give statements to the police.\n\"Thankfully we had each other.\"\nAmanda added: \"Those who have been bereaved by suicide become an at-risk group and need specialist practical support, not just in the immediate aftermath but in the many months after.\"\nGetting support is vital, according to Si\u00e2n Angharad Retter, from Tremain, near Cardigan. \nHer brother Steffan, 26, took his own life in November 2018.\n\"It was an absolutely terrifying experience for me and my parents and it is so important to get support,\" she said.\n\"Soon afterwards, I and two others who had lost loved ones in similar circumstances formed the west Wales branch of LISS [Living in Suicide's Shadow].\n\"We are a group where everyone understands the pain of losing close relatives by suicide - the group gives us the opportunity to go out together and talk about experiences. \n\"Without support the whole process can be an extremely lonely experience.\"\nThe 2 Wish Upon a Star charity was founded in 2012 by Rhian Mannings following the sudden and unexpected death of her son George. Days later her husband Paul, 33, killed himself.\nThe charity has supported many families who have lost loved ones under the age of 25 - many of them by suicide.\nIn 2019, Ms Mannings petitioned the Welsh government to provide better support for families who unexpectedly lose their child or young adult.\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \"The loss of someone by suicide is tragic and individuals bereaved by suicide may have particularly complex feelings.\n\"We will shortly be publishing our national framework for the delivery of bereavement care in Wales. \n\"This will be supported by a \u00a31m bereavement support grant, which will be available to third sector bereavement providers. \n\"As part of this work, the National Suicide Prevention Co-ordinator for Wales is also working with key agencies to develop specific guidance to improve the response and support for people bereaved by suicide.\"\nDyfed-Powys Police has been asked to comment. South Wales Police said a number of questions have to be asked after a sudden death.\nMore information on organisations that can offer support is available at BBC Action Line"

      "tags": "France,Paris",
      "text": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been sentenced to a year in prison for illegally funding his unsuccessful 2012 re-election campaign. \nThe 66-year-old was found guilty in a Paris court of spending tens of millions of euros more on his campaign than was permitted under the law.\nHe will not be jailed, however, and can serve his sentence at home with an electronic bracelet, the court ruled.\nMr Sarkozy, who denies any wrongdoing, described the ruling as an \"injustice\".\nHe said he would go \"right to the end\" to seek \"truth and justice\". His lawyer added that he would appeal the verdict. \nThis is Mr Sarkozy's second one-year prison term. In March, he became the first former president of France to receive a custodial sentence - for corruption and influence peddling - but remains free pending an appeal of that sentence. \nIn the latest trial, Mr Sarkozy was accused with 13 other defendants over their role in the so-called \"Bygmalion\" scandal.\nProsecutors said the former president's UMP party splurged nearly double the \u20ac22.5m (\u00a319.4m) cap on lavish campaign rallies and events, then tried to hide the costs by hiring a PR firm called Bygmalion to invoice the party, not the campaign.\nOn Thursday, the court in Paris ruled that though the former president may not have known the full details of the fraud, he must have seen that limits were breached and did nothing about it.\nIt is the latest legal challenge for Mr Sarkozy, who served a five-year term as president from 2007.\nIn 2012, he lost his re-election bid to socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. Since then he has been targeted by several criminal investigations.\nEarlier this year he was given a suspended prison sentence for trying to bribe a judge in 2014."

      "tags": "Rishi Sunak,Cost of living,UK economy",
      "text": "The government has announced \u00a3500m of grants to help families struggling with the cost of living as other support schemes are withdrawn.\nRising prices - including spiralling energy bills - are making it harder for those on low incomes to make ends meet.\nThe end of furlough and the \u00a320 weekly top-up to universal credit will also remove support provided during Covid.\nLabour said the money \"falls well short of what is needed\".\nLocal councils in England will distribute the grants, which the government says will help millions of households pay for essentials like food and bills.\nThe cash will be made available in October. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive up to \u00a379m of the \u00a3500m.\nWork and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said that the government had helped millions of people over the pandemic.\n\"Many are now back on their feet but we know that some may still need further support. \n\"Our targeted Household Support Fund is here to help those vulnerable households with essential costs as we push through the last stages of our recovery from the pandemic.\"\nThe fund replaces the Covid-19 local support grant programme, which was designed to support those most in need across England with the cost of food, energy (heating, cooking, lighting), water bills (including sewerage) and other daily needs.\nThe new fund will run over winter and those in need of support should contact their local council, the government said.\nHouseholds struggling with the cost of food, heating, water and other essentials will be eligible for support.\nLast week, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng warned that many UK households could face a \"very difficult winter\", with fuel prices surging and the uplift in universal credit ending.\nFollowing widespread criticism from charities, opposition parties and some Conservative MPs, the government decided to offer additional support to the poorest families. \nThe government said the fund would bolster support from the Warm Home Discount which gives a \u00a3140 rebate on energy bills each winter to more than 2.2 million low-income households and the Cold Weather Payment which provides \u00a325 extra a week for poorer households when the temperature is consistently below zero.\nBut former Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, has told the BBC the announcement is an attempt to placate the \"concern\" among Tory MPs at the squeeze on household budgets.\n\"It shows me there is a realisation\" by ministers that \"there is a problem, but the scale isn't understood\", he said. \nHe said the benefits system was the best way to deal with the issue rather than providing more funding for local councils.\nAnd Labour's shadow child poverty secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC: \"What the government's announced today, I'm afraid, is a pretty thin veneer really.\n\"It's designed to give the impression that they're going to tackle the cost of living crisis, but in reality [...] it falls well short of what is needed.\"\nWith talk of a cost of living crisis increasing, this money is designed to help the most vulnerable through the winter months.\nIn the Treasury, there is an acknowledgement that a mixture of factors - inflation, energy prices, fuel prices among other things - will make the coming weeks challenging for some.\nThe cash though is designed to last five months and cover as many as 4 million people in England. \nSome are questioning why ministers are going ahead up ending the universal credit uplift at the same time. \nOpposition parties are still calling for a rethink - though that has been ruled out by government. \nHouseholders are facing a rise in energy bills as the cost of wholesale gas soars, and inflation saw a sharp increase in the year to August.\nRecent analysis by the Resolution Foundation think tank suggested that a typical low-income family with children could see their income fall by more than \u00a320 a week over the next six months.\nRemoving the universal credit top-up will be a \"catastrophic cut\" that could cause people's mental health problems to spiral, the charity Mental Health UK warned on Tuesday.\nVisits to its online mental health and money advice services have almost doubled in a year - from 30,760 in August 2020 to 60,214 last month.\nHousing charity Shelter has also warned that more expensive bills and the reduced benefit are creating a \"perfect storm\" for homelessness to rise this winter."

      "title": "Covid: What impact has the furlough scheme had?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Employment,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "For the past 18 months the government has been subsidising the wages of employees hit by the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe furlough scheme was the centrepiece of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's \"unprecedented\" intervention in the economy, designed to stave off a wave of job losses as the country closed down in the face of the virus.\nIt protected the incomes of millions of people across the UK working sectors that could no longer operate, such as live music, nightclubs, the travel industry, business events, hospitality and retail businesses. \nNow that scheme is ending, requiring firms to shoulder full responsibility for those employees again or let them go.\nDuring the lifetime of the scheme about 11.6 million jobs were supported, with a steep take-up in the first few months especially.\nThat doesn't mean the government was ever paying 11 million people's wages at the same time.\nAccording to data from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), the number of people on furlough peaked at 8.9 million on 8 May last year. It then fell steadily until late 2020, when it picked up again, without ever hitting the heights of the first lockdown.\nSince then, numbers have continued to fall, although around 1.6 million were still relying on the scheme at the end of July, the last date for which figures are available from HMRC.\n\"To all those at home right now, anxious about the days ahead, I say this: you will not face this alone,\" the chancellor said, announcing the furlough scheme in March 2020.\nAlthough he has since become one of the country's best-known politicians, Mr Sunak was fairly new in his post at the time, and he had just kicked off his chancellorship with a Budget that included a jawdropping a \u00a330bn package to boost the economy and get the country through the virus outbreak.\nBut it turned out to be nowhere near enough. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, to give furlough its official title, along with other support measures, would end up incurring a far bigger bill, requiring the government to borrow much more than it would in normal times, month after month.\nUnder the scheme, the government initially paid 80% of the wages of people who could not work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of \u00a32,500.\nBut by the end of the scheme the government was contributing only 60%, with employers shouldering a 20% share themselves\nOverall it cost the government nearly \u00a370bn, but has been praised by the Resolution Foundation think-tank as a \"great success\", protecting people's living standards and preventing what many feared would be a catastrophic rise in unemployment.\nWhile workers were furloughed in every age group it was younger workers who accounted for a large proportion of those on furlough.\nYounger people were more likely to be employed in the sectors of the economy worst hit by the coronavirus lockdown measures including hospitality and retail.\nSince March 2020, more women than men have been furloughed although according to the latest figures more men remained on furlough towards the end of the scheme.\nSome sectors of the economy made more use of the furlough scheme than others.\nWith pubs and restaurants particularly badly affected by coronavirus curbs, the hospitality industry saw a high number of workers furloughed.\nAnd non-essential shops were closed at the height of the lockdown, so retailers made big claims on the government's resources. However, some large employers in that sector, notably supermarkets - who remained open during lockdowns, have since repaid the cash.\nPeople working in the arts, entertainment and other leisure activities were also more likely to find themselves on furlough than those in other walks of life.\nThe scheme was designed to keep people connected to jobs that would return after the pandemic peak passed. \nHowever over the last 18 months some of those on furlough have been made redundant, especially during the period late last year when it looked as though the furlough scheme was coming to an end.\nIn recent months, as the economy reopened and continued to grow, the number of redundancies has fallen.\nThe Resolution Foundation has described the furlough scheme overall as \"a very successful and well-implemented policy intervention\".\nBut its recent research suggested there remained a \"real risk\" to the jobs of those still on the scheme as it ends, particularly for those in parts of the travel sector, which still hasn't returned to normal operation, and for older workers.\nAnd doubts have been voiced in other quarters over some aspects of the scheme.\nIt has drawn fire from the Commons Public Accounts Committee, which wants all firms benefiting from the scheme to be named publicly in the interests of transparency.\nThe committee has spoken dismissively of \"hastily drawn up economic support schemes\" that provided \"unacceptable room for fraud against taxpayers\".\nHMRC, which administered the furlough scheme, has suggested that up to 10% of the money delivered by the scheme to mid-August 2020 - \u00a33.5bn - may have been paid out in fraud or error.\nApart from that, there is the question of whether it has delayed the process of people making the shift from jobs that are no longer viable to take up new opportunities.\nThe number of vacancies fell sharply during the early stages of the pandemic, but job vacancies are now considerably up on last year with staff shortages affecting several sectors.\nSome have blamed furlough for keeping workers out of action during the last few months, waiting to see if their old jobs will still be there for them, when some firms have been desperately trying to recruit new workers. \nAre you coming to the end of your furlough?

      "tags": "Job Retention Scheme,Employment,UK economy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The furlough scheme closes on Thursday, with uncertainty ahead for people who have not yet fully returned to work.\nNearly one million workers were expected to be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation.\nOf those on furlough in late July, about half on the scheme were able to work some of the time, the HMRC says.\nSince the start of the pandemic, it has helped pay the wages of 11.6 million workers.\nBut many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment as it ends.\nThe chancellor said he was \"immensely proud\" of the near \u00a370bn scheme, but now was the right time to close it, despite calls for further support from some badly-hit companies. \nThe travel sector has suffered more than most during the pandemic, with businesses being affected by changing restrictions and lower consumer confidence.\nMark Andrew, the director of Animal Aircare, which helps pets travel overseas via Gatwick Airport, said some of his staff may be made redundant if business does not improve.\nThe firm has not yet had to lay off staff, which Mr Andrew said was \"purely down to furlough\".\n\"Furlough ending means there's a real question mark for our business. We're still waiting for Gatwick to pick up... it seems the airline industry is not buoyant enough yet,\" he said.\nAlthough the end of the scheme comes amid a record number of job vacancies, Fidelity International's investment director, Maike Currie, told the BBC that \"no-one really knows what is next\".\n\"I think what we can be certain of is that we'll see under-employment, where employees return to work but possibly not on a full-time basis and that they might need to supplement their income.\"\nFurlough was introduced in March 2020 after Covid-19 forced large parts of the UK economy to close.\nOfficially known as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, it saw the government pay towards the wages of people who could not work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of \u00a32,500.\nAt first it paid 80% of their usual wage, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%.\nThere have been big recruitment drives for hospitality staff, HGV drivers and warehouse workers as businesses get back on their feet.\nLatest official figures show the UK's economy grew by 5.5% between April and June - revised up from the initial estimate of 4.8%.\nThe uplift was largely driven by household spending rebounding after lockdowns, although many firms are now being held back by current labour shortages.\n\"Any hope that the end of the furlough scheme might be the magic wand to solve the supply chain crisis is likely to be wishful thinking,\" said Susannah Streeter, from Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThere is likely to be a big mismatch of skills and experience between those leaving the furlough scheme and the jobs on offer, she added.\nChief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke told the BBC: \"We think there are probably two million fewer people unemployed than would have been the case if this scheme hadn't been introduced. \n\"I think it's done an enormous amount to shield our economy and our society from the worst of Covid.\"\nThe scheme has also been praised by the Resolution Foundation think tank as a \"great success\".\nIts senior economist Dan Tomlinson said furlough had been \"as critical to fighting the Covid crisis as nationalising the banks was to fighting the global financial crisis\".\nBut the foundation's recent research suggested that a small rise in unemployment was a \"real risk\" for those still on the scheme as it ends, particularly older workers or those in the travel sector.\nWhen the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme started, it was described as a bridge over the pandemic uncertainty. \nIt has succeeded in keeping the official unemployment numbers at less than half pre-pandemic expectation. For that reason it has proven value for money, despite costing over \u00a368bn.\nBut there is now some uncertainty over the fate of the million or so workers still having their wages subsidised. \nNew analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies points to regional differences, with London workers for example the most likely still to be furloughed. Older workers are also disproportionately still on the scheme.\nIndustries that are yet to return to normal, such as the airport sector, had called for the scheme to be kept in some form. Unions also argue that the UK should follow Germany in maintaining a form of the scheme for future crises. \nCertainly a precedent has been set in that the government is willing to spend billions on wage increases if large-scale increases in unemployment are avoided. \nAlthough a million vacancies do not map on to the same number still on furlough, it is clear that many industries are having to welcome back more furloughed workers. Partly out of fear of being caught out by worker shortages later down the line.\nFor many of those returning to work, conditions will not be the same as pre-pandemic.\nJess Pitman was furloughed from her job as marketing manager at a travel firm two weeks after the scheme was introduced.\nThe company she works for specialises in organising trips abroad to raise money for charities, but travellers cancelled their plans when Covid hit.\nThe firm's payroll has been reduced from 27 to just five and the 29-year-old will return to work part-time, topping up her income with freelance work.\n\"I feel really torn about the end of furlough, and I'm really sad for the travel industry as a whole,\" Jess said.\n\"I know a lot of people in the industry will be made redundant... I think we'll lose a lot of talented people, which is really disappointing.\"\nA spokesperson for the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) warned that companies in the sector still face \"extreme difficulties\" because of continued travel restrictions.\nAbta called for sector-specific support for smaller firms in particular, who have lost two summers of sales, as well as those which specialise in destinations still subject to red list rules.\n\"The government needs to look at how it can support these businesses... through a package of tailored financial support,\" the spokesperson added.\nElsewhere, the Federation of Small Businesses also cited concerns over a \"colder environment\" for business.\nEmployers and workers alike will have to cope with the end of the furlough scheme, as well as the scrapping of an incentive for hiring apprentices, rising energy bills and the planned cut to Universal Credit in October.\nHowever, the Treasury said generous support was being provided through its \"Plan for Jobs\", which it said was part of a \u00a3400bn spending package.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said he was \"immensely proud of the furlough scheme, and even more proud of UK workers and businesses whose resolve has seen us through an immensely difficult time\".\nAre you using the furlough scheme?

      "tags": "Keir Starmer,Labour Party",
      "text": "Sir Keir Starmer has said Labour will never again go into an election without a \"serious plan for government\", in a speech to his party conference.\nHe said the country faced a \"big moment\" that \"demands leadership\" - and as prime minister he would provide it.\nSir Keir set out new policies on mental health, education and housing, but it was also a highly personal speech about his own background and values.\nHe got a standing ovation, but was heckled by some left-wingers.\nSir Keir told those barracking him in the Brighton Centre that he was about \"changing lives\" not \"shouting slogans\", to cheers from other delegates.\nAfter a week dominated by rows with the left, Sir Keir urged activists to come together to beat the Conservatives, at a time when energy bills are rising, petrol supplies are running short and the economy is recovering from the pandemic.\n\"These are big issues, but our politics is so small,\" he told delegates. \"So our politics needs to grow to meet the scale of the challenge.\"\nThe 89-minute speech was Sir Keir's first chance to address a full Labour conference since becoming party leader 17 months ago, as last year's event was held largely online because of Covid.\nAddressing a packed auditorium, he said he would \"not stand for the record levels of knife crime that we have in this country today\" and called Labour a party of \"patriots\".\nHe spoke at length about his background, focusing on his previous career as a human rights lawyer and his mother's years of suffering from Still's disease, a form of inflammatory arthritis which severely restricts mobility.\nSir Keir described his parents as \"the two rocks of my life\", saying his father, a toolmaker, had given him a \"deep respect for the dignity of work\".\nHe contrasted his life with that of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whom he described as a \"trickster\", a \"trivial man\" and a \"showman with nothing left to show\".\nWith Labour having lost four general elections in a row, the last one by the biggest margin since the 1930s, Sir Keir attempted to distance himself from the policies of ex-leader Jeremy Corbyn.\nWhile he did not mention his more left-wing predecessor by name, he said: \"We will never under my leadership go into an election with a manifesto that is not a serious plan for government.\n\"It will not take another election defeat for the Labour Party to become an alternative government in which you can trust.\"\nBy contrast, Sir Keir paid tribute to the party's 13 years in power under prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, saying they had cut child and pensioner poverty, taken on more teachers and nurses and reduced hospital waiting times.\n\"You want levelling up?,\" he asked. \"That's levelling up.\"\nAt the start of his speech Sir Keir was repeatedly shouted at by one woman in the audience, but replied: \"I normally get heckled by the Tories at this time of the week, so this doesn't bother me.\"\nSir Keir Starmer deliberately took his time to spell out his vision to voters that Labour has lost. \nIn an effort to connect with them, he spoke in personal terms about his parents and their influence on his political beliefs, revealing more about what drives him. \nPersistent hecklers in the hall were a reminder that support for Sir Keir within Labour is far from unanimous, but they may not hurt his attempt to show he's closing the door on the Corbyn era. \nThere were some policy announcements, but the main message to voters was an appeal to look again at Labour after four election defeats in a row. \nThe speech was also a challenge from Sir Keir to his party to change if wants to win again.\nIt was the longest, most detailed argument he has yet made that he is the man to lead it back into Downing Street.\nMoving on to policies, he announced that a Labour government would upgrade 19 million homes so that they reach a minimum \"Band-C\" energy efficiency level, providing grants for low-income households to achieve this and low-interest loans for others.\nThe changes would include better insulation, double glazing and new heating systems, saving households \u00a3400 a year in bills on average, he promised.\nOther pledges in the speech included:\n\"I can see the ways in which we can remake this nation and that's what we get to do when we win,\" Sir Keir said.\n\"So let's get totally serious about this - we can win the next election.\"\nSir Keir's speech ended a five-day conference which saw him get backing for changes to the way the party elects its leaders, against fierce opposition from the left, who feel they are being marginalised.\nOn Monday, shadow employment secretary Andy McDonald quit Labour's front bench, saying he had been ordered to argue against raising the minimum wage to \u00a315 an hour.\nThe next day, the conference backed a motion calling for this to be party policy, although this is not binding on the leadership.\nAnd delegates voted in favour of nationalising the UK's energy industry, despite Sir Keir ruling this out.\nThe leader also angered the left when he pushed through changes to the way Labour elects its leaders.\nReacting to Sir Keir's speech, left-wing Labour activist group Momentum said it had \"identified a lot of problems but offered very few solutions\".\n\"We all know that the NHS crisis is bad, but what will our party do about it? We are no clearer on that than we were this morning,\" it added.\nThe trade union Unite said there \"wasn't much\" in it about the cost of living and workers' rights.\nBut Christina McAnea, general secretary of the union Unison, said the Labour leader had demonstrated \"vision\" and shown the party \"could bring hope to the many families forgotten by this government\", adding: \"This is a serious plan for change\".\nConservative Party co-chairman Oliver Dowden said: \"As Labour's chaotic conference comes to an end, it is clear Sir Keir Starmer's party is more divided than ever and has no plan.\n\"Labour spent five days talking to themselves about themselves instead of to the country.\""

      "tags": "Sarah Everard murder,Deal,Metropolitan Police Service,Brixton",
      "text": "The murder of Sarah Everard sparked a national outcry, spurring women to share their experiences of feeling unsafe on the streets. Many included a sense of the teller lining themselves up shoulder-to-shoulder with her: \"She was the same age as me\", \"I used to live near her\", \"I've walked the same route\".\nMs Everard didn't set herself up to be such an everywoman, a symbol of longstanding - and ongoing - violence against women. She had no choice in her name becoming a battle cry for change. \nThe private, excoriating grief of friends and family seems to have been subsumed by the wider - albeit important and valid - reactions of protest and polemic, marches and mass mourning. \nSarah Everard was a daughter, sister, friend and colleague. According to those in the know, she was dreadful at karaoke but \"brilliant\" at everything else. \nThere were just 38 minutes between the time this \"clever, articulate and caring\" woman left a friend's house and the last time she was seen. \nThe final image of her, captured by a bus camera, also showed a white Vauxhall Astra with its hazard lights on and both front doors open.\nThe car had been hired specifically for kidnapping a woman. It was returned to the rental company the following morning, having served its purpose.\nSarah Everard was dead.\nHer body was found a week later in a woodland stream in Ashford, Kent, where her killer owned a patch of land. \nA complete stranger, a police officer, had kidnapped, raped and murdered her.\nHe knew what he was doing, this man who killed her for his own gratuitous wants.\nOutwardly, he had what appeared to be a perfectly ordinary life. A responsible job. Wife and children. A house in Deal in Kent he shared with them.\nBut the 48-year-old officer's fa\u00e7ade hid the actions of a sexual predator who had been planning the crime - although not yet selecting his victim - in chilling detail. On 28 February, three days before he killed Ms Everard, he had been accused of indecent exposure in a branch of McDonald's. It wasn't the first time.\nThe very same day, he bought a roll of self-adhesive plastic described as \"carpet protector\" and booked the hire car he would use to abduct the marketing executive. He arranged for time off work.\nAfter he killed Ms Everard, he bought builders' bags, a tarpaulin and a cargo net, wiped his phone and concocted an implausible and time-wasting web of lies about his involvement in her disappearance.\nThat they won't have to sit through the grisly evidence and twisted lies of a trial must be scant relief to her loved ones.\nMs Everard should have had a brilliant future, a lot to look forward to. She had bounced back after a relationship breakup and was seeing someone new. She had just started a new job. \nShe, her boyfriend Josh Lowth and four others were planning a trip to Ibiza at the end of summer.\nOne of Ms Everard's friends said: \"What I loved about her was that she had depth. She wasn't a vapid, nice person. She had opinions, sarcasm and wanted things to be better. \n\"We could trust her to fight the good fight.\"\nMs Everard grew up in York, with an older brother and sister. Her father was a professor and her mother a charity worker.\nDescribed by her family as \"bright and beautiful\", \"kind and thoughtful\", \"caring and dependable\", she \"always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour. She was strong and principled and a shining example to us all\".\nRose Woollard has been a close friend of Ms Everard since university, and was one of the first to become alarmed. She contacted the BBC in an attempt to raise awareness before Ms Everard's disappearance had become an official police investigation.\nMs Woollard said: \"Sarah has always been an exceptional friend, dropping everything to be there to support her friends, whenever they need her.\n\"It was only recently that she was telling me the good news about her new role, which she was excited to start.\"\n\"She was sunshine and light, and made you feel warm and good and safe,\" said another friend. \"I feel angry about it as well, but my main anger is that it happened to her.\"\nA former colleague said: \"Sometimes you meet a person with a beautiful soul and it shines through. \n\"There is nothing anyone can say that will make things better for her family and loved ones. They must be in hell. I can only say that Sarah was a very special person and will be missed by so many.\"\nThe uproar over Ms Everard's death, and what she has come to represent, led one friend to say: \"I would like to just say who she was to me, as a person. \n\"Finding the right words is so hard. \n\"I can't sum her up in a few well-chosen words, nor express what she meant to me by sharing memories. I can only skim the surface now in the wake of the horror and the anger, and work through the rest alone in the weeks and months to follow.\n\"Sarah was open. Honest. Unflinching in her ability to listen and empathise. There are some people you know for a relatively short time, but whom you instantly strike up a close bond with due to your similarities - Sarah was one of these people. We shared a lot, and I was never in any doubt of her discretion or sincerity in her support and kindness. We laughed, we cried. We talked about the future. \n\"She should be here.\"\nA simple post on Facebook on 14 June said: \"Happy Birthday Sarah Everard. I miss you today, and every single day\".\nWhen she was taken, Ms Everard was less than a mile from her flat in Brixton. The killer had been cruising around for more than four hours before he saw her for the first time. Years of predatory behaviour, days of planning, hours of scouting, and mere minutes to trap his prey.\nThis was a decision he made. It was not a frenzied attack in which a person loses self-control. It was cool-headed and clinical. \nInvestigators are looking into the hypothesis he used his police ID card as a means to stop Ms Everard, under the guise of questioning her about Covid restrictions.\nAt any point he could have driven away. \nHe chose not to."

      "tags": "Depression,Mental health",
      "text": "Many people who have taken anti-depressants for at least two years may be able to stop them without relapsing, but most will still need long-term treatment, a UK study suggests.\nPrescriptions for the drugs have more than doubled in the past 15 years because people are staying on them for much longer. \nBut it's not clear how well they work over many years.\nThe researchers say they want to find out who is benefitting and who isn't.\nTheir findings, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, show 44% of people who gradually stopped taking their anti-depressants did not have another bout of depression in the following year.\nOf people who continued to take their medication as normal, 61% did not relapse.\nStudy author Dr Gemma Lewis, from University College London, said: \"Our findings add to evidence that for many patients, long-term treatment is appropriate, but we also found that many people were able to effectively stop taking their medication when it was tapered over two months.\"\nThe researchers said it was important to consult a doctor before doing this. They also said psychological therapies could help prevent a relapse, although there was often a waiting list.\nProf Glyn Lewis, also from UCL, said: \"Anti-depressants are effective but, like many medications, are not ideal for everyone.\"\nThe 478 adults involved in the study were recruited from 150 GP surgeries across England, and all had been taking anti-depressants for at least two years and felt ready to come off them.\nThey were separated into two groups - in one, people continued to take their medication while in another, their drugs were tapered off over three months - and followed up for a year.\nOf those who stopped taking anti-depressants, 56% said they relapsed or felt depressed again for more than two weeks at some point. They were also more likely to experience symptoms of withdrawal, which could be confused with a relapse and may mean some people need to come off the drugs more slowly, the researchers said.\nDespite this, only half chose to start taking anti-depressants again, and by the end of the study, 59% of the group who had stopped the drugs were no longer taking any depression medication.\nEven in the group which continued taking their medication, more than a third said they felt depressed at some stage.\nThe research team does not know why some people seem able to come off their anti-depressants and some cannot, but predicting who can stop them safely is the next challenge.\nWith prescriptions for anti-depressants increasing, there are concerns that more and more people could end up taking them for life - and the risks of long-term use are still unclear.\nStudy author Prof Tony Kendrick, from the University of Southampton, says long-term use in people over 65 may be leading to more falls, strokes and seizures - but the overall risks are low, and it is not known whether it is the drugs causing these issues, or underlying health problems.\nYounger middle-aged patients reported far fewer side-effects from taking anti-depressants for many years.\nProf Kendrick said he was \"cheered\" by the findings which showed people were not taking the drugs \"unnecessarily\".\nThe medications in the study are some of the most commonly prescribed - citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine or mirtazapine. Other drugs, which are more difficult to withdraw from, were not studied.\nProfessor Sir Simon Wessely, regius chair of psychiatry at King's College London, said the study was \"very important\", and would help patients make an informed choice.\n\"Yes, you can come off medication, provided it's done slowly, but there is a small, but not insignificant, risk of another illness,\" he said.\n\"As ever there is no right answer, but this study provides more information to assist people in making up their minds.\"\nMental health charity Mind said it wanted to make sure that people have access \"to a range of treatments and are able to have open discussions with their GP\".\nThese discussions should include any possible side effects so people feel they can change or withdraw from medication safely, it said. \nResearchers from the universities of York, Southampton and Bristol, and McMaster University in Canada, were also involved in the study."

      "tags": "Scottish government,Vaccine passports",
      "text": "Major problems have been reported with Scotland's Covid vaccine passport app, just hours after its launch.\nPeople now need proof they have had two doses of vaccine in order to enter nightclubs and many other large events.\nThe NHS Scotland Covid Status app only became available to download on Apple and Android devices at about 17:30 on Thursday.\nBut many people have said they were unable to access their vaccination status through the app.\nThe Scottish government said more than 70,000 people had downloaded the app on on Thursday, with a spokesman adding: \"This huge demand did mean that some people experienced delays and we are sorry that happened.\n\"We have now increased the capacity of the NHS systems that sit behind the app - where most of the issues causing delays have occurred - in order to deal with demand and, as a result, we are seeing increasing numbers of people now able to access their records.\"\nAnecdotal evidence on social media suggested that problems may have arisen when people tried to use their NHS CHI number to register.\nThis step comes after users are asked to take a picture of their passport or driving licence.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said there should be an \"indefinite delay\" to the rollout of the new scheme to avoid a \"weekend of chaos\" at venues across the country. \nHe added: \"Thousands of people will be at the football and going out to hospitality premises this weekend.\n\"This plan should really be scrapped altogether but, if the SNP insist on charging ahead, they must indefinitely delay the vaccine passport scheme until the most basic issues are ironed out.\"\nPeople have been sharing their experiences of trying to download the new vaccine passport app. \nDean of the Faculty of Advocates, Roddy Dunlop QC, described the app as the \"worst I have ever tried to use\". \nHe wrote on Twitter: \"I am not prone to hyperbole. I promise.\n\"And I instantly recognise that I was originally instructed to challenge the introduction of Covid passports and so am not neutral.\n\"But try the app. This is, literally, the worst app I have ever tried to use.\" \nAnother app user shared screenshots of his experience on Twitter during which he was told \"no match found\" followed by: \"Something went wrong. We're working on it.\"\nOthers reported issues getting past the initial log in page, while a BBC Good Morning Scotland listener told the programme that he had tried twice to download the app without success.\nHe said: \"I tried for a couple of hours last night but not joy and this morning I tried again and although I could get past the biometric part it would take me to end of the process and was still not working. \n\"It just isn't suitable for purpose at the moment, they should have known it was going to happen in the first place.\"\nUniversity of Edinburgh scientist Dr Christine Tait-Burkard said she was unable to get the app working, being told a match could not be found for her on the NHS database.\nHowever, the academic told the programme that once up and running, the app will help \"persuade some of the hesitant people [to get vaccinated] if the vaccine passport has consequences.\"\nMike Rhodes, of the IT firm ConsultMyApp, said he thought the servers being used for the app were being overloaded because of demand but this should have been anticipated. \nHe said: \"It is highly likely that those developers that built the app shell also built the interface to the back-end servers that ended up failing. \n\"Secondly, this wasn't an unforeseen event - the developers absolutely knew this would be downloaded incredibly quickly and was likely to get hundreds of thousands of people attempting to register at the same time.\"\nMr Rhodes questioned why there was \"so little time\" between the app being launched and it being needed for entry into events. \nThe new rules came into effect at 05:00 on Friday - but the government announced earlier this week that they will not actually be enforced until 18 October. \nPaul Banham, of Glasgow's Buff Club, told BBC Scotland's Lunchtime Live: \"We'll be having a look at them over the next few weeks but we won't be refusing entry if someone doesn't have it - there's too many glitches at the moment. \n\"We've had a lot of students contact us and a lot of them are saying they have been vaccinated in other areas of the UK and that is not showing on their Covid status so there's a few gaps at the moment and hopefully they will be ironed out.\"\nThe Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), which represents nightclub, lost a legal bid to delay the rollout on Thursday. \nIt had argued that the new system was \"discriminatory\" and \"disproportionate\".\nBut judge Lord Burns ruled that the vaccine passports were \"an attempt to address the legitimate issues identified in a balanced way\", and was within the margin of what the government could decide was a reasonable response to the pandemic.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the court judgement was \"clear and emphatic\".\nShe said: \"This is a targeted and proportionate way to try and reduce the harm the virus will do over the winter months, to keep our economy open and fully functioning.\n\"We will continue to engage with businesses not just in the run-up to the enforcement of this on 18 October, we will do that afterwards as well so we are listening and understanding and working collectively to keep the country as safe as possible.\"\nThe vaccine certification scheme will require venues to put in place a \"reasonable system\" to check the status of customers over the age of 18, with certain exemptions on medical grounds.\nVenues affected include nightclubs, unseated indoor events with more than 500 people, unseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 people, and any event with more than 10,000 people in attendance.\nElsewhere in the UK, Wales plans to introduce its own Covid passport rules later this month but England has scrapped similar plans.\nNorthern Ireland has yet to announce a formal vaccination passport scheme.\nThe Scottish launch comes as latest figures show that a total of 4,189,701 people have received the coronavirus vaccine in Scotland, of which 3,837,689 people have received two doses."

      "tags": "France",
      "text": "For decades the crimes of a notorious serial killer have haunted the Paris crime squad.\nBut now a former military police officer is said to have confessed to being the murderer known as Le Gr\u00eal\u00e9 - the pockmarked man - before his death.\nNamed locally as Fran\u00e7ois V\u00e9rove, his DNA has been matched to several crime scenes linked to Le Gr\u00eal\u00e9.\nHis murders and rapes shocked Paris between 1986 and 1994 but until now were never solved.\nAmong the shocking crimes attributed to him was the murder of 11-year-old C\u00e9cile Bloch. She was reported missing after failing to show up to school in Paris in 1986.\n\"We won't ever know all the crimes Le Gr\u00eal\u00e9 committed,\" said Didier Saban, a lawyer representing the families. \nV\u00e9rove is linked to four murders and six rapes but Mr Saban said there were undoubtedly more, and his death had left many families without answers.\nA picture of Le Gr\u00eal\u00e9 has hung for decades on the walls of the criminal brigade of the Paris judicial police.\nThis cold case was finally cracked when an investigating magistrate recently decided to send letters to 750 gendarmes (military police) stationed in the Paris region at the time.\nThe 59-year-old man found dead had been a gendarme before becoming a police officer and later retiring, He was summoned by police on 24 September to give a DNA sample five days later. His wife reported him missing on 27 September.\nHis body was discovered in a rented flat in Grau-du-Roi on the Mediterranean coast, along with a suicide note. Prosecutors says his DNA matched evidence found at several crime scenes. \nThe contents of the letter have not been confirmed but French reports say he confessed to experiencing \"previous impulses\" while saying he had since \"got himself together\". He apparently admitted murders without detailing the victims or circumstances.\nLe Gr\u00eal\u00e9's nickname dates back to evidence given at the time of C\u00e9cile Bloch's murder.\nThe victim's half-brother, Luc Richard, was among residents who recalled seeing a man with an acne-scarred face on the day of the crime in their apartment building in the 19th district of northern Paris.\nBloch's body was later found under a piece of old carpet in the basement. Officials said she had been raped, strangled and stabbed, and the case sent shockwaves across France.\nHer brother, who helped police draw a sketch of the suspect, remembered sharing a lift with the man, who seemed \"very sure of himself\".\n\"He said something to me like, 'Have a very, very good day,'\" he recalled in an interview with the Sud Ouest newspaper in 2015.  Mr Richard has previously spoken about how the case has haunted him, saying he has lived with a \"great feeling of injustice\".\nDNA evidence linked Ms Bloch's killer to other murders and rapes.\nThis included the 1987 killing of 38-year-old Gilles Politi and his German au pair Irmgard M\u00fcller.\nLocal reports say he was linked to the 1994 murder of 19-year-old Karine Leroy, who was found dead on the edge of a wood more than a month after disappearing while on her way to school.\nIn rapes committed against a 26-year-old German woman and two girls, aged 14 and 11, the suspect is reported to have identified himself as a policeman.\n\"We had this conviction that he was either an officer or a gendarme, both from the violence he used against his victims and the tactics he adopted,\" the lawyer representing the victims told France Info TV. Sometimes he would even present his card with the French tricolor on it.\nMr Saban believed the killer had done all he could to ensure his DNA was not left at crime scenes. But now his identity has been revealed he wants unsolved crimes to be reopened in which DNA techniques were never used."

      "text": "Scotland's vaccine passport scheme will start on Friday as planned after a judge refused a legal challenge from nightclubs seeking to delay it.\nPeople will need proof they have had two doses of vaccine in order to enter nightclubs and many other large events.\nThe industry lodged a legal challenge, saying the system was \"discriminatory\" and \"disproportionate\". \nBut Lord Burns said it was an attempt to address \"legitimate issues\" of the pandemic in a \"balanced way\".\nRejecting the legal challenge, he noted that the plans had been signed off in principle by MSPs, and would be subject to frequent review.\nThe regulations underpinning the scheme will come into force at 05:00 on Friday morning, having been published for the first time on Thursday afternoon.\nHowever the government has said the rules will not actually be enforced until 18 October, to give venues time to test their systems.\nThe vaccine certification scheme will require venues to put in place a \"reasonable system\" to check the status of customers over the age of 18, with certain exemptions on medical grounds.\nVenues affected include nightclubs, unseated indoor events with more than 500 people, unseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 people, and any event with more than 10,000 people in attendance.\nThe plans were approved by MSPs despite all three opposition parties voting against them, but the Night Time Industries Association Scotland lodged a legal challenge pushing for a delay.\nAt the Court of Session on Wednesday, QC Lord Keen - a former Advocate General for Scotland - argued that the system was \"discriminatory\" against certain venues, and \"wholly disproportionate\".\nHe said the status quo should be maintained until ministers could provide a \"coherent explanation\" for why the scheme was needed, adding that the court should \"protect the basic legitimate rights\" of the petitioners.\nHe said ministers were bringing forward regulations \"beyond the 11th hour, in the strangest fashion\", adding: \"The very fact I have had to say within 24 hours of these regulations coming into force that we haven't seen them, is itself redolent of the problem that exists here.\"\nFor the Scottish government, QC James Mure argued that the scheme had been drawn up at a time when the NHS was under \"extreme pressure\" due to the pandemic.\nHe said it was aimed at reducing transmission of the virus and thus alleviating pressure on the health services, to help keep high-risk venues like clubs open, and to encourage greater uptake of the vaccine.\nAnnouncing his decision on Thursday morning, Lord Burns said he did not accept that the petitioners had demonstrated the scheme was \"disproportionate, irrational or unreasonable\", or that it infringed on their rights.\nHe said it was \"an attempt to address the legitimate issues identified in a balanced way\", and was within the margin of what the government could decide was a reasonable response to the pandemic.\nWhile Lord Keen had argued the decision to set up the scheme had been taken without any supporting evidence having been published, Lord Burns said the decision was \"made on the basis of principle and broad outline\" with details to follow.\nThe judge said the system was subject to scrutiny at parliament and would be frequently reviewed by ministers, with a specific duty in law to revoke regulations if they are no longer necessary from a public health standpoint.\nThe Night Time Industries Association Scotland said it was \"deeply disappointed\" that the scheme would be going ahead.\nA spokeswoman said the group would \"continue to challenge the Scottish government on this issue\" and would take further legal advice on their options.\nAt Holyrood, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the court challenge showed that \"everything has been left to the last minute\", and that the government \"must accept that this is not ready\".\nHe added: \"Businesses have never had a tougher time than right now, but they are getting guidance on vaccine passports at the very last minute, and the evidence case for them - if it can be called that - appeared before a Scottish Parliament committee for the first time this morning.\n\"There are so many flaws littered through this scheme and proper consideration hasn't taken place.\"\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the court judgement was \"clear and emphatic\".\nShe said: \"This is a targeted and proportionate way to try and reduce the harm the virus will do over the winter months, to keep our economy open and fully functioning.\n\"We will continue to engage with businesses not just in the runup to the enforcement of this on 18 October, we will do that afterwards as well so we are listening and understanding and working collectively to keep the country as safe as possible.\""

      "text": "Three more energy suppliers have gone bust amid the surge in wholesale gas prices, the regulator Ofgem has said.\nEnstroga, Igloo Energy and Symbio Energy said they would stop trading on Wednesday.\nThe trio are the latest companies to go under as soaring gas prices have made price promises by suppliers to customers undeliverable.\nTogether, the suppliers represent less than 1% of the UK market with a total of about 233,000 customers, Ofgem said.\nEnstroga supplies gas and electricity to about 6,000 domestic customers, while Igloo has about 179,000. Symbio Energy has roughly 48,000 in the UK and a small number overseas.\nThe three energy supplies follow six others which have collapsed in recent weeks. A total of nearly 1.73m customers have been affected in September.\nOfgem said customers of Enstroga, Igloo and Symbio would continue to receive energy supplies and any credit to their accounts would be protected.\nAffected customers will be switched to a new tariff by Ofgem and be contacted by their new supplier, the regulator said.\nIt has advised people to take a meter reading and to wait until a new supplier has been appointed before looking to switch to another energy firm.\nOfgem added that consumers will also be protected by the energy price cap, which limits how much firms can charge per unit of gas, once switched to a new tariff.\nNeil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem, said: \"Ofgem's number one priority is to protect customers. \n\"I want to reassure customers of Enstroga, Igloo Energy and Symbio Energy that they do not need to worry.  \n\"Ofgem will choose a new supplier for you and while we are doing this our advice is to wait until we appoint a new supplier and do not switch in the meantime. You can rely on your energy supply as normal.\"\nOn Monday, Ofgem announced Shell Energy had been appointed as the new supplier for 255,000 gas and electricity customers of Green, which collapsed last week.\nGreen ceased trading on the same day as another supplier, Avro, whose 580,000 customers have been moved to Octopus Energy.\nJonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, previously told the BBC the cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills.\n\"As underlying costs rise, pressure on bills does go up,\" he said.\nMr Brearley has rejected claims from the industry the current crisis represents a failure to adequately regulate the market. \nThe government has said it is looking at issuing loans to bigger energy firms to help them take on stranded customers.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said the government would \"not be bailing out failed companies\" and added he does \"not expect supply emergencies\".\nConsumers' attention may have been drawn to the queues for petrol this week, but this news is evidence the gas crisis is far from over.\nIt is a crisis that many more suppliers are not expected to survive. The pressure on them is increasing as wholesale gas prices are continuing to go up.\nMeanwhile, tens of thousands of customers of these three collapsed companies will now wait to be moved automatically onto new, dedicated - but undoubtedly more expensive - tariffs.\nMillions more face price rises on Friday, when Ofgem's higher price cap for variable tariffs kicks in.\nAs more and more suppliers fold, the cost of dealing with their customers will mean further price rises for everyone in the future are inevitable."

      "text": "A group of six people who conspired to abduct a child, who they claimed was the victim of satanic ritual abuse, have been jailed.\nAnke Hill, 51, Jane Going-Hill, 60 and Kristine Ellis-Petley, 58, had previously admitted the charges.\nWilfred Wong, 53, Janet Stevenson, 67, and Edward Stevenson, 69, were found guilty after a month-long trial.\nSentencing them at Caernarfon Crown Court, Judge Nicola Jones said they had \"acted as vigilantes\".\nThe kidnapping happened on Anglesey on 4 November last year.\nThe defendants had claimed the child was the victim of satanic ritual abuse and said they believed they were saving it from harm.\nHowever, a police investigation had already concluded there had been no such abuse.\nAnke Hill and Wilfred Wong snatched the child from their foster carer as they arrived home from school.\nHill wrestled the child from their car seat and them in a waiting car, while Wong held a knife to the foster carer's throat before slashing one of the carer's tyres to prevent them from following.\nHill was jailed for 14 years and five months while Wong was given a 17-year jail sentence.\nHill was told she had manipulated others into joining with her to kidnap the child, while Wong was told by the judge \"you still have a clear under-lying belief in these accusations\".\nHe was given a concurrent sentence of two years and six months for possession of a bladed weapon.\nJanet Stevenson was jailed for 15 years and was told she still had \"entrenched views on the victims of satanic ritual abuse\" and, like Hill and Wong, there was a danger she would reoffend in the future because of her belief that children were victims of satanic ritual abuse.\nHer husband, Edward Stevenson, who had helped in the conspiracy by hiring a car to drive the child away from Wales was jailed for eight years for his \"essential\" role.\nTwo others, Jane Going-Hill and Kristine Petley, from Holyhead, acted as lookouts on bridges from Anglesey to the mainland to spot any police activity.\nGoing-Hill was jailed for four years and eight months, and Petley for four years. The judge said the pair had carried out surveillance prior to the kidnapping.\nThe judge said the events of last November had caused \"significant, long-lasting and potentially permanent psychological harm to the child\" in the case.\nThe court heard the kidnap had been long in the planning, had been changed after previous plans came to nothing, and the \"sophisticated\" plot had involved burner phones, a hire car, false number plates and a coded system of communication.\nBut months of planning unravelled in a few hours after North Wales Police acted quickly to track the kidnap vehicle and got colleagues in Northamptonshire to stop the car on the M1 just hours after the child was taken.\n\"Without their actions, the child would by now have been lost\" abroad, said the judge.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service said the facts of the case were \"chilling\", and it must have been a terrifying experience for the child and carer.\nA month-long trial was held at Caernarfon Crown Court in July, but a court order prevented any reporting of the case until last month when all proceedings against the various defendants were concluded.\u00a0\nKarren Sawford, 48, was found not guilty and an eighth defendant, Robert Frith, was found dead in his prison cell last year.\nThe jury heard how Hill conspired with Wong and Janet Stevenson to kidnap the child from foster care, with the help of the other three.\nHill claimed the child had been the victim of satanic abuse in the past, before being fostered, though police investigated and found there was not enough evidence to support this allegation.\nThe court heard the group was recruited after Hill contacted Wong, who is a campaigner against satanic ritual abuse.\nHill found Wong online, and phone records produced in court showed the pair spent many hours in conversation.\nWong put Hill in contact with Janet Stevenson, a counsellor who specialises in working with victims of satanic abuse.\nHill worked with Wong and the others to organise an elaborate plan, involving code names and a clandestine rendezvous at Bangor railway station, where one gang member arrived by train and followed another through the city at a distance.\nAt one stage, the conspirators also considered modifying a horsebox with a secret compartment to smuggle the child away.\nOn Thursday, following the sentencing hearing, a\u00a0North Wales Police spokesperson said: \"This was a complex and carefully orchestrated conspiracy, perpetrated with chilling ruthlessness.\n\"This was a harrowing ordeal for both the child and foster carer. The impact of this incident cannot be understated, and we would like to acknowledge their strength and courage throughout this investigation.\n\"Through the dedication of detectives, and a meticulous investigation, we presented a strong case which resulted in these convictions.\u00a0\n\"This would not have been possible without the close partnership work between ourselves, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the local authority, to whom we are very grateful.\"\nA CPS spokesperson said: \"The group had made a remarkable amount of planning to carry out this crime, including sourcing a passport with a view to take the child abroad.\n\"The facts of the case are chilling, and it must have been a terrifying experience for the child and carer.\n\"Through detailed analysis of the material provided by the police, the CPS built a strong case which resulted in these convictions.\""

      "text": "The family of Sarah Everard confronted her murderer in court and laid bare their loss and anguish. These are their victim impact statements in full.\nThe following accounts contain details which readers may find distressing.\nSarah is gone and I am broken-hearted. She was my precious little girl, our youngest child. The feeling of loss is so great it is visceral. And with the sorrow come waves of panic at not being able to see her again. I can never talk to her, never hold her again, and never more be a part of her life. We have kept her dressing gown - it still smells of her and I hug that instead of her.\nSarah died in horrendous circumstances. I am tormented at the thought of what she endured. I play it out in my mind. I go through the terrible sequence of events. I wonder when she realised she was in mortal danger; I wonder what her murderer said to her. When he strangled her, for how long was she conscious, knowing she would die? It is torture to think of it.\nSarah was handcuffed, unable to defend herself, and there was no one to rescue her. She spent her last hours on this earth with the very worst of humanity. She lost her life because Wayne Couzens wanted to satisfy his perverted desires. It is a ridiculous reason, it is nonsensical. How could he value a human life so cheaply? I cannot comprehend it. I am incandescent with rage at the thought of it.\nHe treated my daughter as if she was nothing and disposed of her as if she was rubbish.\nIf Sarah had died because of an illness, she would have been cared for. We could have looked after her and been with her. If she had died because of an accident, people would have tried to help - there would have been kindness. But there is no comfort to be had, there is no consoling thought in the way Sarah died. In her last hours she was faced with brutality and terror, alone with someone intent on doing her harm. The thought of it is unbearable. I am haunted by the horror of it.\nWhen Sarah went missing we suffered days of agony, not knowing where she was or what had happened to her. Then, when Sarah's burnt remains were found, we spent two terrible days waiting for tests to show how she had died, fearing she had been set alight before she was dead - the thought was appalling.\nBurning her body was the final insult, it meant we could never again see her sweet face and never say goodbye.\nOur lives will never be the same. We should be a family of five, but now we are four. Her death leaves a yawning chasm in our lives that cannot be filled.\nI yearn for her. I remember all the lovely things about her. She was caring, she was funny. She was clever, but she was good at practical things too. She was a beautiful dancer. She was a wonderful daughter. She was always there to listen, to advise, or simply to share with the minutiae of the day. And she was also a strongly principled young woman who knew right from wrong and who lived by those values. She was a good person. She had purpose to her life.\nMy outlook on life has changed since Sarah died. I am more cautious, I worry more about our other children. I crave the familiarity and security of home - the wider world has lost its appeal. It is too painful to contemplate a future without Sarah, so I just live in the here and now. I think of Sarah all the time, but the mornings and evenings are particularly painful. In the morning I wake up to the awful reality that Sarah is gone. In the evenings, at the time she was abducted, I let out a silent scream: Don't get in the car, Sarah. Don't believe him. Run!\nI am repulsed by the thought of Wayne Couzens and what he did to Sarah. I am outraged that he masqueraded as a policeman in order to get what he wanted.\nSarah wanted to get married and have children - now all that has gone. He took her life and stole her future and we will never have the joy of sharing that future with her. Each day dawns and I think Sarah should be here, leading her life and embracing new experiences. She had so many years ahead of her.\nI don't know how anyone could be so cruel as to take my daughter's life. What I do know is that Sarah will never be forgotten and is remembered with boundless love.\nI cling on to memories of Sarah, I hold them tight to keep them safe. The other night, I dreamt that Sarah appeared at home. In my dream I held her and could feel her physically. Jeremy was there, we were comforting her, saying: 'It's all right Sarah, it's all right'. I would give anything to hold her once more. I hope I dream that dream again.\nThere's a photograph of my beautiful daughter on the screen. She had a beautiful mind too. Mr Couzens, please, will you look at me? The impact of what you have done will never end. The horrendous murder of my daughter, Sarah, is in my mind all the time and will be for the rest of my life.\nA father wants to look after his children and fix everything, and you have deliberately and with premeditation stopped my ability to do that.\nSarah was handcuffed and unable to defend herself. This preys on my mind all the time.\nI can never forgive you for what you have done, for taking Sarah away from us.\nYou burnt our daughter's body \u2014 you further tortured us \u2014 so that we could not see her again. We did not know whether you had burnt her alive or dead. You stopped us seeing Sarah for one last time and stopped me from giving my daughter one last kiss goodbye.\nHer body fell apart when she was moved. Her brain and neck bones were removed for months by the pathologist and her body was difficult to preserve so we had to use the services of a specialist embalmer to enable a dignified burial.\nAll my family want is Sarah back with us. No punishment that you receive will ever compare to the pain and torture that you have inflicted on us.\nYou murdered our daughter and forever broke the hearts of her mother, father, brother, sister, family and her friends.\nSarah had so much to look forward to and because of you this is now gone forever. She was saving to buy a house and looking forward to marriage and children. We were looking forward to having grandchildren. We loved being a part of Sarah's world and expected her to have a full and happy life.\nThe closest we can get to her now is to visit her grave every day\nYou treated Sarah as if she was nothing. Placed more emphasis on satisfying your sick disgusting perversions than on a life. Her life.\nYou disposed of my sister's body like it was rubbish. Fly-tipped her like she meant nothing. She meant everything. We couldn't even see her, she was so badly burnt. Her brain was removed from her skull to check for trauma and cause of death - I still don't know if they put her brain back in her head or whether it is lying next to her body in her coffin.\nShards of her kneecap were returned to us to be placed with her body - shards that you knocked when moving her burnt body from the fridge you had used to hide her and conceal the fire.\nWe are still missing her hyoid bone from her throat, which is being checked to see the force you used to strangle her, to determine how long she may have survived. We know it was broken. Her burnt body still had her necklace and one earring in her ear. The other had fallen from her ear because it had burnt off.\nYou hear from the police that it takes around two minutes to strangle someone, and around eight to ten seconds for them to lose consciousness.\nAt first there is a sense of relief at hearing that your sister might only have been aware of what was happening for eight to 10 seconds. But have you put your hands around your neck and tried pushing hard? Eight to 10 seconds now seems a long time.\nYou used your warrant card to trick my sister into your car. She sat in a car, handcuffed, for hours. What could she have thought she had done wrong? What lies did you tell her? When did she realise that she wasn't going to survive the night?\nI'm constantly replaying in my head - did you rape her, then kill her? Did you kill her while raping her? You get small nuggets of information and the thought process starts again. Your semen and blood were found in your car. So this suggests you raped her in the car. You find out you may have used a belt to strangle her. New horrendous images forming.\nYou stopped to get a Lucozade and water at a petrol station. Was she still alive at this point? Bound in your car? I am horrified by your ability to flit between what you did and normal, everyday actions. Your casual demeanour on CCTV was very upsetting and shocking to see.\nWe had to go to the flat and pack up Sarah's whole life - washing left hanging up, half-sewn outfits, deliveries waiting to be returned, packages waiting at the door ready to be opened.\nAll signs of a life waiting to be lived, chores to be done, ready for her to return and continue when she got home. But she never got home because a predator - you - was on the loose. Prowling the streets for hours looking for his prey.\nYou can't comprehend what you are being told when it happened because it is so horrific. Some sort of sick waking nightmare. You can't imagine anyone could do such a thing.\nYou are waiting to hear anything from the police. Every bit you get is different. You hear her body has been found. Then you find out she has been burnt. So badly burnt you can't see her. Can't see her again to say goodbye.\nThe first thought you have in your head after despair and shock is - was she dead before you burnt her? Imagine that even having to be a thought. You find out no soot was found in her lungs, which suggests she was burnt after you murdered her. Imagine being relieved to hear your sister was dead before she was burnt.\nI replay it continuously round in my head. What you may have said to her, what she may have said back, when she realised she was in grave danger and was not going to survive.\nHoping my sister was unconscious and drugged, but we know that was not the case - no drugs found in her body, no trauma to the head. Burst blood vessels in her brain from your strangulation, which meant she was conscious when you were doing these unfathomable things to her.\nMy only hope is that she was in a state of shock and that she wasn't aware of the disgusting things being done to her by a monster. When you forced yourself upon and raped her. When you put your hands around her neck and strangled her.\nIt disgusts me that you were the last person to touch her perfect body, and violate her in the way you did. The last person to see her alive and speak to her.\nHow scared she must have been. The last moments of her life not with loved ones, but frightened and fighting for her life. I hate to think of her being so scared and alone and that in her last moments she had no one with her. No kindness. I hate that I wasn't there to save her. To stop you. I find it hard to believe she is not just living her own life and sick at the thought that her last moments on this earth alive were so horrific.\nHow dare you take her from me? Take away her hopes and dreams. Her life. Children that will never be born. Generations that will never exist. Her future no longer exists. The future I was supposed to live with my sister no longer exists. You have ruined so many lives.\nSarah is the very best person, with so many people who love and cherish her. I want to speak to her and hug her and hear her laugh and go out for dinners and drinks and dancing.\nAll those conversations we can never have. There were so many things I wanted to share with her - trips abroad, being each other's bridesmaids, meeting her babies and being an auntie, growing old together and seeing who got the most wrinkles. We weren't even halfway through our journey and you took it all away.\nI feel like I live in a make-believe world, as if nothing is real. I have to pretend because the thought of not having Sarah forever is too hard to bear. A lifetime now seems a very long time.\nI should never have to write a eulogy for or bury my little sister. There is no punishment that you could receive that will ever compare to the pain you have caused us. We can never get Sarah back. The last moments of Sarah's life play on my mind constantly. I am so disgusted and appalled. It terrifies me that you have such disregard for a person's life. You have taken from me the most precious person. And I can never get her back."

      "text": "Leigh Faulkner's two-bed flat had been worth around \u00a3175,000 but he sold it for \u00a350,000 less after post-Grenfell fire safety problems emerged.\nThe 54-year-old father-of-two decided to \"take the hit\" financially because of uncertainty over government help.\nHe said he felt \"robbed\" when he sold the Cardiff Bay flat for \u00a3125,000.\nA Welsh government fund for surveys to establish what repairs buildings require opens for applications on Thursday.\nHousing minister Julie James said her \"heart goes out\" to those affected, but providing support was \"fiendishly complicated\".\nCampaigners have been increasingly frustrated at how long the Welsh government is taking to establish a repair fund.\nMany leaseholders in high-rise apartment blocks have found it impossible to sell as lenders will not provide buyers with mortgages on the properties.\nThey are also facing significantly increased costs to cover insurance premiums and interim fire safety measures. \nAfter several years living and working in Dubai, the Faulkners moved back into their flat in Victoria Wharf, Cardiff Bay, in 2019 and started the hunt for a house. \nBefore the cladding and other fire safety problems were identified, Mr Faulkner believed the flat was worth around \u00a3175,000.\nIt was valued at \u00a3160,000 as part of a part-exchange for a new-build house in Dinas Powys, Vale of Glamorgan. \nBut that deal fell through when the problems at Victoria Wharf came to light.\nWith concerns about safety and his annual service charge rising to \u00a35,000, he decided to sell the flat at auction in June.\nThe home was bought by a property investment company.\n\"It was a tough decision, there was part of me wanted to tough it out and just see how things panned out with the developer.\u202f \n\"There wasn't much positive coming from Welsh government at the time, it was mostly talk.\u202f \n\"So it was that uncertainty that drove us finally to say, 'yeah, let's just take the hit'.\n\"Forty or 50 thousand doesn't sound a lot to some people, but I'm sure for most people to lose that is painful.\"\u202f \nThe sale enabled them to buy a house near Llantwit Major, a cheaper option than the one they had wanted in Dinas Powys.\nMr Faulkner said after leaving school with \"only a few GCSEs\" and working and saving all his life, it was a \"bitter pill to swallow\".\n\"We've done the right things, we've not spent frivolously on holidays, we've never spent money we never had. \n\"It does feel like somebody's just come in and taken that money out of my bank account in effect.\"\u202f \nBex Ashwin from campaign group Welsh Cladiators said the opening of the fund was welcome but questioned if ministers \"fully understand the urgency of the situation\".\n\"It is also not clear if this will be of any benefit to the number of flats who have already had to undertake survey work at significant cost,\" she said.\nAsked why the Welsh government was only now at the stage of opening a fund for survey work, Ms James said: \"Because it's so fiendishly complicated is the short answer to that. \n\"It's nothing to do with how desperate we are to help people get themselves out of this situation.\n\"I don't say this lightly at all, my heart goes out to people who are stuck in this situation, it's awful. \n\"But we need to get it right, we need to not make a mess of it and we need to make sure we are funding the right things.\n\"I know it must seem glacial to the people out there living with this day to day but it's so complicated to do we wanted to get it right so I'm very pleased to be announcing it, now we hope that people will come forward immediately.\"\nShe said further funding \"of various sorts\" for repair work would be developed as surveys begin to be completed.\nShe will meet developers next week to discuss their contribution and said she is still awaiting confirmation from the UK government about the \"level and timing\" of funding Wales will receive as a result of fire safety spending in England.\nYou can see more about this story in Wales Live on the BBC iPlayer"

The species was officially listed as endangered in 1967.\nAnother bird declared extinct is the Bachman's warbler, which was one of the rarest songbirds in North America. It too has been listed as endangered since 1967.\nEight species of birds from Hawaii and the Little Mariana fruit bat from the Pacific island of Guam are also on the list.\nThe FWS, in its statement, said the protections afforded by the ESA, which came into effect in 1973, had come too late for these species.\nBut it stressed the act has been successful at preventing the extinction of more than 99% of species listed, and its protections are needed now more than ever.\n\"The Service is actively engaged with diverse partners across the country to prevent further extinctions, recover listed species and prevent the need for federal protections in the first place,\" said Martha Williams, FWS Principal Deputy Director. \n\"The Endangered Species Act has been incredibly successful at both preventing extinctions and at inspiring the diverse partnerships needed to meet our growing 21st century conservation challenges.\""

      "text": "A senior MP has led calls for the Met Police commissioner to resign, after the man who murdered Sarah Everard while he was a serving officer was sentenced to a whole-life prison term. \nLabour MP Harriet Harman told Dame Cressida Dick women's confidence in the police \"will have been shattered\". \nIn her letter she wrote it would not be possible for Dame Cressida to oversee the changes needed to rebuild trust. \nBut the home secretary said she would \"continue to work with\" Dame Cressida.\nPriti Patel added she would continue to hold the Met and Dame Cressida to account \"as everybody would expect me to do\".\nWayne Couzens, 48, kidnapped, raped and murdered Ms Everard, 33, in March. \nThe Old Bailey heard how Couzens used his Metropolitan Police warrant card and handcuffs to abduct Ms Everard under the guise of an arrest, as she was walking home from a friend's house in Clapham, south London. \nAt the time of the murder, Couzens was a serving firearms officer for the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, working at diplomatic premises around central London.\nHe was sacked by the Met after pleading guilty. \nMs Harman, chairwoman of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and a former justice minister, is a prominent campaigner on women's rights. \nShe has also written to Home Secretary Priti Patel, calling for urgent changes to rebuild women's confidence in the police. \nHer proposals include tougher action against officers accused of violence against women and stricter vetting of recruits. \nIn her letter to Dame Cressida, Ms Harman, who is also Mother of the House - the longest continuously serving female MP - wrote: \"I ask you to resign to enable these changes to be taken through and for women to be able to have justified confidence in the police.\"\n\"Women need to be confident that the police are there to make them safe, not to put them at risk,\" she added.\n\"Women need to be able to trust the police, not to fear them.\"\nMs Harman told Ms Patel \"too many warning signs\" about Couzens \"had been swept under the carpet\" and women's confidence in the police \"cannot be rebuilt with the attempt to reassure that this was just, as the Metropolitan Police commissioner said, one 'bad'un'.\"\nA former Met chief superintendent also said Dame Cressida should quit.\nParm Sandhu told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme a \"complete overhaul\" of vetting procedures was needed and she did not have trust in the Met commissioner to make the necessary changes. \n\"I think she has done as good a job as she can, she cannot move with the times and she needs to go,\" she added.\nZoe Billingham, who is standing down after 12 years in her role at Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary, described the case as \"a watershed moment for policing\", saying Couzens' crimes had \"struck a hammer blow to policing legitimacy in England and Wales\". \n\"We cannot abide by the narrative that this was a one-off and I think every force now in the country must look to re-establish trust and legitimacy,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. \n\"I'd call on every force to now account immediately - not tomorrow, today -  to its communities - as to exactly what it's going to do to ensure that this can never happen again.\"\nBut her boss Sir Thomas Winsor, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary for England and Wales, told BBC Radio 4's World at One that Dame Cressida should not go.\n\"Cressida Dick is not responsible for the individual acts of every police officer, including a police officer of the appalling criminal proclivities and intent of Wayne Couzens. \n\"Cressida Dick has a great deal of support from her officers and has led the Metropolitan Police with distinction. Not everything in the Met is good and we have published many reports that are critical of the Met, but this is not a case for the resignation of the commissioner.\" \nDame Cressida became the first woman to lead London's force when she was appointed in 2017.\nEarlier this month, it was announced that she will serve an extra two years in her role and remain in post until 2024."

      "tags": "Fuel,Haulage",
      "text": "There has been no improvement in petrol supplies at independent petrol stations since Wednesday, according to industry body the Petrol Retailers Association.\nThe PRA, which represents independent fuel retailers, said that more than a quarter (27%) of its members' were still out of fuel on Thursday.\nThat was better than the 37% which were out of fuel on Tuesday, but demand remained higher than usual, it said.\nHowever the AA said it saw signs that the pressure was starting to ease.\nThe PRA, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,300 petrol stations, said Thursday's figures were based on responses from 1,500 stations.\n\"Trying to calm this down appears to be a monumental task at the moment,\" said PRA chairman Brian Madderson.\n\"The surge in demand appears to be continuing,\" he said. \"There's been no easing off of the pressure from drivers wanting to refuel whenever they can, wherever they can.\"\nThe UK has been grappling with a fuel crisis that has caused huge queues outside some petrol stations, and forced customers to drive round multiple sites in search of supplies.\nWhile the government and industry said there was enough fuel at UK refineries, a shortage of drivers has slowed the transport of fuel to petrol stations.\nThe government said it was seeing the \"first signs\" of demand for fuel stabilising, and stressed there was no shortage of fuel.\nThe AA also said it saw signs that the pressure on fuel pumps was starting to ease.\nThe motoring group said that the number of call-outs from drivers who had run out of fuel had initially increased sharply and was \"in the hundreds\" over the weekend. But it said those numbers were now falling rapidly.\nAlthough some queues remain in London, the South East and some other built-up areas, AA president Edmund King said daily improvements were now visible.\n\"We believe we have turned the corner,\" he said.\nThe PRA told the BBC that it had also received \"anecdotal\" evidence that the problems were more acute in London and the South East. It said that Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales appeared to be \"mostly ok\".\nThe PRA's Mr Madderson said he had written to the government this morning to warn them that the price of petrol and diesel at the pump was likely to rise, after a rise in the price of Brent Crude oil. A fall in the value of the pound against the dollar would also push up prices for UK customers, he said.\n\"Those two [factors] have already started to impinge on wholesale prices, which have gone up - in the last three nights - by nearly 3p a litre,\" he said. \nGovernment plans to use the army to address some of the delivery problems in the coming days would help to ease the problems, Mr Madderson said, but the main thing that was required was a change in public behaviour.\n\"Let's just try and calm it down please,\" he said. \nHe said he understood that the army could be helping with deliveries by the weekend. \nThe majority of sites completely out of stock were BP franchisees, Mr Madderson said, adding the PRA was talking to BP about the issues they were facing.\nBP told the BBC it was \"working flat out to keep our petrol stations stocked and restock them when they run out\".\nLong queues and frustrated customers have led to multiple reports on social media of abuse of service station staff.\nBBC broadcast engineer Simon Hardwick tweeted: \"Chatting with a member of staff at a supermarket petrol station, who said they are getting deliveries but within a few hours they sell out again. He also mentioned the abuse he's been receiving from members of the public.\"\nIndustry leaders have condemned physical and verbal abuse suffered by service station employees during the crisis.\nGordon Balmer, the executive director of the PRA, said the abuse was \"completely unacceptable\".\n\"It is important to remember that fuel stocks remain normal at refineries and terminals, and deliveries have been reduced solely due to the shortage of HGV drivers\", he added.\nThe haulage industry said an existing shortage of lorry drivers had been made worse by a number of factors, including the pandemic, Brexit, an ageing workforce, and low wages and poor working conditions.\nIn an attempt to limit disruption, the government has confirmed that 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers can receive temporary UK visas, with the scheme ending on Christmas Eve.\nThe Road Haulage Association said, however, the recent move \"barely scratches the surface\", adding that only offering visas until Christmas Eve \"will not be enough for companies or the drivers themselves to be attractive\".\nA spokesman for the government said it had taken \"immediate action\" to increase the numbers of HGV drivers.\n\"We recognise the challenges facing industry and streamlined the testing process in July to boost the number of drivers,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, petrol station group EG said its workers would get a 5% pay rise for \"heroic\" work since the start of the Covid pandemic.\nThe wage increase takes the minimum rate for over-18s to \u00a39.50 per hour at EG Group, which was founded by the Asda-owning Issa brothers.\nMohsin and Zuber Issa, the billionaire co-founders and co-chief executives of the group, said: \"Our colleagues have pulled out all the stops and been nothing short of heroic during often very difficult times since the start of the pandemic.\n\"It is due to their hard work and dedication that EG has continued to be a growth business, performing strongly over the past 12 months.\n\"We are grateful to each and every one of them for their contributions and are therefore making a total reward package available to them which we believe is among the best in the country.\"\nEG Group was founded in 2001 and has more than 45,000 staff working in more than 6,200 sites in Europe, the US and Australia."

      "tags": "Computer hacking,Apple,Cyber-security,Contactless payment",
      "text": "Large unauthorised contactless payments can be made on locked iPhones by exploiting how an Apple Pay feature designed to help commuters pay quickly at ticket barriers works with Visa. \nIn a video, researchers demonstrated making a contactless Visa payment of \u00a31,000 from a locked iPhone.\nApple said the matter was \"a concern with a Visa system\".\nVisa said payments were secure and attacks of this type were impractical outside of a lab. \nThe problem, researchers say, applies to Visa cards set up in 'Express Transit' mode in an iPhone's wallet. \n\"Express Transit\" is an Apple Pay feature which enables commuters to make quick contactless payments without unlocking their phone, for example touching-in and touching-out at a London Underground ticket barrier.\nIt is a weakness in how Visa systems work with this feature, that researchers from the Computer Science departments of Birmingham and Surrey Universities, discovered how to attack.\nIn demonstrating the attack, the scientists only took money from their own accounts.\nIn very simple terms - and with many key details deliberately omitted- the attack works like this:\nIn a demonstration video seen by the BBC, researchers were able to make a Visa payment of \u00a31,000 without unlocking the phone or authorising the payment.\nThe researchers say the Android phone and payment terminal used don't need to be near the victim's iPhone.\n\"It can be on another continent from the iPhone as long as there's an internet connection\" said Dr Ioana Boureanu of the University of Surrey.\nThe researchers have so far demonstrated the attack only in the \"lab\" - and there's no evidence that criminals are currently exploiting the hack.\nKen Munro, a security researcher with Pen Test Partners, who was not involved in the research, told the BBC it was \"a really innovative piece of research\" and needed to be fixed quickly.\nHe said it's a similar attack to having a contactless credit card terminal tapped against your wallet or purse.\nBut this attack was rather more insidious, he said, as it doesn't need the card terminal any more - just a small box of electronics that can relay the fraudulent transaction elsewhere\n\"Perhaps the greatest worry is for a lost or stolen phone. The crook doesn't have to be concerned about being spotted by others as they carry out the attack any more.\"\nThe university researchers also said the attack might be easiest to deploy against a stolen iPhone. \nThe researchers say they first approached Apple and Visa with their concerns almost a year ago - there have been \"useful\" conversations, but the problem has not been fixed.\nVisa's view was that this type of attack was \"impractical\".\nIt told the BBC that it took all security threats seriously, but \"Visa cards connected to Apple Pay Express Transit are secure, and cardholders should continue to use them with confidence.\n\"Variations of contactless fraud schemes have been studied in laboratory settings for more than a decade and have proven to be impractical to execute at scale in the real world\".\nIt is possible, for example, that Visa's fraud detection systems would spot and block unusual patterns of spending, although the researchers did not encounter this problem in their lab tests.\nThere's also the practical problem of getting close to a victim's phone.\nAnyone who thinks they have lost their phone can use Apple's iCloud to block Apple Pay or wipe the phone, and they can also alert Visa and block payments.\nApple told the BBC: \"We take any threat to users' security very seriously. This is a concern with a Visa system but Visa does not believe this kind of fraud is likely to take place in the real world given the multiple layers of security in place\". \n\"In the unlikely event that an unauthorised payment does occur, Visa has made it clear that their cardholders are protected by Visa's zero liability policy\".\nBut Dr Andreea Radu, of the University of Birmingham who led the research, told the BBC complex attacks that work in the lab can end up being used by criminals.\n\"It has some technical complexity - but I feel the rewards from doing the attack are quite high\", she said, adding that if unaddressed \"in a few years these might be become a real issue\".\nDr Tom Chothia also at the University of Birmingham, said iPhone owners should check if they have a Visa card set up for transit payments, and if so they should disable it. \n\"There is no need for Apple Pay users to be in danger, but until Apple or Visa fix this they are\", he said.\nThe researchers also tested Samsung Pay, but found it could not be exploited in this way. \nThey also tested Mastercard but found that the way its security works prevented the attack.\nCo-author Dr Ioana Boureanu, from the University of Surrey, said this showed systems could be \"both usable and secure\". \nThe research is due to be presented at the 2022 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy."

Fresh fruit will still be available. \nYogurt and daily dessert options, as well as fresh organic milk or drinking water, complete the temporary menus.\nJayne Rear, the county council's cabinet member for education and skills, said: \"We're reducing the menu for all our schools to make it fair for everybody.\n\"We will reduce it for a couple of weeks so we can replenish our stocks hopefully to be back running after half-term.\n\"It has been so, so difficult to recruit drivers and it is across the country and we are doing all we can.\"\nAs the fourth largest authority in England, LCC procures a large amount of food and drink, with 80% of meals freshly prepared and cooked in school kitchens.\nThe authority said it has strict specifications for its school meals.\nAll of its suppliers are classified as \"local\" while 75% of the food it purchases is produced in the UK.\nJulie Goodwin, headteacher of St Lawrence CE Primary School in Barton, said: \"I'm happy the menu we are providing meets all the nutritional requirements.\n\"We are going to try and jig it around a little bit. \n\"The bottom line is that they are going to get a warm meal and there will be a variety.

      "tags": "Fuel,Motoring",
      "text": "The government has started deploying its reserve tanker fleet, driven by civilians, to boost fuel deliveries.\nIt comes as the fuel industry said the situation at the pumps \"has begun to improve\" and that it is working with the government to maintain regular deliveries. \nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said soldiers would be delivering fuel later this week, after days of queues. \nHe said things had been difficult but denied there was a fuel supply crisis. \nMinisters have decided to deploy troops to drive tankers in \"the next couple of days\", he said, in addition to the civilians driving them from Wednesday. \nSome 150 military drivers are ready to drive the fuel tankers, with another 150 Army personnel ready to support them. \nFuel suppliers and retailers, including Shell UK, BP and Esso, said in a statement issued by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy: \"We remain confident that the situation will stabilise further in the coming days and encourage everyone to fill up as they normally would to help forecourts return to normal.\"\nThe industry statement also said there had \"always been plenty of fuel at our refineries and terminals\" and welcomed the deployment of the reserve tanker fleet. \nThe Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there were \"encouraging signs\" the pressure was starting to ease at the pumps, with forecourts taking further fuel deliveries.\nThe PRA, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 stations, said 27% of sites had run out of fuel on Wednesday - compared with two-thirds being without on Sunday.\nBrian Madderson, PRA chairman, told BBC News that while there were \"less queues [and] panic buying\" there was still \"unusually heavy demand\". He said \"one or two\" petrol station groups were reporting fewer dry sites than on Tuesday.\nIt would take more than \"a day or a few days\" to fully replenish stocks at all UK forecourts, he said, but there was still \"plenty to go round\".\nOn Tuesday, speaking for the first time since issues began, Prime Minister Boris Johnson also sought to reassure drivers about supplies, saying that people should be \"confident\" to go about their business.\nHe said he was not seeking to prioritise essential workers at pumps because things were \"stabilising\".\nSir Keir Starmer used his first in-person conference speech as Labour leader on Wednesday to criticise the government's handling of fuel supply issues.\nReferring to the government's flagship \"levelling up\" policy to lower regional inequalities, he said: \"Level up, you can't even fill up.\"\nHe accused the government of ignoring the issues, blaming others and delivering \"half-baked\" solutions with \"no plan in place\". Mr Starmer urged the PM to \"either get a grip or get out of the way and let us step up to clear up this mess\".\nOne hospice in Oldham has put out an appeal for petrol, saying its staff were struggling to fill up their vehicles. \nNurse Lindsey Harper, lead nurse for community service at Dr Kershaw's Hospice, said there was \"an element of sheer panic\" over the situation. The hospice gives end-of-life care to 11 patients in their own homes and staff vehicles need constant refills of unleaded petrol. \nIt wants filling stations to give its staff priority access and is also asking the public for donations.\nMs Harper said: \"We need to prioritise those patients; we need to get to those patients as soon as we can. \n\"We can't be thinking about where we need to stop off for fuel.\"\nThere have also been concerns voiced by other care organisations that vulnerable service users could be left without their usual help if the crisis does not ease.\nEmma Voglemann who lives in south Cambridgeshire said that, without the 24-hour help from her team of five carers, her \"situation is life-threatening\".\nCare assistant Jenny Irons, who works in Clacton, Essex, with end-of-life patients, said it was frustrating to see people top up their cars, then get out four or five jerry cans to fill up those too. \nJames Spencer, managing director at fuel supplier Portland Fuel, said the UK was over the worst of the situation and sending in the Army would \"generate more panic\".\n\"Under normal circumstances supply can easily meet demand,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He added that now many people had filled up their tanks, there might be a \"dip in demand\".\nFuel supplies are plentiful at refineries but a shortage of tanker drivers caused problems with deliveries to a small number of filling stations last week.\nReports of pumps running dry at some garages then subsequently led to a surge in demand.\nSainsbury's, which has 315 filling stations, said it was still \"experiencing high demand for fuel\" and that \"all our sites continue to receive fuel\".\nSimon Williams, fuel spokesman for roadside assistance firm RAC, said its latest data on breakdowns \"points to an improving picture with fewer drivers running out of fuel at the roadside\". \nHe added: \"After huge increases in these breakdowns between Saturday and Monday, yesterday we saw a 40% drop in 'out of fuels' compared to the day before.\" \nThis is still higher than normal but is a \"positive sign\", he said. \nBut Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Driver Association, said that the situation was \"not getting better\", with 25% to 30% of his members unable to work on Tuesday because they could not get fuel.\nHe called for an essential users list to be brought in to \"take the sting out of this crisis\".\nMeanwhile, car use in Britain this week fell to its lowest level for a working Monday since 12 July, suggesting some drivers have reduced the amount they are driving due to fuel supply issues.\nThe figures from the Department for Transport showed car traffic was at 91% of pre-pandemic levels on Monday, compared with 97% a week earlier.\nThe UK is estimated to be short of about 100,000 lorry drivers - causing problems for a range of industries, including food suppliers and supermarkets, in recent months. \nThe government is taking action to ensure there were enough deliveries in all industries during the run-up to Christmas, the prime minister said. \nHow have you been affected by the fuel crisis?

      "tags": "Young people",
      "text": "The mental health of children and young people has not improved since last year's lockdown, a survey by NHS Digital suggests.\nIt found one in six children in England had a probable mental disorder in 2021 - similar to 2020, and up from one in nine in 2017.\nAnd nearly 40% of six to 16-year-olds, and half of 17 to 23-year-olds, said they felt their mental health had got worse over that time.\nGirls were more affected than boys.\nCharities say it's very worrying that so many young people are struggling with their mental health and may need long-term support.\nThe figures are based on questions asked to more than 3,600 children and young people in 2017, 2020 and March 2021 about their family life, schooling and feelings.\nThe NHS Digital report authors said it was difficult to work out how much of the change in children's mental health was because of the pandemic - but they found those with a probable mental health disorder were more likely to be worse off.\nThese children and young people were more likely to feel lonely, experience sleeping and eating problems and miss school. They were also less likely to have a stable family life.\nCharity Action for Children said the figures were \"shocking\" and showed the true scale of the mental health crisis facing the NHS in England \"after 18 months of fear, anxiety and disruption\".\n\"We cannot sit back and watch this unfold. Children need support as soon as a problem is identified, and not be left to suffer in silence on a waiting list for months on end, risking even more damage to their mental health,\" said director of policy Imran Hussain.\nA recent BBC investigation found that one in five children seen by mental health services in the past year waited more than 12 weeks for care in many areas of England.\nLaw student Bilal Hussain, 20, is a mental-health ambassador at Birmingham City university. \nLast year, when Covid hit, he had a breakdown.\n\"I felt no-one could hear me out, no matter who I was or how old I was,\" he said.\nHe received help from his GP and NHS programme Healthy Minds, and now wants to help others.\n\"Even just giving a moment of our time for an individual could potentially save a life,\" Bilal said.\nThe mental health survey also found that:\nCharity YoungMinds said the research was \"a stark warning\" that the increase in children with probable mental disorders last year appeared to be \"here to stay, unless swift government action is taken\".\n\"We are urging new investment in a network of early support hubs so that all young people can get the help they need as soon as they need it,\" said chief executive Emma Thomas.\nThe Children's Society said it wanted the government \"to commit to measuring children's wellbeing as it already does for adults\". \nThis will help identify children who are struggling and how best to prevent mental health problems from emerging, it said.\nAn NHS England spokesman said it was investing in services, including into new school-based mental health teams and existing specialist community mental health, services to support children and young people."

      "tags": "Britney Spears,Music",
      "text": "A judge has suspended Britney Spears' father from the legal arrangement that gave him control of her life after Spears accused him of years of abuse.\nJamie Spears was appointed her guardian in 2008, amid concerns over her mental health. On Wednesday, a judge handed the role to a man appointed by Spears.\nFans around the world have supported her through the #FreeBritney campaign. \nThose outside the court in Los Angeles cheered and whooped when they heard the news. \nAnd there was jubilation from some of Spears' high-profile supporters on social media, including Cher, LaToya Jackson and Dionne Warwick. \nMr Spears, who denies any abuse, had filed to end the conservatorship after Spears requested another guardian.\nA conservatorship is granted by a court for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions, like those with dementia or other mental illnesses. \nSpears' conservatorship is split into two parts - one for her estate and financial affairs, the other for her as a person. Under this legal agreement, she has not controlled her finances since 2008.\nJamie Spears was initially in charge of both parts of the conservatorship but stepped down as his daughter's personal conservator in 2019 for health reasons. Jodi Montgomery, a care professional, replaced him in that role on what has been a temporary basis.\nIn a court hearing in Los Angeles, Judge Brenda Penny formally ended the conservatorship that the star had with her father, but left in place a separate conservatorship with an accountant chosen by Spears' legal team.\nMr Spears had argued that this accountant, John Zabel, was not qualified to oversee the singer's $59m (\u00a346m) fortune.\nJudge Penny ruled that the singer's care be turned over to Mr Zabel \"forthwith\", adding that it \"is in the best interest of the conservatee\".\nThe singer's lawyers also requested that a new hearing be held in the next 30 to 45 days to decide whether to end Spears' conservatorship altogether.\nSpears' struggles with mental health and the courts have attracted massive public interest, with three documentaries on her life released in just the past week alone. \nAhead of the hearing on Wednesday, fans held a rally outside the court where they sang her classic \"Hit Me Baby One More Time\". Fans in London's Trafalgar Square also held a Free Britney rally on Wednesday.\nSpears herself did not call into the hearing.\nAfter quietly simmering for years, the case exploded this summer amid a flurry of legal filings. \nOn 23 June, Spears delivered a 20-minute emotional testimony in court, blasting the arrangement with her father. \nShe accused him of holding her in a mental health facility against her will and forcing her to use medications and birth control to prevent her from getting pregnant. \n\"I just want my life back,\" she said. \"I truly believe this conservatorship is abusive.\"\nSpears spoke in court again on 14 July, telling the judge she wanted to charge her father with conservatorship abuse.  \"If this is not abuse, I don't know what is,\" she added.\nMr Spears and his lawyers have denied all allegations of abuse, saying in court filings that \"all he wants is what is best for his daughter\".\n\"If Ms Spears wants to terminate the conservatorship and believes that she can handle her own life, Mr Spears believes that she should get that chance,\" his lawyers told the judge earlier this month.\nMathew Rosengart, a lawyer hired by Ms Spears in July, has accused Mr Spears of trying to extort $2m from his daughter as a condition of ending the conservatorship.\nIn a surprise move in September, Mr Spears himself filed to end the 13-year arrangement. It came about two months after he offered to step down and allow another guardian to replace him. \nDuring Wednesday's hearing, Mr Rosengart argued that Spears' should continue to be temporarily overseen by Mr Zabel until Mr Spears' alleged abuse is fully investigated. Mr Spears' lawyer, Vivian Thoreen objected, calling Mr Zabel a \"stranger\" to the case.\nAfter the ruling, her fianc\u00e9 Sam Asghari took to Instagram to cheer the decision.\nSpears \"burst into tears upon hearing the judge's decision,\" a source close to the singer told Page Six. \"She's in shock and at a loss for words but literally jumping for joy. She hasn't felt joy like this in 13 years,\" the person added."

      "text": "Sarah Everard was a \"wholly blameless victim of a grotesque series of circumstances\", a judge has said.\nWayne Couzens, a Met Police officer, strangled Ms Everard with his police belt after kidnapping her during a false arrest.\nCouzens showed his warrant card before restraining the 33-year-old, putting her in his hire car and driving away.\nLord Justice Fulford said he had \"no doubt Couzens used his position as a police officer to coerce her into car\".\nAhead of sentencing Couzens, the judge said the circumstances of the case were \"devastating, tragic and wholly brutal\".\nThe evidence gathered against him was \"unanswerable\" and there was \"no credible innocent explanation\" for it, he said.\nThe judge added that Couzens went \"hunting a lone female to kidnap and rape\" having planned his actions in \"unspeakably\" grim detail.\nThe defendant's preparations included taking some of his police kit with him and lying to his family about working on the night of the murder, he said.\nProsecutor Tom Little QC previously suggested the case was so exceptional and unprecedented that it could warrant a whole life order, meaning Couzens would die in jail.\nDuring mitigation earlier, defence barrister Jim Sturman QC said his client was filled with \"self-loathing\".\nHe told the Old Bailey that nothing he said was intended to minimise the \"horror\" of what Couzens did that night and after, but he argued against a whole-life order.\n\"He accepts he will receive and deserves severe punishment,\" Mr Sturman said,\n\"No right-minded person... can feel anything other than revulsion for what he did.\"\nThe barrister claimed that Couzens should not be sentenced to a whole-life order on three grounds: his guilty pleas, underlying depression and that he has no previous convictions for violence.\nMs Everard's family previously said there can be \"no redemption for what he had done\".\nThe defendant was not able to look at the family during the hearing.\nMr Sturman added: \"He is ashamed. What he has done is terrible and he deserves a very lengthy finite term.\n\"But he did all he could after he was arrested to minimise the wicked harm that he did.\"\nLucy Manning, BBC special correspondent, from the Old Bailey:\nWayne Couzens walked into the dock, bent over, again looking down at the floor.\nAfter the emotion of Wednesday when he was made to look up and face the Everard family as they described the impact of losing Sarah, he will find out today if he will spend the rest of his life in jail.\nThe Everard family are in court to hear what sentence he will receive.\nAs Couzens' barrister told the court that the policeman doesn't seek to make excuses for anything that he'd done and he is filled with self loathing and abject shame, Sarah Everard's mother stared at her daughter's murderer. He never looked up.\nAs they said yesterday, all they want is Sarah back and no punishment he receives will ever compare to the pain and torture Couzens inflicted on them.\nCouzens' two-day sentencing hearing, which started on Wednesday, heard that Ms Everard's ordeal could be summarised as \"deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation, fire\".\nThe firearms officer, who had clocked off from a 12-hour shift at the American embassy that morning, drove to a secluded rural area near Dover in Kent, where he parked up and raped Ms Everard.\nThe marketing executive, who lived in Brixton, south London, had been strangled by 02:30 GMT the following morning, the Old Bailey heard.\nCouzens burned her body in a refrigerator in an area of woodland he owned in Hoads Wood, near Ashford, before dumping her remains in a nearby pond.\nHe was arrested at his home in Deal, Kent, after police connected him to a hire car he used to abduct Ms Everard, whose remains were found by police dogs on 10 March.\nA whole-life order means the criminal is in prison for the rest of their life without ever becoming eligible for parole. \nIt differs from a life sentence, under which the prisoner is given a number of years they must spend in jail after which they will be eligible to apply for parole.\nWhole-life tariffs are reserved for offenders judged to be the most dangerous to society."

In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough.\nSome employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends.\nInternational travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs.\nMany forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. \nIf you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. \nThe selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay.\nIf you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: \nYou might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. \nThe amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. \nYou may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs. \nThere is lots of free benefits guidance and advice available, including: \nThe government says 11.6 million jobs have been supported by the scheme.\nFrom March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about \u00a366bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. \nThat's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid.\nHowever, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs. \nAt the start of the pandemic it was feared that more than one in 10 workers would become unemployed.\nInstead the unemployment rate is currently less than one in 20.

We can't keep absorbing those costs.\n\"I don't think retailers will be able to keep the costs down.\"\nKieren Clarke-Hill and his wife have already done most of their Christmas present shopping, having started in September.\nHe said: \"This year, with Covid, and you know something else is going to happen down the line, we like to be a little bit cautious and thought why not.\"\nVictoria Jones said she was not \"overly concerned\" about any potential shortages.\n\"We've gotten used to learning how to be content and survive anyway, so if we can survive a pandemic, we can survive a few shortages.\"\nYou can see more about this story in Wales Live on the BBC iPlayer"
