      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Greater Manchester's Covid death rate has been 25% higher than the rest of England during the pandemic, new research has found.\nThe study into the impact of the virus in the region also said life expectancy in north-west England declined more during 2020 than in England overall.\nThe report says health inequalities in Greater Manchester have been exposed and amplified by the pandemic.\nIt calls for more resources directed at education, employment and housing.\nThe report was originally commissioned in 2019 by the Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership - the devolved health body responsible for health across the city region. \nIt asked one of the world's leading experts on health inequalities, Prof Sir Michael Marmot, to look at how it could improve the health of Manchester's population.\nBut the pandemic led to a change in emphasis, meaning today's report looks at the toll the virus has taken across the area. \nIt found the city had a 25% higher Covid-19 death rate than England as a whole in the 13 months to March 2021. \nGreater Manchester had the third highest Covid death rate of the areas studied in the report, behind the West Midlands and Greater London. \nThat high death rate contributed to a decline in life expectancy in the wider North West that was larger than the average in England, it said.\nLife expectancy in the North West fell in 2020 by 1.6 years for men and 1.2 years for women compared with an average in England of 1.3 years and 0.9 years respectively. \nIn the garden of their family home in Oldham, Gary Gilmartin's sisters Jayne Risby and Debbie Phillips are still coming to terms with the death of their brother.\n\"He was just really special, a really special person. I'd say out of all the family he was the real character,\" says Jayne of her brother.\nGary fell ill after a family holiday to Spain in March of 2020, just as the pandemic was taking off.\nThree weeks after dancing and singing karaoke with his sisters in Benidorm, Gary was dead.\nA dedicated Manchester City fan, Jayne says her brother was hugely popular. \n\"He was just a massive Mancunian, a lot of people in Manchester just absolutely loved him.\" \nAnd Jayne says the whole family - Gary was one of five siblings - is struggling with grief.\n\"The loss of him affects us now for the rest of our lives, we'll never have Gary around for a party, we'll never have him round for dinner. \n\"I just feel like he's been stolen away from us and it's left a massive void.\"\nBoth sisters know that Gary is one name among hundreds of thousands - each one a painful story of loss.\n\"There's millions aren't there, all worldwide. Really, we're all suffering.\"\nIn the report, Sir Michael says the pandemic exposed and amplified existing issues in the city. \n\"Greater Manchester has high levels of avoidable health inequalities as a result of longstanding economic and social inequities, and as across the country, ethnic disadvantage,\" he said.\n\"The city region has also experienced high rates of mortality from Covid-19 and particularly damaging long-term economic and social effects during the pandemic as a result of prolonged lockdowns.  \n\"The kind of recommendations that I make are not just about health care or not just about public health. \n\"They're about housing and transport and community development and jobs and schools.  It cuts across the board. And we need to spend to improve the health and wellbeing for future generations as well as for now.\"\nThe proposals also include a call for extra resources for early years care, better mental health services for young people, and measures relating to the environment and workplaces.\nMayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham has welcomed the report's findings.\n\"The pandemic has brutally exposed just how unequal England actually is,\" he said. \"People have lived parallel lives over the last 18 months. \n\"People in low-paid, insecure work have often had little choice in their level of exposure to Covid - and the risk of getting it and bringing it back home to those they live with.\n\"Levelling up needs to start in the communities that have been hit hardest by the pandemic. \n\"To improve the nation's physical and mental health, we need to start by giving all fellow citizens a good job and good home.\""

Her cause of death at this stage was given as a stab wound to the neck, which cut through her carotid artery, jugular vein and cervical spine.\nDet Con Barrick said there was no evidence she had been sexually assaulted.\nGiving evidence at the separate inquest opening for Sellers, Det Con Barrick said the 35-year-old was unemployed and was last seen at his family home in Sheffield at 06:30 on 18 June, when he left in his vehicle.\nPolice searched the area after Ms Spinks was found, but Sellers's body was found by members of the public. He was in an area of Blue Lodge Farm surrounded by trees and bushes.\nA post-mortem examination suggested his death was \"self-inflicted\", as a result of starving his body of oxygen.\nDerbyshire Police has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which means full inquests cannot be held until their investigation has concluded.\nHowever, assistant coroner Matthew Kewley has asked police to give him a written update by 29 October.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "The Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex will meet later to unveil a statue of their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, on what would have been her 60th birthday.\nThe event will be William and Harry's first appearance together since the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral in April.\nCommissioned by the brothers in 2017, the statue will stand in Kensington Palace's redesigned Sunken Garden.\nAt the time, they said they hoped it would help visitors to the palace \"reflect on her life and her legacy\".\nHarry, who lives in the US with his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, and their two children, arrived in the UK last week in order to complete his quarantine ahead of Thursday's event.\nOn Wednesday, he paid a surprise visit to children's charity WellChild's awards ceremony for seriously ill children in the UK.\nKensington Palace confirmed that, in addition to the royal brothers, members of Diana's close family will attend the unveiling, which is due to take place this afternoon.\nThe committee that oversaw the statue's creation and the redesign of the garden that will be its home will also attend. \nIan Rank-Broadley, who has a long track record of creating images of the Royal Family, was chosen to sculpt it, and he will also be among the guests.\nThe ceremony - scaled back due to Covid restrictions - will be a \"small event and a very personal moment for the family\", a source told the PA News agency.\nKensington Palace said the Sunken Garden had been \"one of the princess's favourite locations\" when she lived there.\nMore than 4,000 flowers have been planted for the garden's redesign, which has taken 1,000 hours to complete.\nThe garden, which sits within London's Hyde Park, will be open to the public to visit for free from tomorrow, in line with Kensington Palace's opening hours. \nThe birthday flowers and balloons outside the railings of Kensington Palace are a reminder that despite her death almost 24 years ago, Diana has not been forgotten.\nBack when they were on much friendlier terms, Princes William and Harry commissioned this statue to be a permanent reminder of her \"positive impact on the UK and the world\".\nMuch has changed since then. Physically, the Sunken Garden has been redesigned and replanted with her favourite flowers. \nBut it is the changed relationship between her two boys which will overshadow much of the unveiling.\nThis will be a family event but William and Harry will know that the small number of cameras allowed in to capture the moment will be trained on them and their interactions. \nIt will add to the pressure they will be feeling on a deeply personal and poignant day for them. \nSpeaking about his mother's death in a recent interview, Harry said he had been willing to drink and take drugs to cope with the pain of losing her.\nHe also spoke of his family's unwillingness to talk about the death, and how he was expected to \"suffer\" in silence.\nThe comments, along with a series of other revelations, followed the Sussexes' decision to step down as senior royals at the beginning of 2020.\nPrincess Diana was killed in a car crash in August 1997, when Prince William and Prince Harry were aged just 15 and 12. \nIan Rank-Broadley is no stranger to depicting royalty. His effigy of the Queen appeared on all UK and Commonwealth coins since 1998, while another of his likenesses of the monarch appears on a plaque at the Supreme Court in Parliament Square.\nEarlier this month a limited-edition \u00a35 coin commemorating the life of the Duke of Edinburgh featuring Rank-Broadley's likeness of Prince Philip was unveiled on Armed Forces Day.\nTwo of his sculptures - a group of stretcher bearers carrying a wounded soldier and another group tending to an injured comrade - can be seen at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.\nHis other work includes a sculpture of a machine gunner that stands on the Royal Anglian Regimental Memorial at the Imperial War Museum in Duxford, Cambridgeshire."

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban,US Armed Forces,United States",
      "text": "The US military could complete its withdrawal from Afghanistan within days, reports say, amid increasing Taliban battlefield gains.\nUS officials told Reuters that some US forces were expected to stay to protect the US embassy and Kabul airport.\nThe reports came as a top US commander warned the country risked sliding into civil war as the last US troops leave.\nFighting has surged since the US began withdrawing last month, with the Taliban seizing swathes of territory.\nCNN quoted US officials corroborating the Reuters report. \"This week could be a critical week in the withdrawal and end of the retrograde process,\" an unnamed defence official told the network.\nAbout 650 US troops are expected to remain to help secure the US embassy in Kabul, and several hundred more may be stationed at the city's airport.\nPresident Biden has set a deadline of 11 September for US troops to fully withdraw. But recent reports had suggested most of the more than 4,000 troops deployed in recent months would be out by mid-July, well ahead of time.\nThe pace of the pull-out now appears even faster. \nOn Tuesday, Gen Scott Miller said Afghanistan could face \"very hard times\" if its leadership was unable to unite once international troops leave.\nThe warning from the commander of the US-led mission in Afghanistan came just days after the UN warned of \"dire scenarios\" as the Taliban took hold of many districts.\nIt said insurgents had taken more than 50 of 370 districts since May, encircling many cities and closing in on the capital Kabul.\n\"The security situation is not good right now,\" Gen Miller said in a rare news conference.\n\"Civil war is certainly a path that can be visualised if this continues on the trajectory it's on right now,\" he added. \"That should be a concern to the world.\"\nAfghans knew this was coming. Warnings of \"civil war\" have become a visceral part of their own lives; they've lived, and seen loved ones die, in a steadily deteriorating situation long before this \"day after\" even starts. \nBut the looming departure of the last US soldier is now concentrating minds. Many fear the worst even as they hold fast to any faint glimmers of hope. Both the government and the Taliban speak of a summer of fighting before there's any chance of a genuine effort to forge a negotiated way out. \nEveryone insists \"there is no military solution\" but there's still no certainty of a peaceful one. In many rural areas, families already flee an upsurge in fighting, many for the umpteenth time. \nThese are anxious days of \"fight-or-flight.\" Many with means have left, are leaving; others vow to stay. Most Afghans have no choice; this moment of history will just be more days of trying to make ends meet.\nGen Miller accused the Taliban of failing to reduce violence in line with an agreement it struck with the US.\nThe militant group claims to have recently captured more than 100 districts across Afghanistan - something experts tie to the lack of US air support to Afghan forces.\nBut Gen Miller did not rule out the US using air strikes against the Taliban.\n\"What I [would] like to see is no air strikes, but to get to no air strikes, you stop all violence,\" he told reporters.\nUS-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in October 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks in the US.\nPresident Biden has said the American pull-out is justified as US forces have made sure Afghanistan cannot again become a base for foreign jihadists to plot against the West.\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani insists the country's security forces are fully capable of keeping insurgents at bay, but many believe the withdrawal risks casting Afghanistan back into the grip of the Taliban.\nPresident Biden has pledged that the US will continue to support Afghanistan after pulling troops out, but not \"militarily\".\nThe last Italian soldiers deployed in Afghanistan as part of Nato-led foreign forces have now returned home. Italy's defence ministry said it had deployed more than 50,000 troops to Afghanistan since 9/11. \nOn Tuesday, Germany brought to an end almost two decades of involvement in the country. About 150,000 Germans had served there since 2001, the defence ministry said. "

      "text": "A group of holiday hotspots have been added to the international green list.\nFrom 04:00 on Wednesday, travel to Malta, Madeira and the Balearic Islands is allowed without having to quarantine.\nPassengers arriving from those destinations are only required to take a Covid test on day two of their return.\nThe first flights from Scotland took off from Edinburgh on Wednesday morning.\nWithin hours of the restrictions being lifted, passengers flew from Edinburgh Airport to Ibiza and Majorca. More airlines will open routes to the new green list destinations from the weekend at other airports across Scotland.\nHowever, the Scottish government said there would be close monitoring of the Balearics ahead of the next review of foreign travel guidance in three weeks.\nThe development comes in week one of the school holidays for most Scottish children.\nOther additions to the expanded green travel list include Antigua, Barbados, and Bermuda.\nConversely a number of destinations - including Tunisia and Uganda - have been added to the red list which requires managed isolation for 10 days on return.\nThe \"traffic light\" risk warning system for international travel came into effect on 17 May.\nUnder the rules, travellers returning from red list countries are required to enter managed isolation. \nAmber list returnees must self-isolate at home with two Covid tests on days two and eight. \nTravellers returning from green list countries are not required to isolate, but must take a Covid test on day two.\nStudent Louis Eastment was returning home to Majorca from Edinburgh Airport having finished a business course at university.\nThe 19-year-old is looking forward to enjoying the weather - and not having to isolate for 10 days having already produced a negative test result.\n\"It's much easier to get back home and cheaper for students, it's just a lot less stress,\" he said. \nSpeaking about the ongoing green list monitoring, he said: \"I think it's better because it takes into account the specifics of each country instead of grouping everything together.\n\"Last time I did have to isolate so now I can get there and know I'm fine because I'll test myself when I get there just to be sure.\"\nAlthough this is the longest the green list has been since the the traffic light system was implemented, the public has been warned before booking travel that the international situation can change at short notice.\nTransport Secretary Michael Matheson said: \"From the outset we have said caution is required regarding international travel and people should think very carefully about travelling abroad as situations can suddenly change.\n\"We continue to work closely with the other home nations and are cautiously supportive of exploring options for the easing of restrictions for fully vaccinated travellers arriving from countries on the amber list.\n\"But only if the clinical advice supports it and if systems are in place to ensure the wider safety of the Scottish population.\"\nTravellers this summer will still have to follow the rules of the country they are travelling to.\nSome countries require proof of vaccination and/or results of a PCR Covid test.\nA vaccination status letter can be requested from the NHS Inform patient portal or via a freephone Covid status helpline on 0808 196 8565.\nThe countries added to the green travel list on 30 June are: Malta, Madeira and the Balearic islands; the Caribbean nations of Antigua, Barbados, Barbuda, Dominica and Grenada; and the UK overseas territories of Anguilla and Montserrat, Bermuda, British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Pitcairn, and Turks and Caicos Islands.\nThey join current green list countries Australia, New Zealand, Brunei Darussalam, Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Iceland, Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.\nThe Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Haiti, Mongolia, Tunisia and Uganda have been added to the red list following the latest review.\nOn Tuesday, Portugal and Malta introduced measures to restrict UK travellers who are not fully vaccinated.  \nThe Portuguese government said travellers must quarantine for 14 days unless they can prove they received their second vaccine dose a fortnight before arrival.\nMalta is only allowing double-vaccinated people in from Wednesday.\nIn Spain, UK travellers need to prove they are fully vaccinated, or provide a negative PCR test on arrival. This includes travellers to the Balearics.\nThe measures have been introduced amid fears British travellers could spread the more contagious Delta variant of coronavirus, which was first identified in India.\nThe tougher restrictions across Europe come after Germany urged the EU to restrict UK travellers. German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to designate the UK as a \"country of concern\" because the Delta variant is so widespread here.\nExperts have warned that there is a civic duty to protect other countries from the Delta variant until their vaccine programmes caught up with the UK's. \nDr Elly Gaunt, a virologist at the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh, said the restrictions on Scottish travellers were in-line with the infection rates in other countries, but did not reflect the rising cases in Scotland. \n\"The numbers yesterday were 70% up than what they were a week ago,\" she told BBC Scotland. \n\"We have this civic duty to protect other countries from the emergence of the Delta variant until their vaccination programmes can catch up.\"\nShe said: \"The Alpha variant emerged in Kent and we didn't close our borders so we exported that around the world and we've seen the consequences in many, many deaths in other countries as a result of that. \n\"We are in the same situation where we have an extremely high rate of the Delta variant which is associated with increased hospitalisation, increased transmission and some immunoevasive properties, meaning that people who have already had Covid could be reinfected.\"\nDr Gaunt said it was risky to take that to countries with lower vaccine coverage and the health infrastructure needed to deal with outbreaks like the one in Scotland. \nShe added that she would not recommend travelling by plane, where air is re-circulated, because \"the Delta variant is extremely transmissible in the air\".\nHowever, the travel industry welcomed the additions to the green list, while urging the government to go further.\nJulian Slatter, from Edinburgh-based Ian Dickson Travel, warned that the system was still causing confusion and anxiety for travellers. \n\"The big uncertainty people have is if they're on holiday and it goes from green to amber,\" he told Reporting Scotland. \"We've all seen how panic sets in and there's not often enough flights for people to get in. \n\"We need to have something that's more uniform so that people aren't going to a green list country that has a different rule to another green list country. We need governments to start talking to each other.\"\nEasyJet has said the timetable \"simply isn't ambitious enough\" and British Airways said the announcement was not enough to help the sector recover from the pandemic.\nJet2 cautiously welcomed the announcements as \"a step in the right direction\".\nThe Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) said the changes would \"not on their own deliver the meaningful restart of international travel that the industry desperately needs\"."

      "text": "Nearly 500 saplings of the world's largest tree, the giant sequoia, have been planted in Brecon.\nThe team behind the One Life One Tree project said it could be the largest plantation of its type in Europe and that every tree would offset a person's lifetime carbon footprint due to its size and lifespan.  \nEach sequoia also has its own story, like the one planted by Gareth Jones in memory of his wife, Lucy.\n\"I think she'd appreciate it,\" he said.\n\"My wife, for the last 20 years of her life, worked as an international education consultant.\n\"She travelled all over the world and she always felt that she was contributing to this carbon dioxide,\" said Mr Jones, from Rhoose in the Vale of Glamorgan.\n\"She had three gold cards with different airline companies, and they were all maxed out - she was doing a lot of flying. So, this is payback time.\"\nFounder Henry Emson came up with the idea when he started thinking about ways to offset his children's lifetime carbon footprint.\n\"I quite quickly realised that what people wanted was to be a part of something that was positive, to be a part of the solution,\" he said.\n\"We are all repeatedly reminded about how much trouble the planet is in and the climate emergency.\n\"That triggered me to think that I could offer this to other people to help them plant their giant sequoia and to be more climate responsible.\"\nThe sequoia was chosen because it grows very quickly and can live for thousands of years.\n\"What we have here is the opportunity to plant effectively the most powerful tree species on the planet for carbon capture,\" he said.\n\"Sequoias stack carbon incredibly efficiently.  \n\"Over the space of, say, a hectare, a sequoia grove left for a hundred years, versus a natural native woodland planted, will capture 10 times more CO2 for that hectare of space.\"\nBut he said it would take \"a couple of hundred\" years for each tree to bring someone's carbon footprint down to zero.\n\"It comes with the acknowledgement that people need to do more in the short term to reduce emissions and that planting trees takes a long time, but this is about a legacy.\"\nLindsay Perks planted a sequoia with her husband, Matt, and their two children, Annabelle, 12, and Will, seven, in memory of her father, Trevor, who died in February.\n\"It was very difficult for him to talk about what he wanted for his funeral and we had no idea what to do,\" said Ms Perks, from Bristol.\n\"But this was an idea he was really taken with. It feels like an appropriate thing to do. My dad liked woodwork.\n\"To leave something as monumental as a tree that takes in so much carbon is a real treat to be able to do that for someone.\"\nSequoias are best known for growing in their native California where some grow taller than 200ft (60m).\nIn the middle of the 19th Century, some were planted in the UK by wealthy Victorians.\nOne such grove is not far up the road in Leighton in Powys where some of the oldest sequoias, planted in 1857, are now taller than 130ft (40m).\nIn Brecon, 1,500 native trees are being planted at the site, which used to be a timber plantation.\nAlongside the sequoias, native trees like oak and beech are being planted to increase biodiversity.\nMr Emson said 1,000 people had signed up to the project, each paying \u00a3395 to plant a sequoia, and another site in Abergavenny had just been purchased.\nThe project promises to donate the sequoias to a woodland charity to ensure the trees are not cut down and so they can eventually grow to tower over generations to come."

      "text": "The bodies of two children have been found in the rubble of a collapsed Florida tower block, raising the known death toll to 18, rescuers say.\nRescue teams have been able to build a ramp for a crane to reach areas of the ruined building.\nNearly 150 people are still missing after the collapse one week ago. The latest victims to be found have not yet been publicly identified.\nOfficials say they remain hopeful that some survivors could be found.\nRescue teams say they are working 12-hour shifts as they comb the rubble in the town of Surfside, north of Miami, despite sweltering heat and high humidity hampering their efforts.\n\"They are digging as if there are survivors there. They are still remaining hopeful, but it is indeed a terrible tragedy all around,\" Florida Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez told the BBC.\nFresh rescue teams are due to arrive from other states, with severe tropical weather expected to hit the area in the coming days.\nAs well as bad weather, search and rescue teams have also faced fires and falling debris.\nAn Israeli team helping with the rescue efforts told CNN it had discovered some tunnels large enough for a person, though most of the debris was \"very, very tight.\"\nOne family confirmed on Wednesday that the 12th person found dead after the collapse was 92-year-old Hilda Noriega.\nThey said they had lost the \"heart and soul\" and \"matriarch\", but would \"get through this time by embracing the unconditional love Hilda was known for\".\nWhat caused nearly half of the 40-year-old Champlain Towers south block to fall as residents slept in the early hours of last Thursday remains unknown.\nBut it emerged yesterday that residents had received a letter in April warning them of worsening structural damage to the building.\nLawsuits are already being filed over the disaster, with the latest accusing the block's building association of \"reckless and negligent conduct\".\nMiami-Dade County State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said she would convene a special grand jury to examine building safety and \"what steps we can take to safeguard our residents\" from similar disasters in the future.\nUS President Joe Biden and his wife Jill plan to visit the scene of the tragedy later on Thursday."

      "text": "A bookshop owner has described how customers have sworn and spat at staff trying to enforce Covid safety rules.\nPeople in Wales must wear a mask in shops and keep to social distancing rules unless exempt on medical grounds. \n\"The lack of respect is shocking,\" said Sian Ellen Cowper of Browsers in Porthmadog, Gwynedd, where customers are now only allowed in on invitation.\nA small business group said it was disappointed and had been contacted by others with similar examples.\nMs Cowper said the past few months had been among the most challenging in the shop's 40-year history. \n\"We felt we were opening into an environment where the public knew what was expected of them,\" she said.\n\"What we've encountered has been very different.\n\"We have been faced with shoppers, 80% of whom have to be asked to put a mask on or sanitise their hands.\n\"We've given up trying to police social distancing because of the additional abuse we've been receiving.\"\nThe shop now has a rope across the door before customers are welcomed in by invitation. \n\"It's been quite shocking,\" said Ms Cowper.\n\"A few people say they genuinely forgot and that is fine - we all forget - but a high percentage are abusive. \n\"There is no excuse for someone to swear at a member of staff.\n\"We were spat at on one occasion.\"\nPaula Lesley, who owns Toy-Bocs-Tegannau toy shop a few doors down on Porthmadog High Street, said she had also come across similar behaviour with some shoppers not wanting to queue or sanitise their hands. \n\"Mostly it's been very good, but you do get the exception of some who don't want to queue outside,\" she said.\n\"If they don't stick to the rules then, unfortunately, they're not allowed in.\"\nThe Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said a number of people had contacted them with similar worries.  \n\"It's extremely disappointing that staff and business owners have been subjected to this,\" said Ben Francis, its policy chairman in Wales. \n\"FSB Wales have urged people to support local businesses where possible but this sort of abuse behaviour should never be a result of that support.\"\nThe Welsh government said everyone had a responsibility to follow Covid regulations to help prevent the spread of the virus and keep people safe."

      "text": "Under-18s travelling to mainland Portugal with a fully vaccinated parent or guardian will not have to quarantine, authorities have confirmed.\nThe statement follows two days of confusion over whether Portugal's new rules applied to minors.\nUnder the rules, adults must quarantine for 14 days unless they can prove they received their second vaccine dose a fortnight before arrival.\nBut children aged 12 and over do have to show a negative Covid-19 test. \nThis must either be an RT-PCR test taken 72 hours before their departure, or a lateral flow test taken 48 hours before their departure.\nThese rules are specific to mainland Portugal, which is currently on the amber list, meaning those travelling back to the UK from there must quarantine for 10 days at home. \nDifferent rules apply for travellers to Madeira, which will be added to the UK's green watch list from Wednesday. \nThe new rules have already had an impact. \n\"It was carnage and chaos for every business in the Algarve,\" says Joe Mountain who runs Sandy Blue Villas, renting accommodation in the Algarve.\n\"Yesterday we were contacted by 50% of UK guests with forward bookings for this summer. \n\"People were in meltdown and just not understanding the rules. It's impossible to find answers. \n\"For us, it has been continued uncertainty for the last two months, with a real lack of ability to plan. We rely on that and it is critical that we get UK guests this summer.\"\nIn another development, Malta's health ministry has said travellers arriving there from the UK from Wednesday will need an official NHS letter to prove their vaccination status.\n\"Only the paper version of the NHS Covid letter will be accepted, which can be requested online or by calling 119,\" the health ministry said.\n\"The vaccination certificate will be not accepted in digital or downloaded PDF form. It must be the printed version issued directly from the NHS.\"  \nMalta has said only \"fully vaccinated travellers\" will be allowed to enter the country from the UK - and this includes children aged 12-plus. Children under 12 will be permitted if they are accompanied by parents or guardians who have had both doses. \nThe Maltese government has said those aged between five and 11 must also show evidence of a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours before arrival.\nThe measures have been introduced for UK travellers, in particular for those not fully vaccinated, amid fears they could spread the Delta variant of coronavirus, which was first identified in India."

      "tags": "Savings,HM Treasury,Money,Personal finance",
      "text": "Details of a new savings product which will fund the government's environmental projects have been revealed - except for one key factor.\nAnyone aged 16 or over will be able to put between \u00a3100 and \u00a3100,000 into Green Savings Bonds from National Savings and Investments (NS&I).\nMoney will be locked in for three years but, significantly, the interest rate has yet to be announced.\nThat, and when the bonds go on sale, will be unveiled later in the year.\nAnna Bowes, of comparison site Savings Champion, said: \"It is frustrating that we were told this would be available in the summer but that date is being stretched.\"\nShe said the interest rate was unlikely to be very competitive because the bonds would be attractive to people who wanted to save safely in green projects. \nChancellor Rishi Sunak announced in the Budget that the new savings product would go on sale in the summer.\nIt is designed to raise billions of pounds for environmental projects such as wind and hydrogen power, as part of plans to hit the government's net-zero carbon emissions target by 2050.\nThe chancellor also hopes it will assist with green shoots of economic recovery after the pandemic by creating jobs in this sector.\nIn effect, the money will go to the government to spend on these products, rather than the public investing directly in a specific environmental scheme.\nThe new Bond will go on sale via NS&I - the government-backed provider of Premium Bonds. It has been heavily criticised by savers and MPs for its customer service performance during the pandemic. \nHowever, it is attractive to savers as their money is 100% guaranteed to be safe by the government. Up to \u00a385,000 per person, and per bank, building society or credit union is guaranteed for savers elsewhere under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.\nThe terms - published on the NS&I website - state that savers aged 16 and over can apply online and each put in between \u00a3100 and \u00a3100,000. Anyone unable to operate online can phone NS&I for help.\nTo receive interest, they must not withdraw their savings for three years.\nIn recent years, savers have been starved of any kind of decent returns owing to cheap rates of borrowing.\nSignificantly, the Green Savings Bond interest rate has not yet been declared.\nThe average rate for three-year bonds on the market is 0.76% a year. The most generous interest rate for a three-year bond at the moment is 1.26% a year.\nThe Treasury has described it as a world-first. Savings Bonds are certainly nothing new. The Investment Guaranteed Growth Bond (IGGB) was sold via NS&I for a year from April 2017. That was a three-year bond, with an interest rate of 2.2%.\nThere are a number of \"green\" savings products available to savers, some of which have market-leading interest rates.\nThey include the Gatehouse Bank Green Saver and Oxbury Bank Forest Saver, which fund tree planting projects. Triodos Bank and the Ecology Building Society also use money raised from savers to lend to environmental projects.\nOther specific green investment prospectuses are also marketed in the UK, although they often rely on the projects to be successful before paying any kind of return."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nEngland football fans are being told not to travel to Italy to watch their side face Ukraine in the Euros quarter final on Saturday, since Italy's Covid travel rules for UK arrivals mean they'd have to quarantine and miss the match. Good news if you're an England fan living elsewhere though: Uefa will sell the 2,300 or so tickets that had been allocated to the FA to registered England fans who don't live in the UK. Italy's travel rules are more relaxed for people living in Europe. It comes as new figures for Scotland show nearly 2,000 Covid cases have been linked to people watching football. Two thirds of cases were fans who travelled to London for Scotland's game with England.\nThe NHS has been given the go ahead to start planning a Covid vaccine booster programme in the UK before this winter. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has issued advice that those who are most vulnerable to Covid should get a third dose - meaning all adults over 50 and anyone younger who qualifies for a flu jab. The current vaccines are thought to protect people against serious illness for at least six months - although there's no firm data on exactly how long immunity lasts. The idea is that boosters will help maintain protection against Covid and new variants. More on how the UK's vaccine rollout is going here.\nCurrently, rules in schools mean that pupils are kept in groups - or bubbles - and if someone in that group tests positive for Covid then everyone else in the bubble must self-isolate. Figures earlier this week showed there had been a sharp rise in pupils sent home to isolate, and now Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has told MPs he wants the system scrapped as soon as possible. He said they could be removed as part of the next step of lockdown easing in England, currently scheduled for 19 July. \nEarlier Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged the PM over why he didn't sack former Health Secretary Matt Hancock when he broke Covid rules. He brought up the case of Ollie Bibby, who was not allowed to see his family as he died of leukaemia in hospital in May, a day before Mr Hancock was filmed kissing a colleague in violation of Covid regulations. \"It's one rule for them, another rule for everyone else,\" said Sir Keir. In response, Boris Johnson said everyone shared the Bibby family's grief but that the government was focusing on vaccines, rather than \"on stuff going on within the Westminster bubble\". Ollie's mum Penny said his reply made her family feel \"not important\".\nNearly half of Australia's population - more than 12 million people - are under new stay-at-home orders after a small rise in cases across the country. Seven Australian cities including Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, Darwin, Townsville and the Gold Coast are now in lockdown as authorities scramble to prevent the spread of the highly-contagious Delta variant. State leaders said they were facing a \"pressure cooker situation\" as new cases emerged. The move comes after a slow vaccination rollout with just 5% of the population being fully vaccinated.  \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nAs more and more over-18s are vaccinated, we've answered some of the main questions about getting the jab.\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Galston,Wembley Stadium,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Thousands of Scotland fans have gathered in central London to watch the team's Euro 2020 match with England.\nMany fans travelled despite warnings they should not go to London unless they have a match ticket, or a safe place to watch the game.\nThose who gathered in Leicester Square were moved on by police shortly after half-time.\nThe Tartan Army were allocated only about 2,600 tickets for Wembley, due to Covid rules. The final score was 0-0.\nA fan zone in Trafalgar Square was reserved for 750 key workers.\nGroups of supporters wearing kilts, Scotland shirts and flags have been chanting, singing and playing bagpipes gathered at Leicester Square, King's Cross and Hyde Park.\nA large number of officers moved in on Scotland fans congregated in Leicester Square shortly before half time, after it is understood an opposing group tried to approach the visiting fans who remained at the central London location after kick off. \nOfficers moved in and placed a cordon around the group of Scots who were later moved out of the square. \nEarlier a dispersal order was issued for central London, giving the police extra powers to break up groups of people where they believe their behaviour is causing a nuisance, harassment or distress.\nThere have been no reports of any significant disorder - although there have been videos on social media that appeared to show some fans singing offensive anti-English songs.\nEstimates that 20,000 Scotland fans would travel south for the match have been been described as \"very conservative\" by a London Assembly member.\nAhead of the match, fans gathered in Leicester Square wearing kilts and Scotland shirts waved flags and set off blue smoke bombs while chanting, singing and playing the bagpipes.\nSome England fans were also seen in the square wearing team shirts and draped in England's flag.\nPeople were seen climbing into the fountain of William Shakespeare in the square and splashing around in the water. Others climbed on top of the statue and put a cone on its head.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged fans to \"be respectful to our hosts\" in London, and said they should not behave in a way that was going to make the Covid problem worse. \nShe also said she would \"abhor and condemn unreservedly\" any anti-English behaviour.\nAli Brawley, 55, from Galston in East Ayrshire, said he had arrived with a group of friends in London at midnight on Wednesday, and had spent the time since \"sightseeing\" around the city's pubs.\nMr Brawley and his friends will be watching the game from a pub which they booked, but he believes it would have been easier for fans - and the police - if there had been a dedicated fan zone for the Tartan Army.\nHe added: \"We had our first train cancelled, our hotel closed last week for refurbishment - we had to rebook the hotel. We just thought we weren't getting to get here. \n\"The organisation has been horrendous because of Covid, it's been tough to try and get somewhere to watch the football. \n\"I do believe they should have had big screens, herd us all together so we're all in the one place but now all the Scots are going to be everywhere.\"\nScotland fan Michael McLean, from Inverness, told BBC Scotland he had decided to travel after booking travel and accommodation several months ago.\n\"It's an amazing atmosphere so far. I think it seems that they've underestimated how many would travel down for the game,\" he said.\n\"It feels like a normal football occasion. It doesn't feel like there's a pandemic on, which I don't think is good in a way, but it's definitely good to enjoy an occasion after a year-and-a-half.\"\nMr McLean said the trains had been packed on the way down, with crowds of Scottish fans gathering and chanting outside King's Cross station on Thursday afternoon.\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime he had heard London Mayor Sadiq Khan's pleas for fans to stay away, but said much of the travel he had booked was non-refundable.\n\"\u00a3600 in total for all of us would be a lot to lose just to decide not to go down. Fair enough if it was refundable - but I don't want to lose the money.\"\nOne Scot who lives in London said it was \"inevitable\" that crowds of fans would travel south. \nGary, a 30-year-old consultant, said: \"It was inevitable, regardless of restrictions in place. You can't stop the masses coming down to celebrate a once in a generation event.\"\nOf the Scotland-England rivalry, he added that \"99%\" would be friendly. \"It'll be a laugh,\" he said. \nThe Met Police's football chief, Ch Insp Joseph Stokoe, said officers had been reminding fans that some Londoners are \"still living under the fear of the pandemic\". \nHe added: \"It's a shame, it feels like there aren't enough places for the fans to enjoy themselves, but that's why the message has always been - if you don't have a ticket, don't travel.\n\"Enjoy the match, enjoy the event locally, in a safer event. Don't come here, because unfortunately because of what's gone on across the world, we've been unable to provide the amount of fan zones you might expect in normal times.\"\nEmma Best, a member of the London Assembly and the Conservative group's spokeswoman on health, said she believed an estimate that 20,000 Scotland fans would travel might turn out to be a \"very conservative\" estimate.\nBut Ms Best added that the Tartan Army had been creating a \"really good-natured atmosphere\" throughout the city.\n\"The Boogie song is being played everywhere I've been walking. It's a lovely atmosphere and you could be forgiven for thinking we are not still in the midst of a pandemic, and I think that sums it up.\n\"What a shame that we can't have this match in normal times and really enjoy this occasion, but we are where we are and I do hope it's as safe as it can be.\"\nWembley is open at 25% capacity for the match, with supporters having to show either proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test before entry.\nPubs and bars in London were also expected to limit numbers allowed in.\nThe much-anticipated match, the 115th in international football's oldest rivalry, is the first time the two sides have met in a major tournament since Euro 96, when Paul Gascoigne's famous goal sealed a 2-0 win for England.\nScotland lost their first game of the tournament 2-0 against the Czech Republic on Monday, while England defeated Croatia 1-0 the previous day.\nWembley and Hampden are among 11 venues across Europe hosting the games in the tournament, which was delayed for a year because of the pandemic.\nScotland have never made it past the group stage before, but the top two - or possibly three - teams will go through to the knockout phase. \nAfter the match at Wembley, Croatia will visit Hampden on Tuesday for Scotland's second match on home soil.\nWhere are you watching the Euros this evening?

      "title": "Settled status: EU citizens urged to apply to stay in UK now or lose rights",
      "tags": "Kevin Foster,UK immigration,Immigration,Brexit",
      "text": "EU citizens living in the UK have until the end of Wednesday to apply to stay or lose their rights, under post-Brexit rules introduced by the government. \nMore than 5.6 million applications have been received, but around 400,000 cases are still waiting to be processed.\nMinisters say anyone who applies on time will have their existing rights protected while their case is heard. \nLabour says many vulnerable people risk losing access to public services and the deadline should be extended.\nUnder the terms of Britain's departure from the European Union, EU citizens and their families living and working in the UK no longer have an automatic right to do so as freedom of movement has come to an end. \nInstead, they have to apply for legal permission to remain under what is known as the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS).\nPeople from the European Economic Area (EEA) countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, as well as Switzerland are also affected. \nOnce granted status, applicants can continue to use the NHS, study and access public funds and benefits, as well as travel in and out of the country. \nKate (not her real name) was among the first EU citizens to apply for settled status after Brexit, but she did not, initially, realise she also had to register her two-year-old daughter.\nThe 34-year-old German citizen - who has been living and working in Sheffield for four-and-a-half years - realised her mistake when she saw one of the government's TV ads.\nBut she had to post her daughter's passport to the Home Office to verify her identity and it has been stuck in the system for weeks, meaning she will miss the deadline.\n\"Everyone knew this was coming - campaigners have been talking about this for weeks now,\" says Kate. \n\"They should extend the deadline. It's just difficult to understand why they are not doing that.\"\nShe adds: \"It is very worrying, what if they lose my daughter's passport? \n\"It doesn't make you feel very welcome.\"\nAccording to provisional Home Office figures to the end of May, 5,605,800 applications have been received since the scheme opened in March 2019 and 5,271,300 have been finalised.\nThe countries whose nationals have made the highest numbers of applications are Poland (975,000) and Romania (918,000).\nOf the concluded applications, more than 2.7 million were granted settled status, allowing them permanent leave to remain in the UK.\nA further 2.2 million were given pre-settled status, meaning they need to reapply after living in the country for five years to gain permanent residence.\nEU nationals living in the UK have until 30 June to apply to stay in the UK. \nThey can apply for:\nSome 94,000 applications have been refused, 72,100 were withdrawn or void and 74,900 were deemed invalid - where the Home Office decides someone is not eligible to apply or has failed to provide sufficient proof of residence.\nConcerns have been raised that thousands of people could fail to register and lose their rights as a result. \nMiklos Flora, who lives in Worcester but is originally from Hungary, told Radio 4's PM programme that he has struggled with his application. \nHe said he applied for himself with his Hungarian ID card but then realised his wife's card had expired and he could not proceed with their application as a result. \n\"With my kids, the problem is they don't have any kind of ID cards so I have been advised from the Citizen's Advice they are going to send me a form that is around 39 pages that we have to fill out and then send by post,\" he told PM. \nCome Thursday morning, most experts agree that it is highly likely there will be tens if not hundreds of thousands of EU citizens who have suddenly become illegal immigrants. \nSo, at its worst, the relatively straightforward scheme could become a second and larger Windrush scandal - despite it being designed to avoid a repeat of that injustice in which the Home Office failed to recognise the rights of people who had long been living legally in the country. \nSo who's not registered? Children could be a huge group because their parents may not realise they are not British. \nThere may be 130,000 in the benefits system too - and there is anecdotal evidence that even some of the well-heeled may be affected if they are unwittingly relying on an old form of permanent residence. \nThe impact of Brexit on all these people, and others more vulnerable, may only become clear when they go for a job or treatment on the NHS - and find they've got no right to be in the UK at all.\nLabour's Paul Blonfield, who raised the issue in the House of Commons earlier, said there are \"several potential problems\" not least a significant number of late applications, including from those who cannot get through on helplines.\nSpeaking to Radio 4, he said he has heard from people who have been holding for eight hours for advice and face losing their status and their rights. \nAnd he said there are particular concerns about children about  in care with applications not made for about 1200 young people. \n\"I pressed for the government to do what other European countries have done in relation to UK citizens and that's recognise that we are going through a global pandemic and extend the deadline so these issues can get sorted out,\" he said. \n\"We need to actively reach out\" to those people who have not applied he said \"because they are the hard to reach groups - those people with language difficulties, perhaps people in care, young people in social care,\" he added.\nImmigration minister Kevin Foster said \"the overwhelming majority\" of people have now applied and \"there are provisions for late applications where people have reasonable grounds for making one\".\n\"We will take a practical and compassionate approach to those who haven't applied particularly where there may be vulnerabilities or obvious reasonable grounds such as children whose parents may not have applied for them.\"\nHe said if people have any concerns about their status come the 1st of July \"the message is simple - don't delay, apply today\". \nThere is \"a range of grant funded support organisations that will help people apply and we have an assisted digital service that people can use if needed\" he added. \nAre you an EU citizen living in the UK who is yet to apply for settled status?

      "text": "The European Union (EU) has agreed to a three-month delay to a ban on some meat products from Great Britain being sold in Northern Ireland.\nThe proposed ban on items like fresh sausages was a consequence of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a Brexit deal between the UK and EU in 2019.\nThe EU and UK agreed to extend a so-called grace period - the time before the ban comes into effect.\nThe new arrangement means the meat ban will be postponed until 30 September. \nThe EU's chief Brexit negotiator, European Commission Vice-President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the EU was \"accommodating\" the UK's request to extend the grace period but was \"not issuing a blank cheque\".\n\"This solution is of a temporary nature, in which strong conditions are attached,\" he added.\n\"This extension will allow stakeholders, and especially supermarkets in Northern Ireland, to continue to adapt their supply chains to the post-Brexit situation - something yet to be completed. \n\"What is equally important, we hope that during these three months, the UK will engage constructively on the broader agreement in the areas of public, animal, and plant health based on alignment with EU rules.\"\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d  added that the EU Commission had put forward \"solutions in a number of other areas\" including the continued supply of medicines and for guide dogs, as well as a decision waiving the need for Northern Ireland motorists to show an insurance green card when driving in EU countries.\nHe said: \"These solutions help to ensure that the application of the protocol impacts as little as possible on the everyday life of communities in Northern Ireland. \n\"They highlight the EU's commitment to - and ability to deliver - solutions that work.\"\nThe EU said it had \"identified a solution to facilitate the movements of guide dogs\" accompanying those travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but details had to be worked out.\nCurrent rules mean assistance dogs are not exempt from paperwork and vaccines needed to bring pets from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\nThe broad agreement was welcomed by the UK's Brexit Minister, Lord Frost, who described it as a \"sensible extension\".\n\"This is a positive first step but we still need to agree a permanent solution - Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom and its consumers should be able to enjoy products they have bought from Great Britain for years,\" he said. \nThe deal was announced on the same day that a High Court judge in Belfast ruled that the Northern Ireland Protocol was lawful.\nThe protocol is the part of the Brexit deal that creates a trade border in the Irish Sea in order to prevent a hardening of the Irish land border.\nIt keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are enforced at its ports.\nIt was agreed by the UK and EU in October 2019 and was subject to further negotiation and agreement in 2020.\nLord Frost helped to negotiate the NI Protocol on behalf of the UK government but previously said it was not being implemented as he intended.\nIn a statement after Wednesday's deal, he said: \"This is a very clear sign that the protocol has to be operated in a pragmatic and proportionate way. \n\"The chilled meats issue is only one of a very large number of problems with the way the protocol is currently operating, and solutions need to be found with the EU to ensure it delivers on its original aims: to protect the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, safeguard Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom, and protect the EU's single market for goods.\"\nThe Labour Party's shadow minister for task force Europe, Baroness Chapman, welcomed the decision but urged Boris Johnson \"not to waste\" the extension.\nIrish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said the extension showed that the EU was delivering solutions to a range of issues raised by the protocol.\n\"I welcome that the EU has responded positively to the UK's request for an extension to the grace period on chilled meats,\" he said. \n\"This co-operative approach recognises that the protocol is jointly owned and must be jointly implemented. The only sustainable solutions are those agreed together. \n\"Today's announcement also ensures continued access to vital medicines in Northern Ireland as well as addressing issues relating to motor insurance green cards, guide dogs and the movement of certain animals.\"\nEarlier, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin said that EU-UK work on resolving differences over the Northern Ireland Protocol was of a \"stop-start nature\".\nSpeaking in the D\u00e1il (Irish Parliament) he said there was goodwill on the issue on the part of EU leaders but that the UK needed to engage.\nThe EU does not generally permit the import of chilled meat products like mince and sausages from non-member states.\nSince January, producers in Great Britain have not been able to sell these products in the EU single market.\nHowever, in December 2020, the EU agreed to a six-month grace period to allow supermarkets in Northern Ireland to re-orientate supply chains away from Great Britain.\nIt is this grace period relating to chilled meats which has now been extended.\nMeanwhile new poll from Queen's University Belfast suggests people in Northern Ireland are evenly split on the protocol.\nAlmost 70% of respondents agreed that Northern Ireland needs 'particular arrangements' for managing the impact of Brexit but they are divided on the protocol itself. \nWhen asked whether the protocol is appropriate for Northern Ireland, 47% agree that it is but 47% disagree. \nSimilarly, 43% think that the protocol is, on balance, good for Northern Ireland, whereas 48% think that it isn't. \nNevertheless, 56% agree that the protocol provides Northern Ireland with a unique set of post-Brexit economic opportunities.\nProfessor Katy Hayward, from Queen's University Belfast and a senior fellow of the UK in a Changing Europe, said: \"People in NI are highly exercised by the Protocol, both for and against - and in equal proportions. \n'The political tensions are compounded by the low levels of trust in the political parties when it comes to the protocol, and by the fact that the Protocol is likely to feature heavily in the next assembly election.\"\nThe online polling was carried out by LucidTalk, surveying a weighted sample of 1,500 adults. It has a margin of error of up to 3%."

      "tags": "Deafness and hearing-impairment,Depression,Disability,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Thousands of deaf and disabled people across the UK have told the BBC of the devastating impact the pandemic has had on their lives.\nMost said their disability had worsened and more than 2,400 said routine, often vital, medical appointments had been cancelled.\nMore than 3,300 people took part in the research carried out by the BBC.\nDisability charity Scope said the findings confirmed that disabled people's needs \"had been forgotten\".\nThe findings paint, for the first time, a comprehensive picture of a hidden fallout of Covid-19.\nNearly 100 more disabled people also contacted the BBC wanting to share their stories. Many of them had experienced huge physical and mental decline since March 2020. \nThere were young people with autism who had attempted suicide because they could no longer cope with drastic changes, others were isolated and alone, their support networks gone or hours of care cut.\nAccess to healthcare was a huge issue - one woman was told not to go to hospital if she contracted Covid as this might put her more at risk.\nA family told how care had been almost stopped for their disabled daughter, while her father, who had had Covid, was offered a range of treatments.\nFourteen-year-old Josselin has a rare genetic condition, which means she has hearing loss, a vision impairment, can't walk or talk and is fed through a tube.\nHer family, who live in Wiltshire, have a vital network of services they rely on to keep her well - physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, respite care. All of that stopped in March 2020.\n\"Josselin really struggled. She just shutdown,\" says her mother Karen Tilley. \"I never thought [she] would suffer from depression like that.\n\"After about a month she started pulling her hair out and picking at her skin, she had cuts all over her arms.\"\nJosselin was prescribed anti-depressants and anti-psychotic medication. She was also given prescription drugs like diazepam to cope with the pain she was having in her hips and her spine because of a lack of physiotherapy.\n \"Suddenly she was put on all these new medications. There was just no support for us at all - it was horrendous.\"\nAt the beginning of this year, Josselin's dad Lee, 43, caught Covid-19. He spent five weeks on a ventilator in intensive care.\nLee is back home making small and slow steps to, the family hope, a full recovery. But the difference between the support he is offered and the treatment his daughter receives is stark.\nHis calendar is full of medical appointments. He has an occupational therapist, a physiotherapist, and he has been sent equipment to help him regain his mobility.\nBut for Josselin, her cochlear implant, which needs retuning every few months, has not been checked for nearly two years. Her last eye test was over the phone, she's not had any face-to-face physiotherapy since March 2020, and her walking frame no longer fits.\n\"It feels like it's because she's disabled so it's not worth bothering with,\" says Karen. \"She's not ever going to walk and talk so they just don't bother with her.\"\nAll the people we have spent time with over the past few months have shared their own, heart-breaking stories. Considering everything they have had thrown at them this past year, they have managed to get through it the best they can, almost entirely on their own. \nBut what really hit me is that none of them kept a \"who had it worse during Covid\" scorecard. \nYes, they all pretty much described themselves in one way or another as \"the forgotten ones\", but they were all incredibly measured and understanding of the fact that the pandemic has touched us all in very different ways, disabled or not. \nFreelance journalist Raya Al Jadir, 43, uses a ventilator. She was told by her specialist doctors that if she caught Covid-19, she should not go to hospital because the level of care she would need could not be guaranteed.\nShe was also warned that it was unlikely that she would be considered for life support.\n\"It made me feel alone and isolated. If I did end up in hospital and I was really sick - who was going to fight for me?\"\nRaya was one of the hundreds of disabled people who told the BBC that they would avoid going to hospital during the pandemic.\nFrom March 2020 to May 2021, Raya did not leave her house for fear of catching Covid. \nShielding may have officially ended but there are still many disabled people living an isolated existence. Nearly 2,000 told the BBC that they had left their house on only a few occasions since the start of the pandemic, with almost 250 saying they had not ventured outside since March 2020.\nAt the end of May, Raya finally left her London flat.\n\"Breathing the air, seeing the clouds made me feel part of the world again.\n\"As a disabled person, I feel like the weakest link in society. And now, because of Covid-19, no-one knows what to do with the weakest link.\n\"I don't think my life will ever return to what it was before March 2020.\"\nOne of the biggest disability charities in the UK, Scope, has said the BBC's findings \"confirm the government's failure to provide support for disabled people throughout the pandemic.\"\n\"Millions spent months shielding, having to battle for basic support like healthcare, supermarket deliveries, financial support and social care,\" said James Taylor, executive director at disability equality charity Scope. \"Horrifying reports of DNRs [do-not-resuscitate orders] being placed on people without their consent left many fearing they'd not get treatment if they caught the virus. \nThe government \"must take bold action now to put disabled people at the heart of the recovery, and end the growing inequality\".\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said it recognised the pandemic has been \"incredibly difficult\" for disabled people.\n\"Among other support, we have invested \u00a32.4m to help charities offer vital projects to improve disabled people's physical and mental wellbeing.\n\"The government has provided a range of help for disabled people throughout this period and through our forthcoming National Disability Strategy we are going to go even further in addressing issues that disabled people say affect them the most.\"\nInformation and support: If you or someone you know needs support for issues about emotional distress, these organisations may be able to help."

      "tags": "Scarlett Johansson,Film",
      "text": "Black Widow, the latest Marvel superhero film and the first to focus on Scarlett Johansson's character, has received broadly positive reviews from critics ahead of its release next week.\nThe Hollywood Reporter said it was \"a stellar vehicle\" for the actress, while Empire said it was \"a lot of fun\".\nTotal Film agreed, calling the film a \"rousing addendum\" for the character.\nYet the way it treats issues like forced sterilisation and the sexual exploitation of women has been queried.\nThe film involves a secret Russian program that abducts, brainwashes and sterilises young women and turns them into lethal undercover operatives.\nThe Independent's Clarisse Loughrey said the movie, directed by Cate Shortland, was \"inescapably a story about the abuse and exploitation of young women\".\nThat element, she continued, leads to some \"tragically effective\" moments, thanks in part to the \"knockout performance\" given by Britain's Florence Pugh.\nThe Telegraph's Robbie Collin, however, said the film's \"coyness around its central premise\" was \"an exposing moment\" for the blockbuster franchise.\nHis review quoted a villainous character, played by Ray Winstone, who observes that girls \"are the only natural resource the world has too much of\".\n\"The film lacks either the nerve or the moral vocabulary to so much as spell out, let alone reckon with, the implications of his statement,\" Collin wrote.\n\"The film plainly wants the extra shot of gravitas that comes with serious, real-world resonance, but isn't prepared to do the legwork to earn it.\"\nDigital Spy's Gabriella Geisinger also took issue with the film's \"flippant\" handling of its characters' \"deeply dark and prescient\" histories.\nHer three-star review went on to suggest that \"topics so dark and disturbing\" were impossible to reconcile with \"the family-friendly mould Marvel uses\".\nEarlier this month, Johansson complained about the way her character had been \"hyper-sexualised\" when she first appeared in the franchise in 2010.\nBlack Widow sees Johansson's character, real name Natasha Romanoff, return to Eastern Europe to reunite with former spies she was raised to believe were her relatives.\nThey are played by David Harbour, the Stranger Things actor who recently married pop star Lily Allen, and British Oscar-winner Rachel Weisz.\nThe Guardian's Peter Bradshaw praised Harbour for his \"rumbustious and scene-stealer of a comic turn\" and suggested his character \"could well ascend to spinoff greatness of his own\".\nVariety's Owen Gleiberman also commended the US actor for giving \"a surprisingly convincing performance as this blustery Slavic blowhard\".\nBBC Culture's Caryn James awarded the film four stars out of five, saying it was \"entertaining and full of action\" that was \"exhilarating, sleek [and] well-paced\".\nYet Screen Daily's Tim Grierson said \"the size of the spectacle\" did not prevent the film from feeling \"minor by the standards of the franchise\".\nHe described it as \"a James Bond-style spy thriller\" that would \"tide audiences over until a bigger, richer adventure comes along\".\nThe film opens in UK cinemas on 7 July and will be available two days later to Disney+ customers who subscribe to its Premier Access service.\nBlack Widow was officially launched on Tuesday with screenings for fans in London, Melbourne, New York and Los Angeles.\nFlorence Pugh attended the London event, while David Harbour posed with cosplayers - fans dressed in costume - at the New York screening.\nThe film was due to have opened last year but was one of a number of major releases to be delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"I did not think our film was going to be a part of the first wave of films where people would go back to the cinema and watch it,\" Pugh told reporters.\n\"That being said, I'm so grateful that it is. I think that it's a really cool film to, if you can and you feel safe to, go back to the cinema to.\"\nHarbour said: \"It feels like we're starting to get back to normal again. For a while I thought it was completely dead and I was terrified. So I'm very happy to be back.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Mixed-sex couples in Scotland are now able to enter civil partnerships after campaigners called for a change in the law.\nPreviously, the law only allowed same-sex couples to be civil partners.\nThe change follows a ruling in the Supreme Court in 2018, which found that the existing UK law went against the European Convention on Human Rights on equality grounds.\nThe first civil partnership in England took place in December 2019.\nRebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, who won a legal battle for the right to heterosexual civil partnerships, celebrated at Kensington and Chelsea Register Office in west London.\nThe couple said their \"personal wish\" to form a civil partnership came from a \"desire to formalise our relationship in a more modern way, with a focus on equality, and mutual respect\".\nMs Steinfeld said it creates \"new, modern possibilities\" for thousands of people to express their love and commitment and ends \"the unrivalled position of marriage\".\nThe Civil Partnership Act 2004 came into force on 5 December 2005, allowing same-sex couples, who were not permitted by law to marry, to register a civil partnership. \nThe new law enabled same-sex couples to enjoy similar rights and responsibilities to those of a married couple. \nHowever, at the end of 2014, the law changed to allow same-sex couples to marry.\nThe number of civil partnerships dropped as a result of the change from 436 to about 70 for each year after 2014.\nThe law change created an anomaly which meant civil partnership and marriage were available to same-sex couples but only marriage was available to mixed-sex couples. \nThis was challenged in the Supreme Court.\nThe Scottish government launched a consultation to consider either barring further civil partnerships or opening them up to opposite-sex couples.\nMinisters decided to make the partnerships available to everyone. \nFrom 1 June, it has been possible for mixed sex couples to submit a notice of intention to enter into a civil partnership. \nThis meant, taking into account the 29-day notice period, that the first mixed-sex civil partnerships could take place from 30 June.\nEqualities Minister Christina McKelvie said the change \"embedded equality of choice\" to allow couples to \"formalise their relationship in the way that best reflects their beliefs and ensures access to the rights, responsibilities and benefits which flow from entering a legally recognised relationship\".  \nShe added: \"This ground-breaking change in law demonstrates our commitment to creating a fairer and more inclusive society for all.\n\"I wish good luck to all couples who are entering Scotland's first mixed-sex civil partnerships.\""

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nA higher death rate in Greater Manchester and a decline in life expectancy across the north-west of England as a result of Covid have emerged in new research. The study found Greater Manchester's Covid-19 death rate was 25% higher than that of England as a whole in the 13 months to March 2021 and life expectancy in the region fell by 1.6 years for men and 1.2 years for women in 2020. The average fall in England was by 1.3 years and 0.9 years respectively. In the report, Sir Michael Marmot makes a series of recommendations about health, housing, transport, community development, jobs and schools. \"It cuts across the board,\" he says. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham welcomes the findings.\nThe green list of countries has been expanded and now there is no need to self-isolate when returning to the UK from Malta, Madeira, and the Balearic Islands as well as number of UK overseas territories, including Antigua, Barbados and Grenada. But the additions, apart from Malta, will be on the \"green watchlist\", which means if things change then they risk being moved to the amber or red lists.\nThousands of deaf and disabled people across the UK have told the BBC of the devastating impact the pandemic has had on their lives. Most said their disability had worsened and more than 2,400 said routine, often vital, medical appointments had been cancelled. Disability charity Scope said the findings confirmed disabled people's needs \"had been forgotten\".

But months later she was still experiencing repeated flare-ups including skin rashes, nerve pain, chest cramps and severe fatigue.\nAs England's footballers concentrate on preparing for the quarter-finals of the Euro 2020 tournament, so will fans. The team, who beat the German side for the first time in the knock-out stage of a major competition since the 1966 World Cup final, will be travelling to Rome for their next fixture against Ukraine on Saturday. But there's little chance for fans hoping to travel to the Italian capital for the match. Italy is on the UK's amber list, and also has its own quarantine rules in place so for most UK travellers the best-case scenario would mean arriving there only to be stuck watching the match in a hotel room.

The rules came into effect at midnight.\nThe new quarantine measures apply only to those travelling to mainland Portugal, not Madeira.\nThere were 19 flights listed as departing on Monday from UK airports to Portugal's mainland airports - Lisbon, Faro and Porto.\nBrazil, South Africa, India and Nepal were already on Portugal's quarantine list, but the exception for people who are vaccinated against Covid-19 to avoid isolating applies just to the UK.\nFrustrated would-be holidaymaker Sarah Cluskey is one of many people who have been caught out by the ever-changing travel rules.\n\"Portugal is one of our favourite holiday destinations and when it went on the green list, we decided to book,\" she told the BBC.\nSarah's husband runs a construction company and has had to work in very difficult circumstances throughout the year, she says. \nHe has been travelling into London the whole time, apart from the first three weeks of lockdown.\nAfter a stressful year, she, her husband and their two teenage daughters had been looking forward to a break in the sun.\n\"Myself and my husband have been double vaccinated, so we can still go. However, we have an 18-year-old daughter who has just received her first vaccination and a 13-year-old daughter who hasn't been vaccinated. \n\"This leaves us in a position where we can go away, but not as a family, and there will be many other people in the same situation, which is very unfair to families. \n\"This means that we have no choice now but to cancel our holiday.\"\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Monday the measures in Spain for UK travellers would come into effect in 72 hours and included the Balearic Islands as well.\nPortugal and mainland Spain are currently on the UK's amber list, meaning those arriving back in the UK must take two tests and quarantine for 10 days.\nThe Balearic Islands are on the UK's green list, so holidaymakers do not have to quarantine on their return.\nMalta has said only \"fully-vaccinated travellers\" will be allowed to enter the country from the UK, but children under 12 will be permitted if they are accompanied by parents or guardians who have had both doses.\nThe Maltese government has said those aged between five and 11 must also show evidence of a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours before arrival.\nThe UK government says travellers can use an NHS Covid Pass to prove their vaccination status.\nThe pass is available in digital or paper format and people can access their own pass two weeks after having a second dose of the vaccine.\nYou are eligible to get a pass if: \nThe tougher restrictions across Europe come after Germany urged the EU to restrict UK travellers.\nThe Times reported German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to designate the UK as a \"country of concern\" because the Delta variant of the coronavirus is so widespread.\nThe plans will be discussed by senior European and national officials on the EU's integrated political crisis response committee.\nThe destinations added to the green list from 04:00 BST on 30 June are:\nSix destinations will also be added to the government's red list on 30 June - the Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Haiti, Mongolia, Tunisia and Uganda.\nMrs Merkel previously told Germany's parliament: \"In our country, if you come from Great Britain, you have to go into quarantine - and that's not the case in every European country, and that's what I would like to see.\"\nShe is set to meet Prime Minister Boris Johnson at Chequers on Friday.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has also talked about his concern at the spread of the variant.\nCurrently, fully vaccinated UK visitors to France can enter without quarantining.\nTravelling abroad isn't just about what is on the UK's green list: other countries also have to let UK travellers in. \nIn the last few days, more countries have tightened up their restrictions on arrivals from the UK, but each has decided its own approach on a sliding scale of severity. \nSome, like Spain, have added the need for a Covid test, while others like Malta require 12-year-olds and over to quarantine if not fully vaccinated. Each country is likely to continue deciding its own individual travel policy, but if many follow Malta's example, this could majorly disrupt family holidays. \nMany countries that rely on UK tourists will be loath to increase restrictions that will stop them from travelling and policies could change during the summer as countries vaccinate more of their citizens. \nBut these changes do show that international travel is still on shaky ground. \nWith Covid still widespread in many countries, tourists will have to think carefully about their spending on holidays.\nThere is always a risk that a green-list country may move to the amber or red list. If this happens, you will need to quarantine after your holiday - something that could be difficult for many people.\nOperators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate on your return.\nIf the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised, then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there.\nIn this case, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash.\nRead more about your refund rights on holidays\nAre you planning a holiday this summer?

      "tags": "NI Brexit,Brexit",
      "text": "The Northern Ireland Protocol is lawful, a High Court judge in Belfast has ruled.\nA group of unionist politicians, including Arlene Foster and Lord Trimble, had challenged the protocol in judicial review proceedings.\nThey claimed it was unlawful because it conflicts with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and the Acts of Union.\nBut Mr Justice Colton rejected their challenge on all grounds on Wednesday afternoon.\nMr Colton found that the Withdrawal Agreement Act, which includes the protocol, does conflict with the 1800 Acts of Union in respect of free trade between Britain and Northern Ireland.\nHowever, he added that the relevant parts of the Acts of Union are \"impliedly repealed\" by the Withdrawal Agreement Act.\nThat means that the more recent legislation automatically overrides the older laws.\nHe said the Acts of Union could not be used to override the \"clear specific will of Parliament\".\nNormally, a constitutional law, like the Acts of Union, can only be expressly repealed, but they can be impliedly by another constitutional law.\nThe judge said the Withdrawal Agreement Act meets the definition of a constitutional law.\nHe also rejected the argument that the protocol had changed the constitutional status as defined in the Good Friday Agreement.\nFurthermore, he found that the secretary of state did have the power to change Stormont's usual cross-community voting mechanism.\nNormally, Stormont must approve controversial issues by a cross-community vote but the protocol will be subject to a straight-majority vote.\nThe judge said the secretary of state had the power to do this on two grounds: that it was necessary to reflect the will of Parliament in implementing the Withdrawal Agreement Act and that it concerns international relations which is not a devolved matter.\nFurther areas of challenge concerning EU law were also rejected.\nThe judge was also critical of an analogy used by the applicants' barrister when he compared the operation of the protocol to the Vichy regime.\nVichy was the collaborationist French administration during the Nazi occupation.\nThe judge said such a comparison was \"unhelpful\".\nAn adjoining case, taken by Belfast pastor Clifford Peeples, was also dismissed by the judge.\nOthers pursuing the lead judicial review case included former Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken, TUV leader Jim Allister, former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib and Baroness Hoey. \nWednesday's judgement is likely to be appealed and the case could ultimately be heard by the Supreme Court before the end of 2021.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the government would \"study in detail\" the High Court ruling, after being asked about it during Prime Minister's Questions. \nDUP MP Ian Paisley asked if the government would \"reverse the mistakes of the Northern Ireland Protocol, seize the moment, defend the union to unilaterally fix and put Northern Ireland out of its commercial, social and economic misery\".\nMr Johnson said: \"Nothing will affect the position of Northern Ireland as part of the UK - we will make sure we uphold that.\"\nAlliance MP Stephen Farry also urged the prime minister to accept the ruling as a \"watershed where we can stop talking about the protocol in constitutional and identity terms\".\nThe prime minister replied that the \"best thing\" the EU could do was remove all the problems associated with the protocol's application.\n\"I hope all that can be fixed indeed and then we can move on,\" he added. \nDUP leader designate Sir Jeffrey Donaldson described the ruling as \"politically significant\" and would have potential consequences for \"the future stability of political institutions\".\nIn a tweet, he said the judgement confirmed the \"protocol damages our constitutional position in the UK contrary to the principle of consent and various agreements\".\nUlster Unionist MLA Steve Aiken said his party acknowledged the decision, but said it is \"an issue of such magnitude that it needs to be appealed to a higher court\".\nSpeaking at a press conference in Belfast following the judgement, Mr Habib said: \"The only positive you might put on it is we do now officially know that the union of the United Kingdom has been trampled on by the protocol.\"\nMr Habib said the prime minister now \"has to face up to the reality that his own judicial system has said that the union of the United Kingdom has been broken\".\nFormer Labour MP Kate Hoey - now Baroness Hoey - said it must be \"absolutely clear that this is only the beginning of the legal challenge and also of peoples' protests against what has been done to us without consent\".\nTUV leader Jim Allister said the court ruling \"confirmed the protocol is dismantling the union\".\nMr Allister said the ruling \"underscores the necessity to step up the political battle against the protocol\".\nHe said the UK government must \"now reverse the mistake of repeal, if the PM's words mean anything\".\n\"No more propping up the Belfast Agreement institutions while the protocol manoeuvres us out of the union,\" he added.\nSinn F\u00e9in MLA Declan Kearney said \"there is no credible alternative to the protocol\". \n\"It's ironic that the Tory/DUP cheerleaders of Brexit are now so opposed to the protocol that was made necessary by their reckless pursuit of a hard Brexit,\" he said."

      "tags": "EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,UK economy,Brexit",
      "text": "New legislation set to replace EU rules will grant the government and councils greater freedom to support businesses, the business secretary has said. \nThe Subsidy Control Bill will replace EU-wide state aid rules, which require member states to seek approval for government assistance to firms.  \nMinisters said the rules will allow the government to help companies with grants or loans faster.\nIt has been dubbed \"the most important bit of post-Brexit legislation yet\". \nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government was using its \"newfound freedoms\" following Brexit to \"empower public authorities across the UK to deliver financial support - without facing burdensome red tape\".\n\"We're seizing the opportunities of being an independent trading nation to back new and emerging British industries, create more jobs and make the UK the best possible place to start and grow a business,\" he added.\nThe government has said the new bill would allow it to be more agile, targeted and timely in its interventions with businesses.\nThe government said the announcement would not \"signal a return to the failed 1970s approach of government picking winners or bailing out unsustainable companies\".  \nThe UK has historically extended far less government support to private business than its EU counterparts in France and Germany and officials have historically said they do not expect the overall level of state aid to increase significantly.  \nThe government said it will judge cases for support on whether they deliver good value for money and help hit targets such as \"levelling up\" and decarbonising the economy.  \nThere will also be safeguards to ensure that devolved government departments and local authorities do not engage in bidding wars of support that could cause a relocation of businesses and jobs from one part of the UK to another. \nMatthew Fell, chief UK policy director for the Confederation of British Industry, said a new \"swift\" system could be a \"useful tool to meet the government's ambitions for the economy\". \nHe said EU state aid rules were \"too often proved prohibitive and bureaucratic\".\n\"Government support is a last resort for businesses, but at the right time and place, it can make an invaluable contribution to key players and industries,\" he added.\n\"Smart decision-making that ensures value to the public purse, respects the level playing field agreement with the EU and supports economic growth in all parts of the UK, can only be a good thing.\"\nHowever, the wording of the bill is set to be closely studied by the European Commission, which has expressed concerns the UK may distort competition by failing to ensure UK and EU firms operate on a so-called \"level playing field\".  Competition lawyers have also warned the new rules may prove controversial. \nMartin McElwee, a competition lawyer at Freshfields, said the government's new legislation offered \"more flexibility\", but \"less certainty\". He said businesses and lenders wouldn't find that loss of certainty easy.\n\"The EU subsidy regime was very complex, but we could help businesses, charities and public service providers understand what side of the line they fell on,\" he added.\n\"If you are a bank thinking about whether to lend to a business that's received support from the government, isn't certainty what you need?\"\nA new unit to issue advice on operating the new regime will be set up within the existing Competition and Markets Authority - but the CMA will have no powers to prohibit the granting of support. \nThe UK will still be subject to World Trade Organisation rules and any decisions made can be contested in law courts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic,Australia",
      "text": "Seven Australian cities are now in lockdown as authorities scramble to prevent the spread of the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant. \nOfficials reported a slight case rise on Wednesday, to more than 200 cases.\nNearly half the population - more than 12 million people - are under stay-at-home orders in Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, Darwin, Townsville and the Gold Coast.\nOn Wednesday, the outback town of Alice Springs also entered a snap lockdown after cases emerged in South Australia.\nAuthorities fear the virus could now spread to nearby Aboriginal communities which are already vulnerable. \nAcross the country on Wednesday, state leaders said they were facing a \"pressure cooker situation\" as new cases emerged. \nMany leaders have urged faster vaccinations as just 5% of the population is fully vaccinated. \nBut messaging around the country's main vaccine, the AstraZeneca jab, has been contradictory. \nIf you woke up in Australia today, you'd be forgiven for being confused about vaccinations. There's been the slow rollout, the lack of supply, and vaccine hesitancy. Now, add mixed messaging from the leadership to this list and you've got a perfect storm.\nIn a big U-turn on Monday Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that anyone under 40 who wants the AstraZeneca vaccine could have it after talking to their GP. \nThat message was quickly rejected by the Australian Medical Association's president, who said it took him by surprise and went against expert advice. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) recommends AstraZeneca for over 60s. \nState premiers then also accused the PM of wrong guidance, while criticising the shortage of the Pfizer alternative.\nDelta has breached Australia's defences faster than anticipated. It's underlined how slow and at times shambolic the vaccine rollout has been. \nAustralia remains in an enviable position globally, with an overall low number of Covid-19 cases and deaths. \nBut the next few weeks will be crucial - with the country's Covid success now hanging in the balance.\nThe Delta variant has been found in five of eight states and territories, just a fortnight after it emerged in Sydney.\nAustralia had prevented wider Covid transmission for the past year through stringent measures. These included closed borders, hotel quarantine and aggressive contact tracing systems.\nBut leaks from quarantine have highlighted gaps in the country's defences. \nIt has also exposed the vulnerability of a largely unvaccinated population. Mr Morrison has been widely criticised for the vaccine rollout's failures.\nOn Wednesday, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk also called for a crackdown on international arrivals.\nShe said the state's concerning new Delta cases had come from a business traveller from Indonesia who had infected a hospital receptionist.  Three cities in the state - Brisbane, Townsville and the Gold Coast - entered a three-day lockdown on Tuesday.\n\"The person who brought the virus into Queensland was a regular traveller, not a vulnerable Australian returning home... I honestly think we need a serious discussion about ensuring that people are vaccinated coming into this country,\" said Ms Palaszczuk.\n\"We have got to minimise the risk. We are at a pressure cooker moment at the moment. Right across Australia.\"\nWestern Australia and Victoria have also called for a reassessment of arrivals allowed into the country.\nNew South Wales recorded 22 new cases on Wednesday, taking its cluster to about 170 cases. Its capital, Sydney, and surrounding regions remain in lockdown until 9 July."

      "tags": "Bill Cosby sexual assault case",
      "text": "Bill Cosby was once known to millions as \"America's Dad\", but the comedian had his reputation shattered when he was sentenced to three to 10 years in jail after being convicted of sexual assault.\nThat judgement has now been overturned, and the 83-year-old has walked free from prison after serving two years of the sentence.\nHis role as the benevolent, jumper-wearing Dr Cliff Huxtable in 1980s hit sitcom The Cosby Show made him a national treasure in the US.\nBut more than a dozen women accused Mr Cosby of misconduct, and one case made it to court.\nAlthough a jury failed to reach a verdict in June 2017, a retrial originally led to a conviction less than a year later. But in June 2021, Pennsylvania's highest court ruled he had been denied a fair trial, quashing the guilty verdict.\nHow did this man, a household name for so long in America, rise and fall so far?\nBorn in 1937 in a social housing complex in Philadelphia, the young William Henry Cosby Jr shone shoes and worked at a local supermarket to help his family make ends meet. \nHis early life was touched by tragedy when one of his four brothers died and he, the oldest, became a father figure.\nAccounts of his school years portray a joker and a storyteller who loved to entertain classmates. After school he joined the US Navy, then went to university and worked part-time as a bartender.\nFilling in for a club comedian, he laid the path for his future fame. \nHis debut on NBC's Tonight Show in 1963 led to a recording contract with Warner Brothers, and the release of a series of award-winning comedy albums.\nOn one of those, 1968's To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With, he established the themes that would define his work - the father as a loving disciplinarian; siblings who could plot together one minute, then scream blue murder the next; and a confidence in the bonds of family.\nThe album sleeve noted: \"During his time on stage, Cosby never once told a joke. He didn't sing or dance or do tricks. All he did was talk\" - but the performer had the 10,000-strong audience in the palm of his hand throughout.\nBy the time the album was released, Mr Cosby was already a TV star.\nIn 1965, he had become the first black actor to star in a drama series, when he was cast in the espionage show I Spy.\nHe played Alexander Scott, an undercover agent posing as a tennis instructor, alongside Robert Culp, who played fellow agent Kelly Robinson. \nPremiering during a time of great upheaval for race relations in the US, it was banned by some stations in the southern states. But Cosby went on to earn three consecutive best actor Emmys for his role - a record that still stands.\nDespite his prominence on TV, Mr Cosby made a conscious decision not to directly address race relations in his act - preferring a more subtle challenge to the status quo. \n\"A white person listens to my act, and he laughs, and he thinks: 'Yeah, that's the way I see it, too,'\" he once said. \n\"OK. He's white. I'm Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that we are alike. Right? \"So I figure this way, I'm doing as much for good race relations as the next guy.\"\nThe Cosby Show, which was launched by NBC in 1984 and aired for eight seasons, was his biggest success and established him as a household name.\nBased on his stand-up routines, Mr Cosby's portrayal of an educated, affluent doctor - Heathcliff \"Cliff\" Huxtable - and the trials of raising five young children drew parallels with his own life.\nHis TV wife, Claire, was loosely based on his own wife Camille, whom he married in 1964.\nThe sitcom was watched by about 30 million viewers each week. By 1989, its star was earning $4m (\u00a32.5m) a month in syndication rights alone.\nWhen the show was cancelled in 1992, Mr Cosby embarked on a number of projects including film roles, but was never able to emulate the success of his star vehicle.\nIn 2013, he received rave reviews for his first TV stand-up show in 30 years, which led to a national tour.\nBut his comeback fell apart as several women came forward with allegations of sexual assault going back almost 30 years.\nThe accusations first surfaced in 2005, when Andrea Constand, a staff member at Cosby's former university, said she had been drugged and molested by the star at his home a year earlier.\nProsecutors declined to press charges, citing lack of evidence, but Ms Constand filed a civil case against the comedian. \nThirteen women, 12 of whom remained anonymous, agreed to be witnesses, each with a similar account of sexual assault.\nMr Cosby denied the accusations, which his lawyer called \"preposterous\", and the case was settled out of court in 2006 for an undisclosed sum.\nIn subsequent years, some of Ms Constand's fellow witnesses told their stories to the media. But the accusations were not comprehensively reported until Mr Cosby's planned TV comeback thrust him back into the limelight.\nMore than 50 women accused the star of sexual assault or rape, but due to time limits on cases, only one - Andrea Constand - took the case to criminal court. \nMr Cosby's lawyers consistently denied the charges, asking why the women had not made legal complaints at the time when they said they were assaulted. \nIn 2014 Mr Cosby said he had not addressed the allegations in public because \"a guy doesn't have to answer to innuendos\".\nBut shortly afterwards, previously unseen court papers from 2005 came to light and showed he had admitted obtaining sedatives to give to young women he wanted to have sex with. The sedatives, called Quaaludes, render people unable to move.\nThe accusations disrupted his hopes of a return to show business. Cable station TV Land pulled repeats of The Cosby Show, some of his stand-up shows were called off and protesters showed up to the ones that he still put on.\nHis statue was removed from the MGM Hollywood Studios park in Florida, and several colleges removed honorary degrees they had given him.\nHis portraits were taken down from the walls in his alma mater, Temple University in Philadelphia, and he resigned from the board of trustees.\nAt first, it appeared unlikely that any criminal action would be taken against Mr Cosby, partly because most US states have of statutes of limitation in cases of rape and sexual assault.\nHowever, one case came to criminal trial - that of Andrea Constand.\nThe case was seen as one of the biggest US celebrity court case since the murder trial of former American football player OJ Simpson in 1995.\nIn June 2017, Ms Constand told her story in court for the first time, having previously been barred from doing so due to the 2006 settlement.\nShe said Mr Cosby had given her pills that he claimed were herbal and said would \"take the edge off\", but which left her virtually paralysed.\n\"In my head, I was trying to get my hands to move or my legs to move, but I was frozen\", she said. About 20 minutes later, she said, he put his hand on her genitals.\n\"I wasn't able to fight it in any way,\" she told the court. \"I wanted it to stop.\"\nMr Cosby continued to deny the allegations. He did not give evidence in court but had one witness. In the end, with Mr Cosby possibly facing the rest of his life in prison if found guilty, the jury was deadlocked, and a mistrial was declared in June 2017.\nThe retrial, which began on 9 April 2018, took place in a changed atmosphere. \nA flood of sexual misconduct accusations against powerful men in the entertainment industry such as Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey had triggered the #MeToo movement.\nThe trial in Pennsylvania became one of the first celebrity cases of the #MeToo era. The decision by the judge to allow five more women to testify against him was seen as a key development.\nOn this occasion, the jury took two days to find the comedian guilty on all three counts of sexual assault. Months later, he was sentenced to a total of three to 10 years in prison.\nAfter serving two years of the jail sentence, in June Pennsylvania's highest court overturned his conviction for sexual assault. Hours later, Mr Cosby was driven away from the prison.\nThe court found that Mr Cosby had been denied due process and should not have been put on trial because he had reached an agreement with the previous prosecutor in 2005 that he would not be charged.\n\"He must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be barred\", it wrote in a 79-page ruling.\nBut despite the outcome, some legal analysts said Mr Cosby would not be able to go back to the life he knew before. His reputation would be \"forever tarnished\", said defence lawyer Rikki Klieman of CBS News.\n\"He does not go back to being America's Dad, everything that he lost in terms of the trappings of his life - his reputation, his TV jobs, his night club jobs, his being a spokesperson - all of that is gone.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

While some firing had taken place, he said it was well out of range.\nReiterating the navy's explanation, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said on Wednesday that the destroyer \"was conducting innocent passage through Ukrainian territorial waters in accordance with international law\". \nA separate encounter in the Black Sea has since been reported the following day by the Dutch navy, which has accused Russian fighter jets of repeatedly harassing its ship, HNLMS Evertsen.\nAfter last week's incident involving HMS Defender, the British ambassador was summoned by the Russian foreign ministry, which protested against what it said was a violation of its territory. Crimea was seized by Russia in 2014 but most of the international community considers it to be part of Ukraine.\nClassified UK documents assessing Russia's likely response have since been found dumped near a bus stop in Kent, in south-east England.\nAsked during his annual TV phone-in with Russian citizens whether the incident risked provoking World War Three, the Russian president said even if HMS Defender had been sunk that would not have happened. \n\"They know they cannot win this conflict: we would be fighting for our own territory; we didn't travel thousands of miles to get to their borders, they did,\" he said.\nHowever, he did accuse the UK and the US of mounting a co-ordinated, provocative operation to assess Russia's response.\nMr Putin pointed out he had personally ordered troops to pull back from Ukraine's borders two months ago, as international concern intensified over what Russia insisted was nothing more than military exercises.\nNow he said that British and US forces were trying to open up military bases, \"making Ukrainian territory close or on the border with Russia a military platform that is a threat to Russian security\". He also linked it to his summit with President Joe Biden in Geneva the week before.\nHe suggested that a US reconnaissance plane had taken off from a Nato airfield in Greece, possibly from Crete.\nHowever, he did not mention Dutch naval accusations that Russian warplanes armed with missiles had flown dangerously low, staging \"mock attacks\" on the frigate HNLMS Evertsen south-east of Crimea.\nDutch Defence Minister Ank Bijleveld insisted the ship had every right to sail there and there was no justification for \"this kind of aggressive action that unnecessarily heightens the risk of accidents\".\nThe Russian defence ministry has since said that Su-30 fighters and Su-24 bombers were scrambled and carried out flights \"at a safe distance\" from the ship.\nPresident Putin has made clear he blames Nato and its expansion for the conflict in eastern Ukraine which erupted in 2014. Russian-backed separatists took control of large areas of the east after Moscow seized Crimea. \nBut Mr Putin wrote in an article published last week that the US had organised a coup in Ukraine and Europe had actively supported it."

      "text": "With the vaccination programme racing against the spread of new variants, rules around international travel are rapidly changing.\nAlthough different countries have their own entry rules, a digital \"passport\" which provides evidence of a person's vaccination status has been rolled out across Europe.\nSimilar apps have been rolled out in the UK and while Scots have had to request theirs by post, Nicola Sturgeon has announced a QR system will be launched on Friday.\nPeople in Scotland have been able to access their certificate since 19 May - which shows both the dates of Covid vaccination and the type of drug administered.\nThe Scottish government said the service was intended to allow people access to a certificate without asking their GP, thereby \"easing the burden\" on the NHS.\nWhile no countries required vaccination status to travel when the service launched, some countries now do - and destinations have different entry rules which can change at short notice.\nThe government has information which you can check before travelling.\nMore than 30 countries, including Greece and Spain, now accept the pass.\nOriginally people could download the document online, but on 22 May the site suffered a security glitch which enabled people to alter details on the document using popular software programmes.\nBBC Scotland was able to download a certificate and edit it to include a false name and the address of the BBC's Glasgow headquarters.\nA fix was implemented on 25 May, which meant people in Scotland could only request the document be sent to them by post.\nPeople can view their vaccine status through the NHS Inform patient portal. Users have to log in using a unique username printed on their Covid vaccination appointment letter.\nThose who are not online can request the certificate to be posted by phoning a freephone Covid status helpline on 0808 196 8565.\nScotland's reliance on a paper system was previously criticised by travel agents, who said travellers were being \"blindsided\". \nConcerns emerged that the paper system was causing airport queues and more interactions with staff and passengers.\nBy the end of July, the Scottish government had awarded a Danish firm a \u00a3600,000 contract to develop a vaccine passport similar to those already in use elsewhere in the UK and Europe.\nOn Tuesday during a Covid update to Parliament, Ms Sturgeon confirmed people could download their certificate in the form of a QR code from Friday.\nPaper copies will continue but will include a QR code on them.\nFurthermore, vaccine passports are to be required for entry to nightclubs and many large events in Scotland from later this month.\nMs Sturgeon said the hospitality industry as a whole would not be included in the certification scheme - although that decision would be kept under review.\nAnd there are no plans to include key services or settings where people have no choice over attendance - such as shops, public transport, education and medical services.\nAn EU vaccine \"passport\" has been introduced across all 27 member nations - plus Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.\nBecause the UK is no longer in the EU, the certificate is not available to most Britons, which has led to a number of problems.\nThe European system often requires people to present a QR code, however people in Scotland have been denied entry to certain places when they presented their paper certificate.\nFrance insists UK visitors are fully vaccinated before entry for non-essential travel. The country has also tightened its rules for any UK travellers who are not fully vaccinated, requiring them to have a negative test in the 24 hours before arrival, rather than the 48 hours allowed previously.\nThe country has also rolled out a new health pass which means people need proof of vaccination to enter places such as museums and cinemas.\nMeanwhile Norway initially only accepted Norwegian, Danish, Swedish or EU digital Covid certificates as proof of vaccination or previous illness.\nFrom 12 August it began to accept certificates from England and Wales as it was able to verify QR codes at the border.\nAgain this has caused problems for people in Scotland - including one man whose yacht has been stranded in Norway since last August.\nPeople in England can use the NHS app to either download their certificate or have it emailed to them. \nSimilar systems are in place in Wales and Northern Ireland, and while the NI system went offline following a data breach in early August, it is now up and running again.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has announced plans \"to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather\" by the end of September.\nUnder these new measures, people would show proof of vaccination by using the NHS Covid Pass app in England."

      "text": "The NHS has been given the green light to start planning a Covid vaccine booster programme in the UK ahead of this winter.\nA bigger flu season than normal is expected, meaning extra protection against Covid is likely to be needed.\nMore than 30 million of the most vulnerable should receive a third dose, vaccine experts are advising.\nThey will include all adults aged 50 and over, and anyone over 16 who qualifies for a flu jab.\nHealth service bosses had previously said they needed lots of warning of an autumn Covid-19 booster rollout in order to plan the logistics alongside vaccinating millions of people against flu.\nInterim advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is that boosters will help maintain protection against Covid-19 and new variants for those most at risk, before winter comes.\nThe vaccines are thought to protect most people against serious illness for at least six months, but a lack of data on exactly how long immunity lasts is prompting a safety-first approach.\nNo decisions have yet been made on which vaccines will be used.\nProf Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, said: \"We want to be on the front foot for Covid-19 booster vaccination to keep the probability of loss of vaccine protection, due to waning immunity or variants, as low as possible - especially over the coming autumn and winter.\"\nHe said other respiratory viruses, particularly flu, \"will make a comeback\" and be an additional problem this winter.\n\"We will need to ensure protection against flu, as well as maintaining protection against Covid-19,\" Prof Van-Tam said.\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said ministers were working with the NHS to rapidly deliver the programme from September.\n\"Our first Covid-19 vaccination programme is restoring freedom in this country, and our booster programme will protect this freedom,\" he said.\nScotland's health secretary Humza Yousaf said the government had been working closely with NHS boards to plan for the booster campaign, while the current vaccination programme \"continues at pace and remains on schedule\".\nWales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan said she was working with Welsh health boards to ensure they can deliver a booster programme \"from the start of September\".\n\"In line with the other nations of the UK, the Welsh government welcomes the JCVI advice,\" she said. \"It very much aligns with our thinking and our planning assumptions to date.\"\nThe JCVI's final advice will be published before September, when better data will be available on how long protection from the first two doses of the vaccines lasts. The latest figures on hospitalisations, emerging variants and trials will also be taken into account at that point, and could change their advice.\nIn the meantime, the JCVI's advice is to offer a third Covid jab (and a flu jab) to the following people from September 2021:\nAfter those groups, it will be:\nProf Wei Shen Lim, Covid-19 chair for JCVI, said all these groups would also be eligible for the annual flu vaccine and were strongly advised to have it.\nYounger adults will be not be given a third dose, because they will only have had their second dose in the summer, although this decision will be revisited at a later time, the JCVI said."

      "text": "Education Secretary Gavin Williamson says he wants the school \"bubble\" system in England removed as soon as possible, as rising numbers of pupils are being sent home to isolate.\nThis could happen alongside the next step of the roadmap for unlocking the country from the pandemic, he told MPs.\nBut Labour warned that schools needed immediate action to avoid \"chaos\" in the last weeks of term.\nOfficial figures this week showed over 375,000 children have been sent home.\nA Downing Street spokesman declined to say whether bubbles would be scrapped, either in September or as part of changes to restrictions potentially from 19 July.\nHead teachers' leader Paul Whiteman said schools needed to be told how \"alternative arrangements would work\". \nOn Wednesday the UK reported another 26,068 Covid-19 cases - the highest daily figure since January 29.\nAnother 14 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also reported.\nResponding to an urgent question from Labour, Mr Williamson said he recognised the \"frustration of parents and pupils who may feel like they're being asked to isolate unnecessarily\".\nThe numbers sent home from school for Covid-related reasons have quadrupled this month - but among those having to isolate only about 4% are confirmed cases, with most sent home because of a potential contact at school.\n\"I want to see these restrictions, including bubbles, removed as quickly as possible,\" said the education secretary, facing warnings from MPs about an escalating problem with pupils being sent home.\nThis would be part of the \"next step\" in the process of unlocking from the pandemic, he told MPs, which under current plans could be 19 July, close to the end of the summer term.\nMr Williamson said he was working with the health secretary on changing the response to Covid in schools.\nThis could include more testing - and a pilot scheme has been using daily testing in response to Covid cases, rather than a wider group of pupils having to isolate.\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said there was no requirement for an entire bubble to have to be sent home, but only those in \"close contact\".\nBut there were calls to keep bubbles and isolation from Unison, representing school support staff. \"Self-isolation is one of the proven ways to keep cases under control,\" said the union's head of education, Jon Richards.\nShadow Education Secretary Kate Green said a new approach quickly needed to be introduced.\n\"Action is needed now to protect the final weeks of learning this year,\" she said, warning that \"changing restrictions for five days at the end of term will create more chaos for schools and families\".\n\"Schools, parents and pupils need urgent clarity. If bubbles will end on 19 July, schools need to know now so they can plan,\" said Ms Green.\nAnalysis: \nBy Sean Coughlan, BBC News education correspondent\nIt was striking how MPs from all sides seemed so concerned about the surge in pupils being sent home from school.\n\"We cannot allow this situation to continue,\" said James Daly, Conservative MP for Bury North, who said 2,000 pupils were currently isolating in his local area.\nLabour's Christian Matheson, City of Chester MP, cited a constituent whose child had been sent home on three separate occasions.\nThere were calls for a change in how Covid rules are applied, because among the 375,000 pupils sent home across England, 96% are not confirmed cases but only isolating as a precaution.\nThese figures could get even more alarming in the weeks ahead, with more confusion for schools and a growing political headache for ministers.\nParents and children could also be disappointed if it means missing some of the end of year events and rites of passage of leaving.\nBack in March, when pupils returned and attendance levels were high, pupils being sent home might have felt like a problem fading away. \nNow it's threatening a chaotic end to such a disrupted school year - and a reminder that adapting to Covid is going to be here for the long term.\nConservative Caroline Nokes asked for reassurance that \"as we look to both 19 July and the end of the summer term that there can be no question of a return to bubbles and self-isolation when children return in the autumn\".\nMr Williamson said: \"Our direction is very clear about lifting the restrictions and ensuring that children are not in the situation where they have to bubble.\n\"It's very much part of the course of this road map - and we will be very much expecting that children would not be facing that in September.\"\nLiberal Democrat Daisy Cooper said \"parents are at their wits' end\" with children having to self-isolate.\nAnd there were warnings of a \"generation of ghost children\" from Robert Halfon, chair of the education select committee, who called for action before the end of term to stop so many young people missing school.\nTory MP Esther McVey called on Mr Williamson to put a stop to \"self-isolation madness\" in schools.\n\"Last week, 375,000 pupils were off school for self-isolation and there has been a 40% increase in anti-depressants being prescribed to under 17-year-olds.\n\"Given that children are extremely unlikely to suffer serious ill health as a result of catching Covid, and given the damage being done to their education and their mental health, isn't it time we stopped this self-isolation madness and get all pupils back into classrooms where they belong?\"\nAsked if he intended Covid testing in schools to continue in the long term, Mr Williamson said he hoped to \"move away\" from it at the earliest opportunity.\nConservative Mark Harper asked: \"Given we've now vaccinated all of those adults at risk of being seriously ill from Covid, is he really suggesting, given that Covid is going to be endemic, that for the rest of time we're going to be testing our school children on a regular basis?\nMr Williamson replied: \"We do want to see schools return to normality and we don't want children to feel as if there's an extra layer of things that they have to do, that we as adults don't have to do.\"\nHe said testing had been an \"incredibly important tool\" in helping schools to return and that the issue was \"under review\".\n\"Much longer-term do I see testing as something that we expect children to continuously do always in the future? No I don't, and I ideally want to move away from that at the earliest and most realistic possible stage.\" "

      "text": "New legislation set to replace EU rules will grant the government and councils greater freedom to support businesses, the business secretary has said. \nThe Subsidy Control Bill will replace EU-wide state aid rules, which require member states to seek approval for government assistance to firms.  \nMinisters said the rules will allow the government to help companies with grants or loans faster.\nIt has been dubbed \"the most important bit of post-Brexit legislation yet\". \nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government was using its \"newfound freedoms\" following Brexit to \"empower public authorities across the UK to deliver financial support - without facing burdensome red tape\".\n\"We're seizing the opportunities of being an independent trading nation to back new and emerging British industries, create more jobs and make the UK the best possible place to start and grow a business,\" he added.\nThe government has said the new bill would allow it to be more agile, targeted and timely in its interventions with businesses.\nThe government said the announcement would not \"signal a return to the failed 1970s approach of government picking winners or bailing out unsustainable companies\".  \nThe UK has historically extended far less government support to private business than its EU counterparts in France and Germany and officials have historically said they do not expect the overall level of state aid to increase significantly.  \nThe government said it will judge cases for support on whether they deliver good value for money and help hit targets such as \"levelling up\" and decarbonising the economy.  \nThere will also be safeguards to ensure that devolved government departments and local authorities do not engage in bidding wars of support that could cause a relocation of businesses and jobs from one part of the UK to another. \nMatthew Fell, chief UK policy director for the Confederation of British Industry, said a new \"swift\" system could be a \"useful tool to meet the government's ambitions for the economy\". \nHe said EU state aid rules were \"too often proved prohibitive and bureaucratic\".\n\"Government support is a last resort for businesses, but at the right time and place, it can make an invaluable contribution to key players and industries,\" he added.\n\"Smart decision-making that ensures value to the public purse, respects the level playing field agreement with the EU and supports economic growth in all parts of the UK, can only be a good thing.\"\nHowever, the wording of the bill is set to be closely studied by the European Commission, which has expressed concerns the UK may distort competition by failing to ensure UK and EU firms operate on a so-called \"level playing field\".  Competition lawyers have also warned the new rules may prove controversial. \nMartin McElwee, a competition lawyer at Freshfields, said the government's new legislation offered \"more flexibility\", but \"less certainty\". He said businesses and lenders wouldn't find that loss of certainty easy.\n\"The EU subsidy regime was very complex, but we could help businesses, charities and public service providers understand what side of the line they fell on,\" he added.\n\"If you are a bank thinking about whether to lend to a business that's received support from the government, isn't certainty what you need?\"\nA new unit to issue advice on operating the new regime will be set up within the existing Competition and Markets Authority - but the CMA will have no powers to prohibit the granting of support. \nThe UK will still be subject to World Trade Organisation rules and any decisions made can be contested in law courts.

      "tags": "George W Bush,United States",
      "text": "Donald Rumsfeld, the two-time US defence secretary who was one of the main architects of the Iraq war, has died at the age of 88.\nServing under President George W Bush, he was a key proponent of the so-called \"war on terror\" after the 9/11 attacks.\nUS forces invaded Iraq in 2003 after claiming the country had weapons of mass destruction, but no such weapons were found.\nMr Rumsfeld resigned three years later amid the fallout from the conflict.\nHe staunchly defended his record, but many experts blamed him for decisions that led to difficulties in Iraq and the wider region. \nOn Wednesday, his family said he had died at home in the town of Taos, New Mexico. \"History may remember him for his extraordinary accomplishments over six decades of public service,\" they said in a statement.\n\"But for those who knew him best and whose lives were forever changed as a result, we will remember his unwavering love for his wife Joyce, his family and friends, and the integrity he brought to a life dedicated to country.\"\nReacting to the news, President Bush described him as \"a man of intelligence, integrity, and almost inexhaustible energy\" and an \"exemplary public servant\" who \"never flinched from responsibility\". \nUS defence secretary Lloyd Austin, meanwhile, said: \"Secretary Rumsfeld was propelled by his boundless energy, probing intellect, and abiding commitment to serve his country.\"\nBorn in Chicago in 1932, Mr Rumsfeld's political and private career spanned decades. He first came to Washington DC in the 1960s and served in multiple positions under presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.\nIn 1975, he became the youngest person to be named defence secretary and later became the oldest to serve in the role during his second stint under President Bush.   \nHe was at the Pentagon when the building was hit by a hijacked airplane during the 9/11 attacks. Mr Rumsfeld was among the first to reach the smouldering crash site, and he helped carry the wounded in stretchers.\nLess than a month later, US forces began an air campaign against al-Qaeda, the group responsible for the attacks, and the Taliban in Afghanistan, toppling the regime within weeks. \nThe administration's attention then turned to Iraq, which had played no role in the attacks. Mr Rumsfeld made the case for the March 2003 invasion, arguing that the country's weapons of mass destruction posed a danger to the world. No such weapons were ever found.\nMr Rumsfeld was known for his rollicking news conferences in which he sparred with reporters. One of the most memorable moments came in 2002, when he gave a much-mocked answer about \"known knowns\" and \"known unknowns\" after being asked whether there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\nHis tenure was also marked by photos that surfaced in 2004 of US personnel abusing prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad, and the treatment of foreign terrorism suspects at a prison set up at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\nMr Rumsfeld, however, largely remained defiant over his record after leaving office. In a 2011 memoir, which he titled Known and Unknown, he defended his decisions around the Iraq war but did express regret over some of his comments."

      "tags": "Companies,Retailing,Fashion",
      "text": "US fashion giant Gap has confirmed it plans to close all its 81 stores in the UK and Ireland and go online-only.\nThe firm said it would close all its stores \"in a phased manner\" between the end of August and the end of September.\nThis includes 19 stores that were already scheduled to close in July as their leases were expiring. \nThe company has not disclosed how many employees the closures will affect, but will shortly start a consultation process with the staff.\nThe firm said it was \"not exiting the UK market\" and would continue to offer a web-based store when all the shops had closed.\nA Gap spokesperson said the decision followed a strategic review of its European business.\nAs a result, Gap is also looking to offload its stores in France and Italy.\nGap was a big hit when it first opened in the UK back in 1987, famous for its hoodies and sweatshirts.  But in recent years, it has struggled to stay relevant, resorting to prolific discounting to pull shoppers in. That left Gap in a weak position to withstand the turmoil of a global pandemic. \nIt launched a strategic review of its entire European operations last autumn, warning that it was considering closing all its UK stores. Just a few weeks ago, 19 store closures were announced - now the rest of them will close as well. \nGap blamed what it described as market dynamics - in other words, the huge shift to internet shopping. It's going online-only, just like Debenhams and Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group. It's yet another famous name bidding a retreat from our High Streets, adding to the challenge of what to do with empty shops. \nKate Hardcastle, a consumer and retail expert says the closure is because Gap failed to keep up with the competition by not offering enough variety or being as cheap as competitors such as Primark.  \n\"The brands you want to shop with in physical retail have to have so much more than just products on offer, they have to have purpose,\" she says. \n\"It just didn't feel like a company that had embraced the new consumer,\" she adds.  \nThe company said it was in negotiations with another firm to take over all of its French stores.\nIn Italy, Gap said it was in discussions with a partner for the potential acquisition of the stores there.\n\"We believe in Gap's global brand power. We are executing against Gap's Power Plan and partnering to amplify our global reach,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"We are not exiting the UK market. We will continue to run and operate our Gap e-commerce business in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.\"\nA source close to the company said that it had seen rapid uptake of internet shopping for its clothes in the UK since the pandemic-enforced lockdowns. \nThe move comes as the latest blow to UK High Streets, already reeling from the collapse of the Debenhams and Arcadia retail empires during the pandemic.\nThe Debenhams brand continues online after being bought by retailer Boohoo for \u00a355m in January - and now Gap has added to the ranks of bricks-and-mortar clothing chains that have moved to cyberspace.\nDo you work for Gap?

      "title": "Bill Cosby: Why is there a time limit on bringing sexual assault cases to US courts?",
      "text": "More than 50 women allege they have been sexually assaulted by the comedian Bill Cosby, but only one woman will face him in criminal court. Campaigners say laws which set deadlines on when these crimes can be reported, deny survivors justice.  \nIt started when he was just eight. A man, well known to his family, began grooming him. \nFifty years later, Kevin Sweeney is finally able to talk about the sexual abuse to which he was subjected. \n\"It quickly escalated to inappropriate touching, and eventually rape,\" explains Mr Sweeney. \nIt continued until Mr Sweeney was 13 years old.  His abuser threatened to harm his siblings and parents if he told anyone, so he stayed silent.  \nNow a school teacher, married with children, Mr Sweeney lived with his secret for decades. \nIn his early forties, after learning his abuser had died, he worked up the courage to tell his wife.\n\"It took about 8 months of therapy before I could say the word rape,\" he explains.\nBy then, it was too late to seek justice - even if his attacker had been alive, he could not have pressed charges, thanks to the statute of limitations on such crimes in his home state.\nStatutes of limitation set deadlines on when someone can file a criminal complaint.\nIn murder cases there is no time frame, but for many other crimes, the clock starts ticking after an alleged offence occurs. When it comes to allegations of rape and sexual assault, states have different laws. The window of opportunity can vary from a few years, to a few decades. In sixteen states there is no limit. \nCampaigners say this law has impeded many of those who are accusing Bill Cosby from seeking justice. Proponents say it's necessary to keep the justice system fair. \nFifty-eight women have come forward claiming Mr Cosby sexually assaulted them - allegations spanning from the 1960s to the late 2000s.  \nBut only one of these women has brought charges against Mr Cosby.\n\"For most of these accusations, it was simply too late for a prosecutor to even consider them,\" Gloria Allred, the lawyer representing more than 30 of the women, recently wrote.  \nMr Cosby is due to go on trial in June next year, accused by Andrea Constand of drugging and abusing her in Pennsylvania in January 2004. He denies the allegations and all the others.  \nMs Constand first went to the police in 2005, but prosecutors initially said there wasn't enough evidence to press charges. \nLast year the case was reopened, after new evidence emerged. Ms Constand filed her case a few days before the statute of limitations - which is 14 years in Pennsylvania - was about to expire. \nBut other women who accuse Mr Cosby of sexual assault say they feel cheated. \nLise-Lotte Lubin says she passed out after Mr Cosby gave her two alcoholic drinks and petted her hair at a hotel in Nevada in 1989.  She believes she was drugged by the comedian.\nShe tried to file a police complaint at the start of 2015, after other women came forward with stories very similar to her own. Because the four year statute of limitations in Nevada had passed, it was too late.\nTestifying before a judiciary committee in March of that year, she said, \"I now understand that the law prevents the victim in my circumstances from seeking justice.\" \nIn May 2015, a new law was passed giving survivors up to 20 years to report an alleged sexual crime. Ms Lubin, who was one of the leaders of the campaign for change, said the new law would provide survivors of sexual assault \"much needed time\" to come forward. \nIn June this year, Beth Ferrier and Heidi Thomas, who both allege Mr Cosby assaulted them in the 1980s, celebrated as politicians in Colorado doubled the statute of limitations there from 10 to 20 years. \nMr Sweeney also successfully fought to change the statute of limitations in his current home state, Ohio. \nIn June 2015, the state increased the time sexual assault survivors have to file a complaint, from 20 to 25 years. He hopes the limitation will be removed completely one day. \n\"Imagine that your wife or your daughter or your sister or mother had had this experience, and that you did everything you could as their parent or spouse to get them to a point where they were strong enough to testify but then found out you couldn't because time was up. \n\"What would you say to them then?\"\nThe fight to change statute of limitation laws across the US has been met with resistance. The Catholic Church has lobbied against proposals to change child sexual assault laws in several states.\nMany legal experts argue these laws exist to protect defendants. \nJoe Patrice, a former lawyer who edits the legal news publication Above the Law, believes there needs to be a cut-off point so a defendant isn't at the mercy of prosecution indefinitely.\nKeeping a case within a set period avoids a scenario where memories fade and it becomes one person's word against another's, he argues. Mr Patrice is also concerned that in sexual assault cases where DNA is crucial, evidence could get corrupted over time.\nBut it can take decades for DNA evidence to come back in the first place. In a number of states, including Ohio, rape kits lie untested for decades. \nAmy Roberts had to wait nine years for her rape kit to come back. \nTwo decades ago, a man broke into her college apartment and raped her at knifepoint. \n\"I thought he was going to kill me,\" she said. \"After I left, I went to the hospital and got a rape kit done, and I reported it to the police and basically that's where it stayed for a while.\"\nMs Roberts' attacker still hasn't been caught. Like Mr Sweeney, she also testified before the state Senate in Ohio.  \nAs part of the new changes introduced, victims now have an additional five years to file a case after DNA is found.\n\"Rape is such a traumatic crime. It's almost 20 years and I still feel like it's affected my core.\n\"The idea that there's an arbitrary timeline that a person can no longer be held accountable makes no sense.\"\nThe publicity the Cosby case has thrown onto these issues could bring about even more change. \nIn California, a state where some of Mr Cosby's accusers live, a bill called SB 813 was recently passed to end the statute of limitations for rape, child sex abuse, and other sex crimes. \nGovernor Jerry Brown has until the end of September to sign the bill into law. \nThe author of the bill, State Senator Connie Leyva, says the high burden of proof still stands in these cases. \n\"SB 813 simply ensures that the door does not slam in the face of victims,\" she says.\nAnd for Mr Sweeney, it's important that door always stays open. \n \"One of the dangers of statutes of limitations is that it's assuming a victim's healing process is linear and logical. But it's not.\n \"It's more like a wave pattern. I feel strong today, but tomorrow I don't.\"\nFollow Rajini on Twitter - @BBCRajiniv"

      "text": "French police say they have arrested a woman suspected of causing a huge crash during the Tour de France by waving a sign in the riders' path on Saturday.\nThe peloton was 45km (28 miles) from the end of the first stage, when her sign clipped German rider Tony Martin.\nHe fell to the ground and caused dozens of other riders to follow suit, in what was one of the Tour de France's worst ever crashes.\nFrench authorities say the woman, who is French, is in custody in Landerneau.\nVideo footage of the incident has been shared widely online.\nThe woman can be seen holding a sign with \"granny and granddad\" written in German. She is looking away from the peloton coming towards her and does not see them approach, while holding her sign too far into the road.\nAs a result of the crash, two riders had to pull out of the Tour completely and another eight riders were treated for injuries.\nThe crash held up the race, which was between between Brest and Landerneau in north-west France, for five minutes, while bikes and riders were untangled and cleared from the road.\nFollowing the incident, Tour de France Deputy Director Pierre-Yves Thouault said the tour would take legal action against the woman.\n\"We are suing this woman who behaved so badly. We are doing this so that the tiny minority of people who do this do not spoil the show for everyone,\" he told AFP news agency.\nFrance has relaxed its coronavirus restrictions and many people have flocked to see the riders.\nThose hoping to watch the race have been told to keep off the route and maintain their distance."

      "text": "A mother stopped from seeing her dying son in his final weeks said she felt Boris Johnson \"dismissed\" a question about what happened to her family.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer highlighted the case of Ollie Bibby, 27, who was not able to see his family as he died in hospital.\nMr Johnson said he \"shared the grief of Ollie and his family and millions of people up and down the country\".\nPenny Bibby said all families who have made sacrifices \"must be listened to\".\nHer son, from South Benfleet, Essex, died of leukaemia in hospital on 5 May, a day before Matt Hancock was filmed kissing a colleague, prompting his resignation as health secretary.\nMr Bibby had begged to see his family in the weeks before his death.\nSir Keir raised the case in the first Prime Minister's Questions since Mr Hancock resigned and asked why he had not been sacked. \nHe said he had spoken to the Bibby family, who had followed the rules and made \"huge sacrifices\", in contrast to Mr Hancock, who had set the rules.\n\"Every time, it's the same old story,\" said Sir Keir. \"Where the British people are doing everything asked of them, it's one rule for them, another rule for everybody else.\"\nIn response, Mr Johnson said: \"We all share the grief and pain of Ollie and his family and millions of people up and down the country have endured the privations that this country has been through in order to get the pandemic under control, and that is why we had a change of health secretary a day after the story appeared.\n\"And that's why as a government, instead of focusing on stuff in the Westminster bubble, we are focusing on rolling out those vaccines at a rate that will make sure that people like Ollie and his family do not have to suffer in the future.\"\nHis spokeswoman later said he \"absolutely was not\" referring to the case of Ollie Bibby when he spoke about the Westminster bubble.\nMrs Bibby said the response made her family feel \"not important\".\n\"Boris Johnson just dismissed the question, he avoided answering it entirely, which made us feel like we're not important,\" she said.\n\"He keeps going on about vaccinations, but there are no guarantees that families can be together on their death bed, even if everyone is vaccinated. \n\"There are no signs that anything is going to change.\"\nShe previously said she was \"livid\" Mr Hancock broke social distancing rules, while her family were \"treated like criminals\" as they battled to see Ollie in the weeks before he died.\nShe said she had received hundreds of \"heartbreaking\" messages from families in similar situations since her story came to light. \n\"I have lost confidence in this government now,\" she said.\n\"There needs to be a plan, this can't go on. How many more families need to be kept apart while loved ones are dying?\"\nSir Keir told the BBC: \"What came across powerfully in my conversation with Penny was the huge dignity which she and her family have shown through this terrible ordeal.\n\"Ollie's case demonstrates the huge sacrifices that families have made during this pandemic to follow the rules. That's why it was important for me to raise with the prime minister today.\"\nMr Bibby spent seven weeks at University College London Hospital before he died. His parents said they did not blame the staff, who were following rules, but most of his family were \"denied the chance to say goodbye properly\".\nThe hospital said it was \"confident that Ollie received appropriate care and treatment and that regular visits were allowed in line with hospital guidance\" but it would look to \"learn from the family's experience\".\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "Residents of a Florida apartment building that collapsed last week received a letter in April warning of worsening structural damage.\nThe letter, obtained and reported by US media, was sent by the president of the apartment block's building association.\nIt said damage that was first reported in 2018 had \"gotten significantly worse\" and would soon \"begin to multiply\" without immediate repairs.\nAt least 12 people were killed and 149 more are still missing in the collapse.\nThe letter is the latest in a string of documents that have emerged providing evidence that the Champlain Towers South building in Surfside, north of Miami, had known structural issues.\nLawsuits are already being filed over the deadly disaster, with the latest accusing the building association of \"reckless and negligent conduct\".\nThe April letter, sent by the president of the Champlain Towers South Condominium Association, said that \"observable damage\" had gotten \"significantly worse\" and warned that \"concrete deterioration is accelerating\". \nThe letter also warned about roof damage, and estimated that fixing the building's problems would cost about $15m (\u00a310.8m)\nIt follows reports about findings from a 2018 inspection that urged timely repairs after \"major structural damage\" was found, including  \"abundant cracking\" in an underground parking garage. \nQuestions over the collapse are mounting at the same time as a desperate search operation continues.\nDozens remain missing in the rubble of the 12-floor apartment building, which partially collapsed in the early hours of Thursday as scores of residents slept. \nOfficials insisted on Tuesday that the operation remains a search and rescue one. \"Nobody is giving up hope here. Nobody is stopping. The work goes on. Full force,\" Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said.\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis said: \"When somebody's missing in action in the military, you're missing until you're found and we don't stop the search, so I think that's what's happening.\"\nHundreds of emergency responders, including experts from as far away as Mexico and Israel, are assisting with the operation. \nOfficials say rescuers are removing debris \"piece by piece\" and using scanners, cranes and dogs to try and find anyone that may still be alive. \nMiami-Dade Fire Chief Alan Cominsky said some 3,000,000lb (1,360,000kg) of concrete had already been removed.\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to visit the building collapse later this week along with First Lady Jill Biden.\nThe president will thank emergency services and meet with families impacted by the \"terrible tragedy\", the White House said."

      "tags": "Climate change,Severe weather,Canada",
      "text": "Hundreds of sudden deaths, many of them suspected of being heat-related, have been reported during Canada's record-breaking heatwave, officials say.\nSome 486 fatalities were recorded over the past five days in British Columbia alone, a 195% increase on the usual amount over that period.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau offered condolences to families of the victims, many of whom were elderly.\nAbnormally high temperatures have been recorded across North America.\nBritish Columbia Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe said on Wednesday: \"It is believed likely that the significant increase in deaths reported is attributable to the extreme weather BC has experienced and continues to impact many parts of our province.\"\nShe said many of those who died in the heatwave had lived alone in homes that were not ventilated. \nMs Lapointe added that the western province had only seen three heat-related deaths over the past three to five years. \nOn Wednesday evening, the town of Lytton, British Columbia, was evacuated because of a wildfire - a day after it recorded Canada's highest ever temperature of 49.6C (121.3F).\nMayor Jan Polderman told CBC News: \"The whole town is on fire. It took like a whole 15 minutes from the first sign of smoke to all of a sudden there being fire everywhere.\"\nThe heat over western parts of Canada and the US has been caused by a dome of static high-pressure hot air stretching from California to the Arctic territories. Temperatures have been easing in coastal areas but there is not much respite for inland regions.\nThe weather system is now moving eastwards over the Prairie provinces - Alberta and Saskatchewan and parts of Manitoba have been placed under Environment Canada heat warnings.\nJanice Houldsworth, who lives in the British Columbia community of Castlegar, told the BBC she had not ventured outdoors for four days. \"I've never experienced anything like this in all my 70 years,\" she said.\n\"We have blackened out all the windows, have fans running 24/7 constantly spraying with mist, cold foot baths, and showers and [are] drinking tons of liquid.\"\nIn Vancouver alone, heat is believed to have been a contributing factor in the deaths of 65 people since Friday. \nAt an affordable housing event in Kanata, Ontario, Mr Trudeau described heatwaves as a growing problem, and went on to talk about climate change.\nCanada's southern neighbour, the United States, has also seen extreme heat. \nIn the US Pacific Northwest on Monday, temperatures hit 46.6C (116F) in Portland, Oregon, and 42.2C (108F) in Seattle, Washington, the highest levels since record-keeping began in the 1940s, the National Weather Service said.\nIn Oregon, authorities say at least 63 people have died from health issues related to the hot weather over the past few days. Forty-five of those deaths were recorded in Multnomah County.\nAt least 16 people have died in Washington state's King and Snohomish counties.\nUS President Joe Biden has also linked the heatwave to climate change in a speech. \nI've heard from scientists who say that in just a few days they'll be able to determine just how much human driven warming has contributed to the searing temperatures seen in British Columbia.\nOne interesting piece of evidence is the lack of respite that night brings - recent temperatures at midnight in BC have been 2C warmer than the normal summer daytime figure.\nResearchers say this combination of day and night-time heat is very dangerous for humans - a study published last year indicated that these compound events are closely linked to emissions of greenhouse gases.\nNatural variability and local factors such as sea breezes can raise or limit the impacts of extreme heat.  But the bigger picture is the rising thermometer of global heating is impacting all events.\n\"Every heatwave occurring today is made more likely and more intense by human-induced climate change,\" Dr Friederike Otto from the University of Oxford told the BBC.\n\"Climate change is definitely one of the drivers of the intensity of this Canadian heatwave - but it is not the only one and determining how much it impacts it, is a work in progress.\" \nEven if they can't directly attribute this heatwave to climate change, experts say the fingerprints of global heating are all over it. \nBoth Mr Trudeau and Mr Biden have warned of an increased chances of wildfires in the heatwave. \nOn Wednesday Mr Biden met with governors of western US states and fire officials, as the annual North American wildfire season began.\nJodi Hughes, weather presenter at Global News Calgary, told the BBC that firefighters were extremely concerned at the possibility of wild fires, possibly sparked by thunderstorms that could occur as the weather pattern changes.\nMany homes in British Columbia do not have air conditioning as temperatures are usually far milder during the summer months.\nOne Vancouver resident told AFP news agency that hotels seemed to be sold out, as people flocked there for air conditioning, adding: \"I've never seen anything like this. I hope it never becomes like this ever again.\"\nOfficials in British Columbia have warned residents against leaving their doors open, after a spate of bears wandering into people's home.\nIn Vancouver, residents have reported car windows cracking and melting, even when they are not parked in the sun.\nHave you been affected by the high temperatures?

      "text": "Education Secretary Gavin Williamson says he wants the school \"bubble\" system in England removed as soon as possible, as rising numbers of pupils are being sent home to isolate.\nThis could happen alongside the next step of the roadmap for unlocking the country from the pandemic, he told MPs.\nBut Labour warned that schools needed immediate action to avoid \"chaos\" in the last weeks of term.\nOfficial figures this week showed over 375,000 children have been sent home.\nA Downing Street spokesman declined to say whether bubbles would be scrapped, either in September or as part of changes to restrictions potentially from 19 July.\nHead teachers' leader Paul Whiteman said schools needed to be told how \"alternative arrangements would work\". \nOn Wednesday the UK reported another 26,068 Covid-19 cases - the highest daily figure since January 29.\nAnother 14 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also reported.\nResponding to an urgent question from Labour, Mr Williamson said he recognised the \"frustration of parents and pupils who may feel like they're being asked to isolate unnecessarily\".\nThe numbers sent home from school for Covid-related reasons have quadrupled this month - but among those having to isolate only about 4% are confirmed cases, with most sent home because of a potential contact at school.\n\"I want to see these restrictions, including bubbles, removed as quickly as possible,\" said the education secretary, facing warnings from MPs about an escalating problem with pupils being sent home.\nThis would be part of the \"next step\" in the process of unlocking from the pandemic, he told MPs, which under current plans could be 19 July, close to the end of the summer term.\nMr Williamson said he was working with the health secretary on changing the response to Covid in schools.\nThis could include more testing - and a pilot scheme has been using daily testing in response to Covid cases, rather than a wider group of pupils having to isolate.\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said there was no requirement for an entire bubble to have to be sent home, but only those in \"close contact\".\nBut there were calls to keep bubbles and isolation from Unison, representing school support staff. \"Self-isolation is one of the proven ways to keep cases under control,\" said the union's head of education, Jon Richards.\nShadow Education Secretary Kate Green said a new approach quickly needed to be introduced.\n\"Action is needed now to protect the final weeks of learning this year,\" she said, warning that \"changing restrictions for five days at the end of term will create more chaos for schools and families\".\n\"Schools, parents and pupils need urgent clarity. If bubbles will end on 19 July, schools need to know now so they can plan,\" said Ms Green.\nAnalysis: \nBy Sean Coughlan, BBC News education correspondent\nIt was striking how MPs from all sides seemed so concerned about the surge in pupils being sent home from school.\n\"We cannot allow this situation to continue,\" said James Daly, Conservative MP for Bury North, who said 2,000 pupils were currently isolating in his local area.\nLabour's Christian Matheson, City of Chester MP, cited a constituent whose child had been sent home on three separate occasions.\nThere were calls for a change in how Covid rules are applied, because among the 375,000 pupils sent home across England, 96% are not confirmed cases but only isolating as a precaution.\nThese figures could get even more alarming in the weeks ahead, with more confusion for schools and a growing political headache for ministers.\nParents and children could also be disappointed if it means missing some of the end of year events and rites of passage of leaving.\nBack in March, when pupils returned and attendance levels were high, pupils being sent home might have felt like a problem fading away. \nNow it's threatening a chaotic end to such a disrupted school year - and a reminder that adapting to Covid is going to be here for the long term.\nConservative Caroline Nokes asked for reassurance that \"as we look to both 19 July and the end of the summer term that there can be no question of a return to bubbles and self-isolation when children return in the autumn\".\nMr Williamson said: \"Our direction is very clear about lifting the restrictions and ensuring that children are not in the situation where they have to bubble.\n\"It's very much part of the course of this road map - and we will be very much expecting that children would not be facing that in September.\"\nLiberal Democrat Daisy Cooper said \"parents are at their wits' end\" with children having to self-isolate.\nAnd there were warnings of a \"generation of ghost children\" from Robert Halfon, chair of the education select committee, who called for action before the end of term to stop so many young people missing school.\nTory MP Esther McVey called on Mr Williamson to put a stop to \"self-isolation madness\" in schools.\n\"Last week, 375,000 pupils were off school for self-isolation and there has been a 40% increase in anti-depressants being prescribed to under 17-year-olds.\n\"Given that children are extremely unlikely to suffer serious ill health as a result of catching Covid, and given the damage being done to their education and their mental health, isn't it time we stopped this self-isolation madness and get all pupils back into classrooms where they belong?\"\nAsked if he intended Covid testing in schools to continue in the long term, Mr Williamson said he hoped to \"move away\" from it at the earliest opportunity.\nConservative Mark Harper asked: \"Given we've now vaccinated all of those adults at risk of being seriously ill from Covid, is he really suggesting, given that Covid is going to be endemic, that for the rest of time we're going to be testing our school children on a regular basis?\nMr Williamson replied: \"We do want to see schools return to normality and we don't want children to feel as if there's an extra layer of things that they have to do, that we as adults don't have to do.\"\nHe said testing had been an \"incredibly important tool\" in helping schools to return and that the issue was \"under review\".\n\"Much longer-term do I see testing as something that we expect children to continuously do always in the future? No I don't, and I ideally want to move away from that at the earliest and most realistic possible stage.\" "

1,470 cases - being aged between 20 and 39.\nThere has been a lot of talk about the mixing prompted by watching football being a cause of spread of the virus in Scotland.\nIt is an easy target given the images of people together in stadiums and fanzone sites.\nBut the problem with this data is it does not provide the answer to that.\nIt is contact tracing data used to establish who should be asked to isolate because they may be a close contact of an infected person.\nIt does not tell you where the individual caught the virus - just where they had been when they were infectious.\nSo this tells us that 6% of positive cases during this period attended a match, Fanzone, someone's home or the pub to watch a game of football.\nThe fact that people were out enjoying Scotland's first tournament for 23 years is no surprise.\nIt's quite likely that led to some transmission - although remember it is indoor settings such as having a drink in the pub or sharing public transport on the way to the game that is more risky than watching a match outdoors  - but it's hardly an explanation for Scotland's big rise in cases.\nScotland fan Michael MacLean told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme that he tested positive for Covid following his trip to London for the match against England.\nThe 21-year-old travelled from Inverness on the train, visiting pubs and celebrating with other supporters in Leicester Square during his three-night stay in the city.\nA few days after returning to Scotland, he showed symptoms of coronavirus.\nHe said: \"Leicester Square, I would say, was the spreader. \n\"It was an amazing experience, but I am quite gutted I got Covid because that has affected me, affected my work, it has affected my friends.\"\nOn Wednesday Scotland recorded 3,887 new cases, which was 9.8% of all tests carried out. \nIn the past seven days 20,511 positive results have been returned.\nHospital admissions have risen and deaths related to covid are also up, but they are nowhere near the numbers seen during the first two waves of the pandemic.\nHealth Secretary Humza Yousaf told BBC Scotland earlier this week that the data clearly showed the number of people testing positive was \"skewed disproportionately towards young males\".\nAnd he said several public health experts had partly put the increase down to the large number of indoor gatherings to watch Euro 2020 matches. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon had previously denied claims that the Scottish government took a lenient approach to football fans while Scotland was playing in the tournament. \nShe told a briefing on Tuesday: \"We haven't taken a softly, softly approach.\n\"We were very explicit in saying to fans who didn't have a ticket for Wembley not to travel.\n\"We can't physically stop every person travelling and significant numbers of people did travel.\" "

      "text": "Long-awaited plans to extend opening times for pubs and nightclubs in Northern Ireland have passed their final hurdle at Stormont.\nThe changes will allow pubs and clubs to serve alcohol for an extra hour, until 02:00, almost every weekend.\nEaster drinking restrictions have also been removed, with the changes backed by assembly members (MLAs) after a debate in the assembly.\nMost of the changes will take effect from 1 October 2021.\nThe 1 October date will allow the hospitality industry to avail of extended opening times ahead of the Christmas period.\nOther measures will come into force from 6 April 2022 in time for next Easter. \nIt marks a significant liberalisation of Northern Ireland's laws on alcohol that has been in the making for nine years.\nA previous bill to change Northern Ireland's licensing laws began its legislative passage in 2016, but the assembly collapsed in January 2017 amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in, who share power together at Stormont.\nMeanwhile, a full statutory review of licensing laws in Northern Ireland will also be held following an amendment to the licensing bill secured by SDLP assembly member (MLA) Matthew O'Toole on Tuesday afternoon.\nThe amendment means the Department for Communities must begin an independent review within the next year, including an investigation of how the so-called \"surrender principle\" affects the industry. \nThe principle means no new licence can be granted unless another one is surrendered.\nLicences for selling alcohol on and off premises are also convertible in court, which means that every supermarket or convenience store seeking to add an off sales needs to acquire a licence from somewhere else.\nMr O'Toole said the review would be a \"first step toward reforming the system here so that it works for everyone\".\nCommunities Minister Deirdre Hargey said she believed it was a \"a balanced piece of legislation\".\nShe told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme there was a need \"to modernise in 2021\".\n\"I want to make sure we do this in a balanced way, lifting some of the current restrictions, which are archaic, but also be mindful in terms of the health and safety impacts,\" she said.\nCinemas will also be permitted for the first time in Northern Ireland to apply for a licence to sell alcohol to customers. \nIt will bring the rules in Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland.\nMichael McAdam of the cinema chain Movie House said it was a positive step.\n\"I think it will add to people's overall experience,\" he said.\n\"I don't envisage massive sales but it's about giving people choice and that's the good thing about this legislation.\"\nOther changes in the bill include the extension in \"drinking-up time\" from half an hour to an hour, meaning venues can operate until 03:00 at weekends.\nThe law will also be tightened in some areas - supermarkets will face restrictions on where they can place in-store advertising for alcohol.\nThe current voluntary code of practice for drinks promotions will be replaced with legal requirements.\nThe changes will also enable local drinks producers to sell their products directly to the public in limited circumstances, make changes to the law affecting registered private clubs and allow changes to permitted hours at major events.

      "tags": "Republic of Ireland,Coronavirus vaccines,Hospitality industry,Restaurants",
      "text": "The Irish government is delaying the return of some indoor activities, including hospitality, over increasing cases of the Delta Covid-19 variant.\nIndoor hospitality was due to reopen on 5 July.\nWhen it reopens, it will be limited to those who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19, Taoiseach (Irish PM) Miche\u00e1l Martin has said.\nThe recommendation was made by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).\nThe Irish cabinet met on Tuesday morning to consider the plans.\nMr Martin said while there would be an increase in the number of people who could attend outdoor events and the number who can attend weddings would be increased to 50 as planned, \"the return to other indoor activities including hospitality will be delayed\".\n\"NPHET's clear advice based on the modelling it has done is that given the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant, the safest way to now proceed with the return of indoor hospitality is to limit access to those who have been fully vaccinated or who have recovered from Covid infection,\" he said.\n\"Over the course of the coming weeks, the government will work urgently with the relevant sectors to agree a practical and workable approach.\n\"The simple truth is that we are in a race between the variants and the vaccines and we want to do everything we can to ensure that the vaccine wins.\"\nMr Martin said he knew his announcement of the delay would be greeted with dismay and frustration.\nHe said the tourism and hospitality sectors had borne a disproportionate burden throughout the pandemic and in recognition of this additional supports would be provided in the coming weeks.\nThe taoiseach gave no date for when indoor dining and drinking in pubs and restaurants would resume.\nRestaurateurs and publicans expressed their anger and frustration at Mr Martin's comments.\nCathal Doherty, who owns the Ballyliffin Townhouse Boutique Hotel in County Donegal, said many in the hospitality sector would view Tuesday's announcement as unworkable. \n\"We obviously have to wait for the full published guidance, but it will be interesting to see how they [the government] can even begin to possibly explain this,\" Mr Doherty said.  \n\"It's beyond confusing, we just seem to be going backwards.\"\nMr Doherty believes for many small businesses across Ireland the delay for reopening will be seen as the \"final nail in the coffin\".\n\"If we [the hospitality sector] don't start getting a decent trade in summer then many small businesses are simply not going to make it until winter,\" he said.  \n\"That is the hard truth, this has caused more challenges than solutions,\" he added.\nMartina Barrett, who owns The Tavern in Portnoo, County Donegal, labelled the proposed rules as \"absolutely ridiculous\". \nMs Barnett explained that many of her staff, who are in their early 20s, have not even received their first Covid-19 jab and questioned how her pub could operate.\n\"It's just impossible to police, and once again this decision has left us unclear as to what to do next,\" she explained. \nLabour leader Alan Kelly said the plan was \"bananas and discriminatory\".\nHe said what the government is proposing was not enforceable and people under 30 were shocked that they had been \"jettisoned\".\nSocial Democrats co-leader R\u00f3is\u00edn Shortall also said the plans were unworkable and unenforceable.\nIndependent TD Mattie McGrath called on the government to dispense with the services of NPHET.\nMinister for Health Stephen Donnelly said it was intended to agree a plan by 19 July in consultation with the hospitality industry to allow those who are vaccinated or recovered from Covid-19 to use indoor hospitality.\nThe Cabinet Covid Committee had a meeting which lasted until 01:00 local time on Tuesday.\nDuring the meeting, the NPHET gave some warnings to the Irish government on Monday, including a \"most pessimistic\" scenario of hundreds of thousands of cases between July and September and more than 2,000 deaths with Covid-19.\nMeanwhile, T\u00e1naiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson vaccines would now be offered to all age groups after being previously limited to over-50s.\nThe plans have been criticised by the Restaurants Association of Ireland, which said it was \"astounded\" that indoor hospitality would face a further delay. \nIn a statement, the group said it believed the policy was discriminatory and unworkable.  \n\"Restaurant, pub and caf\u00e9 owners will now be placed in the unenviable, complex and difficult position of allowing vaccinated customers enter indoors and restricting non-vaccinated customers to outdoor dining,\" its chief executive Adrian Cummins said. \n\"Such a practice of refusing access to goods and services in currently illegal under equality acts.\"\nHe added that many people working in the hospitality sector were in the unvaccinated age groups, and could potentially be asked to refuse service to their peers. \nOutdoor hospitality in the Republic has been reopen since 7 June, with social distancing and restrictions on the number of people who can meet in place. \nIn Northern Ireland, indoor hospitality reopened on 24 May, with restrictions in place on the number of people and households able to meet. \nNon-essential international travel is expected to resume on 19 July and the cabinet is also expected to give the green light to increasing the number of wedding guests to 50 next month."

      "text": "The Methodist Church has become the largest religious denomination in Britain to permit same-sex marriages.\nA vote to change the definition of marriage at the Methodist Conference on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed by 254 in favour with 46 against.\nFreedom of conscience clauses mean ministers will not be forced to conduct such weddings if they oppose the move.\nSame-sex marriage is not allowed in the Church of England or the Roman Catholic Church. \nHowever it is welcomed in the Scottish Episcopal Church, the United Reformed Church and the Quakers in Britain.\nThe Methodist Church is Britain's fourth largest Christian denomination with about 164,000 members across more than 4,000 churches. \nChurch officials hope the first same-sex weddings in Methodist chapels will take place in the autumn.\nThe Rev Sam McBratney, chair of the Dignity and Worth campaign group, said it was a \"momentous step on the road to justice\" after many years of \"painful conversations\". \n\"Some of us have been praying for this day to come for decades, and can hardly believe it is now here,\" he said. \"We are so grateful to our fellow Methodists for taking this courageous step to recognise and affirm the value and worth of LGBTQ+ relationships. \n\"We reassure those who do not support this move that we want to continue to work and worship with you in the Church we all love.\"\nHowever in an emotional debate, Carolyn Lawrence, a former vice-president of the Methodist Conference, warned there was a \"significant minority\" of Methodists who were \"planning on leaving or resigning their membership\" as a result of the vote. \n\"Today is a line in the sand for many people and seen as a significant departure from our doctrine.\"\nBen Riley and Jason McMahon have been together for 12 years but have waited to marry until they could have a church wedding.\nBen said today's decision \"means so much\" and they now hope to marry in their local Methodist church in Preston.\nJason, who is training to be a Methodist minister, described it as a \"very emotional day\".\n\"To be told by the Church that you are worthy, that we accept you, and that you can be married in the eyes of God in the church you call home with friends and family - it means a great deal.\n\"It has really helped me feel truly at home within a Church that is able to embrace anybody.\"\nHe said waiting for same-sex weddings to be permitted had been \"painful\" but added that he hoped the Methodist Church could now \"begin to look outwards\".\nThe proposals were initially passed by the Methodist Conference in 2019 before being sent to local synods for consultation. \nAll but one of the 30 local synods have since voted in favour of the change. Wednesday's confirmatory vote was due to take place at the 2020 conference but that was cancelled because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe changes mean the Methodist Church now holds two parallel definitions of marriage - one position says \"marriage can only be between a man and a woman\" and the other that \"marriage can be between any two people\".\nChurch officials hope the dual definition will persuade conservative churches not to leave and protect ministers from discrimination claims if they refuse to marry gay couples.\nThe Rev Sonia Hicks, president of the Methodist Conference, said: \"The debate today and our wider conversation has been conducted with grace and mutual respect. \n\"As we move forward together after this historic day for our Church, we must remember to continue to hold each other in prayer, and to support each other respecting our differences.\""

      "title": "Bill Cosby freed after top court overturns sexual assault conviction",
      "text": "US comedian Bill Cosby has left prison hours after his sexual assault conviction was overturned by Pennsylvania's Supreme Court.\nThe judges said there had been a \"process violation\" by the prosecution, but admitted their ruling was unusual.\nMr Cosby, 83, served more than two years of a three to 10-year sentence at a state prison near Philadelphia. \nIn 2018 he was found guilty of drugging and molesting ex-basketball player Andrea Constand.\nMr Cosby is best known for starring in the 1980s TV series The Cosby Show and was once known as \"America's Dad\".\nDozens of women have publicly accused Mr Cosby of sexual assault, but he was only tried criminally for the incident against Ms Constand. His conviction in 2018 was widely seen as a landmark moment in the #MeToo movement.\nIn a verdict issued on Wednesday, Pennsylvania's highest court found there was a \"process violation\" because Mr Cosby's lawyers had made an agreement with a previous state prosecutor that he would not be charged in the case.\nThe former actor appeared frail as he slowly walked to waiting media outside his home, shortly after being released from prison.\nHe did not say anything, instead leaning on his team of lawyers and spokesman Andrew Wyatt to answer questions.\n\"On this hot day - this is a hot verdict for us,\" Mr Wyatt said.\n\"Mr Cosby has always used his celebrity and his name to uplift women... How could a man who is being watched by the FBI every day be raping and drugging women\u2026 especially a black man?\" he added.\nOff camera, fans of Mr Cosby could be heard yelling their support throughout the media conference.\nMr Cosby was found guilty on three counts of felony indecent assault against Ms Constand. \nDecades his junior, she met him in 2002 when working at Temple University in Philadelphia and described the comedian as a mentor figure. She later testified at trial how she became \"frozen\" after Cosby drugged and molested her at his home in 2004.\nMs Constand first came forward to police about the assault in 2005, but former state prosecutor Bruce Castor did not press criminal charges. She then sued the comedian for sexual battery and defamation, reaching a settlement with a confidentially agreement in 2006.\nIn 2014 and 2015, dozens of women came forward with similar allegations of drugging and assault by Mr Cosby. Local authorities knew that statute of limitation rules meant they could not pursue the majority of these accusations - but they reopened the case involving Ms Constand and eventually charged him just days before the 12-year limit on her allegations was set to expire. \nA judge declared a mistrial in his first trial in 2017 after the jury failed to reach a verdict.\nThe testimony of other accusers was then allowed during a second trial, which helped prosecutors paint a pattern of predatory behaviour by Mr Cosby.\nThe judges' reasoning is complex - their written finding is 79-pages long.\nThey cite a written agreement reached by Mr Castor, the former prosecutor, stating that he would not charge Mr Cosby if he testified in Ms Constand's civil lawsuit.\nIn Wednesday's ruling, the Supreme Court judges also found that testimony from accusers unrelated to the case had tainted the trial.\n\"There is only one remedy that can completely restore Cosby to the status quo ante. He must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be barred\", the finding released on Wednesday reads.\n\"We do not dispute that this remedy is both severe and rare. But it is warranted here.\"\nA spokesman for Mr Cosby, Andrew Wyatt, thanked the court in a statement. \n\"This is the justice Mr Cosby has been fighting for. They saw the light,\" Mr Wyatt said. \"He was given a deal and he had immunity. He should have never been charged.\"\nActor Phylicia Rashad, who played his wife on the Cosby Show, wrote on Twitter: \"A terrible wrong is being righted - a miscarriage of justice is corrected!\" in response to the news. \nProsecutor Kevin Steele said in a statement that Mr Cosby \"was found guilty by a jury and now goes free on a procedural issue that is irrelevant to the facts of the crime\".\n\"My hope is that this decision will not dampen the reporting of sexual assaults by victims\u2026 We still believe that no one is above the law - including those who are rich, famous and powerful.\"\nLawyer Gloria Allred, who represented more than 30 accusers of Mr Cosby, described the ruling as \"devastating\" but said the decision did not vindicate the comedian's conduct. \n\"My heart especially goes out to those who bravely testified in both of his criminal cases,\" her statement added."

      "text": "Specialists have been drafted in from across the UK to investigate the death of two rail workers hit by a train.\nBritish Transport Police has launched a \"thorough and painstaking\" probe, while Network Rail is also investigating.\nGareth Delbridge, 64, from Kenfig Hill, and Michael \"Spike\" Lewis, 58, from North Cornelly, were hit by the Swansea to Paddington train near Margam at about 10:00 BST on Wednesday.\nPolice said they may have not heard it as they were wearing ear defenders.\nThe Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) has also launched an independent inquiry.\nBritish Transport Police (BTP) said it was \"highly likely\" its investigation would \"continue for some time\".\nDivisional commander for Wales, Supt Andy Morgan, said: \"We have drafted in specialist teams from across the UK to assist our local investigators in their efforts.\n\"We are also very mindful of the impact this incident has created on the community. \n\"But please be reassured that if any safety-critical matters come to light at any stage, then they will be highlighted to the appropriate agency and acted on urgently.\"\nNetwork Rail has appointed an independent investigator to form part of an inquiry team that will include trade unions and industry partners.\nChief executive Andrew Haines said many in the company were \"still reeling from the shock of the tragedy\".\n\"They were extremely well respected and experienced members of the Port Talbot track team - together they have given over 84 years' service to the railway and they will be missed,\" he said.\n\"This is a heart-breaking reminder of how dangerous it can be to work on the railway and highlights to us all the importance of challenging anything that seems unsafe.\"\nA third worker was treated at the scene for shock after the train struck Mr Delbridge and Mr Lewis, but was not injured.\nMr Delbridge's family said he was the \"most loving husband, father, brother and granddad\".\n\"He loved life, work and his holidays - but most of all, his family,\" they added.\n\"We are devastated to have lost Gaz in such tragic circumstances, and both he and Spike will be missed so sadly by all of their family and friends.\"\nThe family of Mr Lewis said he was \"loved by everyone\".\nThey said: \"We would like to thank everyone so much for their support during this difficult time and ask that we are now given the space we need to grieve.\"\nAlan Gitsham, a former railway worker who used to work with both men, said: \"Mike was great, a tidy fella. I'm devastated, I can't believe he's gone.\"\nKenfig Hill Rugby Football Club said Mr Delbridge was a long-standing member.\nGary Chappell, the club's treasurer, said Mr Delbridge's death was \"more than devastating\".\n\"He was an absolutely fantastic guy. He always had a smile on his face,\" he said.\n\"He always had time to say hello to you.\""

      "text": "A prototype flying car has completed a 35-minute flight between international airports in Nitra and Bratislava, Slovakia.\nThe hybrid car-aircraft, AirCar, is equipped with a BMW engine and runs on regular petrol-pump fuel. \nIts creator, Prof Stefan Klein, said it could fly about 1,000km (600 miles), at a height of 8,200ft (2,500m), and had clocked up 40 hours in the air so far.\nIt takes two minutes and 15 seconds to transform from car into aircraft.\nThe narrow wings fold down along the sides of the car.\nProf Klein drove it straight off the runway and into town upon arrival, watched by invited reporters.\nHe described the experience, early on Monday morning, as \"normal\" and \"very pleasant\". \nIn the air, the vehicle reached a cruising speed of 170km/h.\nIt can carry two people, with a combined weight limit of 200kg (31 stone). \nBut unlike drone-taxi prototypes, it cannot take off and land vertically and requires a runway.\nThere are high expectations for the nascent market in flying cars, which have long been heralded in popular culture as a visionary landmark of the future.\nIn 2019, consultant company Morgan Stanley predicted the sector could be worth $1.5trillion (\u00a31tn) by 2040.\nAnd at an industry event on Tuesday, Hyundai Motors Europe chief executive Michael Cole called the concept \"part of our future\".\nIt is considered a potential solution to the strain on existing transport infrastructures.\nThe company behind AirCar, Klein Vision, says the prototype has taken about two years to develop and cost \"less than 2m euros\" (\u00a31.7m) in investment.\nAnton Zajac, an adviser and investor in Klein Vision, said if the company could attract even a small percentage of global airline or taxi sales, it would be hugely successful.\n\"There are about 40,000 orders of aircraft in the United States alone,\" he said.\n\"And if we convert 5% of those, to change the aircraft for the flying car - we have a huge market.\" \nDr Stephen Wright, senior research fellow in avionics and aircraft, at the University of the West of England, described the AirCar as \"the lovechild of a Bugatti Veyron and a Cesna 172\".\nAnd he did not think the vehicle would be particularly loud or uneconomical in terms of fuel costs, compared with other aircraft.\n\"I have to admit that this looks really cool - but I've got a hundred questions about certification,\" Dr Wright said.\n\"Anyone can make an aeroplane but the trick is making one that flies and flies and flies for the thick end of a million hours, with a person on board, without having an incident.\n\"I can't wait to see the piece of paper that says this is safe to fly and safe to sell.\""

      "text": "Dozens of people have died in Canada amid an unprecedented heatwave that has smashed temperature records.\nPolice in the Vancouver area have responded to more than 130 sudden deaths since Friday. Most were elderly or had underlying health conditions, with heat often a contributing factor.\nCanada broke its temperature record for a third straight day on Tuesday - 49.6C (121.3F) in Lytton, British Columbia. \nThe US north-west has also seen record highs - and a number of fatalities.\nExperts say climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves. However, linking any single event to global warming is complicated.\nUS President Joe Biden said the heatwave was tied to climate change in a speech on Tuesday as he pitched a plan to update the country's infrastructure network.\nOn Wednesday he is meeting with governors of western US states and fire officials, as the annual North American wildfire season begins.\nThe heat over western parts of Canada and the US has been caused by a dome of static high-pressure hot air stretching from California to the Arctic territories. Temperatures have been easing in coastal areas but there is not much respite for inland regions.\nBefore Sunday, temperatures in Canada had never passed 45C.\nBritish Columbia Premier John Horgan said the hottest week the province had ever experienced had led to \"disastrous consequences for families and for communities\".\nThe number of heat-related fatalities is likely to rise as some areas say they have responded to sudden death incidents but have yet to collate the numbers.\nIn Vancouver alone, heat is believed to have been a contributing factor in the unexpected deaths of 65 people since Friday. \n\"I've been a police officer for 15 years and I've never experienced the volume of sudden deaths that have come in in such a short period of time,\" police sergeant Steve Addison said. Three or four a day is the normal number.\nHe said people were arriving at relatives' homes and \"finding them deceased\".\nDozens of officers have been redeployed in the city, while the increased volume of emergency calls has created a backlog and depleted police resources.\nBritish Columbia Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe said 100 more deaths than normal had been reported in the period from Friday to Monday.\nThe tiny village of Lytton, about 155 miles (250 km) east of Vancouver - and not much further south than London - has recorded all of Canada's recent record highs.\nResident Meghan Fandrich said it had been \"almost impossible\" to go outside.\n\"It's been intolerable,\" she told the Globe & Mail newspaper. \"We're trying to stay indoors as much as possible. We're used to the heat, and it's a dry heat, but 30 [degrees] is a lot different from 47.\"\nMany homes in British Columbia do not have air conditioning as temperatures are usually far milder during the summer months.\nOne Vancouver resident told AFP news agency that hotels seemed to be sold out, as people flocked there for air-conditioning, adding: \"I've never seen anything like this. I hope it never becomes like this ever again.\"\nThe country's weather service, Environment Canada, has issued heat warnings for the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, along with areas of Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories and Manitoba.\nJodi Hughes, weather anchor at Global News Calgary, told the BBC that firefighters were extremely concerned at the possibility of wild fires, possibly sparked by thunderstorms that could occur as the weather pattern changes.\nIn the US Pacific Northwest on Monday, temperatures hit 46.1C in Portland, Oregon, and 42.2C in Seattle, Washington, the highest levels since record-keeping began in the 1940s, the National Weather Service said.\nAt least a dozen deaths in Washington and Oregon are believed to be linked to the heatwave.\nA doctor in a Seattle hospital told the Seattle Times the number of patients streaming in with heat stroke was comparable to the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nDr Jeremy Hess said some had kidney or heart problems, and one man had third-degree burns from walking on asphalt.\nSeattle resident Mark Aldham set up a cooling system in his front yard with free snacks and drinks. \"It is super hot here. So my partner and I, we set up some shade that we have from [Nevada festival] Burning Man to help cool off our neighbourhood and keep everyone safe,\" he told Reuters.\nThe heat has been intense enough to melt cables, shutting down the Portland Streetcar Service on Sunday.\nAn electrical utility in Spokane, Washington, has also introduced rolling blackouts to cope with huge power demand as residents run air conditioners.\nAgricultural workers are often now being given the option to start at dawn and finish at noon. But labour contractors say that some stay on to work regardless of the heat.\nOne worker was found dead in a field at the end of his shift at a farm in Oregon.\nOne Seattle resident told AFP that the city felt like a desert: \"Normally... 60, 70 degrees [Farenheit] is a great day - everybody is outside in shorts and T-shirts - but this is... ridiculous.\"\nAmazon allowed members of the public into areas of its Seattle headquarters as a cooling-off location on Monday, while people in Portland also flocked to cooling centres.\nHave you been affected by the high temperatures?

      "text": "One of British art's most famous paintings, The Blue Boy by Thomas Gainsborough, is to return to the UK 100 years after it left.\nThe 1770 masterpiece will be loaned to the National Gallery, where it will go on display on 25 January 2022.\nThe London gallery's 1922 farewell show for the work attracted 90,000 visitors after it was sold to a US businessman.\nCurrent National Gallery director Dr Gabriele Finaldi said the work showed Gainsborough at \"his dazzling best\".\n\"The loan of Gainsborough's The Blue Boy to the National Gallery is truly exceptional and a unique opportunity for visitors,\" Dr Finaldi added. \n\"Rich in historical resonances, a painting of supreme poise and elegance, The Blue Boy is without doubt a masterpiece of British art.\"\nThe painting, which depicts a young man in a blue satin suit set against a moody country landscape, is thought to be of Jonathan Buttall, the son of a wealthy merchant.\nIt was bought and taken to the US by the railway pioneer Henry Edwards Huntington. Since then, it has been on display at the Huntington Library, Art Museum and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, California.\nBefore The Blue Boy left British soil, the then-National director Charles Holmes wrote \"Au revoir\" on the back of the painting in the hope it would one day return.\nThe painting's popularity and cultural influence have seen it quoted by contemporary artists and depicted in Hollywood films including Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained, in which one of Jamie Foxx's outfits was said to have been inspired by that worn by Gainsborough's young subject.\nThe artwork was also seen in films including 1989's Batman, Joker and The Naked Gun.\nThe Huntington's president Karen R Lawrence said: \"This masterpiece has made an indelible mark on both art history and popular culture, capturing the imaginations of a wide range of audiences. \n\"Given The Blue Boy's iconic status at The Huntington, this is an unprecedented loan, one which we considered very carefully. We hope that this partnership with the National Gallery will spark new conversations, appreciation and research on both sides of the Atlantic.\"\nIn 2018, the Huntington began to restore the painting, with much of the work carried out in public in what was dubbed the Project Blue Boy exhibition. \nDespite the painting's fame, it is acknowledged as being largely inspired by the work of Anthony Van Dyck.\n\"We have to remember that this painting wasn't commissioned, but rather was produced by Gainsborough for the express purpose of showing off his prowess at the Royal Academy exhibition of 1770, where it would be seen next to the work of his rivals,\" Project Blue Boy co-curator Melinda McCurdy told ArtFix Daily in September.\n\"Gainsborough intended it to grab attention, and conservation work has revealed the incredible technical skill he brought to this showpiece.\"\nThe Blue Boy will be on show at the National Gallery, London, from 25 January to 15 May 2022.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Long Covid,Coronavirus vaccines,Leicester,Glasgow,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Middle-aged women experience the most severe, long-lasting symptoms after being treated in hospital for Covid-19, two UK studies suggest. \nFive months on, 70% of patients studied were still affected by everything from anxiety to breathlessness, fatigue, muscle pain and \"brain fog\".\nBut the researchers say there is no obvious link with how ill people originally became.\nHow women's bodies fight off illness could explain their poorer recovery.\nThe larger study - led by the University of Leicester - which is yet to be peer-reviewed, followed up more than 1,000 patients who had been admitted to hospital with Covid-19 in the UK last year. It found that up to 70% had not fully recovered, an average of five months after leaving hospital, with women most affected.\nMore than 400,000 people have been admitted to hospital with Covid in the UK since the start of the pandemic.\nA separate smaller pre-print study, led by University of Glasgow, found women under 50 were seven times more likely to be more breathless, and twice as likely to report worse fatigue than men of the same age who had had the illness, seven months after hospital treatment.\nIn the Leicester study, these lasting 'long Covid' symptoms stopped 18% of people returning to work and forced 19% to change their job.\nDespite patients receiving a range of hospital care - with most given antibiotics, one-third receiving oxygen and just over a quarter ending up in intensive care - even those who had had short hospital stays still had ongoing problems.\nPeople who hadn't returned to normal health were more likely to be female, white, aged between approximately 40 and 60, have two or more underlying conditions, and been on a ventilator.\nDr Rachael Evans, an associate professor at the University of Leicester and respiratory consultant at Leicester's Hospitals, said, \"much of the wide variety of persistent problems was not explained by the severity of the acute illness\" - often characterised by lung damage.\nThis suggests other underlying factors may be at play, she added.\nAnd among women, it was the middle-aged group which appeared to be worst affected by long-term health problems, while younger and older women recovered better.\nStudy author Dr Nazir Lone, consultant in critical care at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, said this could be because \"older age groups are more likely to die\" and so more younger, middle-aged women are more likely to survive with health issues.\nBut he also said it was possible women have \"a different immune response to men\". Men, however, are more likely to be admitted to hospital with Covid in the first place.\nThe PHOSP-Covid study also found that most people with severe, ongoing symptoms five months after leaving hospital had higher than normal levels of a chemical called CRP in their bodies, which is linked to inflammation.\nThis is also present in middle-aged women, who are prone to auto-immune conditions in which the body attacks its own healthy cells and organs. \n\"This may explain why post-Covid syndrome seems to be more prevalent in this group, but further investigation is needed to fully understand the processes,\" said Prof Louise Wain, chair in respiratory research at the University of Leicester. \nThe researchers were also able to identify four different groups or \"clusters\" of people based on their mental and physical health issues after Covid, with one group showing particular problems with \"brain fog\". They tended to be older and male. \n\"The evidence for different recovery 'clusters', and ongoing inflammation, really is important in guiding how we conduct further research into the underlying biological mechanisms that drive long Covid,\" Prof Wain said.\nThe University of Glasgow study, on 327 adults discharged from 31 hospitals across the UK, found women under 50 were five times less likely to say they felt fully recovered from Covid-19 up to seven months later.\nWomen in this age group were also more likely to have a new disability than men of the same age who had also had the illness.\nThese new difficulties often related to memory, mobility, vision and hearing.\nThe study's lead author, Dr Janet Scott, from the University of Glasgow-MRC Centre for Virus Research, said: \"Our research shows that survivors of Covid-19 experienced long-term symptoms, including a new disability, increased breathlessness, and a reduced quality of life. \n\"These findings were present even in young, previously healthy adults under 50, and were most common in younger females.\" \nShe said this could have \"profound implications for pandemic policy decision, as well as vaccination strategy\".\nDr Lone, who was involved in both studies, said it was vital to identify people with ongoing health problems from Covid and get experts such as dieticians, physiotherapists and social workers on board to help provide personalised help and support.

      "tags": "Companies,New York City,Donald Trump,United States",
      "text": "Former US President Donald Trump's company and its finance chief have been charged with tax-related crimes.\nAllen Weisselberg, 73, turned himself in to New York authorities on Thursday. He was later charged with concealing $1.7m (\u00a31.2m) worth of income.\nProsecutors say the 15-year-long scheme helped executives evade taxes by giving benefits, such as rent and school fees, that were hidden from the authorities.\nLawyers for the firm and Mr Weisselberg have pleaded not guilty to tax fraud.\nNo charges were brought against Mr Trump personally, though prosecutors said the former president had signed some of the cheques at the centre of the case. \nThe Trump Organization is a family holding company that owns hotels, golf clubs and other properties - and the cornerstone of a global brand that encompassed book deals, TV shows and Trump-emblazoned skyscrapers.\nThe criminal charges are the first to arise from long-running investigations into alleged fraud by both the Manhattan district attorney and the state attorney general. \nThe inquiry by District Attorney Cyrus Vance focused on whether Mr Weisselberg and other company executives received benefits such as apartment rentals or leased cars without reporting them properly on their tax returns.\nThe charges announced on Thursday include tax fraud and falsifying business records.\nAt the hearing at Manhattan's criminal court, prosecutor Carey Dunne said this was a \"sweeping and audacious\" scheme involving \"off-the-books payments\".\n\"It was orchestrated by the most senior executives who were financially benefiting themselves and the company, by getting secret pay raises at the expense of state and federal taxpayers,\" he said.\nMr Weisselberg \"is prepared to fight these charges in court,\" his lawyers said.\nMr Trump and his allies have said the investigations are politically motivated. The indictment was served as Mr Trump has been discussing a potential comeback run for president in 2024. \nThe ex-president issued a statement slamming the announcement: \"The political witch hunt by the radical left Democrats, with New York now taking over the assignment, continues. \n\"It is dividing our country like never before,\" he said.\nEarlier on Thursday, the Trump Organization said Mr Vance was using Mr Weisselberg, who has worked for Trump's business for nearly 50 years, \"as a pawn in a scorched earth attempt to harm the former president\".\n\"This is not justice; this is politics,\" the company said.\nHowever, during the court proceedings, prosecutor Carey Dunne said: \"To address what this case is not about: It's not about politics.\n\"This investigation, which is ongoing, has been thorough, careful and proper, and has been limited to subject matters within our New York jurisdiction.\" \nIf the company is found guilty, however, certain business partners might draw a line under their relationship with the Trump Organization and the company could face fines.\nNew York City, for example, has already announced it will terminate contracts with the firm to run skating rinks, a carousel and a golf course, in the aftermath of the US Capitol riots.\nDaniel Goldman, who was lead lawyer in the US House of Representatives for the first impeachment of Mr Trump in 2019, tweeted that the indictment could spur lenders to call in their loans, driving the Trump Organization to bankruptcy.\nThe investigations will also take into account eight years of Mr Trump's personal and corporate tax returns, obtained by prosecutors after a long legal battle, which ended in the Supreme Court in February.\nMr Trump, who inherited money from his father and went on to become a property developer, is the first president since Gerald Ford in the 1970s not to have made his tax returns public.\nDespite facing a number of investigations, the former president has denied any wrongdoing personally or in his business.\nNew York City has already cut business ties with the twice-impeached former president."

      "text": "Bill Cosby has been convicted of sexual assault by a Pennsylvania jury. After years of allegations from dozens of women, how did we get to this point?\nMr Cosby was convicted of three counts of aggravated indecent assault against Andrea Constand in a retrial at a courthouse in Pennsylvania.\nBill Cosby is an American comedian and actor best known for his role as the father in the television hit The Cosby Show which ran from 1984-92 and was a huge hit in the US and around the globe. \nAt one point he was the highest-paid actor in the US.\nHe was born on a council estate in Philadelphia and started his career as a stand-up comedian in 1962, debuting on NBC's The Tonight Show in 1963. \nIn 1965, he became the first black actor to star in a drama series in the US, in the espionage show I Spy. He earned three consecutive best actor Emmys for his role, at a time of high race tensions in the US.\nThe Cosby Show was described by TV critics as \"transformational piece of American culture\". He portrayed a doctor called Cliff Huxtable raising five children with his wife. By 1989, he was earning $4m (\u00a32.5m) a month in syndication rights alone.\nIn 2013 he did a national stand-up tour and received rave reviews. After that, several women began to come forward with allegations of sexual assault, some going back nearly 30 years.\nBill Cosby: America's Dad under fire\nHe was on trial for a charge of three counts of felony indecent assault, alleged by a former colleague, Andrea Constand. Cosby has been found guilty on all three counts.\nIt is the only criminal case Cosby has faced thus far related to sexual assault accusations dating back years. \nMs Constand, a former employee of Temple University who now lives in Canada, has said that she came to think of Cosby as a \"mentor and a friend\" before she said he made unwanted sexual advances.\nShe went to visit him at his home in 2004 to discuss her career and her future where she said he drugged and sexually assaulted her.\nA criminal complaint unsealed last year details the encounter.\nShe and Cosby settled a lawsuit in 2006 and she was paid an undisclosed sum.\nProsecutors re-opened her case last summer when they realised the statute of limitations had not run out and after other women had come forward.\nIn other states, he faces defamation lawsuits for branding his accusers liars. Over the years, nearly 60 women have come forward accusing Mr Cosby of sexual assault.\nThirty-five of those women told their stories to New York Magazine in 2015.\nThey alleged he assaulted them in their own homes and even in public.\nIn another case, an accuser named Judy Huth said Cosby molested her when she was 15 years old, forcing her to perform a sexual act on him at the Playboy mansion in Los Angeles.\nCriminal charges were not filed against Cosby because of the statute of limitations. His lawyers called Ms Huth's claims discredited or decades old. \nIn another prominent case, a 25-year-old model named Chloe Goins sued Cosby for a sexual assault at the Playboy Mansion she says happened in 2008.\nShe sought criminal charges but prosecutors decline to pursue them. \nHe maintains the sexual encounters were consensual. \nIn Ms Constand's case, he said she never said no, though she never said yes either. \nA deposition for her case showed that he admitted pursuing sex with younger women and giving them Quaaludes, a sedative.\nHe said he was confident his behaviour was not rape.\nThe New York Times described the deposition as presenting Cosby as \"as an unapologetic, cavalier playboy, someone who used a combination of fame, apparent concern and powerful sedatives in a calculated pursuit of young women\". \nThe first trial failed to reach a verdict in the spring of 2017.\nIn the second trial, the judge allowed more evidence to be admitted, for the defence and the prosecution.\nSo the court heard testimony from four more accusers, evidence not allowed in the first trial, when only Ms Constand's account was heard.\nThat meant the prosecution could establish a pattern of behaviour on the part of the disgraced comedian.\nThere was also new evidence that worked in Cosby's favour. A new defence witness who once worked with Ms Constand had talked about fabricating evidence against a celebrity for financial gain.\nAnd a $3.38m payment that Cosby paid to her in a 2006 settlement - which the defence said showed she was a gold-digger - had not been previously disclosed.\nSince the first trial failed to reach a verdict in early 2017, there has been a slew of cases brought by women alleging sexual assault by high-profile men.\nThe men and women of the jury were asked during selection how much they knew about #MeToo and directed to make their decision based only on the evidence of this case.\nBut it would have been hard to ignore the new climate in which women have felt empowered to make accusations and a prevailing view that complaints no longer be ignored.\nOne of Cosby's accusers, Lili Bernard, said after the verdict: \"The MeToo movement has shown that women are worthy of being believed.\"\nSince the allegations against Cosby first arose several years ago, Cosby's work - including TV shows, films, and stand-up performances - has been pulled from many US networks, including TV Land, Centric, and Bounce TV. \nNetflix and NBC both ended planned projects with Cosby after the assault charges as well.\nIn 2015, he was dropped by his talent agency, CAA.\nStreaming television giant Hulu also eventually dropped The Cosby Show, though at the time they claimed it was unrelated to the rape allegations.\nAs writer and producer Larry Wilmore told the LA Times last year: \"His legacy is forever going to be tarnished.\"\nIn addition to Cosby's erasure on television, he also lost several honorary titles and degrees following the accusations.\nIn 2014, the Navy revoked his honorary title of Chief Petty Officer.\nSeveral US universities revoked Cosby's honorary degrees in the years leading up to the trial, including Brown University, the University of Connecticut, Tufts University, Oberlin College, Marquette University, and Fordham University.\nShortly after Thursday's guilty verdict, Wesleyan University announced they would do the same."

      "text": "People living with long Covid say access to treatment needs to improve amid calls for specialist clinics.\nPaige Christopher, 25, said services were \"disjointed\", with specialists not \"talking to each other\".\nFellow sufferer Sian Griffiths, 42, said the Welsh government's \u00a35m Covid recovery plan puts \"a lot of emphasis\" on GPs, with limited patient time.\nThe Welsh government said its recovery programme would help sufferers as close to home as possible. \nDietician Ms Christopher from Broughton, Flintshire, has been suffering with breathlessness, chest pains and palpitations for the last six months.\nShe has made several trips to A&E after feeling as though she was having a heart attack or a stroke.\nShe said she has not been getting better, and was frustrated about the level of support and attention available.\n\"I was doing exercise classes, I could walk up mountains, I was going cycling, walking, as well as working, rushing around all the time,\" she said. \n\"Now I can barely walk downstairs, and I can't clean, I can't cook, I can't shower or wash my hair by myself.\"\nThere is no medical definition or list of symptoms shared by all patients - two people with long Covid can have very different experiences, according to NHS Wales.\nHowever, the most common feature is crippling fatigue.\nOthers symptoms include breathlessness, a cough that will not go away, joint pain, muscle aches, hearing and eyesight problems, headaches, loss of smell and taste, as well as damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys and gut.\nMental health problems have been reported, including depression, anxiety and struggling to think clearly, termed \"brain fog\" by those experiencing the symptom.\nEarlier this month, Health Minister Eluned Morgan announced a programme to address long Covid, with GPs issued new guidance and diagnostic tools, as well as treatment and rehabilitation \"pathways\".\nBut the campaign group Long Covid Wales said a better approach would be to set up specialist clinics, which it said would be more consistent with expert guidance.\nMs Christopher said the current support required referrals to different specialists.\n\"From head to toe, there's probably about 20 different things wrong with me at the moment,\" she said.\n\"And the GP can't sort any of them out, so he can only refer on.\n\"Four or five referrals sent off to different places, which will be seen at different times.\n\"You just go around in circles. It's just that holistic approach from a specialist that's needed.\"\nShe tested positive for coronavirus in December but it was a mild dose and she felt better quite quickly.\nBut in January she started feeling much worse and she did not make the link with Covid until an A&E doctor suggested it.\nShe is now one of an estimated 50,000 in Wales with varying degrees of long Covid. \nMs Christopher has seen a cardiologist and been given some medication, which has helped with the palpitations.\nBut despite still having serious problems with breathlessness, she has been unable to get a chest scan.\n\"Overall, it just feels like no one's taking it seriously,\" she said.\n\"And it is a really serious problem, I think, for physical and mental health.\"\nPhysiotherapist Sian Griffiths, 42, a member of the Long Covid Wales group, has been suffering for more than a year with heart palpitations, breathlessness and \"brain fog\".\n\"Physically I'm trying to do a little bit of exercise,\" said Ms Griffiths, from Llandegfan on Anglesey.\nShe has paid to see a private consultant in Stoke-on-Trent for treatment.\n\"I'm on some medication to help with the heart rate, but I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel for the brain fog,\" she said.\n\"Why are we putting the burden on to the GP who, to be fair, has 10 minutes with you? \n\"I don't think that's fair on the GPs, and I don't think that's fair on the people suffering with long Covid.\n\"I'm lucky to have a good GP, some people don't have that.\n\"My view is it needs a consultant-led clinic and I think the government needs to talk to people who have had long Covid.\n\"If you have a MDT [multi-disciplinary team] approach in one place, surely that's going to get people seen quicker and, hopefully, on the road to progression, to rehab.\"\nAdrian Thomas, executive director of therapies and health sciences at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, encouraged anyone in north Wales with \"concerns regarding their care to contact us directly\". \nHe said: \"We are following the guidance set by Welsh government and clinical practitioners are working with patients with symptoms of long Covid to co-produce the most appropriate pathway of care.\n\"We also offer support for people with symptoms of long Covid to help them manage their condition as close to home as possible through our community based services. \n\"We have established the first long Covid education programme for patients in the UK.\n\"This is helping patients to self-manage their symptoms and reduce the effect on their lives. \n\"Many patients are also providing positive feedback that they are benefitting from the national Covid-19 Recovery App, which can be downloaded for free.\" \nThe Welsh government said its Recovery-Adferiad programme \"focuses on expanding the diagnosis, rehabilitation and care for people suffering with long Covid to ensure they can access the services they need, as close to home as possible\". \n\"People who require more specialist support, which is only available from hospital-based services will be referred via their GP or healthcare professional,\" said an official.\n\"As we are learning more about long Covid, the programme will be reviewed on a six monthly basis.  \n\"By assessing patients in primary and community care setting, it will ensure that people are only referred to services where there is a clinical need and avoid unnecessary referrals to hospital services which can add to the existing long waits for services.\"\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) said managing long Covid patients was \"beyond the scope and capacity\" of GPs.\nDr Phil White, chairman of the BMA's Welsh GPs committee, said: \"The problem with expecting general practice to manage it all is\u2026 we would have to refer to a cardiologist for heart problems, to a nephrologist for kidney problems and to a chest physician for lung problems. \n\"So if there were in place a multi-disciplinary team that looked at the patient as a whole then this would alleviate many of the problems and the complaints.\n\"With such a complex picture and the increasing workload faced by GPs we want to see a service established outside of general practice to best serve patients.\""

There's a very long list,\" he said.\nIndustry bodies warned construction skills shortages were \"hampering the activities of many small building firms\".\nBrian Berry, chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders (FMB), said he was \"concerned by the year-on-year decline in construction apprenticeships in England\".\nHe said an FMB survey, which received 215 responses from builders, found 38% were struggling to hire bricklayers, and 34% couldn't recruit carpenters. \nA recent report found all jobs vacancies in the UK were soaring but there were not enough workers to fill positions.\nKPMG said the easing of Covid restrictions and reopening of various sectors meant demand for workers rose at its fastest rate in May for more than 23 years, but the number of staff available to fill those jobs declined at the quickest rate since 2017.\nThe hospitality industry has been particularly affected by worker shortages.\nThe Road Haulage Association (RHA) has said HGV driver shortages of more than 100,000 was \"hitting crisis level\" due to a combination of factors, which included increasing supply chain demands.\nIn a letter to the prime minister, the RHA said many of its 60,000 drivers from EU member countries had returned home due to Covid travel restrictions and the \"uncertainty of Brexit\".\n\"The vast majority have not returned, nor are they expected to,\" said chief executive Richard Burnett.\n\"We are not going to solve this now by training drivers and as such need access to EU and EEA labour,\" he said.\nHe called on the government to introduce a temporary worker visa for HGV drivers and for the occupation to be added to the shortage occupation list.\nIn a statement, the government said its \"plan for jobs\" was helping people \"retrain, build new skills and get back into work\".\n\"Employers should invest in our domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad,\" it added. \n\"The Skilled Worker Route of the Points Based System does allow employers to source eligible overseas trade workers in many occupations including bathroom fitters, kitchen installers, fencers, tree surgeons and locksmiths.\""

      "title": "Brexit: NI Protocol is lawful, High Court rules",
      "tags": "NI Brexit,Brexit",
      "text": "The Northern Ireland Protocol is lawful, a High Court judge in Belfast has ruled.\nA group of unionist politicians, including Arlene Foster and Lord Trimble, had challenged the protocol in judicial review proceedings.\nThey claimed it was unlawful because it conflicts with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and the Acts of Union.\nBut Mr Justice Colton rejected their challenge on all grounds on Wednesday afternoon.\nMr Colton found that the Withdrawal Agreement Act, which includes the protocol, does conflict with the 1800 Acts of Union in respect of free trade between Britain and Northern Ireland.\nHowever, he added that the relevant parts of the Acts of Union are \"impliedly repealed\" by the Withdrawal Agreement Act.\nThat means that the more recent legislation automatically overrides the older laws.\nHe said the Acts of Union could not be used to override the \"clear specific will of Parliament\".\nNormally, a constitutional law, like the Acts of Union, can only be expressly repealed, but they can be impliedly by another constitutional law.\nThe judge said the Withdrawal Agreement Act meets the definition of a constitutional law.\nHe also rejected the argument that the protocol had changed the constitutional status as defined in the Good Friday Agreement.\nFurthermore, he found that the secretary of state did have the power to change Stormont's usual cross-community voting mechanism.\nNormally, Stormont must approve controversial issues by a cross-community vote but the protocol will be subject to a straight-majority vote.\nThe judge said the secretary of state had the power to do this on two grounds: that it was necessary to reflect the will of Parliament in implementing the Withdrawal Agreement Act and that it concerns international relations which is not a devolved matter.\nFurther areas of challenge concerning EU law were also rejected.\nThe judge was also critical of an analogy used by the applicants' barrister when he compared the operation of the protocol to the Vichy regime.\nVichy was the collaborationist French administration during the Nazi occupation.\nThe judge said such a comparison was \"unhelpful\".\nAn adjoining case, taken by Belfast pastor Clifford Peeples, was also dismissed by the judge.\nOthers pursuing the lead judicial review case included former Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken, TUV leader Jim Allister, former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib and Baroness Hoey. \nWednesday's judgement is likely to be appealed and the case could ultimately be heard by the Supreme Court before the end of 2021.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the government would \"study in detail\" the High Court ruling, after being asked about it during Prime Minister's Questions. \nDUP MP Ian Paisley asked if the government would \"reverse the mistakes of the Northern Ireland Protocol, seize the moment, defend the union to unilaterally fix and put Northern Ireland out of its commercial, social and economic misery\".\nMr Johnson said: \"Nothing will affect the position of Northern Ireland as part of the UK - we will make sure we uphold that.\"\nAlliance MP Stephen Farry also urged the prime minister to accept the ruling as a \"watershed where we can stop talking about the protocol in constitutional and identity terms\".\nThe prime minister replied that the \"best thing\" the EU could do was remove all the problems associated with the protocol's application.\n\"I hope all that can be fixed indeed and then we can move on,\" he added. \nDUP leader designate Sir Jeffrey Donaldson described the ruling as \"politically significant\" and would have potential consequences for \"the future stability of political institutions\".\nIn a tweet, he said the judgement confirmed the \"protocol damages our constitutional position in the UK contrary to the principle of consent and various agreements\".\nUlster Unionist MLA Steve Aiken said his party acknowledged the decision, but said it is \"an issue of such magnitude that it needs to be appealed to a higher court\".\nSpeaking at a press conference in Belfast following the judgement, Mr Habib said: \"The only positive you might put on it is we do now officially know that the union of the United Kingdom has been trampled on by the protocol.\"\nMr Habib said the prime minister now \"has to face up to the reality that his own judicial system has said that the union of the United Kingdom has been broken\".\nFormer Labour MP Kate Hoey - now Baroness Hoey - said it must be \"absolutely clear that this is only the beginning of the legal challenge and also of peoples' protests against what has been done to us without consent\".\nTUV leader Jim Allister said the court ruling \"confirmed the protocol is dismantling the union\".\nMr Allister said the ruling \"underscores the necessity to step up the political battle against the protocol\".\nHe said the UK government must \"now reverse the mistake of repeal, if the PM's words mean anything\".\n\"No more propping up the Belfast Agreement institutions while the protocol manoeuvres us out of the union,\" he added.\nSinn F\u00e9in MLA Declan Kearney said \"there is no credible alternative to the protocol\". \n\"It's ironic that the Tory/DUP cheerleaders of Brexit are now so opposed to the protocol that was made necessary by their reckless pursuit of a hard Brexit,\" he said."

      "text": "\"We are afraid, because they haven't told us how long we are going to be trapped here,\" says 17-year-old Luc\u00eda, adding: \"We were moved without our parents' consent.\"\nShe is among around 200 Spanish students being held under police guard at the Palma Bellver hotel in Majorca, in Spain's Balearic Islands, after an outbreak of more than 1,000 cases of Covid-19 were linked to end-of-year trips by celebrating school students.\nLast week, several students attempted to leave the island, but most were stopped by police at the airport and taken to the hotel for quarantine.\nThree managed to make it back to the mainland and authorities have issued search warrants for their detention, local media report.\nPolice are now monitoring the four-star Palma Bellver hotel with 24-hour surveillance. Balearic Islands public prosecutors have said they are opposed to keeping the students confined to the hotel. \nStudents have been protesting from their balconies and expressing their frustration on social media using the hashtag #secuestrogobiernobalear - which means Balearic government kidnapping.\nInfections linked to the Majorca outbreak account for about 5% of new cases recorded in the past week, the head of Spain's public health body said on Tuesday. \nLuc\u00eda's trip to Majorca was organised with friends last October as a celebration after completing their senior year of school. \n\"At first they told us if we declined to go [to the Palma Bellver hotel] they would sue us,\" Luc\u00eda, who is from C\u00e1diz in the south-west, has told the BBC. \"They were basically forcing us.\" \nNobody in her school group has yet tested positive for Covid, she maintains, and yet they are not allowed to leave their rooms under any circumstances.\nShe also complains they are at risk of being exposed to others isolating in the same hotel who had tested positive.\nSince being forced to isolate she describes being \"threatened, insulted, and harassed\" by people on social media telling her they should not have gone to Majorca in the first place.\nThe majority of the students held at the Palma Bellver are from the southern Andaluc\u00eda region, although several are from Madrid. \nThe Madrid region has reported more than 400 cases linked to the return of students on end-of-year trips, while 172 have been recorded in the Basque Country and Valencia in the east has reported 104.\nDaniel, a student aged 18, arrived on the island on 22 June from his home town of C\u00f3rdoba in southern Spain. \nHe says he feels anxious about being held at the hotel under police guard despite twice testing negative for coronavirus. \n\"I don't know what is going to happen,\" he says. He was among several students who complained to the BBC about the police presence, saying he felt intimidated every time he opened his hotel room door to make a request. \nHe was worried that for some people with health conditions access to treatment was proving difficult.\n\"A person on my floor who is asthmatic and was considered at risk wasn't allowed to go to the hospital after waiting six hours for an ambulance to pick him up.\"\nNeither the Palma Bellver hotel nor Majorca health authorities have yet responded to BBC requests for comment. However, Balearic Islands Health Minister Patricia G\u00f3mez has insisted they are acting to protect local citizens, by detecting positive cases to \"break the chain of infection\". So far 26.1% of young people in quarantine had tested positive in PCR tests and 12 were admitted to hospital with mild symptoms, she said on Monday.\nAnother student from C\u00f3rdoba, 17-year-old Marina, had been staying with a group at a different hotel on 25 June when they were told to gather their belongings at short notice before being transferred to the Palma Bellver.\n\"We were told there was someone who had tested positive in our hotel,\" she says. As she had tested negative for Covid she could not understand the need to remain in isolation.\n\"It is likely that we will have to remain here until 7 July,\" she says. \"We miss our families very much and they are very confused because they haven't been told what is really happening.\"\nIgnacio, 18, says that while the hotel rooms were comfortable enough, staying in quarantine is depressing.\n\"Most of us are isolated individually, which means we won't be able to speak face-to-face with anyone for the next 10 days.\" \nStudents are not being given enough information, he complains: \"We are unsure about how long we will stay here.\"\nSpain's Balearic Islands are among the places recently added to the UK's green travel list, meaning that from 30 June British travellers with a negative test result will not have to quarantine on arrival."

      "text": "The \"serious and potentially debilitating\" impact of long Covid on health is being recognised in Wales, the new health minister has said.\nEluned Morgan said she was putting a \u00a35m recovery programme in place to help patients living with the condition.\nGPs will be issued with new guidance and diagnostic tools, with treatment and rehabilitation \"pathways\".\nMs Morgan said she wanted to ensure people could get specialist hospital treatment, if needed.\n\"It's about making sure there is clear guidance at GP level to make sure they understand what's going on,\" she said.\n\"There will be pathway for more serious and complex cases - when they access hospital care that there's an understanding complex cases will be dealt with in a wholehearted way - taking into account the different issues. \n\"Because that's part of the problem - everybody suffers from long Covid in a slightly different way.\"\nThere is no medical definition or list of symptoms shared by all patients - two people with long Covid can have very different experiences, according to NHS Wales.\nHowever, the most common feature is crippling fatigue.\nOthers symptoms include breathlessness, a cough that will not go away, joint pain, muscle aches, hearing and eyesight problems, headaches, loss of smell and taste as well as damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys and gut.\nMental health problems have been reported, including depression, anxiety and struggling to think clearly.\nBut the programme being announced on Tuesday does not commit the Welsh government to establishing specialist central long Covid centres or hubs, as in England, despite calls to implement the measure.\nMs Morgan said the approach in Wales was based on the principle of helping people \"as close to home\" as possible.\n\"That's why it's critical we make that support available in GP surgeries and we've given huge support to online provision to allow people to self-support,\" she added.\nThe recovery programme will be reviewed every six months, to take into account the latest global research on what is a new, but potentially very serious condition.\nGrandmother Helen James already had underlying health worries when she caught Covid, not just once, but twice.\nBoth times she was ill for about four weeks, and developed pneumonia both times.\nShe was left \"fighting for every breath\".\nHelen, from Pontypool in Torfaen, now has extensive scarring on her lungs and needs to use steroid inhalers and other drugs.\nKidney issues she had under control before Covid now need a new regime of medicines.\n\"Fatigue is the biggest issue because it stops you living your life,\" she said.\n\"You know I couldn't ever plan anything. Sometimes I have to just stay in bed.\"\nSome days, she said she did not \"have the strength to even get to the bathroom, or even to have a shower\".\nHelen called for a \"joined up\" consultant-led approach for long Covid patients, and has told the minister personally in a meeting.\n\"I'm fighting this to the end. I'm not giving up,\" she added.\nHundreds of thousands of people in Wales have had Covid-19 and research suggests as many as 10% might experience longer-term effects.\nIn May, the Office for National Statistics estimated that one million people across the UK living in private households had self-reported long Covid, with symptoms that have lasted more than four weeks after the initial infection.\nThis included 50,000 people in Wales.\nThe new recovery programme has been welcomed by the Royal College of GPs in Wales.\nJoint chairman Prof Peter Saul said: \"The condition has required us all to learn and adapt quickly to support our patients.\n\"Primary care is at the forefront of long Covid care and this announcement will provide confidence that we will have the infrastructure, shared knowledge and data for GPs and their teams across Wales to respond to patients' needs.\""

      "text": "Long-awaited plans to extend opening times for pubs and nightclubs in Northern Ireland have passed their final hurdle at Stormont.\nThe changes will allow pubs and clubs to serve alcohol for an extra hour, until 02:00, almost every weekend.\nEaster drinking restrictions have also been removed, with the changes backed by assembly members (MLAs) after a debate in the assembly.\nMost of the changes will take effect from 1 October 2021.\nThe 1 October date will allow the hospitality industry to avail of extended opening times ahead of the Christmas period.\nOther measures will come into force from 6 April 2022 in time for next Easter. \nIt marks a significant liberalisation of Northern Ireland's laws on alcohol that has been in the making for nine years.\nA previous bill to change Northern Ireland's licensing laws began its legislative passage in 2016, but the assembly collapsed in January 2017 amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in, who share power together at Stormont.\nMeanwhile, a full statutory review of licensing laws in Northern Ireland will also be held following an amendment to the licensing bill secured by SDLP assembly member (MLA) Matthew O'Toole on Tuesday afternoon.\nThe amendment means the Department for Communities must begin an independent review within the next year, including an investigation of how the so-called \"surrender principle\" affects the industry. \nThe principle means no new licence can be granted unless another one is surrendered.\nLicences for selling alcohol on and off premises are also convertible in court, which means that every supermarket or convenience store seeking to add an off sales needs to acquire a licence from somewhere else.\nMr O'Toole said the review would be a \"first step toward reforming the system here so that it works for everyone\".\nCommunities Minister Deirdre Hargey said she believed it was a \"a balanced piece of legislation\".\nShe told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme there was a need \"to modernise in 2021\".\n\"I want to make sure we do this in a balanced way, lifting some of the current restrictions, which are archaic, but also be mindful in terms of the health and safety impacts,\" she said.\nCinemas will also be permitted for the first time in Northern Ireland to apply for a licence to sell alcohol to customers. \nIt will bring the rules in Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland.\nMichael McAdam of the cinema chain Movie House said it was a positive step.\n\"I think it will add to people's overall experience,\" he said.\n\"I don't envisage massive sales but it's about giving people choice and that's the good thing about this legislation.\"\nOther changes in the bill include the extension in \"drinking-up time\" from half an hour to an hour, meaning venues can operate until 03:00 at weekends.\nThe law will also be tightened in some areas - supermarkets will face restrictions on where they can place in-store advertising for alcohol.\nThe current voluntary code of practice for drinks promotions will be replaced with legal requirements.\nThe changes will also enable local drinks producers to sell their products directly to the public in limited circumstances, make changes to the law affecting registered private clubs and allow changes to permitted hours at major events.

      "text": "The US National Security Agency (NSA) has hit back at allegations by Fox News host Tucker Carlson that it is spying on him to force him off air. \nOn Monday Carlson, a long-time critic of President Joe Biden, said a government whistle-blower had told him the NSA was monitoring him for \"political reasons\".\nThe NSA denied he was a \"target\", saying it deals with foreign threats. \nFox News has not commented publicly on its host's claim.\nIn response to a question about Carlson's comments, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said the NSA \"focuses on foreign threats and individuals who are attempting to do us harm on foreign soil\".\n\"Beyond that I would point you to the intelligence community,\" she added.\nThe NSA, together with the Central Security Service, is responsible for intercepting and protecting electronic communications on behalf of the US government, and has a broad cyber security remit.\nDuring a segment of Tucker Carlson Tonight - one of America's most popular programmes - Carlson said he was convinced by the alleged whistle-blower because they had information about an ongoing story \"that could have only come directly from my texts and emails\".\nHe accused the agency of \"planning to leak them in an attempt to take this show off the air\", and said Fox News had filed a freedom of information request \"for all information that the NSA and other agencies have gathered about this show\".\nThe NSA issued its own response on Twitter. \n\"With limited exceptions (e.g. an emergency), NSA may not target a US citizen without a court order that explicitly authorizes the targeting,\" it said.\nBut on his show on Tuesday, Carlson said this was \"infuriatingly dishonest\" and attacked the White House for failing to issue a denial.\nHe recalled several unsuccessful attempts to speak on the phone with the NSA's director, General Paul Nakasone, who he said was \"highly political\" and \"left-wing\".\nGen Nakasone was appointed by Republican President Donald Trump in 2018.\n\"Did the Biden administration read my emails? NSA officials refuse to say,\" said Carlson. \"In a very heated follow-up conversation 20 minutes ago, they refused even to explain why they won't answer that simple question.\"\nThe NSA's work came under scrutiny in recent years after its surveillance of US telephone records was exposed by former contractor Edward Snowden in 2013. Last year, the US Court of Appeals ruled that the programme was illegal.\nCarlson has also come under the spotlight. Earlier this year, senior US military leaders condemned him for criticising measures to support women in the armed forces.\nThe Fox show host was also criticised in 2019 after audio recordings emerged of him defending child marriage and making sexual comments about underage girls."
