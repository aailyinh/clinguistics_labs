      "text": "The Duke of Sussex is to become chief impact officer at the US coaching and mental health firm, BetterUp.\nPrince Harry said in a statement that he was \"really excited\" about taking on the new role. His exact duties, hours and any payment are not clear.\nIt is his latest job move after he and the Duchess of Sussex stepped back as senior royals in March last year.\nIt also comes after the duke and Meghan gave an explosive interview to Oprah Winfrey earlier this month.\nIn it, the couple alleged an unnamed royal family member had asked about how dark their son Archie's skin might be, before he was born.\nBuckingham Palace has said the claim is \"concerning\", but it will be addressed privately. Earlier this week, Buckingham Palace said a diversity review was under way across all royal households.\nIn his statement, Prince Harry said his goal in his new function would be to \"lift up critical dialogues around mental health, build supportive and compassionate communities, and foster an environment for honest and vulnerable conversations\".\nPrince Harry will not manage employees or have people report directly to him, but he is likely to spend some time in the company's San Francisco headquarters once it is safe to do so, BetterUp CEO Alexi Robichaux told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). \nIn his role as the company's first chief impact officer, Prince Harry is expected to have input into initiatives including product strategy decisions and charitable contributions, and advocate publicly on topics related to mental health, the WSJ reports.\nPrince Harry said that when he met Mr Robichaux, they \"instantly recognised a shared passion for helping others realise their full potential\".\nThe chief impact officer position is relatively rare in the corporate world, notes the WSJ - it is seen more commonly in non-profit organisations such as Amnesty International.\nBetterUp, which was founded in 2013, provides mobile-based professional coaching, counselling and mentorship.\nThe firm says it has some 2,000 coaches offering services in 49 languages in 66 countries.\nPrince Harry has previously launched initiatives such as the Invictus Games, which aim for members of the armed forces to use sport for psychological and physical rehabilitation. He has also advocated publicly on mental health issues.\nPrince Harry and Meghan now live in California after confirming in January that they would step back as \"senior\" royals and work to become financially independent.\nThey announced last year that they had reached a deal with streaming giant Netflix to make a range of programmes, some of which they may appear in, as well as striking a deal with music streaming service Spotify."

      "tags": "Asia,Coronavirus vaccines,India,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "India has placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, foreign ministry sources have told the BBC.\nThey said rising cases meant domestic demand was expected to pick up in the coming weeks, and so the doses were needed for India's own rollout.\nThe move - described as a \"temporary squeeze\" by officials - is expected to affect supplies until the end of April.\nSome 190 countries under the Covax scheme are likely to be affected.\nThe scheme, which is led by the World Health Organization (WHO), aims to ensure vaccines are shared fairly among all nations.\nIndia's largest vaccine manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India (SII), has delayed shipments of the AstraZeneca jab to several countries in recent days, including the UK and Brazil. \nIndia has exported more than 60 million vaccine doses to 76 countries so far, with the majority of these being the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\nThe decision comes as India faces a surge in coronavirus cases. On Wednesday it recorded its sharpest daily rise this year, with more than 47,000 new cases and 275 deaths.\nIt is opening up vaccinations for those over the age of 45 from 1 April, and officials expect demand for vaccinations to increase.\n\"[The export hold] is a temporary measure. Domestic demand will have to take precedence,\" one foreign ministry source told the BBC's Soutik Biswas.\nThey said there was likely to be a squeeze on vaccine supplies until April, but the situation could ease come May when at least one additional vaccine is expected to be given emergency approval.\nThere have been no exports from India since Thursday, according to the foreign ministry's website.\n\"Everything else has taken a backseat, for the time being at least,\" one source at the ministry told Reuters news agency. \"No exports, nothing [until] the India situation stabilises.\"\nThere has been no official comment from the government or the SII on the decision.\nThe SII - the world's largest vaccine manufacturer - has already delayed shipments of the AstraZeneca jab to the UK, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Morocco.\nLast week, the BBC reported that a delivery of five million doses had been held up by four weeks.\n\"We will try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunisation programme in India,\" an SII spokesperson said at the time.\nThe SII has said it will produce one billion doses this year for low- and middle-income countries.\nAnd in January, it said it could turn out between 60 and 70 million vaccine doses a month. This figure included the AstraZeneca vaccine as well as the US-developed Novavax jab, which is not yet licensed for use in India.\nThat month, the SII also told the BBC that it was aiming to boost its monthly production to 100 million doses from March. However, a recent check revealed production was still at 60 to 70 million doses and had not increased.\nThe Indian government began its vaccination programme on 16 January, and so far has inoculated over 47 million people amid fears of a possible second wave.\nThe authorities are hoping to administer 600 million doses within seven months - about 85 million doses a month."

Some experts, however, said that the choice of location was misguided.\nAt the chancellor's recent Budget, emphasis was also placed on investment in the life sciences, clean energy and technology industries. \nMr Sunak announced the creation of a national infrastructure bank that would mainly invest in green projects ahead of the COP26 climate change summit in the UK later in November."

      "text": "Fourteen people have been arrested at a second night of protests in Bristol, police have said. \nOn Tuesday about 130 people demonstrating against the government's new Police and Crime Bill gathered at College Green.\nIt comes two days after another protest in the city turned violent, injuring several police officers. \nOne witness said the police had been \"quite heavy-handed\", which was \"shocking to see\".\nAvon and Somerset Police said the gathering had \"the making of a rave or a party rather than a protest\" and that it had to act due to lockdown restrictions.\nOne of those arrested was in connection with the disorder on Sunday, while others were arrested for offences including breaches of Covid-19 legislation and obstruction of a highway.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said there was \"no acceptability\" for \"criminality and thuggish behaviour\".\n\"Protests are unlawful right now and quite frankly we have just seen more criminality and violent behaviour, which is simply unacceptable,\" Ms Patel said.\n\"We live in a democracy and obviously we uphold the right to protest but we're in the pandemic and I would urge people to continue to follow the rules and guidance.\"\nThere were between 200 and 250 people at the peak of the protest on Tuesday afternoon, which had been peaceful, with some of those intending to sleep in tents overnight.\nProtesters said they were unhappy about an element of the Police and Crime Bill, which would ban residing on any private or public land in vehicles without permission where they are causing \"significant disruption, distress or harm to local communities\".\nJournalist Martin Booth, who attended the protest for the Bristol 24/7 website, said he believed police had been \"quite heavy-handed\" against protesters. \n\"Some of them were sitting down as the police waded in and it was quite shocking to see,\" he said. \n\"These protesters may have been there against the law but they were not spoiling for any fight, from my perspective.\"\nBut, the force said, like on Sunday, it only took action after dark when people ignored instructions to leave.  \nCh Supt Claire Armes said: \"We will always attract opposing and differing views in these situations but we have successfully cleared the area and minimised any disruption to the city of Bristol.\"\nEarlier, she said protesters had \"insulted\" Bristol's communities, who \"have made too many sacrifices and worked so hard\" to defeat coronavirus. \nAvon and Somerset Police Chief Constable Andy Marsh said: \"It had the making of a rave or a party rather than a protest...we would be having a very different conversation if we had allowed 200 people to set-up a camp on college green with music, food stalls, and human excrement.\n\"We have a duty to uphold the law and stop the risk of a third wave.\" \nOfficers from British Transport Police, Devon and Cornwall, Dorset, Dyfed Powys, Gloucestershire, Gwent and Wiltshire forces were drafted in to help.\nIn a tweet, police said officers had attempted to engage with demonstrators earlier in the evening and asked them to move on.\n\"It's disappointing we needed to take this action on a day we remember those who've lost their lives,\" the force said earlier, referring to the anniversary of the first national lockdown. \nAndrew Plant, BBC Points West \nIt's the second time in three days that we've seen riot police on the streets of Bristol. \nSunday felt very hostile - this didn't. There were lots of things being thrown on Sunday - bottles flying over people's heads and riot police were really under attack. \nThis, the police had under control by going in quite hard, I think it's fair to say. \nThey said they've done that because these gatherings under Covid law are illegal so they felt they need to move people on.\nThey had asked people earlier in the day to leave and disperse and when those people didn't engage, this happened. \nBut it wasn't Sunday, it was very different.\nThe national chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales said his colleagues in the city felt \"under siege\".\nJohn Apter said: \"I really feel for my colleagues in Bristol. There is a sense that you really feel under siege. And for some, whatever they [police officers] do, is not enough and for others, it's too much.\n\"My colleagues are battered and bruised, in some cases physically. We've got a number of officers who were injured on Sunday evening, some very seriously. \n\"This is completely unacceptable.\"\nShortly before 23:00 GMT, police said protesters had been moved off College Green but that a \"significant number\" remained on Deanery Road \"and continue to refuse to leave the area\".\nThe force tweeted: \"Officers will take proportionate action to disperse crowds. They are not containing anyone and we continue to urge people to move on.\"\nA YouTube livestream appearing to be from the demonstration showed large numbers of police with some officers on horseback and others with dogs lined up.\nShouts of \"our streets\" and \"shame on you\" could be heard.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Avon and Somerset Police released images of 10 people it wants to trace over Sunday's disorder.\nIt has since arrested a total of nine people in relation to that day's events and said it was investigating assaults on 40 police officers and one journalist. \nCh Supt Carolyn Belafonte said the investigation will be \"substantial\" and \"has the potential to be one of the largest\" in the force's history.\nFollowing medical assessments on two officers taken to hospital at the weekend, neither suffered broken bones. \nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Companies,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Retailing,Shopping,John Lewis,Aberdeen,UK High Streets",
      "text": "John Lewis has said it will not reopen eight of its stores once lockdown eases, putting 1,465 jobs at risk.\nThe retail giant said some locations could not sustain a large store.\nFour \"At Home\" shops in Ashford, Tunbridge Wells, Basingstoke, and Chester will close - as well as department stores in Aberdeen, Peterborough, Sheffield and York.\nJohn Lewis said the eight shops were \"financially challenged prior to the pandemic\". \nEarlier this month, the retailer warned it would be making more store closures after the impact of the pandemic led it to report a hefty annual loss.\nThe latest move comes on top of the closure of eight stores that John Lewis announced last year. The chain has now axed around a third of its stores in less than a year.\nFor almost 40 years the John Lewis store in Peterborough has been the flagship of the city's shopping centre, but along with seven other branches it looks sets to close.\nShopper James Morrell says he usually goes to John Lewis to look at the \"tech\" and says it will be a shame to not see it reopen after lockdown.\n\"This is pretty much all we've got in Peterborough really, it's our main selling point,\" he says.\nBut he says it \"might be nice for little independent shops to come along and take up the space\".\nRead more here.\nThe company said it planned to create more places to shop for John Lewis products across the UK. It suggested it would not entirely move out of areas where the main store was closing.\n\"In areas where we propose not to reopen stores, we will look at the right combination of options for that location to ensure we remain convenient for our customers, so they can continue to access John Lewis products and services.\" \nIt added it would invest in improving click-and-collect in its Waitrose stores and offer more local collection points through third parties. It also will continue experimenting with John Lewis shopping areas in Waitrose stores, as well as trying out smaller, local neighbourhood shops.\nJohn Lewis said 34 stores would start reopening from 12 April, subject to government guidance, with the exception of Glasgow, which will reopen from 26 April, and Edinburgh, which will reopen on 14 May. \nThe company said it would \"enter into consultation with the 1,465 affected partners\" about the proposals. \nShould it proceed, it said it would make \"every effort\" to find alternative roles for as many as possible.\nJohn Lewis has a unique structure in that its staff are also partners in the business, and receive a share in the profits in good years. \nIt said the stores that were closing were in locations where it did not have enough customers. \"Given the significant shift to online shopping in recent years - and our belief that this trend will not materially reverse - we do not think the performance of these eight stores can be substantially improved.\"\nAndrew worked at the John Lewis store in Birmingham for five years before being made redundant last year.\nHe has worked in the retail industry for 20 years.\n\"I'm not surprised by today's announcement,\" he said. \"While it's true that customer shopping habits have changed, I believe the partnership was in the middle of an identity crisis before the pandemic.\"\nMr Taylor said the company has \"struggled to adapt and needs to work on diversity and inclusion as a business to reflect modern-day Britain.\" \nDan Jarvis, the mayor for Sheffield, said losing the store in Sheffield would be a heavy blow to the area. \n\"The store has been a cornerstone of the city's retail offer for more than a century,\" he said. \"I am working with John Lewis and Sheffield City Council to determine what this means for those whose jobs are now on the line and what can be done to support them.\"\nJohn Lewis has now axed around a third of its stores in less than a year. It wasn't all that long ago that the chain was opening stores. In 2007, it had 26 when it decided to embark on an aggressive expansion plan, almost doubling the number of stores in a decade, even though internet sales were starting to climb.\nThis is now a painful correction. Of the 23 department stores it went on to open, only 12 will still be trading when lockdown ends. Its Birmingham store was the most high-profile casualty last year. The company is also reining back on its smaller \"John Lewis at home\" stores. Only four of the original 12 remain. But it's also losing some older main department stores in regional cities, which will have a huge impact.\nJohn Lewis has been a presence in Sheffield for some 80 years, for instance. The business insists that as the High Street changes, it has to change with it, reflecting changing shopping habits. It expects 70% of its sales to be online by 2025.\nJohn Lewis is betting on fewer bigger \"destination\" shops as well as relying far less on retail in the future for its overall profits - from expanding financial services to using excess space for housing.\nSome bold decisions are being made across retail given the turmoil over the past 12 months, but the question is whether John Lewis can pull off its turnaround plan without losing its competitive edge.\nJohn Lewis said it expects from 60-70% of John Lewis sales to be made online in the future. Nearly 50% of its customers have been using a combination of store and online when making their purchases.\nDespite the expected further shift to online, John Lewis said that stores were essential to its business, as people still wanted physical proximity: \"They provide a sensory experience that online cannot, supported by the expertise of our partners.\"\nThe pandemic caused the chain's first ever annual loss of \u00a3517m for the year to January, against profits of \u00a3146m the previous year. At the time of that announcement earlier this month, the firm said it would reshape its business in response to the change in customer shopping habits.\nMuch of that loss was due to a write down in the value of its stores because of the shift to online shopping, as well as restructuring and redundancy costs."

      "text": "The UK could send asylum seekers abroad while their applications are processed, under plans considered by ministers. \nThe idea is expected to be included in a policy paper next week, as part of a wider shake-up of asylum rules after Brexit.\nThe plan is reportedly being considered to deter migrants from crossing the English Channel.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel has previously called the current system \"fundamentally broken\". \nMore than 650 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far during 2021, double the number during the same period in 2020.\nThe plans have prompted criticism from charities and opposition parties - with Labour calling the idea \"absurd\". \nThe Times has reported ministers are set to consult on plans to change the law to allow for asylum seekers to be sent to processing centres abroad.\nThe newspaper said officials have considered Gibraltar as a possible venue - prompting the British Overseas Territory to write to the UK to seek clarity. \nIn a letter to Ms Patel, its chief minister Fabian Picardo said \"this issue has not been raised with me at any level\".\nSpeaking on Thursday, he told BBC News he had \"very serious concerns\" over the idea, which he dismissed as \"entirely unviable\". \nSelf-governing Crown Dependency the Isle of Man, also named as a possible site, said it had also not been contacted by the UK government. \nAsked on Thursday whether he felt comfortable with sending asylum seekers abroad, Boris Johnson replied: \"The objective here is to save life and avert human misery.\"\nSpeaking at the Downing Street briefing, the prime minister said that people crossing the Channel were \"being conned\" into risking their lives.\n\"The objective is a humanitarian one and a humane one, which is to stop the abuse of these people by a bunch of traffickers and gangsters,\" he added. \nAccording to the Daily Mail, the proposals could see migrants arriving in the UK from countries deemed safe barred from making an asylum claim. \nDetailed proposals are expected as part of legislation to reshape the UK's post-Brexit asylum rules, expected later this spring. \nThe UK is no longer bound by the EU's Dublin regulation, under which it could transfer asylum seekers to countries in the bloc to have their applications processed.\nThe government has long criticised this EU law and has said it wants to negotiate new agreements to replace it. \nPlans to send people abroad are likely to face stern opposition from charities, as well as promoting legal challenges on rights grounds.\nBritish Red Cross, which provides support to people seeking asylum, said \"offshoring\" asylum claims would \"do nothing to address the reasons people take dangerous journeys in the first place\".\nIts Chief Executive Mike Adamson added the move would \"almost certainly have grave humanitarian consequences\".\nLabour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the \"absurd\" idea demonstrated the government had \"lost control and all sense of compassion\".\nLiberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael described the plans as \"unworkable and inhumane\".\nHe said the \"dysfunctional\" Home Office should instead concentrate on clearing the backlog of asylum seekers waiting more than six months for a decision on their claim.\nMany of the migrants crossing the Channel claim asylum once they arrive in the UK. Asylum seekers hope to receive refugee status, meaning they can stay.\nTo be eligible, they must prove they cannot return to their home country because they fear persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or \"anything else that puts you at risk because of the social, cultural, religious or political situation in your country, for example gender, gender identity or sexual orientation\" the government website says. \nLast year the government considered an asylum processing centre on Ascension Island, a UK territory in the Atlantic Ocean - before deciding not to proceed. \nThe European Union itself has previously explored setting up \"disembarkation platforms\" in North Africa to screen asylum applications. \nAustralia has used offshore processing and detention centres for asylum seekers who reach the country by boat since the 1980s.\nThe centres, based on the Pacific island nation of Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, have been criticised by rights groups."

      "text": "Parts of the UK's skyline have been lit up in remembrance of those who have lost their lives in the pandemic.\nOne year on from the start of the first lockdown, candles have been lit on doorsteps around the country and major landmarks illuminated in yellow.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the country had been through a year-long \"epic of endurance and privation\".\nBut \"step by step, jab by jab\", the nation was on the path to \"reclaiming our freedoms\", he told a news briefing.\nSpeaking a year after tough Covid restrictions were introduced in March 2020, Mr Johnson thanked people for their \"courage, discipline and patience\".\nEarlier a minute's silence was held with parliaments across the UK pausing.\nSome of the country's most famous landmarks including the London Eye, Wembley Stadium and Cardiff Castle were lit up in yellow after dark, while people shone lights from their doorsteps to signify a \"beacon of remembrance\" at 20:00 GMT.\nOther notable buildings taking part include Cardiff Castle and Belfast City Hall, while churches and cathedrals tolled bells, lit thousands of candles and offered prayers.\nMr Johnson told a Downing Street briefing that \"at the right moment\" a permanent memorial to those who had died from coronavirus would be built, and that the whole period would be commemorated.\nHe also praised the heroes of the past year, including NHS and social care staff, shop and transport workers, the police and armed forces.\nIt comes as a further 112 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total by this measure to 126,284, while a further 5,379 people tested positive for Covid, according to the latest government data.\nThe prime minister said the pandemic would be something he would remember for the rest of his life and described it as a \"deeply difficult and distressing period\" in history.\n\"For month after month, our collective fight against coronavirus was like fighting in the dark against a callous and invisible enemy - until science helped us to turn the lights on and gain the upper hand,\" he said. \nMr Johnson said the government was on track to meet its target of offering a first dose of vaccine to every adult by the end of July. \nBut he warned the country must be \"very wary\" of a potential third wave, saying there were \"distinct signs\" of one in Europe.\nThe prime minister said he hoped to be able to say more on travelling abroad from England on 5 April - a week earlier than a taskforce into the issue had been scheduled to report back.\nEngland's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty warned there would be \"bumps and twists on the road\", possibly including the emergence of more new variants.\nHowever, he said a \"wall of vaccinated people\" would significantly reduce the ratio between the number of cases and the resulting death toll.\nAs of Monday, more than 28.3 million people have received a first vaccine dose, with more than 2.3 million having had a second shot.\nDeaths in the UK have fallen below the five-year average for the first time since the summer, with experts putting the drop down to the end of the winter wave of Covid deaths, lockdown and the vaccine rollout.\nThe vaccination programme is going well, but once again we are being reminded of the threat of a third wave.\nBoth the prime ministers and his senior advisers made reference to it.\nWith restrictions lifting, cases are likely to go up - although there is hope the change in seasons will help limit those rises.\nOver half of people are vaccinated, but that still leaves many millions susceptible.\nSome will be in the vulnerable groups - either because they have chosen not to take up the vaccine or because it has not worked.\nThat means people will still die just as they do from flu each year.\nIn a bad winter, there can be more than 20,000 flu deaths. \nModelling suggests that with the vaccine rollout and a careful lifting of restrictions there could be 30,000 Covid deaths by summer 2022.\nBut the government's advisers made clear there really is no other option, saying there is \"close to zero chance\" of zero Covid for a virus that spreads so easily, often undetected because so many do not even develop symptoms.\nThe challenge now is managing that risk.\nAsked what he wished he had done differently over the past year, Mr Johnson said the \"biggest false assumption\" during the early part of the pandemic was over asymptomatic transmission, which led to \"real problems that we then had to work very, very hard to make up the ground\". \nHe added that no \"previous government\" had envisioned such a novel disease, while chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said having adequate testing at the beginning of the pandemic would have made a \"big difference\".\n16 March 2020: The public are told to avoid non-essential travel and social contact and to work from home where possible\n18 March: Schools are told to close from 20 March until further notice, except for the children of keyworkers and vulnerable pupils\n20 March: Restaurants, cafes and pubs are told to close\n23 March: The prime minister announces the first national lockdown, telling people they will only be allowed to leave their homes for limited reasons. Non-essential shops are told to close\nEarlier, the Queen marked the milestone by sending a bouquet of flowers to St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, where the Duke of Edinburgh recently had surgery for a pre-existing heart condition. \nA message along with the flowers read: \"As we look forward to a brighter future together, today we pause to reflect on the grief and loss that continues to be felt by so many people and families, and pay tribute to the immeasurable service of those who have supported us all over the last year.\"\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon paid tribute to health workers, telling Holyrood the nation had been reminded \"just how much we owe to their dedication, expertise and compassion\".\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford praised the Welsh public for uniting \"in the darkest of times\".\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster said it had probably been the \"toughest year in living memory\", while Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it had been a \"huge challenge\".\nDoctors, nurses and teachers, as well as more than 50 MPs and peers, have written to the prime minister as part of a cross-party campaign asking for a Covid Memorial Day - paying tribute to the efforts of frontline workers during the pandemic.\nThey are asking for a minute's silence every year on 23 March to remember the lives lost."

      "text": "Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu could struggle to secure enough parliamentary seats to stay in power, preliminary results from Tuesday's election show.\nLocal media said Mr Netanyahu's right-wing bloc would end up with 52 seats - nine short of the threshold.\nIn a surprise development, an Arab party which is projected to get four seats could hold the balance of power.\nThe outcome will among other things determine the course of Israel's relations with the Palestinians.\nThe Arab party, Raam, has not declared whether it will support the efforts of Mr Netanyahu -  not a natural ally - to form a governing coalition or those of the bloc of parties opposed to him remaining in office.\nThe Netanyahu opponents are set to win 57 seats, and although backing from Raam could give them a majority, they are fragmented and unlikely to be able to agree to work together.\nIf neither bloc succeeds, the country could face its fifth election since 2019.\nIsrael's electoral system, a form of proportional representation, makes it almost impossible for a single party to win an election outright.\nAccording to the Central Election Commission, the prime minister's right-wing Likud party won 24.2% of the vote. The centrist Yesh Atid party of the main opposition leader, Yair Lapid, was second with 13.9%.\nIsraeli media reported that the tallies would result in Likud getting 30 seats in the 120-seat Knesset and Yesh Atid 17.\nMr Netanyahu's political allies, the ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties Shas and United Torah Judaism, were projected to get nine and seven seats respectively; the centrist Blue and White party of Defence Minister Benny Gantz eight; and the centre-left Labour party and the nationalist Yamina and Yisrael Beitenu parties seven each.\nThe Joint List alliance of Arab parties, the New Hope party of Mr Netanyahu's former-ally-turned-opponent Gideon Saar, the far-right Religious Zionism alliance and the left-wing Meretz party are forecast to win six apiece; and Raam four.\nAfter the initial projections by Israel's main broadcasters on Tuesday night, Benjamin Netanyahu took to the stage smiling at Likud's headquarters. He declared the vote \"a great achievement\" and spoke of the need for a \"stable government\" for Israel.\nHis opponent Mr Lapid said he was \"proud\" of Yesh Atid's \"enormous\" achievement and that he would \"do everything possible to establish a sane government\". \nThere is plenty of political drama about who is going to sit in Israel's parliament, and especially who is going to be in charge.\nBut with so little movement from the results of previous elections, this vote shows once again how deeply divided Israeli politics are. There are those who are for Benjamin Netanyahu and those who are against him. \nAlready there are deals being done and moves being made behind the scenes. \nIt looks like Mr Netanyahu's best path to securing another term would be a highly unusual one that could involve building a coalition with Jewish ultra-Orthodox, ultra-nationalist and Arab parties. How that would work is almost anyone's guess. \nIsraelis are left wondering whether this election will ultimately prove to be inconclusive once again and the long period of political stalemate will continue.\nIt appears that both Mr Netanyahu and his rivals will require the support of Yamina and Raam to secure a majority.\nRaam split from the Joint List earlier this year in part because Raam's leader Mansour Abbas said he was open to working with Mr Netanyahu to address the needs of Israel's Arab citizens, who make up about 20% of the population.\nIn an interview on Wednesday morning, Mr Abbas said he would not rule out joining any coalition.\n\"We are not in anyone's pocket. We are prepared to engage with both sides,\" he told Israel's 103 FM radio station.\nHowever, Bezalel Smotrich, a Netanyahu ally and the leader of Religious Zionism, indicated on Thursday that the prime minister could not rely on its support if he made a deal with Raam.\n\"A right-wing government will not be formed based on Mansour Abbas's [party]. Period,\" he tweeted.\nAn Arab party has never sat in government in Israel, and such parties do not share Mr Netanyahu's right-wing ideology.\nYamina is led by Mr Netanyahu's former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and defence minister, Naftali Bennett, with whom he has a difficult relationship.\nLike Mr Abbas, Mr Bennett has not announced which side he will throw his weight behind.\n\"I will do only what is good for the State of Israel,\" he said after voting ended on Tuesday night.\nIt will determine who is in charge of one of the most powerful countries in the region, a state which the US considers one of its most important allies. \nThe next government will also shape relations with the Palestinians and Arab countries. \nMr Netanyahu opposes the kind of fully fledged independent state Palestinians are seeking in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza, and supports Jewish settlements in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.\nA centrist or centre-left government would be more likely to try to revive stalled negotiations with the Palestinians and consider territorial concessions in return for peace.\nThe outcome could also affect Mr Netanyahu's trial on corruption charges, which is due to resume in two weeks' time. Analysts suggest a right-wing government could attempt to block the trial from proceeding. The prime minister denies any wrongdoing.\nThe election was widely seen as a referendum on Mr Netanyahu's leadership.\nThe 71-year-old prime minister has been in power continuously since 2009, having served an earlier three-year term in the late 1990s.\nHis campaign focused on Israel's world-leading Covid-19 vaccination programme and his diplomatic success in normalising ties with some Arab countries.\nBut his opponents from across the political spectrum accused him of mishandling the pandemic and argued that he should not remain in office while standing trial.\nAfter the previous three elections neither Mr Netanyahu nor his rivals were able to form a stable governing coalition.\nThe current national unity government, which was the result of a power-sharing deal with Defence Minister Benny Gantz, collapsed in December after just seven months."

      "tags": "Keir Starmer,Boris Johnson,British Army,Ben Wallace",
      "text": "Sir Keir Starmer has criticised the prime minister for \"breaking a promise\" not to cut British Army troops.\nDuring Prime Minister's Questions, the Labour leader quoted Boris Johnson from the 2019 election campaign, where he pledged to maintain the Army's size.\nBut Sir Keir said this week's defence review would now see numbers fall by 10,000 as part of government plans.\nMr Johnson said the government was increasing spending on defence \"by the biggest amount since the Cold War\".\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace confirmed on Monday that the size of the Army will be reduced to 72,500 soldiers by 2025 as part of a major overhaul of the Armed Services. \nHe said a move towards drones and cyber warfare would mean an \"increased deployability and technological advantage\" for the UK, and see a greater effect delivered by fewer people.\nBut the SNP said the reduction in troop numbers \"undermines our Armed forces\" and sees the Tories \"break their election commitment\". \nThe 2019 Conservative manifesto itself does not mention troop numbers, but pledges to \"continue to exceed the Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence and increase the budget by at least 0.5% above inflation every year of the new Parliament\".\nHowever, during the manifesto launch in the general election campaign, Mr Johnson said that his party would \"not be cutting our Armed Services in any form\" if they won the vote.\nSir Keir began PMQs by asking him why he made the promise.\nMr Johnson said: \"That was because what we were going to do was actually increase spending on our Armed Services by the biggest amount since the Cold War - \u00a324bn modernising our Armed Forces with no redundancies, keeping our Army at 100,000 if you include the reserves.\"\nBut Sir Keir said the defence secretary had been \"absolutely clear\" in his statement this week that numbers would fall, adding: \"Only this prime minister could suggest that a reduction from 82,000 to 72,000 is somehow not a cut.\"\nMr Johnson insisted his government had \"kept our promise\" and attacked members of Labour's frontbench for their position on renewing the UK's nuclear deterrent. \nHe added: \"There will be no redundancies, and if you include reserves, we are even keeping the Army at 100,000.\n\"But on top of that we are doing what is needed to modernise our Armed Forces, taking them into the 21st century.\n\"We are doing all the difficult things Labour shirked during their time in office.\"\nSir Keir accused him of \"playing with the numbers\", adding: \"You just cant trust the Conservatives to protect our Armed Forces.\" \nAnd responding to the PM's accusation that Labour had been \"consistently weak on protecting this country\", the Labour leader said: \"What's weaker is making a promise to our Armed Forces just before the election, then breaking it and not being prepared to admit it - not having the courage to admit it.\"\nHe called on Mr Johnson to put his defence policy to a vote in the Commons.  \nIn response, Mr Johnson said the Tories were \"pro-vax, low tax and when it comes to defence, we've got your backs\". \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer raised Monday's announcement of a reduction to the size of the Army, saying Boris Johnson had promised at the last election not to cut the armed forces \"in any form\".\nHe's right. In November 2019, at the launch of the Conservative manifesto - when answering questions after his speech - Mr Johnson said: \"We will not be cutting our armed services in any form - we will be maintaining the size of our armed services.\"\nThis was reported by several papers, including The Sun, which also included the video of Mr Johnson saying it. \nBut that promise wasn't in the 2019 Conservative manifesto.\nOn Monday, the Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced that: \"I have therefore taken the decision to reduce the size of the Army from today's current strength of 76,500 trained personnel to 72,500 by 2025\".  \nIn his reply to Sir Keir, the prime minister spoke of increased defence spending. There was a pledge in the 2019 manifesto to \"increase the [defence] budget by at least 0.5% above inflation every year of the new Parliament\". \nThe spending plan for the Ministry of Defence announced last November will achieve that on average until 2025, based on inflation forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility."

      "tags": "Colleges,NI education,Strike action",
      "text": "Hundreds of lecturers at further education colleges in Northern Ireland are holding a one-day strike.\nStaff belonging to the University and College Union (UCU) are taking the action in a dispute over pay and workload.\nBut the Economy Minister Diane Dodds has said the union rejected a pay offer amounting to a 7% rise.\nThe UCU said their members in further education colleges had only received a 3.8% pay rise since 2013/14.\nAbout 70,000 students attend Northern Ireland's six Further Education (FE) colleges, according to figures from the Department for the Economy (DfE).\nMany of those students take vocational courses and many study part-time.\nThe UCU said the Department for the Economy had failed to increase FE college funding so that employers could pay staff fairly.\nBut BBC News NI has obtained a letter from Ms Dodds to Stormont's economy committee in which she said she did not have any \"direct role\" in the dispute.\n\"Further education colleges are employers in their own right and are responsible for determining the terms and conditions of lecturing staff,\" she wrote.\nHowever, the minister claimed the UCU action would have \"a detrimental effect on some of the most vulnerable learners, many of whom are already struggling to cope with the impact of a prolonged period of online learning and social isolation\".\nShe told the committee the College Employers' Forum (CEF) had made an offer to trade unions of a 7% pay rise \"which they consider could be met from within existing budgets\".\nThe CEF is made up of the chairs and chief executives of Northern Ireland's six FE colleges.\n\"Trade Union Side then submitted a pay claim seeking 11.7% and advising that the 7% offer was unacceptable,\" Ms Dodds wrote.\nBut in a separate statement the UCU said the 7% pay offer was spread over a four-year period.\nUCU said it was \"barely better than pay restraint and fails to adequately compensate for the years when lecturers received no cost of living increases at all\".\nThe UCU official in Northern Ireland Katharine Clarke said as DfE determined funding to FE colleges they were \"clearly responsible for stagnating pay\".\n\"UCU members are going on strike because they have received a paltry 3.8% increase in total since 2013/14,\" she said.\n\"School teachers have received 11.25% over the same period.\n\"The offer of 7% over four years in the context of the previous capped awards equates to 1.2% per year over a nine-year period.\n\"No other workforce in the public sector has been subject to such a derisory increase.\"  \nBut in Ms Dodds' letter, she said she had no authority to intervene in talks between the colleges and unions and that DfE would only become involved when agreement was reached.\n\"It is only when agreement has been reached through that process that a business case is submitted to the Department for appraisal,\" she said.\n\"Should the business case be considered to be sufficiently robust it can then be approved and consideration given to meeting any additional resource requirements.\"\nMs Dodds also said UCU did not represent all lecturers in FE colleges, as many were members of the NASUWT and NEU.\nShe also claimed unions had also rejected a previous three-year pay offer of an increase of over 10% in 2020 without balloting their members, and concluded by urging the unions and employers to resume negotiations.\nBut the UCU accused Ms Dodds of failing to meet them and of \"shirking her responsibility\" for underfunding FE colleges.\nThe union said strike action would be followed by action short of a strike unless the minister and department \"secure more funding for colleges and a proper pay rise for college lecturers\".\nThat action short of strike will see UCU members refusing to work overtime, and boycotting any un-agreed additional duties.    \nMonica Goligher, a lecturer in biology at Belfast Met, is among those taking part in Wednesday's strike.\nShe told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme she believes striking staff will have the support of their students and the wider public because \"they appreciate what we do\".\nMs Goligher said lecturers' workload had \"imploded\" since their most recent contract was negotiated in 2009, and had increased further as a result of the pandemic.\nStaff have taken on a \"huge administrative burden\" as well as additional teaching requirements over those last 12 years, she explained.\n\"That has been compounded by moving to teach online, practically in full, since last March with less than 24 hours to prepare to do that.\"\nMs Goligher was asked if their pay claim was justified, given that nurses who are risking their lives working on the frontline during the coronavirus pandemic have been offered a 1% pay rise.\n\"We are the people who will step [up] to retrain, re-skill those who have lost their jobs in industries that have been particularly impacted by Covid and the ongoing economic difficulties,\" she replied.\n\"Minister Dodds can decide whether that is going to be a task that she is asking of a demotivated, demoralised and exhausted workforce in further education.\""

      "text": "Tougher measures on hauliers travelling from France to the UK are to be considered to stop Covid variants being imported, Boris Johnson has said. \nAt an MPs' hearing, the prime minister was asked why France had not been added to the UK's travel \"red list\".\nMr Johnson said there was a balance needed between protecting public health and keeping trade flowing.\nHis comments come amid concerns about the spread of South African, UK and Brazilian variants in France.\nThe \"red list\", which requires arriving people to pay to quarantine in a hotel, is part of travel regulations aimed at stopping Covid variants entering the country.\nQuestioning the PM at the Liaison Committee, Labour's Yvette Cooper said every week 20,000 people - such as lorry drivers - were coming to the UK from France - and two-thirds of them were exempt from restrictions.\nShe said France had up to 3,000 cases of the South African and Brazilian variants and questioned why it was not on the \"red list\" of countries from which travel is effectively banned.\nShe acknowledged the need for trade would mean quarantine was not appropriate for hauliers but questioned why they were not being tested for coronavirus.\nMr Johnson said putting France on the \"red list\" was \"something that we will have to look at\".\nWhen pushed on whether hauliers should be tested, Mr Johnson said the decision required weighing up the efficacy of current vaccines on the variants of concern and the disruption that would cause to goods being brought across to the UK. \nHe pointed out that 75% of the UK's medicines and 50% of its food comes through short straits (Dover-Calais, ferry and tunnel).\n\"We will take a decision, no matter how tough, to interrupt those flows, if we think it is necessary to protect public health. It may be that we have to do that very soon,\" he told the committee. \nOn Tuesday, health minister Lord Bethell said the UK's nearest neighbours could join other nations on the country's \"red list\".\nThere was a \"possibility\" that every European country could face a ban, he added, but that would be done \"with huge regret\".\nIn December, France closed its border to arrivals from the UK including hauliers. \nThe two-day closure led to queues of thousands of lorries trying to cross the channel, which was eased after France agreed to allow hauliers to cross once they had a negative Covid test result. \nUnder lockdown rules, holiday travel is not currently allowed - either in the UK or abroad.\nNew coronavirus laws, due to be introduced in England on Monday, would mean a \u00a35,000 fine for travelling outside the UK without a reasonable excuse."

      "text": "More than 6,000 cases of Covid-related fraud and cyber-crime have been recorded by the UK's police forces during the pandemic.\nThe Action Fraud team said \u00a334.5m had been stolen since 1 March 2020.\nIt covers activity in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but not Scotland.\nIn a related development, the National Cyber Security Centre has told the BBC it is tackling about 30 \"significant attacks\" a month against the country's pandemic response infrastructure.\nThese involves attempts to breach the NHS, vaccine producers and vaccine supply chains, among other organisations.\n\"There unfortunately have been a number of successful ransomware incidents against businesses - I can think of roughly around 10,\" NCSC operations director Paul Chichester said.\nOther figures disclosed by City of London Police, which co-ordinates efforts to combat fraud, include:\nThe activity peaked between April and May 2020, and January 2021 - both times when lockdowns were in force.\nThe Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit, which tackles criminal gangs responsible for financial fraud and scams, worked with social media platforms to take down over 700 accounts linked to fraudulent activity in 2020, of which over 250 were money mule recruiters.\nBut this may be the tip of the iceberg.\nThe National Crime Agency estimates that just one in five fraud cases are typically reported to the police. \nAnd the volunteer-run Cyber Helpline told the BBC only a quarter of those who had contacted it after a cyber-attack said they had also reported the incident to the police.\nMany of the scams involved conning people out of their money and financial details by focusing on internet shopping.\nRelated fraud was 42% higher over the pandemic than the preceding year, as criminals took advantage of the fact many physical stores had been forced to close.\nAnna - not her real name - from Cheltenham was one of thousands of people who received an SMS message asking her to go online and rearrange a parcel delivery. \nShe filled in her details, but later suspected something was wrong. She alerted her bank and cancelled her bank card.\n\"I thought, now I have nothing to worry about, everything is fine and case closed,\" she told the BBC.\nBut the criminals used the details they had already obtained to authorise her bank to credit her account with a \u00a39,000 loan.\nAnd a short while later they called her, pretending to be the bank. \nNot realising the scam, Anna told them she had not taken out a loan. \n\"They gave me the sort code and bank account number I needed to pay back the loan, and said if I paid the \u00a39,000 there wouldn't be any charges.\n\"But then I was still feeling suspicious, so I Googled the sort code, and it came up with a completely different bank.\"\nSo, Anna called her bank directly and realised the scammers had returned. \n\"I didn't lose any money but it did feel like a real burglary to be honest,\" she said. \nShe closed her account, and changed her email address and mobile number. But she still does not feel safe. \nCharities are also common targets. \nOne in three charities suffered a cyber-attack during the first 10 months of the pandemic, according to Ecclesiastical Insurance.\nOne victim actually specialises in offering cyber-security advice to others.\nHackers got inside Charity Digital's network for seven days without being detected. They compromised its email accounts and sent false invoices to clients.\nThe organisation's chief executive, Jonathan Chevallier, told the BBC the breach had not been noticed in part because all his staff had been working from home.\nCharity Digital spent more than \u00a310,000 investigating the attack and has produced an online webinar to help others avoid a similar fate.\nAnother popular type of cyber-fraud involved romance scams, in which people looking for relationships via the net often get fooled into sending money to prospective partners, who prey on their emotions.\nThis type of crime was 20% more common over the past year than the one before.\nCity of London Police also said key workers had also been specifically targeted.\nIn one case, a man was arrested on suspicion of using social media to advertise bogus car insurance policies to NHS workers.\nThe pandemic appears, however, to have coincided with a fall in one type of cyber-crime.\nReported cases of computer software service fraud - in which criminals call offering fake tech support to fool victims into sharing their payment card details and other credentials - dropped by 15.5%."

      "tags": "Computing,Intel",
      "text": "Intel's new chief executive has told the BBC it is not \"palatable\" that so many computer chips are made in Asia.\nThe majority of processors are currently manufactured in the region, with Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung the dominant players.\nUS-based Intel plans to set up a new division to make chips for other companies based on their own designs.\nUntil now, its focus had been on manufacturing its own chips in its factories across the world.\nPat Gelsinger has said Intel will invest $20bn (\u00a314.6bn) in two new fabrication plants in the US state of Arizona, in addition to a major expansion of an existing Irish facility in County Kildare.\n\"Having 80% of all supply in Asia simply isn't a palatable manner for the world to have its view of the most critical technology,\" Mr Gelsinger said.\n\"Every smartphone, every telemedicine, every remote worker, every remote education, every autonomous vehicle, every aspect of humanity is becoming more digital. \n\"And when it becomes digital, it runs on semiconductors. \n\"This is the heart of every aspect of human existence going forward. And the world needs a more balanced supply chain to accomplish that. We're stepping in.\"\nHe added that Intel also intended to build a further chip-making foundry in a different European nation, but would not be drawn about exactly where.\nWhile these moves will be too late to tackle an existing shortage of chips which is causing problems for car-makers and others, they could help the West avert a future crisis.\nPoliticians in the US and the EU have called for more chip-producing factories to be built locally.\nThis is partly driven by concerns that Beijing aims to reunify mainland China with Taiwan, while North Korea poses a threat to its southern neighbour.\nHowever, Intel has repeatedly missed manufacturing targets over recent years.\nAs a consequence, its latest desktop processors use older transistor technology than rival silicon from AMD and Apple, putting the components at a disadvantage.\nMr Gelsinger must now prove his company has put these problems behind it if the new business is to thrive.\nThe 60-year-old only returned to Intel last month after his predecessor was ousted over concerns about falling market share, among other problems.\nBut earlier in his career, Mr Gelsinger spent three decades at Intel, including a role as its first chief technical officer.\nOne activist investor had pressed him to go \"fab-less\", and spin off Intel's plants to concentrate on chip designs.\nBut Mr Gelsinger has instead chosen what looks like a tougher challenge in order to restore the company to its past glories.\nAnd that includes letting clients order chips that mix together their own technologies with some of Intel's own architectures for an extra fee.\n\"We're putting it all on the table,\" he said.\nThe following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity:\nLet's start with the new Intel Foundry Services business. It sounds like you're going all out to make chips for other companies who lack the facilities to do so themselves. But why help the competition?\nManufacturing is a capacity game. And if you're not leading in terms of total capacity, you will fall behind. So to some degree it's a necessity. If we're going to be in the manufacturing business, we have to be a foundry for ourselves and for others.\nSimply put, the world needs more semiconductors. \nWe're in an environment where digitisation was at a strong pace of growth. And then Covid kicked us into a dramatically different gear. \nThe world needs more semiconductors, and we're one of the few companies that have leading-edge technologies to be able to step into that void. And to keep it for our own products simply is not the right thing for the planet, for the industry, and for a globally distributed supply chain.\nHow disruptive do you think it will be, coming in to take business away from Samsung and TSMC?\nOverall I think everybody is groaning to catch up to the overwhelming demand. And we're going to use Samsung and TSMC for some of our products. \nSo this is about \"co-op-petition\". We expect to have strong partnerships with them as customers, and in some cases we'll compete a little bit. But overall, this is a rapidly growing $100bn market segment that simply needs more supply. \nIt also needs more geographically balanced supply. \nToday there's a heavy bias to Asia. And as we've seen, coming out of some of the disruptions and challenges, the world needs US and European supply in a more balanced way. It's the right thing for the global supply chain requirements, for both commercial as well as for government and defence use as well.\nYou also have a large chip plant in Dalian, China. Are there any plans to build new ones in China?\nAt this point, we have no expansion plans for what we have there. \nThe announcement yesterday was for two new fabs in Arizona. I already have construction projects going on in Oregon, Ireland and in Israel.\nAnd we announced that we expect to open our next sites, in both Europe and the US, within the next year. So at this point, four major sites under construction, and I hope to add two more within the next year.\nWhen you say you want to build more in Europe, is that going to just be more in Ireland or Israel? Or are you looking at other countries, the UK perhaps?\nI fully expect that we'll open up a site in another country in Europe.\nCould that be the UK?\nI'm not going to speculate any further right now. \nBut just to put this in context: these are extraordinary capital investments. They're also extraordinary job generators. \nYou've said you hope Apple might be one of your clients, despite its decision to stop using Intel's own chips. Is that realistic?\nEverybody wants multiple suppliers. So we think there's very real potential. But I have to earn that business. I have to be able to go to my competitors and be able to say: \"I want you to become my customer.\" \nThat also includes Nvidia, Qualcomm and Broadcom, in addition to Microsoft and IBM. I want all of them to say: \"I need more technology... and I trust that Intel is going to become one of my key suppliers.\"\nAnd that includes Apple as one of the biggest users of advanced semiconductor capabilities.\nApple can be a little thin-skinned at times. So is it wise to be running a high-profile ad campaign mocking its computers at the same time as saying we'd like to be your partner again?\nWe have great respect for Apple as a company. They're an innovator. They've done incredible things in the industry. Tim Cook is a great leader.\nAt the same time, we're going to be aggressive competitors and we're out to reinvigorate the PC ecosystem.\nSo we're going to enjoy ourselves. We're going to compete aggressively. And I'm also going to take care of my customers.\nRegarding your own chips, you say you've now mastered your seven nanometre process, which roughly equates to what TSMC and Samsung market as 5nm. But we've heard promises from Intel before, and then things have slipped. What's different this time?\nWe've understood the core issues. What really happened was problems with our 10nm effort caused a domino delay to 7nm. \nThere's an advanced manufacturing technique called extreme ultraviolet lithography. It was immature, and we bet against it. As we shifted in time, it became more mature. Now we've embraced it fully.\nIt's the same thing that TSMC is doing, and leveraging it aggressively.\nSo we feel that we're now in a very predictable pace. \nI have confidence that we're back on track. But not just for 7nm. Our programmes that go for several nodes beyond that are showing very good success. \nWe've also announced a research partnership with IBM. So, we have a rich portfolio of tricks and ideas and innovations to choose from to put us on a course for the long-term leadership of Intel.\nWhen you say leadership, just to be clear, do you think you could overtake TSMC and Samsung in chip-making capabilities?\nIntel led the semiconductor industry for 20-plus years in innovation.\nWe hit a pothole. We're now digging our way out of that pothole. And I'm looking forward to decades of continued leadership in this area.\nParity. Parity-plus. And then sustained leadership. That's the path that we're on."

      "text": "Alex Salmond is to take fresh legal action over the conduct of the Scottish government's top civil servant.\nThe former first minister said Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans had failed to take responsibility for the botched handling of harassment complaints against him. \nHe said he had instructed his lawyers to bring proceedings in the Court of Session. \nMr Salmond previously won a judicial review case against the government.\nThat case forced the government to pay Mr Salmond's legal fees of more than \u00a3500,000 after its investigation into complaints by two female civil servants was found to have been unlawful.\nWhile the precise basis of his latest legal bid is not clear, the BBC understands the ex-SNP leader intends to sue the Scottish government for an unspecified amount in damages. \nMr Salmond also said he would also be making a formal complaint to the police over the leaking of details of the allegations against him to the Daily Record newspaper.  \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she still has confidence in Ms Evans as permanent secretary, and that the government \"made a mistake in the course of trying to do the right thing\".\nMs Evans had her contract extended by the first minister last year. It is due to expire in 2022.\nThe Scottish government said it would be \"inappropriate to comment on a hypothetical legal action or on any matter Mr Salmond may raise with the police. \nOn Tuesday, a Holyrood inquiry concluded that the government's handling of the two harassment complaints against Mr Salmond in 2018 was \"seriously flawed\".\nMSPs on the inquiry committee were critical of the way the new complaints process was drawn up and applied, and of the government's conduct in defending the judicial review proceedings brought by Mr Salmond.\nThe report was critical of Ms Evans, saying there had been an \"individual failing\" on her part over the judicial review and that she should have known that the \"multiple roles\" she played in the process represented \"a significant organisational risk\".\nA separate inquiry by a leading Irish lawyer concluded that Ms Sturgeon's involvement in the saga had not breached the ministerial code.\nThe first minister has since said she would have resigned if she had been found to have done so.\nMr Salmond said the permanent secretary should consider her position after the court case in 2019, and renewed this call while giving evidence to the inquiry last month.\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, the former SNP leader said: \"More than two years later, and despite the most damning condemnation from a committee in the history of the modern Scottish Parliament, the permanent secretary still refuses to accept real responsibility.\"\nHe said he had taken legal advice and would \"shortly be instructing my lawyers to bring proceedings in the Court of Session arising as a direct result of the conduct of the permanent secretary\".\nMr Salmond was acquitted of 13 charges of sexual assault in a separate High Court trial in March 2020.\nAlex Salmond says he accepts the findings of the two reports this week.\nThat is not insignificant. Remember he said he was sure Nicola Sturgeon HAD broken the ministerial code. He now accepts the finding of the independent adviser that she didn't.\nIt is not clear exactly what Mr Salmond's legal action will entail. But it does mean he will be taking a government he once led to the highest civil court in the land once again. That is significant too. \nUltimately, Mr Salmond says he now wants to move on and urges the country to do the same. But his legal action - and a complaint to police - mean there will still be updates to this story in the months to come. \nMs Sturgeon was pressed earlier in the day on why \"no one has assumed responsibility\" for the failings admitted by the government, which the committee said had let down the two women.\nShe told MSPs that she had \"never shied away\" from the fact a mistake was made, but said it was right that complaints were investigated and not \"simply swept under the carpet\".\nShe said: \"What we must do now is put right the things that went wrong, so that mistakes are not made in the future. I deeply regret what happened, and I have apologised - and will continue to do so - to the women who were let down.\"\nLater a spokesman for the Scottish government said it would \"reflect carefully\" on the reports and \"lessons will be learned\". \n\"The first minister retains her confidence in the permanent secretary, who has operated at all times in line with the civil service code and legal advice received,\" he added.  \nMr Salmond also said he would make a complaint to the police about how the story of the initial allegations against him appeared in the Daily Record newspaper in August 2018.\nA previous Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) investigation into the leak found no \"hard evidence\" that it came from the government - but said it had \"some sympathy\" to the view that it had.\nThe inquiry was told that the ICO was the appropriate agency to investigate such matters, and would have reported any issues to the Crown Office if they had been found.\nThe Scottish government spokesman said: \"For the avoidance of doubt, the Scottish government is clear that both an Information Commissioner's Office investigation and an internal leak inquiry found no evidence to support Mr Salmond's claims that there was any leak from the Scottish government about the complaints made against him.\"\n"

      "text": "After a day of silence and song, candles and condolence, when the country stopped to try to absorb the enormity of what's happened this last year, a more familiar, and easy-to-digest political fuss emerged.\nAfter a press conference in Downing Street where, alongside the chief medics, the prime minister was more open, in tone at least, about the things that might have gone wrong in the last year, he went off to address a group of Tory MPs in private, on Zoom, in the Cabinet Room.\nThe chief whip was alongside him, I'm told, having his takeaway sandwich. (He also happens to be a farmer - but more of that later.)\nWith an important vote on Thursday that will extend the government's powers during the coronavirus crisis, you might have expected that the PM would have been verbally pushed and shoved a little by some of his backbenchers, frustrated by the pace of easing restrictions. \nIn actual fact, what has got tongues wagging was remarks that Boris Johnson made about the UK's success with vaccines, first reported in the Sun newspaper.\nDiscussing why the programme was doing so well, he told colleagues it was down to \"greed\" and \"capitalism\". \nSeveral of those present have told me he quickly realised his words could be taken out of context and urged MPs to \"remove that comment from your collective memory\". \nHe then went on to spend much of the meeting repeatedly praising AstraZeneca, pointing out that it was providing the vaccine at cost.\nOne MP said: \"I have never seen anyone withdraw something so fast.\"\nAnother of those present told me the prime minister's \"greed\" comments had been intended to poke fun at the chief whip, who was gobbling his cheese and pickle while sitting next to him.\nBelieve it or not, the party boss of discipline, Mark Spencer, has been christened with the nickname \"Big Farmer\", like \"Big Pharma\" - the pharmaceutical companies.\nAnd it's vehemently denied that the PM's comments were designed to stir up anything in the row with the EU. \nDowning Street didn't want to comment and sources are adamant that Mr Johnson was not intending to be critical of the pharmaceutical companies in any way.\nThe government has no desire to exacerbate the argument between the EU and AstraZeneca over vaccines.\nWith the notable exception of the Foreign Secretary's remarks last week in response to the EU Commission, ministers have been at pains to keep things calm.\nThe prime minister has been trying to prevent a dramatic bust-up in phone calls to EU leaders before their summit on Thursday.\nAnd officials on both sides have been talking to see if any accommodations can be made.\nBut while Mr Johnson's words may have been intended as a friendly jibe at a colleague, tensions are high, and any even accidental noises off are unlikely to help. \nPS A government source stressed on Wednesday morning that the PM was not talking about the UK vaccine programme in general. It's unusual to get any comment on private MPs' meetings, and shows how sensitive this all is."

Didn't make it to hospital. On the bathroom floor.\"\n\"So yeah, it was running to the gym, get a mat, get into the bathroom, get the mat on the floor, towels down, brace, brace, brace,\" he added. \nMr Tindall said his wife's friend Dolly, who was also at the birth of their two daughters, \"recognised that we wouldn't have got to hospital in time\". \n\"Fortunately the midwife who was going to meet us at the hospital wasn't that far away so she drove up just as we had assumed the posit [position] and the second midwife arrived just after the head had arrived,\" he added. \nTheir other two children were elsewhere for the day because Mrs Tindall had been having contractions through the night. \nMr Tindall said Mia was \"over the moon\" and Lena had declared Lucas was \"her baby\".\nIt comes just a few weeks after Mrs Tindall's cousin Princess Eugenie had her son August.\nMrs Tindall, who is a medal-winning equestrian, is the daughter of Anne, the Princess Royal - the Queen's only daughter. \nIn 2018 she spoke about her experience of going through two miscarriages before becoming pregnant with Lena.

      "tags": "Companies,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Retailing,Shopping,John Lewis,Aberdeen,UK High Streets",
      "text": "John Lewis has said it will not reopen eight of its stores once lockdown eases, putting 1,465 jobs at risk.\nThe retail giant said some locations could not sustain a large store.\nFour \"At Home\" shops in Ashford, Tunbridge Wells, Basingstoke, and Chester will close - as well as department stores in Aberdeen, Peterborough, Sheffield and York.\nJohn Lewis said the eight shops were \"financially challenged prior to the pandemic\". \nEarlier this month, the retailer warned it would be making more store closures after the impact of the pandemic led it to report a hefty annual loss.\nThe latest move comes on top of the closure of eight stores that John Lewis announced last year. The chain has now axed around a third of its stores in less than a year.\nFor almost 40 years the John Lewis store in Peterborough has been the flagship of the city's shopping centre, but along with seven other branches it looks sets to close.\nShopper James Morrell says he usually goes to John Lewis to look at the \"tech\" and says it will be a shame to not see it reopen after lockdown.\n\"This is pretty much all we've got in Peterborough really, it's our main selling point,\" he says.\nBut he says it \"might be nice for little independent shops to come along and take up the space\".\nRead more here.\nThe company said it planned to create more places to shop for John Lewis products across the UK. It suggested it would not entirely move out of areas where the main store was closing.\n\"In areas where we propose not to reopen stores, we will look at the right combination of options for that location to ensure we remain convenient for our customers, so they can continue to access John Lewis products and services.\" \nIt added it would invest in improving click-and-collect in its Waitrose stores and offer more local collection points through third parties. It also will continue experimenting with John Lewis shopping areas in Waitrose stores, as well as trying out smaller, local neighbourhood shops.\nJohn Lewis said 34 stores would start reopening from 12 April, subject to government guidance, with the exception of Glasgow, which will reopen from 26 April, and Edinburgh, which will reopen on 14 May. \nThe company said it would \"enter into consultation with the 1,465 affected partners\" about the proposals. \nShould it proceed, it said it would make \"every effort\" to find alternative roles for as many as possible.\nJohn Lewis has a unique structure in that its staff are also partners in the business, and receive a share in the profits in good years. \nIt said the stores that were closing were in locations where it did not have enough customers. \"Given the significant shift to online shopping in recent years - and our belief that this trend will not materially reverse - we do not think the performance of these eight stores can be substantially improved.\"\nAndrew worked at the John Lewis store in Birmingham for five years before being made redundant last year.\nHe has worked in the retail industry for 20 years.\n\"I'm not surprised by today's announcement,\" he said. \"While it's true that customer shopping habits have changed, I believe the partnership was in the middle of an identity crisis before the pandemic.\"\nMr Taylor said the company has \"struggled to adapt and needs to work on diversity and inclusion as a business to reflect modern-day Britain.\" \nDan Jarvis, the mayor for Sheffield, said losing the store in Sheffield would be a heavy blow to the area. \n\"The store has been a cornerstone of the city's retail offer for more than a century,\" he said. \"I am working with John Lewis and Sheffield City Council to determine what this means for those whose jobs are now on the line and what can be done to support them.\"\nJohn Lewis has now axed around a third of its stores in less than a year. It wasn't all that long ago that the chain was opening stores. In 2007, it had 26 when it decided to embark on an aggressive expansion plan, almost doubling the number of stores in a decade, even though internet sales were starting to climb.\nThis is now a painful correction. Of the 23 department stores it went on to open, only 12 will still be trading when lockdown ends. Its Birmingham store was the most high-profile casualty last year. The company is also reining back on its smaller \"John Lewis at home\" stores. Only four of the original 12 remain. But it's also losing some older main department stores in regional cities, which will have a huge impact.\nJohn Lewis has been a presence in Sheffield for some 80 years, for instance. The business insists that as the High Street changes, it has to change with it, reflecting changing shopping habits. It expects 70% of its sales to be online by 2025.\nJohn Lewis is betting on fewer bigger \"destination\" shops as well as relying far less on retail in the future for its overall profits - from expanding financial services to using excess space for housing.\nSome bold decisions are being made across retail given the turmoil over the past 12 months, but the question is whether John Lewis can pull off its turnaround plan without losing its competitive edge.\nJohn Lewis said it expects from 60-70% of John Lewis sales to be made online in the future. Nearly 50% of its customers have been using a combination of store and online when making their purchases.\nDespite the expected further shift to online, John Lewis said that stores were essential to its business, as people still wanted physical proximity: \"They provide a sensory experience that online cannot, supported by the expertise of our partners.\"\nThe pandemic caused the chain's first ever annual loss of \u00a3517m for the year to January, against profits of \u00a3146m the previous year. At the time of that announcement earlier this month, the firm said it would reshape its business in response to the change in customer shopping habits.\nMuch of that loss was due to a write down in the value of its stores because of the shift to online shopping, as well as restructuring and redundancy costs."

      "text": "Exactly one year ago Paul Henderson was seven days into self-isolation for coronavirus symptoms when his wife sought urgent help. By the end of the day he had been put into an induced coma and was fighting for his life. \nPaul says he can't remember his wife Lisa driving him from their home, near the village of Heriot in the Borders, to hospital in Edinburgh. \nIt would be weeks before she would see him again.\n\"I have a vague memory of making a phone call to my wife and the children, not knowing if that would be my last phone call,\" Paul says.\n\"And then I only remember wakening up 30 days later, unaware of what the family had been through.\"\nTwelve months ago, the 55-year-old was among the first of a sudden wave of coronavirus patients that filled Scotland's hospitals in a matter of weeks. \nDoctors were facing a race against time to save some of them from a new disease that they knew little about. \nPaul was one of more than 1,700 people admitted to Covid-19 intensive care in Scotland during the past year. About a third of them did not survive.\nHis month in ICU would see Paul hooked up to a ventilator and his body subjected to a catalogue of horrific symptoms.\nHe believes he may have picked up the virus in a Leith pub where he had been drinking with fellow Hibs supporters after a match was called off.\nPaul says: \"There was singing, there was man-hugging and 'good to see you' and stuff like that, and I was probably getting it passed to me then and I didn't know. You just never knew.\"\nHe says if he had known what he was to go through in the following weeks, he wouldn't have gone to the pub that day.\n\"I was told by all the consultants and doctors that I was lucky to pull through,\" Paul says.\n\"I woke up and I was hooked up to monitors and instruments, the flashing lights, a catheter, two cannulas; I had nine pads stuck to my body, with the wires that check whatever it is they check.\n\"I was in a bad way. I couldn't talk at first because of the tracheostomy. I had pleurisy, double pneumonia and kidney dialysis, and I had to get blood thinning because I was having clots and the kidney dialysis machine was clogging up. \n\"But I never knew anything until I opened my eyes 30 days later and realised the seriousness of it all.\"\nDuring those weeks, Paul had no idea of how the pandemic had taken hold in Scotland. But his mind was still busy. \nHe describes vivid and disturbing dreams he experienced while in the induced coma.\n\"The delirium was horrific, absolutely horrific,\" he says. \n\"In the dreams I was fighting for my life on numerous occasions. I was drowning in the hull of a boat, gasping for air.\n\"It was all real to me but it was in my mind.\"\nHe recalls one dream where he saw \"the brightest light you can imagine\".\nPaul says: \"I think that was it, when I was at my worst, when the consultant one night phoned my wife and said 'be prepared for the worst, he might not make it'.\"\nEventually he did wake up. \nBut his family would still become one of the thousands to lose someone to the virus. In a nursing home in Edinburgh, his elderly mother did not survive it.\nWhen Paul came out of the coma he was worried his mother would find out just how ill he had been.\nHe had not been in touch with her for 40 days and he still had a squeaky voice from the tracheostomy. \n\"So I phoned her and caught up with her,\" he says. \"And then four days later, she had passed away with the coronavirus.\"\nPaul had to focus on his own recovery. He says the NHS was fantastic during the worst times.\n\"I was just too scared to go to sleep,\" he says. \"I'd get upset in the middle of the night and a nurse would just come in and just sit and chat. They saved my life and they were brilliant.\"\nSince then, the charity ICU Steps, a patient support group, counsellors and his wife have all helped him to cope with the trauma.\nHis ordeal will resonate with many who have survived Covid-19. But for him, the impact it has had on his family causes the deepest pain.\n\"I've still got scarring on my lungs. I'm deaf in one ear. Really fatigued, you know, I'm shattered at the end of the day,\" Paul says.\n\"But you know it's only a little to what my family went through.\n\"I do remember saying to my son, look after the girls. My son was only 12 at the time but he was to look after them. He was the man of the house now.\n\"My wife used to come out here in the middle of the night and just look at the stars and just contemplate that I might not come home.\"\nPaul says the experience has brought the family closer together. \nAnd now he's looking forward to taking his son Saul back to see Hibs at Easter Road and is grateful to be able to tell his story.\n\"There are seven and half thousand people dead, and I was nearly one more myself,\" he says.\n\"It's real and it's not going away just yet. But just bear with it. It will come good in the end.\"  "

      "text": "Jewish leaders are calling for a public inquiry into whether alleged Nazi war criminals were protected from prosecution because they spied for the UK in the Cold War.\nIt comes after the BBC found that suspected Nazi collaborator Stanislaw Chrzanowski may have worked for MI6.\nGerman officials believe the Telford pensioner may have murdered more than 30 people during World War Two.\nBut UK police said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him.\nStanislaw \"Stan\" Chrzanowski grew up in eastern Poland, now part of Belarus. He came to Britain in 1946 after being taken as a prisoner of war and joining Allied forces.\nHe settled in Birmingham and, in 1954, met a British woman. They married and he became stepfather to her son, John Kingston.\nFind out more: \nYou can read the full story about the BBC's investigation, or listen to The Nazi Next Door on BBC Sounds\nMr Kingston suspected his stepfather of having been involved in Nazi atrocities - including mass murder - against Jews and other people in the town of Slonim.\nHe spent decades trying to prove Mr Chrzanowski's guilt. He built up a dossier of evidence, including secret recordings of conversations with his stepfather. \nIn 1996 Mr Kingston went with a BBC film crew to Slonim - where tens of thousands of Jews were massacred during the Nazi occupation between 1941 and 1944.\nEyewitnesses told him they had seen Mr Chrzanowski killing people while working for the Nazi auxiliary police.\nUK police investigating alleged war criminals in the 1980s and 90s interviewed him, but no charges were brought.\nMr Chrzanowski always denied being a war criminal. He died in October 2017, aged 96. John Kingston died six months later, aged 74.\nBefore Mr Kingston died, he gave BBC journalist Nick Southall access to all his files, photos and secret recordings. The BBC has since found evidence to support Mr Kingston's claims. \nIt has also discovered news footage from the 1950s showing Mr Chrzanowski at Marienfelde refugee camp in Berlin - a known hive of spy activity - during the Cold War. \nFour other men photographed with him during WW2 also make an appearance in the same footage. The BBC's investigation is continuing to try to confirm their names.\nIntelligence experts believe Mr Chrzanowski was likely to have been working there for British secret services, and this could ultimately be why he never saw justice in the UK.\nIntelligence and security expert Dr Stephen Dorril thinks Mr Chrzanowski, who was fluent in four languages, was likely to have been recruited by MI6 to work at the camp.\n\"It just fits the pattern,\" he said. \"This is exactly what MI6 was doing. They were looking for people who would be willing to work for them, who had knowledge of these areas.\"\nDr Dorril said if Mr Chrzanowski was a Nazi collaborator during the war, the UK's foreign secret service would have known. He says it points to a cover-up.\nProfessor Anthony Glees, a security expert from the University of Buckingham, said British security services destroyed tens of thousands of files in the late 1980s and early 90s that \"almost certainly included\" details of any foreign-born Nazi collaborator who had gone on to work for UK intelligence.\nSenior figures within the UK Jewish community are now calling for a public inquiry.\nMarie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews said if the revelations are true, this is \"a very dark day for Britain - and for British Jews\". \n\"What we need to have here is a very open and honest conversation about the whole of Britain's post-war actions,\" she told the BBC. \nConservative MP Robert Halfon, vice-president of the Jewish Leadership Council, said the findings were \"horrific and frightening\".\nHe told the BBC he plans to call on the parliamentary security committee to investigate whether there were Nazi war criminals in the UK \"who ended up working for British intelligence or any other organ of the state\".\nHe also said any investigation should look into whether or not there was \"a real hornets' nest of other WW2 criminals\" working for the UK. \nThe UK government did not respond to the allegations against Mr Chrzanowski and MI6. When asked why he was not prosecuted for war crimes, it said the case was reviewed by the CPS in the 1990s but the evidence was insufficient to proceed. The CPS said there was no real prospect of a conviction.\nThe Metropolitan Police also said the case failed to meet the evidential test and there was no active investigation.  "

      "tags": "Employment,Banking,Goldman Sachs",
      "text": "The chief executive of Goldman Sachs says it's \"great\" a group of young analysts raised concerns about working conditions at the investment firm.\nA group of 13 US employees mocked up a presentation in which they told of 95-hour working weeks and \"inhumane\" conditions amounting to abuse.\nBoss David Solomon said in a message: \"It's great that this group of analysts went to their management.\"\nBut he added that going an \"extra mile\" can make a big difference for the bank.\nIn his address to the investment bank's 34,000 staff worldwide, Mr Solomon said he expected Goldman to continue to face high demand from clients and emphasised the need to meet the challenge, saying hard work brought rewards.\n\"Just remember: if we all go an extra mile for our client, even when we feel that we're reaching our limit, it can really make a difference in our performance,\" he said.\nThe analysts sent their complaints to bosses in February, but it only became public last week.\nMr Solomon said: \"We want a workplace where people can share concerns freely... If there are any issues, do not hesitate to reach out to ask for help.\" He promised to improve working conditions at the firm.\nMr Solomon said: \"I can imagine that many of you saw the presentation that a group of analysts shared with their management recently about their lack of work-life balance.\n\"This is something that our leadership team and I take very seriously.\" He pledged to enforce its \"Saturday rule\" to ring-fence junior bankers' time off from Friday evening into Sunday morning. \nThe world of investment banking is notorious for placing high demands on its employees, with remote working during the pandemic further blurring the lines between the office and home. \nAt Citi, the fourth largest bank in the US, new boss Jane Fraser recently sent a memo designating Zoom-free Fridays and reminding staff to try to schedule calls within traditional working hours.\nShe also added a company-wide holiday at the end of May, citing \"the need for a reset\".\n\"I know, from your feedback and my own experience, the blurring of lines between home and work and the relentlessness of the pandemic workday have taken a toll on our well-being,\" she wrote in the memo. \"It's simply not sustainable.\n\"Please try to limit scheduling calls outside of what had been traditional working hours pre-pandemic and on weekends\u2002(remember those?)\u2002We are of course a global company that operates across time zones, but when our work regularly spills over into nights, very early mornings and weekends, it can prevent us from recharging fully, and that isn't good for you nor, ultimately, for Citi.\"\nShe told staff to speak up \"if you need more time for a reset.\u2002It's not a sign of weakness; we are all feeling the weariness\".\nThe long hours and high pressures of investment banking were thrown into focus in 2015 when a 22-year-old Goldman analyst, Sarvshreshth Gupta, took his own life after complaining of working 100 hours a week and working all night.\nThe 13 Goldman Sachs employees gave striking testimony, which began circulating on social media on Wednesday, detailing five hours sleep a night, harsh treatment by senior bankers and the effects on their physical and mental health. One said: \"I've been through foster care and this is arguably worse.\"\n\"This is beyond the level of 'hard-working', this is inhumane/abuse,\" said another. \nGoldman is far from the only firm where staff are reporting burnout, as the pandemic blurs work-life boundaries.\nNearly 90% of workers say their work-life balance is getting worse, according to a recent survey published by the Harvard Business Review of 1,500 people across 46 countries.\nGoldman said last week in the light of the findings going viral that it had since taken steps to address employee burnout among this small group, and among wider teams.\nMr Solomon's address to staff said: \"We're accelerating our efforts to hire new junior bankers across investment banking and we're internally transferring bankers to business lines where activity levels are highest.\" \nHe added the firm was trying to manage its workload and reorganise some so it would be done automatically:. \"We're also being more selective about business opportunities that we pursue, and we're working to automate certain tasks in our business.\"\nThe investment bank reported net revenues of $44.6bn (\u00a332.1bn) for 2020.

      "tags": "Robert Jenrick,Oliver Dowden",
      "text": "All UK government buildings in England, Wales and Scotland will fly the union flag every day, following new guidance from the culture department. \nCurrently flags are only required to be flown on certain days such as the Queen's birthday.\nCulture Secretary Oliver Dowden described the flag as \"a proud reminder of our history and the ties that bind us\".\nGovernment buildings in Northern Ireland are covered by a separate law.\nThe guidance released by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport department says the union flag should be flown every day - except on those occasions where another flag is being flown. The guidance will only apply from the summer. \nThe announcement comes after BBC Breakfast host Charlie Stayt received criticism for joking during a TV interview about the size of the union flag behind Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick.\nThe union flag first appeared in 1606, after James VI of Scotland ascended to the throne in England in 1603 to become James I.\nThe flag combined the two flags of England and Scotland's patron saints -  the red cross of Saint George and the white cross of Saint Andrew.\nThe red cross of Saint Patrick was later added.\nBack in 2007, Labour MP Ian Lucas unsuccessfully campaigned for the Welsh dragon to be added to the flag. \nIn 2008, then-Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown scrapped a rule that said the union flag could only be flown on certain days. He said it should be left to individual public offices to decide if and when to fly flag. \nOther countries such as Australia and New Zealand - who are members of the Commonwealth -  feature the union flag on their own flag. \nAnnouncing the new guidance, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: \"The union flag unites us as a nation and people rightly expect it to be flown above UK government buildings - this guidance will ensure that happens every day.\"\nMinisters are also urging all local councils to fly the flag, and buildings will also be able to fly the NHS flag without seeking planning permission. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, Conservative MP Sir John Hayes welcomed the move saying: \"I think we just don't fly our flag enough - if you go to capitals of other countries, around the heart of those capitals, particularly government buildings, you routinely see the flag of that country flying. \n\"So it does seem to me something that unifies the country, that brings us together, that allows us to share in our national pride - what's wrong with that? And after this year, bringing the country together around the flag couldn't be more apposite.\"\nHowever the SNP's Mhairi Black said: \"If the Tories think an overload of union jacks on buildings is the answer to promote the strength of the union, then it shows how thin the case for the union is. \n\"Flags won't undo the poverty and hardship the Tories have created over the last decade,\" she said. \nPlaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts said: \"The Tories know that independence for Scotland is inevitable and that Wales will be hot on their heels.\n\"Sticking flags on every street corner will not change that fact, and rather, only reveals their desperate insecurity about the future of the UK\", she said.\nFlag-flying is a contentious issue in Northern Ireland and in 2015 a commission was set up to help find a consensus on flags, emblems and identity.\nThe commission's report was delayed when devolution in Northern Ireland collapsed and although the findings have been submitted they have not yet been published - despite calls from assembly members in Stormont.

      "tags": "Greenhouse gas emissions,Our Planet Now,Energy industry,North Sea oil and gas,Climate change,Oil,Oil & Gas UK,Natural gas",
      "text": "More oil and gas wells are to be drilled in the North Sea, the UK government has announced.\nThe decision has angered environmental campaigners, who say the government should refuse new licences.\nMinisters say permission to drill will be granted as part of a careful transition away from fossil fuels, safeguarding jobs and the economy.\nBut the environmentalists say that enough fossil fuels to ruin the climate have already been found.\nIn light of this, they say, the government should have refused the new licences.\nThey add that the decision undermines the UK position as leader of the vital UN climate conference in November, known as COP26. \nBut ministers insist that their strategy will work. So-called \"checkpoints\" will be introduced that take into account domestic demand for oil and gas, projected production levels, the increase in clean technologies such as offshore wind, and the sector\u2019s progress in cutting emissions.\nThe sector will face targets to reduce emissions by 10% by 2025 and 25% by 2027. It is also committed to cut emissions by 50% by 2030.\nIt will be helped by joint government and private investment of up to \u00a316bn by 2030.\nThis will include up to \u00a310bn for hydrogen production and \u00a33bn for a technology called carbon capture, usage and storage - where carbon emissions are either turned into other products such as plastics or buried.\nThe government says the deal should cut pollution by up to 60 million tonnes by 2030, while also supporting up to 40,000 jobs across the supply chain.\nMel Evans from Greenpeace  said: \u201cThis is a colossal failure. The UK will make a fool of itself in the run-up to hosting the COP26 global climate talks if our energy minister signs off on new oil and gas licences that serve to rip up the Paris Agreement (the world deal to hold global temperature rise to 1.5C).\n\u201cWe know the government has already approved too much oil and gas extraction to meet our climate obligations under Paris, and the oil industry itself says that we\u2019ve passed peak oil demand.\u201d \nDenmark recently announced a decision to reject new licences for oil drilling in the North Sea. \nThe UK Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said he would follow a different path: \u201cToday, we are sending a clear message around the world that the UK will be a nation of clean energy.\n\u201cWe will not leave oil and gas workers behind in the irreversible shift away from fossil fuels. We will power the green industrial revolution, turning its focus to the next-generation clean technologies the UK needs to support a green economy.\u201d\nHe was supported by Deirdre Mitchie, chief executive of Oil and Gas UK, who told BBC News: \u201cOngoing exploration and production is compatible with net zero emissions \u2013 we\u2019re pleased that the government has recognised this.\"\nNet zero means reducing greenhouse emissions as much as possible and then balancing any that remain by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.\nLang Banks, director of WWF Scotland, told BBC News: \u201cEvery new licence makes it more difficult to achieve the reductions we need and risks creating an even bigger \u2018cliff edge\u2019 for oil and gas workers.\n\u201cAs climate science continues to be updated, it\u2019s entirely possible that there\u2019s going to have to be an even quicker tail-off in oil and gas production than is currently predicted.\n\u201cIf we want the transition to be a fair one, then instead of wasting any more time opening up new fossil fuel reserves, efforts would be better used to more rapidly harness existing skills and direct them toward the zero-carbon industries we all need.\u201d\nDetails have also been given about the UK\u2019s previously-announced plans to stop funding overseas projects that directly support fossil fuels \u2013 that will now happen at the end of March. \nIt will see the UK cease export finance, aid funding and trade promotion for new crude oil, natural gas or thermal coal projects.\nHowever, a controversial gas scheme in Mozambique will still go ahead because it has already been approved.\nIn the last four years, the government supported \u00a321bn of UK oil and gas exports.\nThe need to protect workers in oil and gas has been stressed by an independent group studying Scotland\u2019s transition to a clean economy. \nThe so-called Just Transition Commission warns that creating a near-zero carbon future means a fundamental transformation of the nation\u2019s economy that must be implemented fairly. \nIt says the transition must be made by the people of Scotland, not done to the people of Scotland. And the shift must be a \u201cnational mission with social justice at its heart\u201d. \nThe commission - recruited by the Scottish government from industry, trades unions and academia - says worker education and skills training will be vital.\nIt says the great move towards low carbon must be done in co-operation with the unions.\nFollow Roger on Twitter."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Italy,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The UK and the European Union have said they are working together to improve their relationship, after weeks of tensions over Covid vaccine supplies.\nIn a joint statement, they said they wanted to \"create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all\".\nThe European Commission earlier proposed tougher export controls on vaccines, amid tensions over supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson warned that \"blockades\" were not \"sensible\".\nThe joint UK-EU statement said that \"openness and global co-operation\" would be key to tackling the pandemic.\n\"We are all facing the same pandemic and the third wave makes co-operation between the EU and UK even more important,\" it said. \"We will continue our discussions.\"\nBut there was little harmony earlier on Wednesday when the Commission announced plans for all vaccine shipments to be assessed on the destination country's rate of vaccinations and exports. The proposals, which will be put before EU leaders on Thursday, are seen as focused on the UK and US in particular.\nThe tone of the EU-UK statement was positive, but actual progress between the two sides was described to me by an EU diplomat as \"slow, cumbersome and difficult\". On both sides. \nThat doesn't mean impossible, but at their summit on Thursday, some EU leaders - along with the European Commission - will still be pushing for tougher controls on vaccine exports. And they could hit the UK. \nEU insiders say they had hoped never to use the controls. They say they want them as a means of exerting pressure on vaccine companies and on countries with vaccine production sites that are not exporting to the EU. \nWith a third wave of the pandemic hitting much of mainland Europe, EU leaders are coming under increasing pressure to show voters they are taking action to ramp up both the supply of jabs and their vaccine rollout, on both of which they are trailing behind the UK.\nEU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides rejected a suggestion that the aim was to punish the UK. \"We're dealing with a pandemic and this is not seeking to punish any countries,\" she said.\nAsked whether the UK might retaliate, Mr Johnson told MPs he did not believe \"that blockades of either vaccines or of medicines, of ingredients for vaccines\" would be \"sensible\". Companies might draw conclusions about future investments \"in countries where arbitrary blockades are imposed\", he added.\nMeanwhile, in other developments:\nThe tougher export controls are most like to affect countries that have higher vaccination rates than the EU, such as the UK and US. \nThe key criteria for the proposed regulations are \"reciprocity\" and \"proportionality\":\nThere will be no outright export bans, which are opposed by countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium. \nVaccine manufacturers would be assessed to see if they were fulfilling their contract with the EU, although no specific algorithm is planned.\nIn an interview with the BBC, the EU's Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton insisted the bloc's issues were with AstraZeneca and not the UK government. \"I know that there's some tension... but as long as we have transparency, I think [relations] will be able to be normalised,\" he said.\nHe said if AstraZeneca had provided the agreed 120 million doses to the EU, member states would have been at the same rate of vaccination as the UK: \"We have been heavily penalised and we just want to understand why\". \nAstraZeneca denies that it is failing to honour its contract with the EU.\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"We are all fighting the same pandemic. Vaccines are an international operation; they are produced by collaboration by great scientists around the world. And we will continue to work with our European partners to deliver the vaccine rollout.\"\nLast week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen complained that the EU had exported more than 10 million doses to the UK, but the UK had so far exported none in return.\nHer colleagues added that this had to be seen in the context of the EU being both a global Covid hotspot and also the biggest exporter of vaccines. Since the end of January, EU countries have exported 43 million doses of vaccine to 33 countries not subject to export authorisation, they say.\nUK sources insist vital components are being sent to the continent, for example for the Pfizer vaccine, and they have emphasised the UK's role in investing early in vaccine development, BBC correspondent Nick Beake reports."

      "tags": "Mars,Nasa,Nasa Perseverance Mars rover,Ingenuity Mars helicopter",
      "text": "The US space agency says it expects now to fly the first helicopter on Mars in early April.\nThe little chopper was carried to the Red Planet by the Perseverance rover, which made its dramatic landing in Jezero Crater just over a month ago.\nCalled Ingenuity, the 1.8kg, twin-rotor aircraft will attempt a series of short hops in Mars' rarefied air.\nIf successful, it would represent something of a \"Wright Brothers moment\", says Nasa. \nThis is a reference of course to Orville and Wilbur Wright, who in 1903 conducted the historic first heavier-than-air, powered aircraft flight here on Earth.\nAnd to mark the connection, the agency revealed that a postage stamp-sized piece of fabric from a wing of the brothers' plane has been taped to Ingenuity.\nAt the moment, the chopper is still attached to Perseverance, to its belly. A protective covering was released at the weekend and in the coming days the craft will be lowered to the ground.\nEngineers have identified a 10m by 10m area in Jezero that they're calling the \"airfield\".\nThis is at one end of a 90m \"flight zone\", inside which perhaps five sorties will be performed.\nPerseverance will endeavour to record everything on camera.\n\"We are going to do our very best to capture Ingenuity in flight,\" said Nasa engineer Farah Alibay.\n\"We're going to be taking images, we're hoping to take video.\"\nThis will be challenging, she cautioned. Both rover and helicopter function autonomously and carry separate clocks. The timing devices will need to be in sync for the photography to catch the action.\nIngenuity is built to be extremely light. It has to be in order to achieve lift in the thin atmosphere of Mars.\nIt features four specially made carbon-fibre blades, arranged into two 1m-long rotors that spin in opposite directions at around 2,400 revolutions per minute. That is many times faster than the blades would turn on a passenger helicopter here on Earth.\nEngineers plan for the first flight to be a simple one that sees the chopper rise to about 3m above the ground, hover and turn for about 30 seconds, before then setting back down.\nIf everything goes well, subsequent flights will get more complex. \n\"Currently, the way that we're planning is for the first three flights to demonstrate basic capability - to hover and then to traverse, going to a longer distance down the flight zone and back again,\" Havard Grip, Ingenuity's chief pilot, told BBC News.\n\"If everything goes really well, we might try to stretch our capabilities. But we haven't planned that in detail.\"\nAsked whether the team might attempt something dramatic for a final flight, he declined to speculate.\nLori Glaze, who directs Nasa's planetary science efforts, said Ingenuity could open up possibilities for future aerial exploration.\n\"Could we image areas not visible from space or that a rover couldn't reach? Could a helicopter scout ahead for rovers and help plot the most efficient course for the best science? Could we support future human missions with aerial capabilities?\" she pondered. \n\"Those are questions for another day, but tech demos give us the leeway to be creative and test new things.\"\nNasa has approved a mission called Dragonfly that will use a robotic rotorcraft to fly across the surface of the Saturnian moon Titan in the 2030s.\nThe Soviets were the first to fly air vehicles on another world with their Vega balloons in the atmosphere of Venus in the 1980s."

      "tags": "Calais migrant crisis,English Channel,Refugees and asylum seekers,Europe migrant crisis",
      "text": "At least 27 people have drowned crossing the English Channel by boat.\nRecord numbers of migrants have attempted the journey in recent months.\nThe UK sends Border Force ships out to spot small boats - but there is little they can do other than rescue people in danger. \nEarlier this week France announced an extra \u20ac11m (\u00a39.3m) worth of equipment and 100 vehicles to tackle smuggling along the coast. \nThat kit includes beach-ready quad bikes and zodiac boats, very fast small vessels favoured by the military. Teams have also been given more night-vision equipment to help identify people hiding in sand dunes. \nFrance has cancelled this weekend talks on the issue after Boris Johnson published a letter to President Macron. In it the PM said France should take back migrants who have crossed the Channel.\nFrance insists it's doing all it can to stop crossings. Interior minister Gerald Darmanin said the French authorities stopped 671 migrants on Wednesday alone.\nCalais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont told the BBC it wasn't realistic to think police officers could patrol 200-300km [125-186 miles] of coastline 24 hours a day, given \"it only takes five to 10 minutes to take a boat and fill it with migrants\".\nThe UK has pledged to give France \u20ac62.7m (\u00a354m) during 2021-22 to help increase police patrols, boost aerial surveillance and strengthen security at ports. It's being paid in instalments, which have started.\nThe two countries have also set up a joint intelligence group, which has contributed towards 94 investigations. \nThere have been 65 small boat-related prosecutions in England since 2020 - and nearly 300 arrests in France.  \nIn November more than 1,000 people arrived in a single day, for the first time.\nMore than 25,000 people have crossed the Channel so far this year - but that figure doesn't tell the whole story.\nNearly 45,000 people sought asylum in the UK in the most recent year for which we have data. So, the number who cross the Channel in boats are only part of the total.\nThe UK receives less than half of the asylum applications which France gets. \nMost refugees stop in the country bordering their own: there are about 3,700,000 displaced Syrian people in Turkey. The UK has taken in less than 1% of that number through resettlement or asylum from Syria since 2014. \nIf migrants are found in UK national waters, it is likely they will be brought to a British port. \nIf they are in international waters, the UK will work with French authorities to decide where to take them. Each country has search-and-rescue zones.\nThe distance between Dover and Calais, where many migrants cross, is just 20 miles, and none of it counts as international waters. \nOnce migrants are in the UK, they are usually taken to short-term holding centres.\nUnder international law, people have the right to seek asylum in any country they arrive in. They don't have to seek asylum in the first safe country reached.\nHowever, an EU-wide law called Dublin III, allows asylum seekers to be sent back to the first member state they were proven to have entered. \nBetween 1 January 2019 and 1 October 2020, 231 migrants who crossed the Channel were returned to mainland Europe using Dublin III.\nHowever, the UK is no longer part of this arrangement since leaving the European Union. The UK has not agreed a scheme to replace it, making the transfer of migrants more difficult. \nImmigration minister Tom Pursglove told MPs on 17 November that only five people had been returned to mainland Europe so far in 2021.  \nPriti Patel has authorised Border Force officials to turn back boats carrying migrants to the UK in limited circumstances.\n\"Push back at sea\" is a tactic that is used in Australia. However, France has not co-operated with the UK's approach.\nAs soon as the boats leave French waters - which the UK authorities cannot enter without France's consent - and enter the UK's, they are subject to the protection of UK law, says Prof Andrew Serdy, a maritime law expert. \n\"If France doesn't want to take them back once they have left, it cannot be forced to do so and a stand-off ensues.\" \nA boat can also only be pushed back if it's clear that doing so won't endanger lives, which could be difficult to prove with a small dinghy.\nBut speaking in the House of Commons, the home secretary said she \"had not ruled anything out\" and gave the example of \"Greece in terms of push-backs\", adding that the Greeks use the military including special forces as well as the coastguard to achieve this.\nMany of the migrants crossing the English Channel claim asylum once they arrive in the UK. Asylum seekers hope to receive refugee status, meaning they can stay. \nThey must prove they cannot return to their home country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender identity or sexual orientation. \nTheir asylum application can include their partner and any children under 18, if they are also in the UK.\nDecisions are made by a caseworker. They consider things like the country of origin of the asylum seeker, or evidence of discrimination. \nThis is supposed to be done within six months, although most wait longer.\nAnyone granted refugee status can remain in the country with their dependants for five years. After that, they can apply to settle in the UK.\nAlternatively, they may get permission to stay for other humanitarian reasons. This means they do not qualify for refugee status but are nevertheless at risk of serious harm on return to their country of origin due to:\nFamily members not already in the UK can apply to join those with refugee status or humanitarian protection.\nThey may also be given permission to stay for other reasons - for example, if they are an unaccompanied minor or a victim of trafficking. How long they can stay will depend on their situation.  \nIn 2020, more than 36,000 people, including dependents, applied for asylum in the UK.\nAbout 10,000 were offered refugee status or other protections. \nBoth of these figures were down on the previous year, probably due to the impact of coronavirus. \nWhile an asylum claim is being processed, people are given financial help towards their living costs.\nAsylum seekers aren't allowed to work - or take formal unpaid positions such as internships - unless they have waited more than a year for a decision. They can, however, volunteer to help charities or community organisations.\nThis controversial rule is aimed at preventing people applying for asylum as a route to work in the UK. Critics say it prevents refugees integrating into communities and wastes the skills they have brought with them.\nAsylum seekers cannot choose where they live. Most are initially placed in hostel-type accommodation before moving to longer-term housing.\nMuch of this accommodation has previously been criticised by the immigration watchdog.\nAsylum seekers can get a cash allowance of \u00a339.63 per week for each household member, with extra support available for vulnerable groups such as children or pregnant women.\nAsylum seekers with an active application are entitled to free healthcare and children must attend school. \nIf asylum isn't offered and no other reason to stay in the UK is accepted, the person will be asked to leave the UK, either voluntarily or by force. \nThey can appeal against the decision. Around 30% of appeals were accepted between 2004 and 2020, meaning those individuals were allowed to stay.\nMigrants can receive legal aid for these appeals, which can sometimes take years, as well as continued financial and housing support.

      "text": "The man who looked at compensation for victims of Libyan-sponsored attacks by the IRA has said he understands disappointment at the government ruling out payments.\nWilliam Shawcross was appearing on Wednesday before MPs at the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee.\nHe said he had \"huge sympathy\" for the victims.\nMr Shawcross said when he took on the job he understood his 90-page report would not be published.\nHe described it as an internal scoping exercise.\nHe said he was \"surprised and disappointed\" by Tuesday's government statement, which ruled out using \u00a312bn of frozen Libyan assets to compensate IRA victims.\nMr Shawcross said his report made three recommendations, but his contract with the government meant he was limited in what he could tell the committee.\nHe said he did not identify exactly how many victims may have been murdered or injured using weapons, such as Semtex explosives, provided by the Gaddafi regime.\nThere has been a long-running campaign for compensation, with victims' hopes raised when Mr Shawcross was appointed by government to examine the issue in 2019.\n\"I am aware of the agony of people's expectations in Northern Ireland. It was brought home to me,\" he said.\n\"I have huge sympathy for all the victims of Gaddafi-IRA terrorism and all the victims in Northern Ireland and they deserve to be looked after.\n\"Raised expectations over years and years is a terrible thing amongst the victims.\"\nHe is the man the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee has been chasing for months, but even before William Shawcross joined the Zoom call MPs had given up hope of getting the answers they wanted.\nAs expected, Mr Shawcross quickly declared that he could not disclose details of the report he was summoned to talk about because of his contractual obligations to the government.\nSo we ended up with lots of questions but very few answers.\nHis appearance before the committee was also spiked by Tuesday's government statement ruling out any move to compensate victims with the \u00a312b of frozen Libyan assets.\nRead more here.\nFormer Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's regime supplied large amounts of weapons to the IRA during the Troubles.\nIts Semtex explosives were used in numerous murders, such as the Enniskillen Remembrance Day bombing in 1987 and the 1996 attack in London's Docklands.\nIn a written statement to Parliament on Tuesday, Minister for the Middle East and North Africa James Cleverly said the \"internal scoping report\" was commissioned to provide advice to ministers and draws on \"private and confidential conversations\". \nThe report set out why the government is legally unable to access \u00a312bn in frozen Libyan assets to compensate the victims.  \nMr Cleverly said the \"frozen assets may not be seized by the UK government\".\nHe also ruled out using public funds to pay compensation to victims and then recouping the money from the Libyan government.\nHe said the responsibility for providing compensation lies with the Libyan state and the government had urged the authorities at the \"highest level\" to engage with UK victims.\nBut Mr Cleverly added there were \"clear practical difficulties\" in obtaining compensation from Libya because of the ongoing political and economic instability.\nHe suggested victims should avail of the current injury compensation schemes in the UK and he also pointed to the Troubles victims pension, which may provide another avenue for compensation.\nDUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds accused the government of \"behaving disgracefully\" and letting down victims of IRA terrorism.  \n\"In 2004, Libya agreed to pay $1m compensation to the families of each of the 170 people killed in the bombing of UTA flight 772 in 1989,\" he said. \n\"The German government secured $35m for those killed in the 1986 bombing of the La Belle discotheque in Berlin.\n\"After all these years, our citizens have received little more than warm words and sympathy. \n\"This should be a point of embarrassment for the government. We will be challenging the government further on this matter in Parliament.\"\nKenny Donaldson, of Innocent Victims United, said: \"For two years the UK government has been responsible for heaping further pain upon those already treated so shamefully. \n\"The Shawcross Report can't even be described as a 'whitewash' because it continues to be held back from victims, the full contents remain hidden.\"\nSolicitor Barry O'Donnell, who represents some of the victims, added: \"It would appear that today's ministerial statement is another piece of political choreography designed to undermine the authority of NI Affairs Committee and to frustrate the hopes and expectations of victims and survivors of Gaddafi-Libyan sponsored IRA terrorism.\""

      "tags": "NHS Scotland",
      "text": "NHS staff in Scotland are to be offered a pay rise of at least 4%, the Scottish government has confirmed.\nNurses, paramedics and domestic staff are among those who could receive the boost to their salaries. \nHealth Secretary Jeane Freeman said the average pay of a front-line NHS nurse would rise by over \u00a31,200 a year. \nShe said the offer - which does not apply to doctors - recognised the \"service and dedication\" of staff during the pandemic\nThe settlement will be backdated to 1 December 2020 in recognition of an \"exceptional year of significant pressure\".\nIt follows the \u00a3500 thank you payment for all health and social care workers which was announced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in November.\nEarlier this month Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended plans to give some NHS staff in England a 1% pay rise.\nHe praised \"heroic\" health and social care workers but said the rise was as much as the government could afford during the \"tough times\" of the pandemic. \nMs Freeman described the Scottish government's offer as \"the biggest single pay uplift since devolution\" for NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) staff.\nAfC is the current grading and pay system for\u00a0NHS\u00a0staff. It does not include doctors, dentists, executives and senior managers. \nAcross cycles of economic growth and contraction, public sector pay remains stable while private sector pay is more volatile - racing ahead in the good times, taking the bigger hit and redundancies when they turn tough.\nSo when private employer competition for skilled workers is lower, public sector pay increases can be reined in.\nHowever, the Scottish government has opted to boost pay, going against that cycle and in contrast with the 1% offered to NHS staff in England.\nComing at the end of a three-year 9% pay deal, the cost looks to be about \u00a3135m next year, and unlike the \u00a3500 one-off NHS payment last year, it is baked in to future pay rises.\nNHS staff have political support, so it makes sense ahead of an election. However, with a balanced budget required, a pound spent on pay cannot be spent on others who have been at the Covid battlefront - for instance, care home workers, those in the voluntary sector, welfare benefits for unpaid carers.\nA further consideration in NHS pay is that demand for scarce skills is on the rise, without easy access to EU labour, with doctor retirement, many GPs working part-time and loss of medical expertise overseas. This is one sign of the measures the NHS has to take to ensure it recruits and retains the staff it needs.\nShe added that it would benefit 154,000 staff and including domestic staff, porters and health care support workers.\nThis group, which she described as \"the backbone of our services\" would see pay rises of more than \u00a31,000, the equivalent of between 4% and 5.4%. \nThose on the highest salaries will receive a \u00a3800 pay rise. \nMs Freeman said: \"This has been an exceptionally challenging year for our health service and I am pleased that the Scottish government is able to recognise the service and dedication of our healthcare staff.\"\nThe announcement follows ongoing negotiations between the Scottish government, NHS employers and unions, who will now consult their members on the offer.\nAnd the offer is significantly higher than the pay rise proposals for other public sector workers.\nThis is not just a bumper pay offer for many NHS workers in Scotland, it is a powerful negotiating tool for health unions trying to prise more cash from the UK government. \nIt is hard to imagine nurses and other healthcare staff in England settling for a proposed 1% rise when their colleagues in Scotland are receiving 4%. \nThat contrast will presumably not go unnoticed by the independent pay review panel in England which is due to make its recommendations in May. \nIn Scotland, details of the new pay offer were released just hours before the start of the Holyrood election campaign, during which governments are obliged to avoid making big spending announcements. \nIt may lead to a wider debate in the campaign about how other public sector workers are rewarded and the support available to those in the private sector struggling as a result of the Covid crisis. \nIn her budget, Finance Secretary Kate Forbes announced a 3% rise for people earning under \u00a325,000, with 1% for people earning up to \u00a380,000 a year.\nShe called it a \"progressive and restorative approach\" but unions said it was disappointing after a year of working through the pandemic.\nColin Poolman, Royal College of Nursing Scotland senior officer, said: \"The timescale for negotiations was tight as a result of the forthcoming election but we have now received an offer for a one year pay deal.\"\nWillie Duffy, Unison regional organiser, said that each of the individual trade unions would now enter into discussions with their members on the offer.\nHe told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"There will be a view that it's not enough but we managed through the negotiations to get extra money into the pay envelope.\"\nHe also compared the offer to the 1% offered in England by the Westminster government.\nHe said: \"It shows the stark difference between the two governments and their attitude to trying to deal with health service workers.\"\nAll of Scotland's main opposition parties have made the NHS a central part of their appeals in the forthcoming Holyrood election.\nThe Scottish Conservatives have promised to deliver an increased share of funding to GPs.\nScottish Labour's health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said the NHS pay offer was welcome but it did not consider social care workers, whom she called \"the unsung heroes of the pandemic\".\nMs Baillie said Scottish Labour was committed to a wage rise to \u00a315 an hour for the social care workforce, with an immediate increase to \u00a312 an hour.\nThe Scottish Greens have pledged support for a properly funded publicly-owned NHS Scotland while the Scottish Liberal Democrats are promising a \"decent\" pay rise for NHS staff.

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nMore than 6,000 cases of Covid-related fraud and cyber-crime have been recorded and \u00a334.5m has been stolen during the pandemic in the UK. The Action Fraud team says that sum has been stolen since 1 March 2020, with the activity only covering England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Many of the scams involved conning people out of their money and financial details by focusing on internet shopping. The National Cyber Security Centre also reveals it is tackling about 30 \"significant\" attacks a month against the country's pandemic response infrastructure including the NHS, vaccine producers and vaccine supply chains.\nBoris Johnson has told a private meeting of Tory MPs that the success of the UK's Covid vaccine programme was because of \"capitalism\" and \"greed\". But sources say the prime minister had \"very insistently\" withdrawn his comments straight after making them during a Zoom call with backbenchers.  A government source says Mr Johnson was referring to the profit motive driving companies to develop new products and the remarks were not connected to the EU row over vaccine supply. The PM also reportedly praised work by large drug companies during the pandemic.\n\"There are definitely days when it's pretty tough.\" Alex is one of 1.74 million people currently out of work in the UK. She's been unemployed for most of the pandemic after being made redundant from her role at a finance company in March last year. At the start of the pandemic Alex's partner also lost his job and they moved in with his parents in London. \"When I first got made redundant, I was terrified. But then Covid took over.\"\n\"I'm grinning and bearing it but that doesn't mean it's easy.\" Raggie El-Koumos has lived on his own in Cornwall for the last 17 years, after his wife, Linda, died from cancer. Being alone \"is ok\", he says, \"but being lonely... it hurts, and Covid-19 is not helping that at all.\" After conducting a year-long inquiry into loneliness, a group of MPs and peers is calling on the prime minister to commit to helping people reconnect socially when planning England's recovery from coronavirus.\nThe year anniversary of the first UK lowdown was marked with candlelight vigils across the country last night.

      "text": "The world's largest painting, which was created by British artist Sacha Jafri, has been sold for \u00a345m to raise funds for children's charities.\nJafri spent eight months painting the 1,600 sq m (17,000 sq ft) artwork in a deserted hotel's ballroom in Dubai.\nHe planned to sell it in 70 parts, but French cryptocurrency businessman Andre Abdoune has bought the whole work.\nThe price makes it one of the most expensive paintings ever sold at auction by a living artist.\nJafri said the full $62m (\u00a345m) would go to Dubai Cares, Unicef, Unesco and the Global Gift Foundation to help disadvantaged children in countries like Brazil, India, Indonesia and South Africa.\nThe 44-year-old artist from London originally hoped to raise $30m (\u00a322m). He told BBC News he was \"blown away\" to have doubled that.\n\"I was really overwhelmed by what happened - to raise that amount of money from one painting in one night,\" he said.\nJafri started by putting out an appeal for children to send him their pictures representing how they felt during the pandemic. He got responses from 140 countries, which he used for inspiration, he said.\n\"I was in a deep meditative state. I looked through all the [children's] work - I paint from the subconscious, and then whatever's in there comes out. Nothing's planned. There's no sketches. There were no drawings.\n\"I was literally pouring paint, and then putting another layer on top and another layer, another layer, another layer, just feeling my way through it until something magical happened.\"\nIn September, Guinness World Records recognised it as the largest ever art canvas.\nJafri worked on his own while the Atlantis hotel was closed to visitors, and needed an emergency operation on his spine during the process, as well as injuring his pelvis and feet.\n\"I was on my feet but bent right down so my brush can touch the floor,\" he explained. \"So that's a pretty bad position to be in for 20 hours a day. I was in a trance, so I didn't realise the damage I was doing to my body.\"\nThe painting, titled The Journey of Humanity, was sold in Dubai on Monday.\nJafri said the money would be spent on healthcare and sanitation for \"the poorest communities in the world\" and to connect them to the internet so children can have access to educational platforms. \"The biggest divide at the moment is those with the internet and those without,\" he said.\nThe buyer \"has a beautiful vision\" for the work, the artist said. \"His vision now is he wants to build a museum to house the painting.\"\nThe pair will \"set up a foundation together\" that will \"inspire the next generation to be inspired by art, to avoid the nonsense of the art world\", he added.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "The UK and the European Union have said they are working together to improve their relationship, after weeks of tensions over Covid vaccine supplies.\nIn a joint statement, they said they wanted to \"create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all\".\nThe European Commission earlier proposed tougher export controls on vaccines, amid tensions over supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson warned that \"blockades\" were not \"sensible\".\nThe joint UK-EU statement said that \"openness and global co-operation\" would be key to tackling the pandemic.\n\"We are all facing the same pandemic and the third wave makes co-operation between the EU and UK even more important,\" it said. \"We will continue our discussions.\"\nBut there was little harmony earlier on Wednesday when the Commission announced plans for all vaccine shipments to be assessed on the destination country's rate of vaccinations and exports. The proposals, which will be put before EU leaders on Thursday, are seen as focused on the UK and US in particular.\nThe tone of the EU-UK statement was positive, but actual progress between the two sides was described to me by an EU diplomat as \"slow, cumbersome and difficult\". On both sides. \nThat doesn't mean impossible, but at their summit on Thursday, some EU leaders - along with the European Commission - will still be pushing for tougher controls on vaccine exports. And they could hit the UK. \nEU insiders say they had hoped never to use the controls. They say they want them as a means of exerting pressure on vaccine companies and on countries with vaccine production sites that are not exporting to the EU. \nWith a third wave of the pandemic hitting much of mainland Europe, EU leaders are coming under increasing pressure to show voters they are taking action to ramp up both the supply of jabs and their vaccine rollout, on both of which they are trailing behind the UK.\nEU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides rejected a suggestion that the aim was to punish the UK. \"We're dealing with a pandemic and this is not seeking to punish any countries,\" she said.\nAsked whether the UK might retaliate, Mr Johnson told MPs he did not believe \"that blockades of either vaccines or of medicines, of ingredients for vaccines\" would be \"sensible\". Companies might draw conclusions about future investments \"in countries where arbitrary blockades are imposed\", he added.\nMeanwhile, in other developments:\nThe tougher export controls are most like to affect countries that have higher vaccination rates than the EU, such as the UK and US. \nThe key criteria for the proposed regulations are \"reciprocity\" and \"proportionality\":\nThere will be no outright export bans, which are opposed by countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium. \nVaccine manufacturers would be assessed to see if they were fulfilling their contract with the EU, although no specific algorithm is planned.\nIn an interview with the BBC, the EU's Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton insisted the bloc's issues were with AstraZeneca and not the UK government. \"I know that there's some tension... but as long as we have transparency, I think [relations] will be able to be normalised,\" he said.\nHe said if AstraZeneca had provided the agreed 120 million doses to the EU, member states would have been at the same rate of vaccination as the UK: \"We have been heavily penalised and we just want to understand why\". \nAstraZeneca denies that it is failing to honour its contract with the EU.\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"We are all fighting the same pandemic. Vaccines are an international operation; they are produced by collaboration by great scientists around the world. And we will continue to work with our European partners to deliver the vaccine rollout.\"\nLast week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen complained that the EU had exported more than 10 million doses to the UK, but the UK had so far exported none in return.\nHer colleagues added that this had to be seen in the context of the EU being both a global Covid hotspot and also the biggest exporter of vaccines. Since the end of January, EU countries have exported 43 million doses of vaccine to 33 countries not subject to export authorisation, they say.\nUK sources insist vital components are being sent to the continent, for example for the Pfizer vaccine, and they have emphasised the UK's role in investing early in vaccine development, BBC correspondent Nick Beake reports."

      "tags": "Economics,Inflation,UK economy,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "Sharply lower clothes prices and cheaper second-hand cars caused an unexpected fall in the UK's inflation rate in February.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate fell to 0.4% last month, down from 0.7% in January.\nEconomists had expected inflation to rise slightly, driven by increasing fuel and energy prices.\nBut the impact of rising fuel costs was offset by downward pressures in other areas, including travel costs and toys.\nFebruary is traditionally a month where clothing prices would rise. But ONS deputy national statistician, Jonathan Athow said: \"The impact of the pandemic has disrupted standard seasonal patterns.\"\nClothing and footwear prices fell between January and February for the first time since 2007 and are 5.7% lower than a year before, the biggest annual decline since November 2009. \nThe ONS said second-hand car prices had been rising during 2020 as people sought alternatives to using public transport.\nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon, said that despite inflation's \"sudden drop due to temporary weakness in clothing prices\" he still expected the rate to exceed 2% later this year. \n\"The lockdown has left clothing retailers with considerable excess stock to shift. Clothing prices likely have rebounded this month, now that retailers have introduced new seasonal ranges,\" he said.\nHannah Audino, economist at PwC, said that as lockdowns ease, inflation will tick higher as consumers \"unleash some of the \u00a3150bn of excess savings on the economy\" built up during 2020.\n\"Businesses will also be looking to recoup lost revenues from the past year, although the extension to the VAT cut for the hospitality and leisure sector will continue to exert some downward pressure on prices,\" she said. \nMany economists had predicted inflation would rise slightly in February to about 0.8%, driven higher by a big rise in fuel prices.\nThe ONS said that between January and February petrol prices rose by 3.6 pence per litre, and diesel prices rose by 3.4 pence per litre. Fuel prices fell in the same period last year.\nCrude oil prices have been rising, which is expected to feed through into even higher costs at the pump, and household energy bills are also increasing after suppliers raised prices.\nWednesday's data came a week after the Bank of England had warned that the inflation rate would approach its 2% target level in the coming months, mainly due to energy price increases.\nThe BoE also left record-low interest rates at 0.1% last week and forecast that economic growth would recover towards pre-Covid levels this year. \nThat expectation of faster growth was underlined on Wednesday in a survey that indicated the pace of new orders being placed by companies was increasing.\nThe IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index rose to a seven-month high of 56.6 in March from 49.6 in February, which was much higher than economists' forecasts. A figure above 50 denotes expansion.\nIHS chief business economist Chris Williamson said the surge in order activity, along with recent better news on jobs growth, \"point to robust economic growth in the second quarter, especially if virus restrictions are lifted further\"."

      "text": "A six-year-old girl has been shot dead in Myanmar, becoming the youngest known victim in the crackdown following last month's military coup.\nKhin Myo Chit's family told the BBC she was killed by police while she ran towards her father, during a raid on their home in the city of Mandalay. \nMyanmar's military has been increasing its use of force as protests continue.\nRights group Save the Children says more than 20 children are among dozens of people who have been killed.\nIn total, the military says 164 people have been killed in protests, while the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group puts the death toll at at least 261. \nThe military on Tuesday expressed sadness at the death of protesters, while blaming them for bringing anarchy and violence to the country.\nBut security forces have used live rounds against protesters, and there have been multiple eyewitness reports of people being beaten and sometimes shot as the military conducts house raids to arrest activists and protesters.\nKhin Myo Chit's older sister told the BBC police officers had been searching all the houses in their neighbourhood in Mandalay on Tuesday afternoon, when they eventually entered their place to search for weapons and make arrests. \n\"They kicked the door to open it,\" 25-year-old May Thu Sumaya said. \"When the door was open, they asked my father whether there were any other people in the house.\" \nWhen he said no, they accused him of lying and began searching the house, she said. \nThat was the moment when Khin Myo Chit ran over to their father to sit on his lap. \"Then they shot and hit her,\" May Thu Sumaya said.\nIn a separate interview with community media outlet Myanmar Muslim Media, their father U Maung Ko Hashin Bai described his child's last words. \"She said, 'I can't Father, it's too painful'.\"\nHe said she died just half an hour later while she was rushed away in a car to seek medical treatment. Police also beat and arrested his 19-year-old son.\nThe military has yet to comment on the death. \nIn a statement, Save the Children said it was \"horrified\" by the girl's death, which came a day after a 14-year-old boy was reportedly shot dead in Mandalay.\n\"The death of these children is especially concerning given that they reportedly were killed while being at home, where they should have been safe from harm. The fact that so many children are being killed on an almost daily basis now shows a complete disregard for human life by security forces,\" the group said.\nMeanwhile on Wednesday, authorities released around 600 detainees held at Insein prison in Yangon (Rangoon), many of them university students. \nAssociated Press journalist Thein Zaw was among those freed. He and other journalists had been held covering a protest last month.\nThe AAPP says at least 2,000 people have been arrested in the crackdown so far.\nProtesters have planned for a silent strike with many businesses to close and people to stay at home. There are also plans for more candle-lit vigils overnight, both in Yangon and elsewhere. \nCorrection 1 April 2021: An earlier version of this article gave Khin Myo Chit's age as seven years old. While in Myanmar's counting tradition this is correct, as the BBC uses Western conventions for age we have amended the article to describe her as a six-year-old girl."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Places of worship in Scotland can reopen immediately after Covid regulations forcing their closure were deemed unlawful.\nA group of 27 church leaders launched a judicial review at the Court of Session arguing the Scottish government acted beyond their emergency powers.\nLord Braid agreed the regulations went further than was lawfully allowed. \nThe ruling was issued with \"immediate effect\" so churches - but also mosques, synagogues and temples - can open now.\nIt comes just two days before communal worship is due to resume under the next phase of lockdown easing. \nLawyers for the Scottish government had argued that it was forced to make the changes as the Kent variant of Covid was more transmissible. \nThe Scottish government said it would carefully consider the findings and its implications. \nLord Braid said those who brought the judicial review were entitled to have the regulations  declared unlawful.\nHe said the Scottish government regulations disproportionately interfered with the freedom of religion secured in the European Convention on Human Rights.\nHe added: \"It is impossible to measure the effect of those restrictions on those who hold religious beliefs. It goes beyond mere loss of companionship and an inability to attend a lunch club.\"\nHowever, the judge emphasised that he was not saying that coming together for worship was safe. \n\"I have not decided that all churches must immediately open or that it is safe for them to do so, or even that no restrictions at all are justified,\" he said.  \n\"All I have decided is that the regulations which are challenged in this petition went further than they were lawfully able to do, in the circumstances which existed when they were made.\" \nRev Dr William Philip, senior minister at the Tron Church in Glasgow, welcomed the ruling.\nHe said: \"From the outset we have recognised the serious decisions the Scottish Ministers had to take in response to the pandemic. \n\"However, its approach to banning and criminalising gathered church worship was clearly an over-reach and disproportionate and if this had gone unchallenged it would have set a very dangerous precedent.\n\"However well intentioned, criminalising corporate worship has been both damaging and dangerous for Scotland, and must never happen again.\"\nAndrea Williams, chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre, said she was \"thankful and relieved\" that the court had recognised what she described as a \"dangerous interference\".\nShe added: \"The fundamental principle of freedom has prevailed with a strong dash of good old common sense.\"\nAdditional party Canon Tom White's argument that the regulations were disproportionate on constitutional grounds was also found to be the case by Lord Braid.\nCanon White, parish priest of St Alphonsus Church in Glasgow, said: \"I'm overjoyed to hear that the court has understood the essential need to protect not only the physical and material health of our society but also its spiritual needs and therefore overturned the disproportionate, unnecessary and unlawful blanket ban on public worship.\"\nOn hearing that the restrictions would be lifted immediately, Canon White confirmed he would hold a Covid-safe Mass at St Mary's RC church in the east end of Glasgow on Thursday morning.\nCommunal worship was already due to resume from\u00a0Friday in time for Passover, Easter, Ramadan and Vaisakhi. \nUp to 50 people will be able to attend if the place of worship is large enough to facilitate 2m social distancing, an increase from the limit of 20 people which had applied pre-lockdown. \nA Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"We acknowledge this opinion and will now carefully consider the findings, its implications, and our next steps. Court proceedings are ongoing and it would be inappropriate to offer any further comment at this stage.\""

      "text": "Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has survived a vote of no confidence at Holyrood over her government's handling of complaints against Alex Salmond.\nA Holyrood committee inquiry has concluded that there were \"serious flaws\" in the government's approach.\nThe confidence vote was tabled by Tory MSP Ruth Davidson, who said nobody had taken responsibility for the failures.\nBut MSPs voted by 65 to 31 to reject the motion, with the Greens backing the SNP and Labour and Lib Dems abstaining.\nMs Sturgeon said she \"may not have got everything right\" in her handling of the matter, but insisted that she \"acted appropriately and made the right judgements overall\".\nAnd she told opposition parties that if they wanted to remove her they should do it in the forthcoming election on 6 May, adding: \"It is now time for the country to decide.\"\nThe Holyrood inquiry - which was set up in 2019 after the government conceded its handling of complaints against Mr Salmond had been unlawful - published its report earlier on Tuesday, stating that women had been badly let down by the failed process.\nA majority of members said Ms Sturgeon had misled the inquiry in her evidence, and said they found it hard to believe that she was not aware of concerns about Mr Salmond's alleged behaviour before November 2017.\nHowever an independent investigation by Irish lawyer James Hamilton concluded on Monday that Ms Sturgeon had not breached the ministerial code.\nHe said Ms Sturgeon had given an \"incomplete narrative of events\" to MSPs, but that he believed this was a \"genuine failure of recollection\" and not deliberate.\nThe Scottish Conservatives had tabled a motion of no confidence in Ms Sturgeon before either report had been published - saying that \"overwhelming\" evidence of wrongdoing had already emerged.\nMs Davidson, the party's leader at Holyrood, told MSPs that \"nobody has taken responsibility for the multiple failings at every level which occurred\".\nShe said that Ms Sturgeon \"should not feel able to continue in post\", and that \"the honourable thing would be to resign\".\nMs Davidson said: \"The committee found that Nicola Sturgeon misled this parliament. Nothing can erase that fact, however inconvenient it is to the first minister and her supporters.\"\nThe best time for the opposition to call a no confidence vote is when they have enough support to win and can force a minister from office. \nThat has never been a realistic prospect for the Conservatives in their efforts to oust Nicola Sturgeon. \nWhen they first announced plans for a vote the day before the first minister gave evidence to the Holyrood committee, it was clear she could see off their challenge with support from the Greens. \nWhen she was cleared of breaking the ministerial code by the Hamilton inquiry, her position strengthened. \nBy pressing on regardless, the Tories managed to divide the opposition - with Labour and the Liberal Democrats refusing to vote with them and abstaining instead. \nThe Tories say that makes them the only party strong enough to take on the SNP. \nBut in enabling Nicola Sturgeon to comfortably win a confidence vote today they've given her a pre-election boost after some of her toughest weeks in office. \nMs Sturgeon said she \"may not have got everything right in my handling of this situation\", but said she would \"reject entirely any suggestion of misleading this parliament\".\nAnd she said she would have resigned if Mr Hamilton had found she breached the code.\nHowever she said she had been \"cleared of any breach of the ministerial code\", and told Ms Davidson: \"If you think you can bully me out of office you are mistaken and have misjudged me.\n\"If you want to remove me from office as first minister, do it in an election\".\nMs Sturgeon said she had been accused of \"conspiracy against, collusion with and cover-up on behalf of Alex Salmond\", but that \"none of that is supported by evidence because none of that is true.\"\nThe first minister was backed by Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie, who said the inquiry had become a \"farce\" and accused opposition members of the committee of \"destroying the credibility of their own work\".\nBoth Labour and the Lib Dems abstained in the final vote, meaning only the Conservatives backed the motion.\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said there had been a \"litany of failures\" by the government, but said the Tories were \"only interested in getting a scalp\" and \"grubby party politics\". \nHe said: \"This is a day of shame for our parliament. Scotland deserves a better government and a better opposition.\"\nMeanwhile Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said \"nobody wins from this ugly debate\", and that the confidence debate and motion \"cannot be the end\" of the matter."

      "text": "An Australian festival has apologised for commissioning an artwork that would have seen the UK flag soaked in indigenous people's blood.\nThe work, titled Union Flag, from Spanish artist Santiago Sierra will now not be shown at the Dark Mofo festival.\nIt had sparked condemnation after being included in the programme last week.\nThe festival had asked for \"First Nations peoples from countries claimed by the British Empire\" to volunteer to donate small amounts of blood.\nSierra said the installation aimed to convey the pain and destruction caused by colonialism.\nBut critics, among them several Aboriginal Australians, variously called the work \"abusive\", \"tone-deaf\" and \"re-traumatising\".\nThey noted in particular the setting of the festival in Tasmania - an island state with a history of massacres of Aboriginal people by white settlers in the 19th Century.\n\"To ask First Nations people to give blood to drench a flag recreates, not critiques, the abhorrent conditions of colonisation,\" said indigenous artist Cass Lynch.\nAnother critic wrote online: \"How you do not see the hypocrisy in asking First Nations people to donate their blood to a white artist and in the same breath highlighting that this is stolen land is beyond me.\"\nThe artist had planned for the flag to be \"immersed\" in a vat of blood and hung up for the festival.\nThe festival director initially defended the work against criticism, saying \"self-expression is a fundamental human right\".\n\"We support artists to make and present work regardless of their nationality or cultural background,\" Leigh Carmichael said on Monday.\nBut as the backlash escalated, Mr Carmichael issued an apology the next day and said Dark Mofo would cancel the work. \n\"We've heard the community's response to Santiago Sierra's Union Flag. In the end the hurt that will be caused by proceeding isn't worth it,\" he said.\n\"We made a mistake, and take full responsibility.\"\nSeveral indigenous artists have called for him to resign.\nDavid Walsh, the Australian billionaire owner of the festival, also apologised, and said he had earlier received a letter of complaint from staff about the work.\n\"[I] didn't see the deeper consequences of this proposition,\" David Walsh admitted. \"Naively, perhaps incredibly, I thought it would appeal to the usual leftie demographic.\"\nMr Walsh said he believed in \"the right to express an opinion even... when experience is lacking\", but agreed with critics that \"my ignorance does not empower me\".\nMany people argued the work was \"performative activism\".\n\"How about instead of propping up a white artist's take on colonialism you support Indigenous artists who are actively fighting against this oppression,\" one critic said online.\nWhile many online have welcomed the decision, others, including fans of Sierra's, criticised the festival's concession.\nSierra posted an image to Facebook after the cancellation which read: \"Often the slave defends the symbols of the master.\"\nThe European artist is known for his provocative art pieces on human suffering. \nHis previous works have included featuring drug-addicted sex workers with a line tattooed on their backs and casting sculptures from human faeces."

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has said he does not consider North Korea's launch of short-range missiles - the first since he took office - a provocation.\nMr Biden added that defence officials called it \"business as usual\".\nNorth Korea is said to have fired non-ballistic cruise missiles, which do not flout UN Security Council resolutions, over the weekend.\nThe incident happened after Pyongyang criticised the US and South Korea for conducting joint military exercises.\nIt also comes as Biden's administration continues to attempt to make contact with North Korea.\nThe launch, originally reported by US media, has since been confirmed by US officials and the South Korean defence ministry.\nSouth Korea said two cruise missiles were fired into the Yellow Sea early on Sunday from Onchon in North Korea.\nResponding to reporters' questions on Tuesday night, Mr Biden said: \"We have learned that nothing has changed.\"\nWhen asked if he considered the test a provocation, he said: \"No, according to the Defence Department, it's business as usual. There's no new wrinkle in what they did.\"\nUN Security Council resolutions, which have resulted in strict sanctions on North Korea, have only banned Pyongyang from firing threatening weapons such as ballistic missiles.\nThis is no \"fire and fury\" from North Korea.\nIt's true that every test of a missile by Pyongyang helps improve its military capabilities and that is always a concern to the international community. \nBut cruise missile tests are not a breach of UN Security Council sanctions and North Korea has bigger weapons in its arsenal if it really wanted to challenge the Biden administration. \nThe current focus of the new White House team and its allies is the impending review on North Korea policy.\nDecades of sanctions and three summits between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un have failed to prevent Pyongyang from developing a larger and more deadly nuclear arsenal.\nSo President Biden is most likely shrugging off this latest missile test for good reason -  there's a much bigger challenge ahead.\nSenior US officials have separately said they considered the launch \"normal military activity by the North\".\nThey added they were in the \"final stages\" of their North Korea policy review and planned to host Japan and South Korea's national security advisers for a discussion soon.\nThe US government had previously said it had been trying for weeks to make diplomatic contact with North Korea.\nPyongyang has yet to acknowledge that President Biden is now in office, and the two countries remain at loggerheads over the North's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.\nDuring Mr Biden's election campaign, he called Mr Kim \"a thug\" and said North Korean nuclear disarmament had to happen before US and UN economic sanctions could be relaxed."

      "tags": "Keir Starmer,Boris Johnson,British Army,Ben Wallace",
      "text": "Sir Keir Starmer has criticised the prime minister for \"breaking a promise\" not to cut British Army troops.\nDuring Prime Minister's Questions, the Labour leader quoted Boris Johnson from the 2019 election campaign, where he pledged to maintain the Army's size.\nBut Sir Keir said this week's defence review would now see numbers fall by 10,000 as part of government plans.\nMr Johnson said the government was increasing spending on defence \"by the biggest amount since the Cold War\".\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace confirmed on Monday that the size of the Army will be reduced to 72,500 soldiers by 2025 as part of a major overhaul of the Armed Services. \nHe said a move towards drones and cyber warfare would mean an \"increased deployability and technological advantage\" for the UK, and see a greater effect delivered by fewer people.\nBut the SNP said the reduction in troop numbers \"undermines our Armed forces\" and sees the Tories \"break their election commitment\". \nThe 2019 Conservative manifesto itself does not mention troop numbers, but pledges to \"continue to exceed the Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence and increase the budget by at least 0.5% above inflation every year of the new Parliament\".\nHowever, during the manifesto launch in the general election campaign, Mr Johnson said that his party would \"not be cutting our Armed Services in any form\" if they won the vote.\nSir Keir began PMQs by asking him why he made the promise.\nMr Johnson said: \"That was because what we were going to do was actually increase spending on our Armed Services by the biggest amount since the Cold War - \u00a324bn modernising our Armed Forces with no redundancies, keeping our Army at 100,000 if you include the reserves.\"\nBut Sir Keir said the defence secretary had been \"absolutely clear\" in his statement this week that numbers would fall, adding: \"Only this prime minister could suggest that a reduction from 82,000 to 72,000 is somehow not a cut.\"\nMr Johnson insisted his government had \"kept our promise\" and attacked members of Labour's frontbench for their position on renewing the UK's nuclear deterrent. \nHe added: \"There will be no redundancies, and if you include reserves, we are even keeping the Army at 100,000.\n\"But on top of that we are doing what is needed to modernise our Armed Forces, taking them into the 21st century.\n\"We are doing all the difficult things Labour shirked during their time in office.\"\nSir Keir accused him of \"playing with the numbers\", adding: \"You just cant trust the Conservatives to protect our Armed Forces.\" \nAnd responding to the PM's accusation that Labour had been \"consistently weak on protecting this country\", the Labour leader said: \"What's weaker is making a promise to our Armed Forces just before the election, then breaking it and not being prepared to admit it - not having the courage to admit it.\"\nHe called on Mr Johnson to put his defence policy to a vote in the Commons.  \nIn response, Mr Johnson said the Tories were \"pro-vax, low tax and when it comes to defence, we've got your backs\". \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer raised Monday's announcement of a reduction to the size of the Army, saying Boris Johnson had promised at the last election not to cut the armed forces \"in any form\".\nHe's right. In November 2019, at the launch of the Conservative manifesto - when answering questions after his speech - Mr Johnson said: \"We will not be cutting our armed services in any form - we will be maintaining the size of our armed services.\"\nThis was reported by several papers, including The Sun, which also included the video of Mr Johnson saying it. \nBut that promise wasn't in the 2019 Conservative manifesto.\nOn Monday, the Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced that: \"I have therefore taken the decision to reduce the size of the Army from today's current strength of 76,500 trained personnel to 72,500 by 2025\".  \nIn his reply to Sir Keir, the prime minister spoke of increased defence spending. There was a pledge in the 2019 manifesto to \"increase the [defence] budget by at least 0.5% above inflation every year of the new Parliament\". \nThe spending plan for the Ministry of Defence announced last November will achieve that on average until 2025, based on inflation forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility."

      "text": "The rollout of Covid vaccines in European Union (EU) countries is picking up speed, with more than 300 million jabs  administered.\nAs of 20 June, nearly half of the EU's adult population have had at least one one dose, while 28% have been fully vaccinated.\nEarlier this year, the rollout was hit by delays in production and distribution and vaccine hesitancy in some countries.\nIn the week to 20 June 2021, Germany administered an average of 1 dose per 100 people a day, with Italy and France close behind on  0.9 dose per 100 people - all higher than the UK's 0.6 per 100.\nHungary - which is using Russian and Chinese vaccines as well as the EU-approved ones - has fully vaccinated 46% of its population, the same proportion as the UK. \nIn France, children who are 12 and over can be vaccinated, with parental consent. The government is hoping to avoid class closures when schools reopen after the summer holidays. \nThe EU authorised the use of the Pfizer vaccine in children aged 12-15 at the end of May. \nGermany said it would give it to those aged 12-17 with pre-existing conditions while a number of other EU countries said they would vaccinate children before the start of the next academic year.\nIn June 2020, all 27 member states joined a scheme giving the EU central responsibility for buying vaccines.\nHowever, the EU was slower than the UK to negotiate a contract with AstraZeneca and there were supply problems.\nIts deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna also saw early problems with production and distribution.\nIn February, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the EU's vaccine difficulties, saying: \"We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time.\" \nIn January 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all age groups, but a number of EU countries initially refused to recommend its use for people over 65.\nFrance and Germany eventually revised their stance and approved the vaccine for 65-74 year olds at the beginning of March.\nThey were again among 13 European countries who paused the AstraZeneca rollout again later in March, following reports that a small number of people developed blood clots after receiving the jab. \nOn 7 April, the EMA said there was a \"possible link\" between the vaccine and the clots, although it is still recommended the jab for all age groups. \nSeveral EU countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands now say only people over 55 or 60 should get the jab, while others like Denmark have suspended its use altogether. \nThe headlines surrounding AstraZeneca led to a drop in confidence in the jab. In March, the polling company YouGov suggested that only a third of Germans and 23% of French respondents considered it safe.\nThe EU took AstraZeneca to court to force it to deliver more doses of vaccine. The company blamed production problems but said it had \"fully complied\" with its contract.\nThe EU lost its legal battle. It had wanted AstraZeneca to deliver 120 million doses by the end of June but a court ruled that the company must instead provide 80 million doses by the end of September. \nThe EU said the UK has had an unfair advantage in contracts it signed with vaccine manufacturers, some of whom have plants in the EU.\nEU leaders considered a ban on exports of vaccines to the UK but decided not to introduce one.\nInstead, they called for more transparency from the UK and other countries on the number of doses they export.\nThe EU says that by 1 June 2021, it had exported 245 million doses to 46 different countries. \nUnder the terms of the EU scheme, member states are not supposed to strike deals with any vaccine manufacturer with whom the EU already has an agreement, but they can make separate deals with vaccine makers which have not signed agreements with the EU.\nHungary has been using Russia's Sputnik vaccine for months and and Slovakia has also bought doses of it.\nGermany said in April it would begin talks to secure supplies of the Russian vaccine and Austria said it would buy one million doses, but only once the EU's medicines agency approves the jab for use in the EU. \nThe Czech Republic and Poland have entered talks with both Russia and China.\nThe UK approved the Pfizer vaccine in November 2020, nearly three weeks before EU regulators. \nThe government claimed that being outside the EU allowed it to be more nimble in this area. \nHowever, the UK's approval of the vaccine would have been permitted anyway under EU law - a point made by the head of the UK medicines regulator.\nThe UK could have joined the EU vaccine scheme last year while it was still in a transition phase with the EU, but it chose not to. \nIf it had, the UK might not have been able to do as many deals with vaccine companies."

      "tags": "Home Office,Priti Patel,Refugees and asylum seekers",
      "text": "Ministers are considering converting disused ferries moored off the coast to process people seeking asylum in the UK.\nAccording to Refugee Action, 35,566 asylum applications were made in the UK in 2019 - down from a peak of 84,000 in 2002.\nDowning Street said it was looking at what other countries do \"to inform a plan for the UK.\" \nLabour called the proposal to process people on ferries \"unconscionable\".\nThe most senior civil servant at the Home Office, Matthew Rycroft, said \"everything is on the table\" when it comes to \"improving\" the UK's asylum system.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel asked officials to look at policies, including housing people who are seeking asylum offshore.\nOn Tuesday, the Financial Times reported the Foreign Office had carried out an assessment for Ascension Island, a remote UK territory in the Atlantic Ocean  - which included the practicalities of transferring migrants thousands of miles - and decided not to proceed.\nNow the Times reports that the government is giving \"serious consideration\" to the idea of buying retired ferries and converting them into processing centres, but it says the Home Office rejected a proposal to use decommissioned oil platforms in the North Sea. \nThe paper also says processing migrants on an island off the coast of Scotland had been considered, but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that \"any proposal to treat human beings like cattle in a holding pen will be met with the strongest possible opposition from me\".\nAppearing before the Public Affairs Committee, Permanent Secretary Mr Rycroft said he would not comment on leaks to newspapers, but that the department was \"brainstorming\" ideas.\nHe said: \"We've been looking at what a whole host of other countries do in order to bring innovation into our own system. \n\"No decisions have been taken.  No final proposals have been put to ministers... this is in the realm of the brainstorming stage of a future policy.\"\nMr Rycroft said the UK would \"always comply with all of our international obligations\" and civil servants would \"assess all of the various different possible ideas out there to see which are legal and which make operational sense\u2026 so that ministers can ultimately make decisions\".\nHow does the government tempt fewer people to attempt a perilous crossing of the Channel to reach the south coast?\nWell, one idea is to make it clear that even a successful crossing won't mean getting to stay in the UK - at least in the short term.\nThe government is exploring \"all sorts of options\" - not my words, but those of the most senior civil servant in the Home Office.\nHence the recent headlines about transferring asylum seekers to a lump of British rock in the middle of the South Atlantic - Ascension Island, or buying an old ferry to house them.\nBut remember, although the numbers coming over the Channel in boats are at a record high, they are still a small proportion of overall asylum seekers coming to the UK. \nAnd rows about asylum are far from new.\nTwenty years ago, it was the then-Home Secretary, Jack Straw, found himself in a row with his own party about what the Labour government should do about the issue.\nSo this is an historic problem for parties of both colours.\nLabour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said Labour would oppose any move to use ferries, adding: \"Even considering this is appalling.\" \nHe accused the government of \"lurching from one inhumane and impractical idea to another\" and claimed it had \"lost control and all sense of compassion\". \nThe SNP's home affairs spokeswoman, Joanna Cherry, said the leaked plans showed \"the callousness at the core\" of the government, and the plans would \"treat vulnerable asylum seekers as cattle rather than human beings\".\nBut Conservative MP for Gravesham in Kent, Adam Holloway, said the Home Office was \"completely right\" to be looking at other options that were \"some sort of deterrent\" for asylum seekers.\nHe told Radio 4's Today programme: \"We need to break the link in people's minds that if you get to Britain you're going to stay in Britain, you're going to stay in a hotel and you're going to be accommodated.\"\nHe added that the UK needed to find a \"civilised version\" of the model used by Australia, which has controversially used offshore processing and detention centres for asylum seekers since the 1980s.\nThe discussion comes as record numbers of people are crossing the Channel to the UK, with 400 arriving in one day in September.\nA Home Office source said this week that ministers were looking at \"every option that can stop small boat crossings and fix the asylum system\", but no final decisions had been made.\nNearly 7,000 people have reached the UK in more than 500 small boats this year - by 23 September, 1,892 migrants had arrived during the month, more than in all of 2019.\nBut they are still a small proportion of the asylum seekers coming to the UK. \nTory MP Natalie Elphicke, who represents Dover, said the government had been \"clear they are going to take whatever action is necessary to put a stop to these small boat crossings\".\nShe told the BBC No 10 and the Home Office were looking at a \"whole range of things\" to address the \"draw factor\" of the UK, \"from cruise ships and ferries through to offshore fast track assessment centres, through to changing the immigration law\".\nEarlier in the Commons, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove told Parliament the government was \"actively looking at the steps that we can take\" to stop illegal crossings in the English Channel so the UK can \"maintain our commitment to providing a safe haven\" but also \"safeguard our borders\".\nTo be eligible for asylum in the UK, applicants must prove they cannot return to their home country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender identity or sexual orientation.\nA caseworker decides if they have a valid claim by taking into account factors such as the country of origin of the asylum seeker or evidence of discrimination.\nThis is supposed to be done in six months but delays in processing claims have increased significantly in the last year.\nWhile waiting for a decision to be made, asylum seekers are usually not allowed to work and are initially placed in hostel-type accommodation before longer-term housing is arranged."

      "tags": "UK devolution,Abortion,Brandon Lewis,Abortion in Northern Ireland",
      "text": "The decision to introduce new powers compelling Stormont to implement abortion laws has not been taken lightly, Brandon Lewis has said. \nThe government has published regulations allowing the NI secretary to direct commissioning of central abortion services in NI. \nAbortion was decriminalised in 2019, but full services have been stalled. \n\"We have used every opportunity and avenue to encourage progress,\" said Mr Lewis.\nMr Lewis said the government is \"disappointed with the continuing failure to commission abortion services\". \nHe added that the devolution settlement did not absolve the government of its responsibility to uphold the rights of women and girls. \n\"Our strong preference remains for the Northern Ireland Executive to take responsibility itself for upholding these rights,\" Mr Lewis said. \n\"It has always been our expectation and preference that the Department of Health would drive forward the commissioning of abortion services.\"\nEarlier the government said giving the NI secretary the powers was a \"necessary and appropriate\" step.\nThe regulations - which come into force on 31 March - state that Mr Lewis is acting as required to uphold legal and human rights duties on NI abortion services.\nStormont's Department of Health has said the matter is \"controversial\" and any decision on abortion services must be made by the whole executive.\nEighty-eight MPs - including SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, the party's South Belfast MP Claire Hanna and Alliance's Stephen Farry - have offered cross-party support for the NI secretary's move in a letter to Stormont ministers.\nHowever, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has criticised it and said it would have \"serious consequences\" for devolution.\nIn an interview with BBC News NI on Tuesday, North Antrim MP Ian Paisley said a \"dangerous game\" is being played.\nMr Paisley said: \"If the government is going to cherry pick elements of the New Decade, New Approach agreement, if it is going to cherry pick other issues and force them on to Northern Ireland, it does not augur well for those of us who may be in a position to influence what matters the Northern Ireland Executive decides to take on next.\"\nThe abortion law issue should be removed from the order paper and \"therefore there will be no tit for tat\", he added.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was \"so unfair\" that women have been denied access to \"modern and compassionate healthcare services\".\n\"It should be this executive that decides and makes sure that we deliver these services,\" Ms O'Neill said. \n\"I very much urge the health minister to commission the services.\"\nThis unusual move by Brandon Lewis can be viewed two ways.\nThose opposing it have accused London of a power grab, overriding locally-elected ministers on an issue that has been devolved to Stormont for more than a decade.\nThose in support say the government has an overarching responsibility to ensure the services - already provided for in law by MPs - are set up properly.\nLimited provision is taking place - more than 1,000 terminations have been carried out here since the laws changed last March.\nBut medical staff involved have been working without direction, resources and no funding meaning not every woman or girl seeking the services, can actually access them.\nIt is this that the government says it's trying to rectify, though Brandon Lewis would undoubtedly still prefer the executive to resolve it.\nHe has effectively placed the parties on notice that he will act if they do not. \nHowever, even stronger is the possibility this could all end up being resolved by the courts before the politicians.\nAlliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw welcomed the move by Brandon Lewis, but added it should not have been necessary. \n\"Abortion is a conscience issue for Alliance but this matter is about what should be the first duty of an executive - to ensure the law is implemented properly and fairly,\" Ms Bradshaw said. \n\"This episode once again shows why fundamental reform of the cross-community veto is long overdue.\"\nAbortion was decriminalised in Northern Ireland in 2019, and changes to NI's abortion laws came into force in March after Westminster acted during a period when the power-sharing institutions at Stormont were suspended. \nHowever, the commissioning of full services has been delayed.\nStormont and Westminster are facing legal action from the Human Rights Commission over this delay.\nThe regulations provide Mr Lewis with the powers, but they will need to be debated in both houses of Parliament - within 28 sitting days - to remain in force.\nLatest figures from the Department of Health show that since abortion regulations came into force at the end of March last year, 1,345 terminations have taken place. \nThe department added that full provision of services will require \"substantial additional investment\" from the government. \nThe letter from MPs backing the government's plan was drawn up by Labour MP Stella Creasy, who brought the initial amendment in 2019 that led to the changes to Northern Ireland's abortion laws.\nIt is addressed to Stormont's first and deputy first ministers, Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill, and Health Minister Robin Swann.\nIt states that it is \"disappointing\" the current laws have not been implemented, and that women and girls in Northern Ireland are entitled to have access to \"safe, legal and local abortion services should they wish to access them\".\n\"As parliamentarians from many different parties, we respect and value the devolution settlement of the United Kingdom, and are determined it must never be used to deny the human rights of any woman including those of women and girls in Northern Ireland,\" it adds.\n\"The secretary of state will therefore have our support for this action, and we urge you to commission abortion services urgently.\"\nThe changes meant abortion laws in Northern Ireland altered significantly last year, with terminations available in all circumstances of the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\nIt is legal in other circumstances up to 24 weeks and beyond that for cases of non-fatal fetal disabilities and fatal fetal abnormalities.\nAt present, health trusts are carrying out interim services for early medical abortions up to 10 weeks, meaning women seeking a termination beyond that are required to travel to England.\nThe Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is challenging the UK government, the Northern Ireland Executive and NI's Department of Health for delaying the commissioning of all services.\nThe case is due to be heard by Belfast High Court at the end of May.\nThe DUP, which opposed the changes to the abortion laws by Westminster, has proposed a piece of legislation at Stormont seeking to restrict abortions in cases of non-fatal disabilities.\nIt passed its second reading last week with the support of a number of parties.\nSinn F\u00e9in abstained on that vote, but has separately called for the Department of Health to commission full abortion services as required under the regulations.\nThe Alliance Party, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists view the issue as a matter of conscience for individual assembly members.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann has insisted that he, alone, cannot commission abortion services, according to legal advice the executive received from Stormont's Attorney General Brenda King.\nOn Monday, Mr Swann told the assembly that as it was deemed a \"controversial\" matter under the terms of Stormont's ministerial code, he had a duty to ensure any proposals to commission services had consensus of the whole executive.\nThe code states issues which are \"significant or controversial\" must be brought to the executive.\nSinn F\u00e9in Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has said she also intends to raise the issue at Thursday's executive meeting."

It's unlikely residents will notice any difference as they go about their daily lives - the bins will still get emptied, the pot holes will still get filled in (although not as quickly as some would like).\nBut behind the scenes, one of the key stipulations is that the elected mayor and council might be unable to spend cash on property transactions without the formal consent of the commissioner, which could have significant ramifications. \nAnother dramatic change is also to come: the proposed shrinking of the council chamber from 90 to just 30 elected councillors, who would all face elections at the same time.\nIn a statement, a Liverpool City Council spokesman said the authority took the report's findings into its highways, regeneration and property management functions \"extremely seriously\" and was committed to addressing \"all the concerns raised\".\nHe added that the report made clear that since the arrival of chief executive Tony Reeves in 2018, the council had \"already taken steps to address the issues\".\nMr Reed told the BBC the public would be \"rightly shocked\" about the report.\nHe said Mr Jenrick made it clear that the \"vast majority\" of the council's politicians and staff were \"honest hard-working, dedicated public servants\".\nHe added that he was \"determined to make sure the council continues to run its own business,\" adding: \"We do not want this to define the council or the city.\"\nActing mayor Wendy Simon said the report was \"deeply unsettling\" and she was \"truly shocked\" by the contents.\nBut she was \"really pleased\" at the level of commissioners coming in and \"that they are coming in at an advisory manner\". \nShe said it was important to \"take collective responsibility\" and for all councillors, regardless of political party, come together.  \n\"We know it is a long road ahead to build that trust.\"\nMr Anderson said: \"Under my leadership of eleven years as leader and as the mayor of Liverpool, our city has been transformed... into a northern powerhouse. \n\"Today's headlines do not reflect the dramatic success that we have generated. I want to digest fully today's report before commenting on specific details.\"\nCouncillor Richard Kemp, leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition group at the council, said the inspection had \"exposed grotesque practices\".\nCouncillor Tom Crone, leader of the council's Green Party group, said the city's Labour leaders should \"resign as one\".\n\"Any administration with even an ounce of shame would resign immediately and allow the city to start afresh,\" he added.\nConservative mayoral candidate Katie Burgess said it was \"disappointing that Labour mismanagement has seen the government have to take action to protect the people of Liverpool\".\nIndependent mayoral candidate Stephen Yip said the findings painted an \"appalling picture\" but applauded the \"courageous and honest\" council staff who provided evidence to inspectors.\nHe added he was grateful there was no \"Whitehall takeover\".\nTrade Union and Socialist Coalition candidate Roger Bannister said while he had \"great concerns\", he was \"opposed to the imposition of unelected commissioners taking power away from democratically elected representatives\". \nLiberal Party candidate Steve Radford told the Local Democracy Reporting Service there were \"no great shocks\" in the report and he \"did not need a government inspector to tell me that intimidation has been going on for decades\".\nInspectors were sent in by the local government secretary following allegations of fraud, bribery, corruption, misconduct in public office and witness intimidation at the council.\nAll five men who were arrested deny any wrongdoing and have not been charged with any offence.\nMerseyside Police said the men were no longer on bail, but remained under investigation.\nMr Jenrick reiterated elections would still go ahead in Liverpool in May, with the following candidates for mayor announced so far:\nThe Labour party is due to announce its candidate on 29 March.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "UK immigration,Immigration,Priti Patel,Refugees and asylum seekers",
      "text": "The home secretary has set out what she has called a \"fair but firm\" overhaul to the way people applying for asylum in the UK are treated. \nPriti Patel said, for the first time, people seeking protection as refugees would have their claim assessed based on how they arrive in the UK. \nShe said ministers would crack down on people smugglers because \"enough is enough\".\nLabour said the plans lacked compassion and competence.\nUnder the changes, people who arrive in the UK by what the government call illegal means to claim asylum will no longer have the same entitlements as those who arrive through proper channels.\nThere were 35,099 asylum claims made in the UK during the year ending March 2020, with Iran, Albania and Iraq providing the most applicants.\nMore than 8,000 people crossed the Channel in small boats, with the help of people smugglers. \nSetting out the plans to MPs, Ms Patel said the government would introduce a \"faster and fairer\" system that would \"better support the most vulnerable\". \nMs Patel said \"serious organised criminal gangs\" were exploiting people trying to get to the UK, and that it was these same gangs who were also involved in \"serious violent crimes\" in the UK such as trafficking guns and drugs.\n\"Families and young children have lost their lives at sea, in lorries and in shipping containers having put their trust in the hands of criminals,\" she added.\n\"The way to stop these deaths is to stop the trade in people that causes them.\"\nShe said the new measures will create \"safe and legal routes\", and that people should be claiming asylum in the EU country in which they first arrive, rather than using it as a springboard to reach the UK.\n\"If you illegally enter the UK via a safe country in which you could have claimed asylum, you are not seeking refuge from imminent peril, as is the intended purpose of the asylum system, but are picking the UK as a preferred destination over others,\" she said. \nShe said the system was currently \"clogged up\" with bogus claims and legal wrangles. \nBut human rights lawyers have warned the plans are unlawful because they ignore Britain's international obligations under the Refugee Convention.\nLabour said the proposals would do \"next to nothing to stop people making dangerous crossings\" or to deal with criminal gangs.\nThere are two enormous legal elephants trumpeting away in the shiny glass atrium of the Home Office that are casting some really significant doubts on whether the home secretary's plan is deliverable.\nFirstly, can she treat some refugees who have a recognised case for protection differently from others, purely based on how they reached the UK?\nUnder the UN Refugee Convention (which, history fans, the UK government helped write in 1951) states can't penalise people in need who come \"directly\" from their homeland - or anyone who has \"good cause\" to enter a nation illegally. \nOfficial sources say Ms Patel's restrictions would be legally possible because asylum seekers are not allowed to go \"shopping\" for the best destination.\nBut even if the restrictions are introduced, and the Home Office wants to send people back to France or elsewhere, how is that going to happen?\nThe UK has no legal agreement with EU nations to take these people back. \nAnd that's because we chose to leave it as part of Brexit. The BBC has learnt that the Home Office has not sent any failed asylum seekers back to EU states since the end of the Brexit transition three months ago.\nThe home secretary's plans for asylum rely on striking agreements with other safe countries who would be willing to take people who have passed through their territory on the way to the UK.\nLabour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told MPs the changes proposed by the government \"risk making the situation even worse for victims of human trafficking as it would make seeking help in the UK even harder\". \n\"The government policy is defined by a lack of compassion and a lack of competence, the plans risk baking in to the UK system the callousness of this government's approach,\" he said.\nResponding to Ms Patel's pledges, Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon accused the government of \"seeking to unjustly differentiate between the deserving and undeserving refugee\" by giving protection \"based on how they travel to the UK\".\nMadeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, said it was \"slightly misleading to say people have a choice between the legal and illegal route\" adding \"for many people the clandestine means will be their only way to get to the UK\".\nShe also said there would be \"complex issues\" about whether other countries would be willing to take back asylum seekers deemed to have arrived in the UK via irregular routes.\nAsked if any EU states had agreed to take people back, Ms Patel replied that she was currently in discussions with those countries.\nThere was support from Conservative MPs in the Commons, including West Bromwich MP Shaun Bailey who said: \"Just like my constituents, I'm angry at the images that we're seeing of small boats coming into the Channel and the sky-rocketing costs of our asylum system.\n\"The broader issue here is this: our European neighbours need to step up. It's as simple as that.\"\nThe Home Office said that \"for the first time\" the question of whether asylum seekers enter the UK via another \"safe\" country, such as France would \"have an impact\" on how it dealt with claims.\nThe government would seek the \"rapid removal from the UK\" of rejected applicants, with appeals \"reformed to speed up\" the process, it added.\nBut asylum seekers fleeing persecution or violence and coming to the UK via the \"legal resettlement\" route from countries such as Syria and Iran would straight away get permission to remain in the UK indefinitely, the Home Office said.\nUnder the new plans, anyone who pays criminal gangs to bring them to the UK would only ever receive temporary permission to remain and would be regularly assessed for removal from the UK.  \nOther proposals include bringing in \"rigorous\" age checks to stop adults entering the country by pretending to be children.\nThe use of hotels to accommodate arrivals will end and the government will bring forward plans to expand the \"asylum estate\".\nMs Patel said asylum applicants with criminal records who returned to the UK after being deported would receive a jail sentence of up to five years. The current maximum is six months.\nAnd people smugglers - responsible for shipping many of the 8,500 people who crossed the English Channel in small boats last year - could get life sentences."

      "tags": "Birmingham,Stoke-on-Trent,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Two patients were moved to a hospital 300 miles away, because of intensive-care bed shortages during the second UK coronavirus wave, BBC News has learned. \nAn unprecedented 2,300 intensive-care patients moved between UK hospitals from September 2020 to March 2021, in search of beds, data shows. \nFront-line doctors, speaking for the first time, say these transfers were the only way to care for patients. \nNHS England said the health service had responded well under intense pressure.\nIn January this year, the UK's four chief medical officers put out a joint statement saying: \"Without further action, there is a material risk of the NHS in several areas being overwhelmed.\"\nAnd measures were taken to cope with the increased demand:\nBut ICU staff reported specialist nurses, who normally look after one patient each, were caring for three, four or - in one instance - five. \nAnd data from the UK's Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) shows almost three times more patients than usual were moved to different hospitals - sometimes hundreds of miles away from their home.\nBetween September 2018 and March 2019, in comparison, there were just 789 such transfers. \nIn London, one of the \"hotspots\" for transfers, doctors set up their own schemes to organise the movement of patients.\nCritical-care consultant Dr Mamoun Abu-Habsa was instrumental in setting up a pandemic transfer service before the second wave hit.\nForeseeing the pressures ICUs could face, he sourced an ambulance and equipment, and trained nurses and doctors so they could accompany patients being transferred.\nWhere hospitals were close to capacity, Dr Abu-Habsa said, moving patients made a huge difference to their care.\n\"We were taking patients across from hospitals that were close to their critical levels of oxygen supply, or the last ventilated bed, to hospitals that were under somewhat less pressure,\" he said.\n\"That was absolutely life-saving.\"\nFew NHS staff have been prepared to speak out about the extent of patient transfers during the second wave, because of the sensitivities around moving such fragile patients because of bed shortages. \nBut Dr Abu Habsa wants people to know how carefully the transfers were handled - and why doctors felt they had no choice.\n\"No-one wants their patients to be taken away from them to complete their journey of care at another centre,\" he told BBC News. \n\"That's not how you are wired as a medical professional. \n\"But they were also very acutely aware that under the circumstances the particular hospitals were under, that was the only option to preserve access to life support.\"\nThe latest figures show one in eight patients had to be moved from hotspots in London and the Midlands, with more than a quarter of these travelling long distances.\nAmong the furthest were:\nIn January, the lord mayor of Stoke-on-Trent's chauffeur, Ashley Harvey, was admitted to the city's hospital, with severe breathing difficulties due to Covid-19.\nDays later, despite being in an induced coma and on a ventilator, he was transferred to Salford hospital - one hour away. \nHis family say they were told it was to make room for a surge of patients coming up from the South.\n\"I'm aware that they had nine patients come from London, who were having a displacement of patients coming into the hospitals up and down the country - somebody would have made a difficult decision,\" Mr Harvey said \nHis daughter Louise was home from university when the family were told Ashley was being moved.\n\"They were saying that he was well enough to do that journey - and make space for someone that's worse,\" she said. \n\"It's insane to think that someone could be worse, because he was very poorly,\" but that \"sort of gave us a bit of hope\", she added.\nIn Birmingham, Dr Nitin Arora, a leading member the Intensive Care Society, said, at the worst point, 40% of ICU patients in some hospitals had to be moved - and without the transfers, more people would have died. \n\"We would have seen scenes like in Italy, triaging by age, scenes like New York, where some hospitals had mortality rates five times higher than others because they were working on a seven-to-one ratio,\" he said. \n\"The transfer service was one of the winners in this pandemic.\"\nThe UK has a relatively low proportion of intensive-care beds compared with similar countries - and the pandemic pushed that capacity almost to the limit. \nDr Abu-Hapsa says that must now change.\n\"The shortage of critical care beds in the UK was absolutely felt during the pandemic,\" he said..\n\"There were contingencies in place to redistribute the pressure load from London to other parts of England  - but none the less, the reality remains we were very close to breaking point.\"\nAn NHS official said: \"Each patient transfer only occurred after direct agreement between intensive-care clinicians and senior doctors that it was safe and right to do so and always happened under the supervision of a specialist transfer team. \n\"Being able to provide mutual support in this way is one of the advantages of having a truly national health service and prevented regions being overwhelmed, as happened in some other countries, even when our hospitals admitted more than 100,000 Covid patients in a single month.\""

      "text": "It has been a remarkable 12 months, but for one academic the biggest surprise has been the public's response to Covid.\nBehavioural change usually takes years to 'bed in' with the population, yet most of us have seamlessly adopted face masks and social distancing.\nDr Simon Williams, a Swansea University sociologist, is analysing a treasure trove of data from the pandemic.\nFor him, one of the big questions is: Are any of the changes here to stay?\n\"Changing behaviour, especially at a population level, usually does take a long time,\" said Dr Williams.\n\"Some of the behaviours we are talking about here, whether it's handshaking, hugging, being close to each other, being in groups - these are really fundamental to what it means to be human. \n\"The fact that so many people have rapidly changed their behaviour - and done so over 12 months - is a remarkable collective effort and an effort of resilience.\n\"But it comes at a cost. Hugs can physically have a positive impact like the reduction of stress. It's important that we do not give up on the old normal.\"\nFor social scientists like Dr Williams, the pandemic and the resulting impact of rules handed down by First Minister Mark Drakeford and other ministers has produced an unparalleled source of research material.\nPolitics is usually played out in the public domain, but never before have leaders had to micromanage private lives, from telling us whether we can leave our homes to when we may be allowed to go on holiday.\nA year ago there was genuine concern about how willing people would be to accept and follow such tough limitations.\nThere was talk of ministers only having a small window to enforce regulations before fatigue set in.\nDr Williams said that concern about behavioural fatigue was misplaced, and it was not the only preconception that had to change.\n\"Face masks are a good example,\" he said. \"There was always an assumption in the early stages that the British would not take to face masks as some other countries have. \n\"That quickly changed as we have adopted them to a very high degree. My sense is that we will never get back to a situation where we will never have face masks.\n\"Who would have thought 12 months ago that terms like 'the R value', 'case rates' and 'viral mutations' would be terms that we are all using every day?\n\"As a whole we have a newfound understanding and respect for the role that asymptomatic transmission can play with viruses. General hygiene practices are here to stay.\n\"When you have a sniffle in future, I think we will think twice about the idea of soldiering on in work. Hopefully, companies and organisations will be supportive of that.\"\nThe role of business has been the source of much speculation, in particular from those saying the days of large city centre office HQs are over.\nPip Gwynn, a Newport-based business psychologist, says the challenge now for businesses is how to bring staff together, rather than simply shutting down office space.\n\"What people are missing most now are their colleagues,\" she said. \n\"They are missing the support they get, the gossip, the chance to solve problems together and be creative. \n\"Employers need to provide a space where people can do that, as well as the space where people can be at home to focus on work that is best suited for a quieter environment.\"\nAnd it is not just about the physical space. The growth of home working for so many employers has also led to a change in mindset as the lines between the workplace and home become increasingly blurred.\nShe said: \"We have really started to value the human aspects of each other. \n\"We get to see a lot more about each other, you see people with kids sitting in the background, you see their cats, I have been at meetings where people are holding their babies.\n\"You are seeing your boss, who always used to wear a suit and tie, sitting at his kitchen table wearing a hoodie.\n\"We have learnt a lot of the more human and emotional aspects of work and that is really helping organisations have conversations about mental health and wellbeing which is important.\""

      "tags": "Robert Jenrick,Oliver Dowden",
      "text": "All UK government buildings in England, Wales and Scotland will fly the union flag every day, following new guidance from the culture department. \nCurrently flags are only required to be flown on certain days such as the Queen's birthday.\nCulture Secretary Oliver Dowden described the flag as \"a proud reminder of our history and the ties that bind us\".\nGovernment buildings in Northern Ireland are covered by a separate law.\nThe guidance released by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport department says the union flag should be flown every day - except on those occasions where another flag is being flown. The guidance will only apply from the summer. \nThe announcement comes after BBC Breakfast host Charlie Stayt received criticism for joking during a TV interview about the size of the union flag behind Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick.\nThe union flag first appeared in 1606, after James VI of Scotland ascended to the throne in England in 1603 to become James I.\nThe flag combined the two flags of England and Scotland's patron saints -  the red cross of Saint George and the white cross of Saint Andrew.\nThe red cross of Saint Patrick was later added.\nBack in 2007, Labour MP Ian Lucas unsuccessfully campaigned for the Welsh dragon to be added to the flag. \nIn 2008, then-Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown scrapped a rule that said the union flag could only be flown on certain days. He said it should be left to individual public offices to decide if and when to fly flag. \nOther countries such as Australia and New Zealand - who are members of the Commonwealth -  feature the union flag on their own flag. \nAnnouncing the new guidance, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: \"The union flag unites us as a nation and people rightly expect it to be flown above UK government buildings - this guidance will ensure that happens every day.\"\nMinisters are also urging all local councils to fly the flag, and buildings will also be able to fly the NHS flag without seeking planning permission. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, Conservative MP Sir John Hayes welcomed the move saying: \"I think we just don't fly our flag enough - if you go to capitals of other countries, around the heart of those capitals, particularly government buildings, you routinely see the flag of that country flying. \n\"So it does seem to me something that unifies the country, that brings us together, that allows us to share in our national pride - what's wrong with that? And after this year, bringing the country together around the flag couldn't be more apposite.\"\nHowever the SNP's Mhairi Black said: \"If the Tories think an overload of union jacks on buildings is the answer to promote the strength of the union, then it shows how thin the case for the union is. \n\"Flags won't undo the poverty and hardship the Tories have created over the last decade,\" she said. \nPlaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts said: \"The Tories know that independence for Scotland is inevitable and that Wales will be hot on their heels.\n\"Sticking flags on every street corner will not change that fact, and rather, only reveals their desperate insecurity about the future of the UK\", she said.\nFlag-flying is a contentious issue in Northern Ireland and in 2015 a commission was set up to help find a consensus on flags, emblems and identity.\nThe commission's report was delayed when devolution in Northern Ireland collapsed and although the findings have been submitted they have not yet been published - despite calls from assembly members in Stormont.

Some 13 people were put to death in a matter of months - including six executions carried out after his election defeat.\nDuring his presidential campaign, Joe Biden vowed to end the federal death penalty and encourage states to follow suit, but has not addressed the issue as president.\nVirginia has used the death penalty nearly 1,400 times since its days as a colony, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\nDemocrats, who control the state legislature, pushed for its repeal, arguing it had disproportionately hurt people of colour, the mentally ill and the poor.\nAt the bill signing, Mr Northam noted 296 of the 377 people executed by the state in the 20th century were black.\nThe last two men on death row in the state, both black, will now see their sentences converted to life in prison without parole.\nThe United Nations says 170 of its 194 member states have abolished executions in law or practice and the US has faced repeated international criticism over its failure to do so."

      "tags": "Germany,Coronavirus vaccines,Angela Merkel,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel has cancelled plans for a strict lockdown over Easter, just a day after the measures were announced. \nCalling the plan a \"mistake\", Mrs Merkel said she took \"ultimate responsibility\" for the U-turn.\nThe proposed lockdown was agreed with regional leaders in talks overnight on Monday, with restrictions set to be tightened between 1-5 April.\nBut the plan was reversed following a crisis meeting on Wednesday.\nIt had been widely criticised by business leaders and scientists. \nThe lockdown would have been Germany's strictest yet, with most shops closed and gatherings limited.\nFor five days over Easter from 1 April, Germans would have been asked to stay at home and reduce social contact.\nIn-person religious services would have been cancelled, large family gatherings banned and almost all shops would have been closed.\nThe head of Mrs Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, Armin Laschet, told a regional parliament meeting on Wednesday that the lockdown was \"not enforceable in this form\".\n\"This mistake is mine alone,\" Mrs Merkel told reporters in Berlin. \"The whole process has caused additional uncertainty, for which I ask all citizens to forgive me.\"\n\"There were good reasons for it but it could not be implemented well enough in this short time,\" she added.\nThis was an extraordinary statement. \nChancellor Merkel said she alone bore responsibility for the plan to extend what is usually a three-day Easter holiday to a five-day shutdown. \nThe German leader will be conscious that - as case numbers soar exponentially - public trust in her government's pandemic response is wavering. \nShe was seen as a safe pair of hands who brought the country through the first wave of infections. But - as regional leaders bicker over lockdown measures - Germany's response is becoming increasingly chaotic.\nMrs Merkel appears to be struggling to keep the country together.\n\"Essentially, we have a new virus,\" Chancellor Merkel said when announcing the now-cancelled Easter lockdown.\nThe highly contagious UK (Kent) variant of coronavirus had become dominant, she explained, plunging the country into \"a new pandemic\".\n\"It is much deadlier, much more infectious and infectious for much longer,\" she claimed, adding Germany was in a race against time to vaccinate against Covid-19.\nThe infection rate has risen above 100 per 100,000 inhabitants in Germany. That number is critical in determining emergency decisions such as tightening lockdowns. Under the current rules, areas exceeding that infection rate over a seven-day period will not be subject to further reopenings.\nBut despite the numbers, the announcement of the five-day lockdown, and the subsequent ban on Easter church services, triggered dismay from religious leaders. They argued that their existing social-distancing measures made church attendance safe.\nThe Catholic German Bishops' Conference made clear that, following Wednesday's U-turn, its services would go ahead as planned with hygiene measures in place and video streams available to those who did not want to attend in person. \nRetail leaders also welcomed the reversal. \n\"With today's decision, a bit of reason is returning to coronavirus policy,\" the HDE association of retailers said in a statement.\nThe country's partial lockdown, meanwhile, has been extended until at least 18 April.\nCoronavirus infections have been surging in some parts of Europe in recent weeks as countries scramble to vaccinate their populations despite delays in rolling out jabs. \nThe European Commission has proposed tougher controls on Covid vaccine exports. It has accused the UK-Swedish firm AstraZeneca of failing to honour its contract to supply EU countries.\nThe tougher export controls are most likely to affect countries that have higher vaccination rates than the EU, such as the UK and US."

      "text": "Sharply lower clothes prices and cheaper second-hand cars caused an unexpected fall in the UK's inflation rate in February.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate fell to 0.4% last month, down from 0.7% in January.\nEconomists had expected inflation to rise slightly, driven by increasing fuel and energy prices.\nBut the impact of rising fuel costs was offset by downward pressures in other areas, including travel costs and toys.\nFebruary is traditionally a month where clothing prices would rise. But ONS deputy national statistician, Jonathan Athow said: \"The impact of the pandemic has disrupted standard seasonal patterns.\"\nClothing and footwear prices fell between January and February for the first time since 2007 and are 5.7% lower than a year before, the biggest annual decline since November 2009. \nThe ONS said second-hand car prices had been rising during 2020 as people sought alternatives to using public transport.\nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon, said that despite inflation's \"sudden drop due to temporary weakness in clothing prices\" he still expected the rate to exceed 2% later this year. \n\"The lockdown has left clothing retailers with considerable excess stock to shift. Clothing prices likely have rebounded this month, now that retailers have introduced new seasonal ranges,\" he said.\nHannah Audino, economist at PwC, said that as lockdowns ease, inflation will tick higher as consumers \"unleash some of the \u00a3150bn of excess savings on the economy\" built up during 2020.\n\"Businesses will also be looking to recoup lost revenues from the past year, although the extension to the VAT cut for the hospitality and leisure sector will continue to exert some downward pressure on prices,\" she said. \nMany economists had predicted inflation would rise slightly in February to about 0.8%, driven higher by a big rise in fuel prices.\nThe ONS said that between January and February petrol prices rose by 3.6 pence per litre, and diesel prices rose by 3.4 pence per litre. Fuel prices fell in the same period last year.\nCrude oil prices have been rising, which is expected to feed through into even higher costs at the pump, and household energy bills are also increasing after suppliers raised prices.\nWednesday's data came a week after the Bank of England had warned that the inflation rate would approach its 2% target level in the coming months, mainly due to energy price increases.\nThe BoE also left record-low interest rates at 0.1% last week and forecast that economic growth would recover towards pre-Covid levels this year. \nThat expectation of faster growth was underlined on Wednesday in a survey that indicated the pace of new orders being placed by companies was increasing.\nThe IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index rose to a seven-month high of 56.6 in March from 49.6 in February, which was much higher than economists' forecasts. A figure above 50 denotes expansion.\nIHS chief business economist Chris Williamson said the surge in order activity, along with recent better news on jobs growth, \"point to robust economic growth in the second quarter, especially if virus restrictions are lifted further\"."

South Western Ambulance Service said the attack was \"unacceptable\".\nIt happened outside Soundwell Ambulance Station while Ms Newbury, from Caerphilly, was on shift overnight on Saturday into the early hours of Sunday.\nShe said it left her \"in shock, teary, and angry\", and questioning her job.\n\"Twelve-hour shifts can be difficult anyway...but I'm trying to do something for the community, so coming back to that was so disappointing...I felt 'what's the point in doing this?\"\nAfter sharing the photos of her car on Facebook, Ms Newbury said she had 60-70 offers of help and support.

      "tags": "Egypt,Mediterranean Sea,Shipping industry,Suez canal",
      "text": "A giant container ship the length of four football pitches has become wedged across Egypt's Suez Canal, blocking one of the world's busiest trade routes. \nDozens of vessels are stuck, waiting for rescue boats to free the 400m-long (1,312ft) ship, which was knocked off course by strong winds.\nEgypt has reopened the canal's older channel to divert some traffic until the grounded ship can move again.\nThe blockage sent oil prices climbing on international markets.\nAbout 12% of global trade passes through the Suez Canal, which connects the Mediterranean to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe.\nThe Ever Given, registered in Panama and operated by the shipping company Evergreen, was bound for the port city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands from China and was passing northwards through the canal on its way to the Mediterranean.\nThe 200,000 tonne ship, built in 2018 and operated by Taiwanese transport company Evergreen Marine, ran aground and became lodged sideways across the waterway at about 07:40 local time (05:40 GMT) on Tuesday. \nAt 400m long and 59m wide, the ship has blocked the path of other vessels which are now trapped in lines in both directions.\nThe company that manages the container ship, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), has denied earlier reports that the ship had already been partially refloated. \nIn a statement, it said its \"immediate priorities are to safely re-float the vessel and for marine traffic in the Suez Canal to safely resume\".\nExperts have warned the process could take several days. \nReuters, quoting local sources, says there are at least 30 ships blocked to the north of the Ever Given, and three to the south.\nEvergreen Marine said the ship was \"suspected of being hit by a sudden strong wind, causing the hull to deviate... and accidentally hit the bottom and run aground\".\nBSM confirmed on Wednesday that all crew were \"safe and accounted for\", with no reports of injuries.\nEight tug boats are working to refloat the ship, and diggers on the ground have been removing sand from where it is wedged into the side of the canal bank.\nDr Sal Mercogliano, a maritime historian based in the US state of North Carolina, told the BBC that incidents such as this were rare, but could have \"huge ramifications for global trade\". \nFears that the blockage could tie up shipments of crude oil caused prices to rise by 4% on international markets on Wednesday, Reuters reported.\nThe Kpler energy intelligence service said that more than 20 oil tankers carrying crude and refined products were affected by the jam. \n\"This is the largest vessel ever to go aground in the Suez Canal,\" he said, adding that the ship got lodged in the embankment and would have lost power and its ability to steer.\n\"If they are unable to pull her free... in a high tide, they are going to have to start removing cargo.\" \nJulianna Cona, who says she is on board another ship located directly behind the Ever Given, wrote on Instagram: \"Ship in front of us ran aground while going through the canal and is now stuck sideways looks like we might be here for a little bit...\"\nThe Suez Canal is an artery of world trade, connecting the Mediterranean with the Red Sea, and providing an avenue for vessels to pass between Asia and the Middle East and Europe. The main alternative, a passage round the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, takes considerably longer.\nOn average, nearly 50 vessels per day pass along the canal, although at times the number can be much higher - accounting for some 12% of world trade. It is particularly important as an avenue for oil and liquified natural gas, enabling shipments to get from the Middle East to Europe.\nThe nightmare scenario, then, is for this crucial route to be blocked - which is exactly what has now happened with the stranding of the Ever Given. The question now is how long the route remains impassable, as a long delay would create serious problems for shippers, delaying consignments of goods and fuel. \nOn this occasion, reports suggest traffic could be flowing again relatively quickly, in which case the impact will be limited, although there has been a rise in the oil price.\nBut the incident has shown what can go wrong when the new generation of ultra-large vessels like the Ever Given have to pass through the relatively tight confines of the canal. Although parts of it were expanded as part of a major modernisation programme in the middle of the last decade, it remains tricky to navigate - and accidents can happen.\nThe ship has the capacity to carry 20,000 20-ft shipping containers, according to Reuters news agency. \nNearly 19,000 ships passed through the canal in 2020, according to the Suez Canal Authority - an average of 51.5 ships per day.\nIn 2017, a Japanese container vessel blocked the canal after it ran aground following reported mechanical issues. The Egyptian authorities deployed tug boats and the ship was refloated within hours.\nThe Suez Canal crosses the Suez Isthmus in Egypt - a strip of land between the Mediterranean and Red Sea. The canal is 193km (120 miles) long and incorporates three natural lakes.\nIn 2015, Egypt's government opened a major expansion of the canal that deepened the main waterway and provided ships with a 35km (22 mile) channel parallel to it."

      "text": "Front-line police officers should have been prioritised for the Covid vaccine, according to the head of one force. \nChief Constable Pam Kelly said it has been one of her biggest concerns during the crisis. \nThe Gwent Police boss agreed that NHS staff and the vulnerable should come first, but she wanted greater protection for her staff. \nThe Welsh government said there is insufficient evidence to support vaccination by occupation.\nPolice officers often attend the same scenes as health workers but are the only ones not vaccinated, said Mrs Kelly.\n\"We salute NHS staff, they've been outstanding. But often you will get an ambulance worker, health worker and police officer at the same scene,\" she said. \n\"When there's a violent person, police officers are there trying to protect the health workers - yet it's the police officer that's not vaccinated. \n\"It's a real concern for me. It's all about having enough emergency workers to respond to 999 and 101 calls and the vaccination for police officers would have been a really strong voice in saying we're grateful for what you've done. \n\"They're not asking for money - all we're asking for is for our officers to be safe.\" \nMore than 4,000 emergency workers have been assaulted in Wales over the last 20 months, she added. \n\"Sometimes Covid has been used as a weapon. I understand without question the need for the vulnerable to be vaccinated, but at this stage where the wider community is being vaccinated, I feel very strongly that front-line policing should be vaccinated,\" she said.\nMrs Kelly added that out of a 1,400 strong workforce, just 140 have had the vaccine - based purely on their age or vulnerability. \nBut as crime dropped around 15%, demand for policing increased significantly, she said.\nIn the neighbouring South Wales Police force, Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan is equally concerned about the impact the pandemic has had on staff.\n\"It's taken its toll. On a weekly basis I'm texting somebody who is poorly, somebody who is in hospital, I've visited families, I've been to a number of funerals. We really care about their wellbeing and welfare,\" he said.\nPolice officers \"absolutely\" should be prioritised for Covid vaccines, Temporary Chief Constable of Dyfed Powys Police Claire Parmenter said.\nShe told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: \"I'm pleased that in recent weeks officers have started to get offered reserve vaccines where, at the end of the day, there are some vaccines leftover.\n\"But it's critical that we continue to support officers for the vaccination because they have no choice but to put themselves at risk.\"\nAs a border force, different rules in England and Wales added to the confusing picture.\nInitially the focus remained on engaging, explaining and encouraging compliance, but enforcement has increasingly been a factor.\nIn the last 12 months the role of policing changed significantly. While crime remained a priority, officers were asked to step in and police far more of our lives - right down to where we took a walk and with whom.\nTeam that with protests - and a national focus on the way police have handled protests in a pandemic, from Black Lives Matter to women's safety demonstrations following the murder of Sarah Everard. \nHas it impacted their relationship with their community?\n\"I can't thank communities enough for the way they've worked with us,\" said Mrs Kelly, who was interviewed before officers in Bristol were injured during protests on Monday.\n\"I don't want to become the Covid police - and we've carried on tackling serious organised crime with vigour - but ultimately we have seen some fragility in terms of the relationships between policing and the community.\n\"We've had about 73 protests during the Covid crisis and protests are very difficult to police.\"\nShe said they had worked with protesters - some had moved online, others were done in a Covid-secure way.  \nHer south Wales counterpart Mr Vaughan, who was also interviewed before the Bristol protests, added people have the right to be heard - but the rules have changed in Covid times.\n\"People want their voices to be heard - and people are protesting on some really important issues,\" he said.\n\"In ordinary times the police would work really hard to allow those voices to be heard- to facilitate those protests, but these aren't ordinary times. They're extraordinary times.\n\"There comes a point after a few days of protest, and we've warned them on a number of times, that we need to take action.\n\"That's not for one second calling into question the right of individual's voices to be heard, or indeed the things that they want to talk about which are extremely important things, but we're being called to help protect people from a global pandemic.\"\nThe Welsh government thanked officers for doing a \"fantastic job\" enforcing coronavirus regulations.\nHowever a spokesman said it was following the advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to vaccinate according to age, as that \"remains the strongest factor\" linked to deaths and hospitalisations from the virus.\n\"The JCVI has looked at prioritisation by occupation but found there wasn't sufficient evidence for this,\" he added. \n\"It has advised that the complexity of delivering this approach would slow down the pace of the vaccination roll-out.\""

      "text": "Foreign travel over the summer holiday months should be ruled out, Robin Swann has said. \nThe health minister said Westminster and the devolved governments were discussing the so-called \"red list\" for foreign countries. \nHe said travel to the Republic of Ireland would be dependent on its vaccine rollout.\nMr Swann also said fragilities in NI's health system underlined the need for caution as lockdown eases. \n\"Our health and care services have had the toughest of years. They still need our protection now,\" he said.\nThe \"red list\" is part of travel regulations aimed at stopping Covid variants entering the UK.\nThe health minister said the health system in Northern Ireland had been particularly strained in recent years compared with neighbouring jurisdictions. \nNorthern Ireland has begun taking its first steps out of lockdown, after restrictions were re-imposed nearly three months ago.\nThe current rules came into force on 26 December, in a bid to suppress the spread of Covid-19.\nBut ministers have agreed some relaxations of the rules can now be permitted.\nOn Wednesday, no further coronavirus-related deaths were recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, meaning the total number of deaths remains at 2,107. \nWhile there are no direct international flights arriving into Northern Ireland at the moment, Mr Swann said the executive was looking at establishing a hotel quarantine system for international arrivals.\n\"Should direct flights start, we will have that facility here as well,\" Mr Swann told a press briefing on Wednesday. \nSimon Hamilton, the chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said the health minister's comments on foreign travel would cause alarm. \nHe said there would be \"many in the tourism industry\" who will be \"very disappointed to hear speculative comments that have not be endorsed and backed and supported by the executive\". \nMeanwhile Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said a change in the advice for people who are clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) to Covid-19 was planned.\nSince 26 December, CEV people have been advised to adhere to additional steps to keep themselves safe from exposure to the Covid-19, including advice not to attend their workplace if they can work from home. \nThat will now ease from 12 April. \n\"This is an important step to helping CEV people re-engage with everyday life with confidence,\" he said.\nDr Patricia Donnelly, head of NI's vaccination programme, said the target of reaching all adult age groups by the summer is \"firmly within our sights\".\nA total of 694,863 individuals have received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 96,254 have received two.\nDr Donnelly said that meant almost half of the adult population in Northern Ireland had been vaccinated. \nShe said the vaccination centre in the SSE Arena in Belfast would open on 29 March and more than 300 community pharmacies would also join the vaccination programme next week. \nCurrently, anyone over the age of 50 and those with some underlying health conditions are eligible for a coronavirus vaccine.\nThe SSE Arena will operate alongside the seven regional vaccination centres run by health trusts across Northern Ireland as well as GP practices.\nDr Donnelly also warned those who are trying to \"inappropriately access the service\" that \"they might travel as far as they like, they won't get vaccinated\".\n\"It's going to be a wasted journey for anyone who does it,\" she said. \nIt has emerged that hundreds of people from the Republic of Ireland have been turned away from vaccinations centres in Northern Ireland in recent days.\nMeanwhile the Department of Health has said it is investigating an apparent glitch in its online vaccination booking system.\nIt says a number of appointments were booked by people who were not yet eligible.\nThe BBC understands an online link, enabling people to bypass eligibility criteria questions, was circulating on some social media platforms for some time on Tuesday.\nIn a tweet issued on Wednesday, the department said: \"Yesterday some members of the public in NI who are not yet eligible to receive a Covid-19 vaccine were able to make an appointment. \n\"This was as a result of an issue with the system's eligibility checker and we are looking into the circumstances that allowed this - but we want to clarify that such appointments are being cancelled.\n\"Ineligible appointments will in any event be turned away at the vaccination centre through checks that apply there. \n\"Our thanks to the vast majority of people who are using our services properly.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nThe UK and EU have said they are working together to create a \"win-win\" situation and supply vaccines to all citizens, amid the row over the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab. The European Commission has proposed tougher controls on Covid vaccine exports after it accused AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish firm, of failing to honour its contract to supply EU countries. The plans don't amount to a ban - but they could inflame tensions with the UK. But late in the day, the UK and EU released a joint statement saying that co-operation was important and they are working on specific steps to expand vaccine supply. Meanwhile, the number of infections is rising in many European countries and lockdowns are being extended. At the same time, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel called off a strict five-day lockdown over Easter, saying it would be a \"mistake\". \nA new \"double mutant\" variant has been detected from samples in India. Officials are checking if the variant - where two mutations come together in the same virus - could be more infectious, or less affected by vaccines. India reported 47,262 cases and 275 deaths on Wednesday - the sharpest daily rise this year.\nA bereaved Labour MP has urged the prime minister to commit now to a full public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic, saying people \"want and deserve to understand what happened\". Manchester Gorton's Afzal Khan said his own family had lost \"an entire generation\" to the virus and he could not hold his mother's hand while she was dying. Boris Johnson said he was \"committed\" to an inquiry when it would not be an \"irresponsible diversion\" in dealing with the crisis.\nJohn Lewis has said it will not reopen eight stores once lockdown eases, putting 1,465 jobs at risk. The retail giant, which has previously reported a hefty annual loss, said the shops were were \"financially challenged prior to the pandemic\". The closures include four \"At Home\" shops in Ashford and Tunbridge Wells in Kent, in Basingstoke, Hampshire, and in Chester. \nDoes Zoom fatigue feel familiar? US investment bank Citigroup has urged its staff to limit video calls on \"Zoom-free Fridays\" in an effort to promote a better work-life balance. Chief executive Jane Fraser said it was clear changes needed to be made in response to feedback from staff. \"The blurring of lines between home and work and the relentlessness of the pandemic workday have taken a toll on our wellbeing,\" she said.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "text": "The Duke of Sussex is taking up another new role, at a think tank looking into fake news in the US media.\nPrince Harry will help to lead a six-month study on the state of the media at the Aspen Institute within its new Commission on Information Disorder.\nThe duke - who has long been critical of parts of the press - said there was \"an avalanche of misinformation\".\nThe announcement comes just a day after Harry also announced another new position at a mental health firm.\nPrince Harry and his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, stepped back as senior royals almost a year ago - something he later said was partly due to the UK's tabloid media.\nSince then, the couple have moved to California and Harry has stepped down from his military appointments and royal patronages, although his charity work continues. The pair have also signed deals to make shows and podcasts with Netflix and Spotify.\nThis latest role means Prince Harry will be one of 15 commissioners working on the think tank's study into misinformation and disinformation.\nHis role will be part-time and involve regular meetings over the next few months.\nAmong the other commissioners is Kathryn Murdoch, who runs a foundation and is the wife of James Murdoch, the son of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch.\nIn a statement, the duke said: \"The experience of today's digital world has us inundated with an avalanche of misinformation, affecting our ability as individuals as well as societies to think clearly and truly understand the world we live in.\n\"It's my belief that this is a humanitarian issue - and as such, it demands a multi-stakeholder response from advocacy voices, members of the media, academic researchers, and both government and civil society leaders.\n\"I'm eager to join this new Aspen commission and look forward to working on a solution-oriented approach to the information disorder crisis.\"\nOn Tuesday, it was announced Harry was to become chief impact officer at the US coaching and mental health firm, BetterUp.\nHis new boss said he had \"a feeling he'll work out\" and the duke had \"an incredible attitude and he is filled with energy and enthusiasm\"."

      "title": "Lecturers at further education colleges in NI hold one-day strike",
      "tags": "Colleges,NI education,Strike action",
      "text": "Hundreds of lecturers at further education colleges in Northern Ireland are holding a one-day strike.\nStaff belonging to the University and College Union (UCU) are taking the action in a dispute over pay and workload.\nBut the Economy Minister Diane Dodds has said the union rejected a pay offer amounting to a 7% rise.\nThe UCU said their members in further education colleges had only received a 3.8% pay rise since 2013/14.\nAbout 70,000 students attend Northern Ireland's six Further Education (FE) colleges, according to figures from the Department for the Economy (DfE).\nMany of those students take vocational courses and many study part-time.\nThe UCU said the Department for the Economy had failed to increase FE college funding so that employers could pay staff fairly.\nBut BBC News NI has obtained a letter from Ms Dodds to Stormont's economy committee in which she said she did not have any \"direct role\" in the dispute.\n\"Further education colleges are employers in their own right and are responsible for determining the terms and conditions of lecturing staff,\" she wrote.\nHowever, the minister claimed the UCU action would have \"a detrimental effect on some of the most vulnerable learners, many of whom are already struggling to cope with the impact of a prolonged period of online learning and social isolation\".\nShe told the committee the College Employers' Forum (CEF) had made an offer to trade unions of a 7% pay rise \"which they consider could be met from within existing budgets\".\nThe CEF is made up of the chairs and chief executives of Northern Ireland's six FE colleges.\n\"Trade Union Side then submitted a pay claim seeking 11.7% and advising that the 7% offer was unacceptable,\" Ms Dodds wrote.\nBut in a separate statement the UCU said the 7% pay offer was spread over a four-year period.\nUCU said it was \"barely better than pay restraint and fails to adequately compensate for the years when lecturers received no cost of living increases at all\".\nThe UCU official in Northern Ireland Katharine Clarke said as DfE determined funding to FE colleges they were \"clearly responsible for stagnating pay\".\n\"UCU members are going on strike because they have received a paltry 3.8% increase in total since 2013/14,\" she said.\n\"School teachers have received 11.25% over the same period.\n\"The offer of 7% over four years in the context of the previous capped awards equates to 1.2% per year over a nine-year period.\n\"No other workforce in the public sector has been subject to such a derisory increase.\"  \nBut in Ms Dodds' letter, she said she had no authority to intervene in talks between the colleges and unions and that DfE would only become involved when agreement was reached.\n\"It is only when agreement has been reached through that process that a business case is submitted to the Department for appraisal,\" she said.\n\"Should the business case be considered to be sufficiently robust it can then be approved and consideration given to meeting any additional resource requirements.\"\nMs Dodds also said UCU did not represent all lecturers in FE colleges, as many were members of the NASUWT and NEU.\nShe also claimed unions had also rejected a previous three-year pay offer of an increase of over 10% in 2020 without balloting their members, and concluded by urging the unions and employers to resume negotiations.\nBut the UCU accused Ms Dodds of failing to meet them and of \"shirking her responsibility\" for underfunding FE colleges.\nThe union said strike action would be followed by action short of a strike unless the minister and department \"secure more funding for colleges and a proper pay rise for college lecturers\".\nThat action short of strike will see UCU members refusing to work overtime, and boycotting any un-agreed additional duties.    \nMonica Goligher, a lecturer in biology at Belfast Met, is among those taking part in Wednesday's strike.\nShe told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme she believes striking staff will have the support of their students and the wider public because \"they appreciate what we do\".\nMs Goligher said lecturers' workload had \"imploded\" since their most recent contract was negotiated in 2009, and had increased further as a result of the pandemic.\nStaff have taken on a \"huge administrative burden\" as well as additional teaching requirements over those last 12 years, she explained.\n\"That has been compounded by moving to teach online, practically in full, since last March with less than 24 hours to prepare to do that.\"\nMs Goligher was asked if their pay claim was justified, given that nurses who are risking their lives working on the frontline during the coronavirus pandemic have been offered a 1% pay rise.\n\"We are the people who will step [up] to retrain, re-skill those who have lost their jobs in industries that have been particularly impacted by Covid and the ongoing economic difficulties,\" she replied.\n\"Minister Dodds can decide whether that is going to be a task that she is asking of a demotivated, demoralised and exhausted workforce in further education.\""

      "title": "More big investors shun Deliveroo over workers' rights",
      "tags": "Companies,Deliveroo,Gig economy,Self-employment",
      "text": "Six big UK investment firms say they will not buy Deliveroo shares after concerns over workers' rights.\nThe delivery company hopes to be valued at up to \u00a38.8bn when it lists its shares in April.\nBut Aberdeen Standard, Aviva Investors, BMO Global, CCLA, LGIM and M&G said they were put off by factors including the working conditions of its riders and lack of investor power.\nDeliveroo said it had seen \"significant demand\" for stock with interest rising.\n\"We look\u00a0forward to welcoming new shareholders next week alongside our currently highly respected existing investors,\" it added.\nDeliveroo riders are self-employed, meaning they are not entitled to earn a minimum wage from the company, or holiday and sick pay.\nRupert Krefting, head of corporate finance and stewardship at M&G, said the company's reliance on gig-economy workers made it a risk for investors.\nHe pointed out that Uber had recently had greater legal rights enforced by the Supreme Court for drivers previously categorised as self-employed.\n\"Deliveroo's narrow profit margins could be at risk if it is required to change its rider benefits to catch up with peers,\" Mr Krefting added.\nLegal & General Investment Management (LGIM) said it was put off by an \"unequal voting rights\" structure.\nDeliveroo is planning to let its founder and chief executive Will Shu have more than 50% of shareholder voting rights.\n\"It is important to protect minority and end-investors against potential poor management behaviour, that could lead to value destruction and avoidable investor loss,\" LGIM said.\nPhil Webster, a portfolio manager at BMO, said labour issues represented a \"ticking bomb on the side\" for Deliveroo, which contributed to making it \"uninvestable\".\nAndrew Millington, head of UK Equities at Aberdeen Standard, told the BBC's Today programme that the conditions were a \"red flag\", adding: \"We wouldn't be comfortable that the way in which its workforce is employed is sustainable.\"\nHe compared Aberdeen Standard's recent decision to sell off Boohoo shares, following allegations of worker exploitation at suppliers to the online clothing company.\nLarge institutional investors such as Aberdeen Standard can use their financial muscle to try to influence the way firms are run - such as through relationships with managers and shareholder votes.\nBut Mr Millington said that sometimes \"disinvesting or not investing in the first place is our only option\".\nHe added that it would be interesting to see whether Deliveroo can attract investors over the longer term \"without making progress\" on worker rights.\nOne of the biggest-ever floats on the London market of a home-grown technology company should have meant a feeding frenzy among the City's institutional investors, the companies that have the job of putting trillions of pounds of retail and pension investors money to work.  \nFor years they have watched with envy as their US counterparts have put cash into a steady stream of technology companies.\nNot all have been big hits after listing their shares on public markets, but enough of them have been - think Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla and a string of others - to have made it a big source of investment returns. Deliveroo's listing, which could value the company at just short of \u00a39bn, should have been a rare similar opportunity on the London market.\nInstead some big players, including Aviva Investors and Aberdeen Standard, are turning their backs, saying the way the company employs its riders is not socially acceptable, and poses a risk to its future.\nDeliveroo deems its riders to be self-employed, and points out that the High Court has upheld that view. What is more, Deliveroo says its riders value the flexibility that employment status gives them, although it is worth noting that Uber maintained the same thing until it eventually decided its drivers were in fact workers, not self-employed contractors.\nThere is no danger to Deliveroo's float - there are enough investors around who are happy to buy the shares. The buying strike by large investors could have ramifications well beyond one company, however. Does this mean that all gig economy companies are off limits? Does it signal that all companies on the London market will now have to ensure their worldwide organisations meet the best employment standards? \nAndrew Millington of Aberdeen Standard told the Today programme that would be the battle to come - that his firm would hold on to a company's shares as long as it was moving in the right directions, and paid proper attention to employment standards. That is a subtle warning to boardrooms that they will in future be judged by the way their treat their most junior staff.\nDavid Cumming, chief investment officer at Aviva, said investors were taking social responsibilities \"a lot more seriously\".\n\"A lot of employers could make a massive difference to workers' lives if they guaranteed working hours or a living wage, and how companies behave is becoming more important.\"\nA report by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ) - based on thousands of invoices from 300 Deliveroo riders - claims that one in three is earning less than the National Living Wage, which is currently \u00a38.72 an hour.\nHowever, Deliveroo said the sample of 300 people was \"not a meaningful or representative proportion\" of their riders and that they can earn up to \u00a313 an hour \"at our busiest times\".\n\"These findings [by the BIJ] raise concerns,\" said Tom Powdrill, head of stewardship at shareholder lobby group Pirc. \"Investors considering taking a position in Deliveroo should familiarise themselves with these matters and the risks and responsibilities involved along with all other relevant factors.\"\nMr Cumming also warned of the risk that drivers will have to be reclassified as workers, which would entitle them to rights such as sick and holiday pay. \n\"It's an investment risk if the legislation changes,\" said Mr Cumming. \nUber recently reclassified its drivers as workers after a landmark UK supreme court case last month.\nSince losing a five-year legal battle with drivers who claimed it had wrongly classified their employment status, Uber has offered holiday pay, a guaranteed minimum wage, and pensions benefits to its drivers.\nOther gig economy companies have been looking closely at the Supreme Court's verdict in February, although it does not directly apply to Uber Eats - the food delivery arm of the business.\nDeliveroo has set aside more than \u00a3112m to cover potential legal costs relating to the employment status of its delivery riders.\nIt warned potential investors of the risk of litigation around the world in documents setting out its plans for a stock market debut published on Monday.\n\"The European Commission is set to draw up new legislation governing how the gig economy model works across the bloc,\" pointed out Susannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\"If Deliveroo is forced to change the way it classifies its riders in the future, it is likely to puncture its profits prospects, and could even derail the delivery giant.\"\nDeliveroo, which was founded in 2013, has said it will hand its riders bonuses of between \u00a3200 and \u00a310,000 when it floats, depending on the number of orders they have delivered."
