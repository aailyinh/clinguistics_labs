      "text": "Cyber criminals who stole thousands of digital files belonging to environmental regulator Sepa have published them on the internet.\nThe public body had about 1.2GB of data stolen from its digital systems on Christmas Eve.\nSepa rejected a ransom demand for the attack, which has been claimed by the international Conti ransomware group. \nContracts, strategy documents and databases are among the 4,000 files released.\nThe data has been put on the dark web - a part of the internet associated with criminality and only accessible through specialised software. \nSepa chief executive Terry A'Hearn said: \"We've been clear that we won't use public finance to pay serious and organised criminals intent on disrupting public services and extorting public funds.\n\"We have made our legal obligations and duty of care on the sensitive handling of data a high priority and, following Police Scotland advice, are confirming that data stolen has been illegally published online.  \n\"We're working quickly with multi-agency partners to recover and analyse data then, as identifications are confirmed, contact and support affected organisations and individuals.\"\nThe attack locked Sepa's emails and contacts centre but Sepa said \"priority regulatory, monitoring, flood forecasting and warning services were continuing to adapt and operate\".\nSepa said the theft was the equivalent to a fraction of the contents of an average laptop hard drive.\nSome of the information stolen was already publicly available but other files included data about staff and suppliers was not.\nWhere information has been identified to date, staff have been contacted and are being supported.\nBrett Callow, of cyber security company Emsisoft, has been tracking the Sepa ransomware attack.\nHe said: \"Conti may well be the work of the same people behind another type of ransomware called Ryuk. \n\"There are similarities in the code, ransom note and attack mechanisms.\n\"When the complete haul of data is posted like this, it usually means the group has given up hope of being able to extract payment from the victim of monetise the data in other ways. \n\"It's a loss for them. At this point, they've lost all leverage and the action is intended to serve as a warning to future victims.\"\nDet Insp Michael McCullagh, of Police Scotland's cybercrime investigations unit, said: \"This remains an ongoing investigation. \n\"Inquiries remain at an early stage and continue to progress including deployment of specialist cybercrime resources to support this response.\"\nThe authorities will be pleased.\nIt looks like Sepa decided not to play ball with the cyber criminals.\nRansomware is a scourge that is costing organisations billions of pounds and every time a victim pays, it fuels further attacks.\nSadly for Sepa this is far from over. \nBy the looks of the stash of files that the hackers stole and encrypted, Sepa will have months of work ahead to try to recover important documents and spreadsheets from backups and rebuild their records.\nIt's also telling that, according to the hackers website, almost 1,000 people have so far looked at the documents. \nWho knows what other criminals or hackers are poring over the files right now. \nMaking the documents open to all means that information can be extracted to potentially be used against Sepa in further attacks or extortion attempts.\nIt will be months, perhaps even years until the organisation can say it is safe once more and can put this cyber attack behind it."

      "tags": "Film,Daniel Craig,Cinemas,James Bond,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The release of the next James Bond film has been delayed for a third time because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nNo Time To Die had already been pushed back twice, and will now debut globally on 8 October, an announcement on the film's website said.\nIt had originally been due to hit screens in April 2020.\nThe film is the 25th instalment in the Bond franchise, and marks Daniel Craig's final appearance as British secret service agent 007.\nIt also features Lea Seydoux and Rami Malek.\nThe delay will come as a further blow to cinemas that have been forced to shut for months at a time because of lockdowns. \nEarlier this week, leading film-makers including Danny Boyle and Sir Steve McQueen wrote to the UK Government, calling for financial support for cinema chains because \"UK cinema stands on the edge of an abyss\".\nCineworld said in October, when No Time To Die was pushed back for the second time, that delays to big budget releases meant the industry was \"unviable\".\nBond's latest move sparked a flurry of other delays to major releases. Sony has pushed back Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Peter Rabbit 2, Jared Leto's Morbius, Tom Holland's Uncharted and Cinderella, which will star singer Camila Cabello; while Universal has moved Tom Hanks' Bios from April to November.\nThe UK Cinema Association said the decision to postpone No Time To Die again, \"while clearly disappointing, is at the same time not surprising given the current situation around Covid-19 in the UK as well as the US and other major film territories\".\nThe postponement of Daniel Craig's swansong and other films \"underlines the need for ongoing support for the UK cinema sector\", the trade body's chief executive Phil Clapp said.\nThe association is calling on the government to provide \"direct funding\" to chains, which represent 80% of ticket sales.\nOne of the major chains, Vue, said the delay was \"understandable\", and that the continuing attempts to release the film in cinemas \"is further testament to our shared belief in a bright future for the big screen\".\nHowever, the latest postponement could stoke speculation that the film may ultimately skip cinemas and be released on a streaming platform.\nMajor Disney titles like Pixar's Soul and its live-action remake of Mulan bypassed cinemas, premiering instead on the Disney+ streaming service.\nWonder Woman 1984, meanwhile, was made available in the US on the HBO Max streaming service on the same day it received a limited cinema release.\nLast year, Warner Bros announced its 2021 titles - including sci-fi epic Dune and The Matrix 4 - would all adopt a similar dual release pattern, escalating tensions between Hollywood and US movie theatres.\nThe Dig, a new historical drama starring Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan, was due to be released in selected UK cinemas this month. Now, the film will only be available on Netflix from 29 January.\nAsked whether No Time To Die might go down the same route, Fiennes - who will reprise his role as M in the film - recently told BBC News: \"That's a good question and I'm not really in a position to answer it.\n\"I would love the idea that people could go to the cinema and have the full effect of the big-screen energy behind the Bond, but I'm sure it's something the people who make these executive decisions are probably considering.\n\"I really hope we come through this so people can go to the cinema. Maybe they just have to hold their nerve. But of course we don't know, and there may be financial reasons or imperatives that [mean] they have to put it on a streaming system.\"\nIf No Time To Die is indeed released in cinemas in October, it will arrive a full six years on from the release of its 2015 predecessor Spectre.\nThat won't be far behind the six years and four months that separated the release of Licence to Kill in summer 1989 and GoldenEye in late 1995 - the biggest gap between two Bond films.\nThe last Bond film, 2015's Spectre, took almost $900m (\u00a3690m) at worldwide box offices.\nOther blockbusters to have been delayed by the pandemic include action sequel Top Gun: Maverick and Marvel's Black Widow.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Housing,Grenfell Tower fire,Housing market,Grenfell Tower Inquiry",
      "text": "The government's fund to pay for the removal of dangerous cladding is woefully inadequate, oversubscribed and taking too long to make buildings safe, campaigners say.\nMore than three and a half years since the Grenfell Tower fire which killed 72 people, an estimated 700,000 people are still living in high-rise blocks with flammable cladding.  \nThe \u00a31.6bn Building Safety Programme was set up in 2019. Concerns have emerged about the contract that the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government requires applicants to the fund, usually managing agents or building owners, to sign.\nA clause in the contract, seen by the BBC, indicates applicants will be financially liable for any repair work not covered by the fund.\nThe BBC has learnt that some managing agents are refusing to sign the document, further delaying the repair work, and have written to the government asking ministers to clarify the position.\nChristian Hansen, a solicitor at Bindmans LLP specialising in housing law and fire safety claims, said the contract showed that \"there's going to be a significant shortfall between the costs of the [repair] works that are required and the funding provided under the scheme\".\n\"Someone is going to need to pick up the bill and pay the difference. This contract makes clear it's going to be the leaseholders and for many, this could be tens of thousands of pounds, potentially ruinous costs,\" he warned.\nMr Hansen said that leaseholders wanted the focus of government action \"to be on the manufacturers of the defective materials and construction companies who built these buildings\".\n\"At the moment, they are the ones profiting from putting people's lives at risk.\"\nFirst-time buyer Amy Cottenden, who is 28, bought a one-bed flat in Metis Tower in the centre of Sheffield for \u00a385,000 in 2017.\nInspections of the 14-storey building in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy revealed it had the same type of flammable ACM cladding and other safety faults.\nWork to remove the cladding started last month, but Ms Cottenden, who is a frontline NHS health worker, is frustrated at what she describes as a lack of progress.\n\"The pace of work is extremely slow. So far, they've put scaffolding up and removed three panels. They have told us it's going to take between 12 and 24 months just to take the cladding off,\" she said.\n\"It is absolutely terrifying knowing that you are stuck here. With lockdown, they are saying not to go out, but you are in a building where all you want to do is not be in it. You can't leave. You can't sell. My flat isn't worth anything until it is made safe.\"\nWhile the government's Building Safety Fund is paying for the Grenfell-style cladding to be removed, the building has other fire safety faults, including missing fire breaks, that aren't covered by the scheme.\nIt could cost up to \u00a36m to fix. Flat owners fear they may face huge bills of up to \u00a350,000 each.\n\"We can't pay it and we shouldn't have to pay it. It is not our fault. We could all go bankrupt because of this,\" Ms Cottenden said.\nA spokesperson for Rendall & Rittner, the company which manages Metis Tower, said government funding to remove ACM cladding had been approved totalling \u00a36.3m.\nHowever, an application to the same fund to pay for the removal of other types of unsafe cladding was rejected and the company has appealed against that decision.\nThe company added: \"We understand and sympathise with residents and owners about the uncertainty that this situation is causing and will do all we can to assist.\"\nWhat started as a cladding scandal has now become a much wider building safety crisis, exposing decades of regulatory failure.\nSafety inspections have revealed that many buildings have other serious faults, including missing fire breaks, flammable balconies and defective insulation. None of that is covered by the government's Building Safety Fund.\nDr Nigel Glen, the chief executive of ARMA, the trade association for residential leasehold management, said the additional costs that leaseholders were currently facing for non-cladding-related issues remained a huge concern.\n\"In the longer term, the draining of reserve funds will also mean that in the years to come, any major works that were being saved up for, such as a new roof or lift repairs, will have to be funded anew by the leaseholders,\" he added.\nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said that despite the pandemic, significant progress had been made to remove dangerous cladding, but \"building safety remains the responsibility of the building owner and we expect them to ensure any necessary work is carried out safely and effectively\".\n\"All applicants to the Building Safety Fund are told the amount of funding they have been awarded before being asked to sign contracts - this is clearly explained in the guidance,\" the spokesperson added."

      "text": "Early evidence suggests the variant of coronavirus that emerged in the UK may be more deadly, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. \nHowever, there remains huge uncertainty around the numbers - and vaccines are still expected to work. \nThe data comes from mathematicians comparing death rates in people infected with either the new or the old versions of the virus. \nThe new more infectious variant has already spread widely across the UK. \nMr Johnson told a Downing Street briefing: \"In addition to spreading more quickly, it also now appears that there is some evidence that the new variant - the variant that was first identified in London and the south east - may be associated with a higher degree of mortality.\n\"It's largely the impact of this new variant that means the NHS is under such intense pressure.\"\nPublic Health England, Imperial College London, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Exeter have each been trying to assess how deadly the new variant is.\nTheir evidence has been assessed by scientists on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag).\nThe group concluded there was a \"realistic possibility\" that the virus had become more deadly, but this is far from certain.\nSir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, described the data so far as \"not yet strong\".\nHe said: \"I want to stress that there's a lot of uncertainty around these numbers and we need more work to get a precise handle on it, but it obviously is a concern that this has an increase in mortality as well as an increase in transmissibility.\" \nPrevious work suggests the new variant spreads between 30% and 70% faster than others, and there are hints it is about 30% more deadly.\nFor example, with 1,000 60-year-olds infected with the old variant, 10 of them might be expected to die. But this rises to about 13 with the new variant. \nThis difference is found when looking at everyone testing positive for Covid, but analysing only hospital data has found no increase in the death rate. Hospital care has improved over the course of the pandemic as doctors get better at treating the disease.\nThe new variant was first detected in Kent in September. It is now the most common form of the virus in England and Northern Ireland, and has spread to more than 50 other countries. \nThe Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine are both expected to work against the variant that emerged in the UK.\nHowever, Sir Patrick said there was more concern about two other variants that had emerged in South Africa and Brazil.\nHe said: \"They have certain features which means they might be less susceptible to vaccines. \n\"They are definitely of more concern than the one in the UK at the moment and we need to keep looking at it and studying this very carefully.\"\nThe prime minister said the government was prepared to take further action to protect the country's borders to prevent new variants from entering.\n\"I really don't rule it out, we may need to take further measures still,\" he said.\nLast week the government extended a travel ban to South America, Portugal and many African countries amid concerns about new variants, while all international travellers must now test negative ahead of departure to the UK and go into quarantine on arrival.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "A minority still breaking Covid lockdown rules could make the pandemic \"stretch longer\" in Wales, a senior police officer has warned.\nThe \"gold commander\" for policing lockdown across the Gwent force area said he wanted to thank the vast majority for sticking to the law.\nBut Chief Superintendent Mark Hobrough said those \"blatantly flouting\" rules would face enforcement action.\nNearly 3,800 fines have been issued in Wales for Covid rule breaches.\nThe latest figures released by UK police forces revealed nearly three-quarters of those fines went to men, and the largest group falling foul of Covid rules were aged between 18 and 24.\nCh Supt Hobrough, who oversees Gwent Police's response to Covid-19, said he and his officers had seen a change in the way the public responded to the restrictions since the first lockdown was announced in March 2020.\n\"When it first started there was certainly a lack of understanding among the public,\" he said.\n\"We were called for advice and questions on what was allowed or not allowed, which we've certainly seen diminish.\"\nHe said initially his force was dealing with breaches of regulations by pubs and bars, or people holding house parties.\n\"That has changed over time. We still have experiences of house parties and people congregating in houses, which just isn't allowed obviously.\n\"But I think we are also seeing breaches in relation to people congregating in beauty spots and maybe not exercising in line with the requirements.\"\nAccording to the National Police Chiefs' Council, there were 3,770 fixed penalty notices issues by the four Welsh forces between the last Friday in March and 20 December last year.\nOf those fines, 2,188 were for breaching rules on movement restrictions, while 823 faced penalties for gathering in private properties outside their own households.\nA further 113 notices were issued to individuals for staying in Wales when it was not their main residence, and 89 were hit with fines for entering or leaving local health protection areas, when many counties in Wales had separate travel restrictions in place in the autumn.\nThe figures also reveal that just two fines were issued in the period for failing to wear a face covering in designated indoor areas.\nOut on the streets of Newport, and around the rest of the Gwent force area, the officers on the ground said they wanted to educate the public whenever rules changed, but they will enforce clear breaches.\n\"Some of the things people have been stopped for are travelling into Wales to look at the snow,\" said Sgt Dan Wise, as he carried out checks on motorists in Newport.\n\"Others are travelling to local beauty spots to exercise. Obviously, these are things that are not acceptable.\"\nHe said as the pandemic continues, with high numbers of cases and given how easily the virus can spread, \"we will look to enforce where people are blatantly flouting the rules\".\nAt the Gwent Police headquarters, Ch Supt Hobrough said he had this message for the minority of \"those people who aren't abiding\" by the rules: \"It would very much be within everybody's interest for them to reflect on the way they are conducting themselves.\n\"Because that minority of people who aren't abiding are possibly making this pandemic stretch longer.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Three quarters of applications for a \u00a3500 discretionary grant, which aims to help those on low incomes self-isolate, have been rejected, figures suggest.\nEmployed or self-employed people in England who do not qualify for the Test and Trace Support Payment because they do not receive benefits can apply.\nData obtained by Labour and shared with BBC Newsnight suggests just 12,069 of 49,877 applications were successful.\nThe government said it was assessing how the scheme is supporting people. \nThe cumulative figures obtained by Labour suggest that between October and December last year, 35,252 applications to local authorities in England for the discretionary part of the test and trace support payment scheme were rejected, while 12,069 were granted.\nThe government introduced the Test and Trace Support payment in late September as a way of topping up any benefits or Statutory Sick Pay a person receives.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care says it is a targeted scheme designed to help people on low incomes.\nThere is a list of specific criteria applicants must meet for the grant, but those who do not qualify for this payment and who are on a low income or may face financial hardship as a result of self-isolating, can apply for a discretionary payment.\nLocal authorities in England oversee the entire support scheme, with the qualifying criteria set by the government. They blame overly strict criteria and inadequate government guidance for people being rejected who feel they should qualify for a grant.\nThe Local Government Association, which represents councils in England as well as the London boroughs, said some councils were having to turn down applications for the discretionary support because \"people are ineligible or have failed to provide the evidence needed\".\nLast month, the self-isolation period for contacts of people with confirmed coronavirus was shortened from 14 to 10 days after the time of exposure. \nPeople who are contacted by NHS Test and Trace and told to self-isolate, face fines of up to \u00a310,000 if they fail to comply. Those who don't self-isolate risk spreading the virus to others.\nDr Nishant Joshi, a GP trainee working at a practice in Luton, says he meets, on a daily basis, people who are faced with what he calls a \"Sophie's choice\". \nHe says: \"People come to me with essentially a Sophie's choice situation - I know I have to isolate but also I don't have enough money to put food on my table.\n\"If I say to somebody who comes to me with a health problem, you need to take a couple of weeks off work, I've had patients who have come to me and they're in tears.\"\nRachel, a shop worker from East London with a disabled son, tested positive in early January and was left in a desperate situation after having to self-isolate.\nShe says: \"I didn't have a hot meal for 10 days. I had two bowls of cornflakes and a hot dog. I was hungry. I was petrified\".  \nShe adds: \"It's been probably the worst two weeks of my life. On a personal level I knew I had no choice but to isolate to keep my son safe. \n\"Had I not been in that position I can't guarantee that I would have done the whole self isolation thing because you get desperate.\"\nHer local councillor eventually dropped off a hot meal. Rachel was fortunate and received a \u00a3500 grant at the end of her isolation.\nJosie Tothill from Manchester didn't qualify for the scheme, even though her job, as a personal assistant to a woman who needs mental health support, means she is on a low income.  \nShe had to self-isolate in October after her sister tested positive.  But she did not receive a call from Test and Trace despite being a contact. Only people with a Test and Trace number are eligible.\nJosie says: \"It was difficult, but I got by. But for a lot of people, especially if you work in care, you are already on poverty wages, so to miss two weeks of work - that could be the difference between feeding your kids or not, or paying rent or not.  \n\"So you can see, for some people, it's impossible to do that isolation, so it's much harder to control the virus.\"\nThe Labour Party, which obtained the figures from local authorities under the Freedom of Information Act, says the government must make sure everyone can afford to self isolate.  \nShadow communities secretary Steve Reed said it was vital that people who self-isolated were not \"punished for doing the right thing\".\nHe told the BBC: \"The problem is the government established a fixed pot of money and, in some cases, councils have eked it out so much that many people applying for the funding haven't received it.\n\"In other cases councils have used up all the money because they have more people applying than were expected.\n\"So, we end up with a postcode lottery, if you live in one area you might get the funding, if you live in another area you might not.\"\nAnalysis of the figures by the BBC shows that of the applications to the discretionary scheme:\nWhile most of councils that responded rejected the majority of applications to the discretionary scheme, a smaller number bucked the trend.  \nLambeth granted 77% of applications, Haringey and Wakefield 75%, and Solihull 64%.\nWhile it's impossible to rule out that applications may be coming from people who are taking a chance, it's also clear that some councils are apparently more flexible about the criteria used on the discretionary scheme.  \nThe government is putting \u00a370 million into funding the scheme. It said: \"Local authorities are responsible for decisions when it comes to making additional discretionary payments to people who fall outside the scope of the main scheme and are facing financial hardship as a result of having to self-isolate.\n \"We continue to work closely with the 314 local authorities in England to assess how the scheme is supporting people experiencing financial difficulties.\" \nThe Local Government Association said the government \"needs to ensure its \u00a3500 self-isolation payment support scheme is available to those in need of financial support\".\nIt says it is \"good\" that councils will receive extra government funding \"to support people on low incomes who do not meet the strict criteria for this main scheme, but who may face financial hardship because of the requirement to self-isolate\"."

She has already spent seven days in isolation.\nPlayers who arrived on flights with no infections are also in quarantine but are allowed five hours of court practice a day.\nSeveral players have complained about the impacts to their tennis preparation.\nEarlier this week, in a tweet reported by Australian media that has since been deleted, Badosa wrote: \"At the beginning the rule was the positive section of the plane who was with that person had to quarantine. Not the whole plane.\n\"Not fair to change the rules at the last moment. And to have to stay in a room with no windows and no air.\"\nBut Tennis Australia and state officials have rejected assertions that any rules were changed or not clear ahead of time.\n\"We're thinking of you Paula, and hoping you feel better soon,\" the Australian Open's Twitter account replied in a message to Badosa on Friday.\nOrganisers have said that despite the infections, the Grand Slam will go ahead on 8 February."

      "title": "Cameron House: Fire caused by ash left in cupboard",
      "tags": "Balloch",
      "text": "A hotel fire which claimed the lives of two men started after a porter put a bag of ash and embers in a cupboard containing kindling and newspaper. \nSimon Midgley and his partner Richard Dyson died in the fire at Cameron House next to Loch Lomond in December 2017. \nCameron House pled guilty to charges under the Fire Scotland Act of failing to take fire safety measures.\nChristopher O'Malley, who put the bag in the cupboard, admitted breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act. \nO'Malley's lawyer said the night porter - from Renton in West Dunbartonshire - deeply regretted his actions, and did not deliberately start the fire.\nDumbarton Sheriff Court also heard that Cameron House did not have proper procedures in place for the disposal of ash, or for training staff. \nThe owners also failed to keep cupboards that contained potential ignition sources free of combustibles. \nAt about 04:00 on 18 December 2017, O'Malley, 35, cleared ash and embers from a fireplace in the Cameron House reception into a metal bucket.\nHe then emptied the contents of the bucket into a plastic bag, which he put into the concierge cupboard. \nThe cupboard also contained flammable materials including kindling, newspapers and cardboard. \nAt about 06:40 an initial fire alarm sounded and staff noticed smoke coming from the concierge cupboard.  \nO'Malley opened the door and flames took hold, spreading to the hall.\nHe and two others tried to fight the blaze with fire extinguishers, but were overcome by the flames.\nAdvocate depute Michael Meehan QC told the court the cupboard was well alight and the \"blaze immediately took hold and spread from there\". \nHe added: \"As a result of [Cameron House's] failure to keep the cupboard free of combustibles, ash and embers ignited and fire spread in the main building.\"\nThe night manager sounded the alarm and called 999. Firefighters arrived within 10 minutes to find a \"well developed\" fire in the mansion, which is near Balloch in West Dunbartonshire.\nMore than 200 guests were staying in the hotel. \nThe court heard one family-of-three on the second floor had to be rescued by firefighters while a couple on the first floor had to crawl to safety because corridors and fire escape pathways were filling with smoke and gases.\nIt was after 08:00 when it was discovered that Mr Dyson, 38, and Mr Midgley, 32, were missing. \nFirefighters wearing breathing apparatus found Mr Dyson on a landing at the top of a staircase. \nMr Midgley was lying in a fire escape passageway. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene. \nMr Dyson was taken to hospital, where he was also pronounced dead. \nPost-mortem examinations said the men's causes of death had been inhalation of smoke and fire gases. \nThe couple had travelled from London, and were staying at the five-star resort as the final stop on their winter break to Scotland. \nSheriff William Gallacher also heard of an incident three nights before the fatal fire, where O'Malley and another night porter were told not to put ash into plastic bags because it was a fire hazard. \nCameron House QC Peter Gray said it was therefore \"extremely difficult to understand\" why O'Malley did not follow this guidance on the night of the fire. \nThe court also heard that Cameron House staff were not properly trained in the safe disposal of ash and that no written procedures were in place. \nThere was also no procedure in place for emptying the metal ash bins outside the hotel on a regular basis.\nThat was contrary to recommendations made in two fire risk assessments carried out by an independent company in 2016 and 2017.\nAfter the first report was received by Cameron House management in January 2016, the resort manager agreed there was a lack of a formal procedure for disposing of ash and delegated the responsibility for this to his deputy. \nMr Meehan said this report \"should have been a game-changer\" for Cameron House. \nWhen the issue was raised again in a follow-up report a year later, managers believed it had already been dealt with. \nMr Gray said: \"The resort manager understood incorrectly that all the actions had been completed, including in relation to the written procedure for disposing of ash from open fires.\"\nThe Scottish Fire and Rescue Service had also warned Cameron House managers about the risks of storing combustibles in the concierge cupboard in August 2017. \nThe audit highlighted the potential danger of fire spreading rapidly through the building because of its age and voids. \nA follow-up letter was sent to management in November 2017 - one month before the fire - but combustibles continued to be stored in the cupboard.\nCameron House's lawyer added that the failings were not deliberate breaches but occurred \"as a result of genuine errors\".\nHe also told the court the fire had gone undetected for a long period before being discovered, and that the hotel had a \"suite of measures in place\" to deal with fire safety.\nAn absence of formal procedures for dealing with ashes and embers gave staff the opportunity to improvise, he added.\nMr Gray continued: \"I am instructed to extend my deepest sympathies from the accused to the families of Mr Midgley and Mr Dyson.\nHe said the hotel takes its duties to ensure the safety of its guests extremely seriously.\nDetails of what happened at Cameron House were first revealed in court on 14 December last year, but reporting restrictions meant they could not be published until now.\nSentencing is due to take place on 29 January.

      "text": "Police broke up a wedding party in north London, where they now say about 150 people had gathered.\nOfficers found the windows at the Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls' School, in Stamford Hill, had been covered when they arrived at 21:15 GMT on Thursday. \nGuests fled from the strictly Orthodox Charedi Jewish school when the police arrived. The organisers face a \u00a310,000 fine for breaking lockdown rules.\nThe Met originally claimed that about 400 guests were at the gathering.\nIn a statement, the school said its hall had been leased out.\nA spokesman for the school, whose principal Rabbi Avrahom Pinter died in April after contracting coronavirus, said \"we had no knowledge that the wedding was taking place\".\nHe added: \"We are absolutely horrified about last night's event and condemn it in the strongest possible terms.\"\nBoris Johnson supports the police for \"taking action against people who flagrantly and selfishly ignore the rules\", according to the prime minister's official spokesman.\nThe spokesman said: \"Large gatherings such as that pose a health risk, not just to those who attend but those who they live with or others who they may come into contact with.\"\nChief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, meanwhile, said the \"overwhelming majority\" of the Jewish community would be appalled at the event.\nRabbi Mirvis, who serves as the head of the UK's orthodox Jewish community but is not the leader of the Charedi group, called the wedding party \"a most shameful desecration of all that we hold dear\".\nFive guests were issued with \u00a3200 fixed penalty notices, according to police, who said their inquiries had established those present at the school had gathered for a wedding.\nVideo shared with the Jewish Chronicle shows officers in Stamford Hill speaking with a man to explain why they are there, although he is not accused of any wrongdoing. \nThey are then seen arriving at the Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls' School. \nDet Ch Sup Marcus Barnett of the Met Police said: \"This was a completely unacceptable breach of the law.\n\"People across the country are making sacrifices by cancelling or postponing weddings and other celebrations and there is no excuse for this type of behaviour. \n\"My officers are working tirelessly with the community and we will not hesitate to take enforcement action if that is required to keep people safe.\"\nOn Friday morning, a security guard at the school told the BBC there were more like 100 guests at the party than the much higher number given out by police.\nThe Met later said in a statement: \"Although initial calls suggested some 400 people had attended the wedding, it is now believed that approximately 150 people were in attendance.\"\nStamford Hill is part of the borough of Hackney, which has a Covid-19 infection rate of 625.43 cases per 100,000 people. The England average rate is 471.31 per 100,000 people. \nThe mayor of Hackney, Philip Glanville, said he was \"deeply disappointed\" that the wedding party had taken place, despite \"the number of lives that have already been lost in the Charedi community and across the borough\".\nHe added: \"Unfortunately, similar events have taken place even at this venue before and we need to be really clear how unacceptable it is.\n\"We will be meeting with the Rabbinate and our community partners over the coming days to see how we can prevent further incidents of this nature.\"\nLondon is under an England-wide lockdown, which prevents social mixing between households.\nLondoners are asked to only leave home for limited reasons such as shopping, going to work, seeking medical assistance, or avoiding domestic abuse.\nFor more London news follow on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel.\nDo you have any information to share about this incident?

We are powerless.\n\"I wasn't concerned. I told her 'you have three children'. I told her my tummy is bigger than hers.\"\nHe said his wife, a social worker who graduated with a first class degree, was \"as near perfection as it's possible to be\".\nMr Olowo said the medical director in Turkey \"confessed it had been a mistake\".\nAssistant coroner Alan Blundson recorded a narrative conclusion, and said: \"This is a tragic case, the more so because the surgery was elective cosmetic surgery.\n\"Whilst Mrs Bamgbose was determined to have it performed, her husband had not seen it in any way as necessary.\"\nA post-mortem examination found Mrs Bamgbose had a perforated bowel and her death was caused by peritonitis with multiple organ failure as a complication of liposuction surgery.\nMr Olowo has said he is suing Mono and the surgeon, Dr Hakan Aydogan, for \u00a31m in the Turkish courts, claiming medical negligence."

      "title": "Covid-19: NI lockdown to be extended until 5 March",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,NI Health,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Coronavirus lockdown restrictions in Northern Ireland will be extended until 5 March, the first and deputy first ministers have said.\nThe executive backed the health minister's proposal on Thursday and will review the move on 18 February.\nBut ministers were also told that restrictions may have to remain in place until after the Easter holidays.\nA lockdown closing non-essential retailers and encouraging employees to work from home began after Christmas.\nFamily gatherings are prohibited and people have been ordered to stay at home for all but essential reasons.\nSchools are closed to most pupils until after February's half-term but a paper looking at reopening will be put to ministers at next week's executive meeting.\nThe lockdown came in response to a spike in the number of cases of coronavirus, which followed a relaxation of some rules in the run-up to Christmas.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said extending the restrictions was an \"appropriate and necessary response\" to tackle the \"imminent threat\" posed by Covid-19.\nShe said she understood it would be difficult for many people to accept, given the uncertainty facing families and businesses, but added: \"To not press forward would risk all of the hard-won gains.\"\nThe first and deputy first ministers were right to state just how tough this decision will be for many people.\nBut there's an acceptance among the public that restrictions would have to be extended, given how bad things are in our hospitals.\nTheir decision also suggests politicians have perhaps learned from the last wave of the pandemic, when restrictions were turned on and off sporadically, and the impact that had both on cases and the messaging. \nThey're not alone in sustaining tough lockdown measures, with other UK nations and the Republic of Ireland also keeping their restrictions in place for several more weeks.\nBeyond that, it is thought health officials also want to ensure the vaccination programme is also \"well advanced\" before any restrictions are relaxed.\nThe hope is that, by spring, the picture will have improved significantly. \nUntil then the price we are paying for relaxations before Christmas looks likely to keep rising.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she recognised the executive was asking a lot of everybody but insisted the measures were important.\n\"We don't know what will come after [5 March],\" she said.\nMs O'Neill said there was a commitment not to keep restrictions in place longer than necessary but decisions would have to be taken in line with the health advice and concerns about a new variant of the virus which is more transmissible.\nThe executive's decision comes as another 21 deaths were recorded by the Department of Health on Thursday.\nThe reproductive rate of the virus - known as the R-number - had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations.\nBut the latest estimate from the Department of Health says it is sitting between 0.65 and 0.85 for cases within the community but is still above one for hospital admissions and intensive care.\nWhile some may wonder why are restrictions are being extended when the executive's policy has always been based on this rate of infection, the difference is that this time around there are three times as many people in Northern Ireland's hospitals than there were in last April's peak.\nDaily case numbers are still significantly higher too.\nWhile ministers have agreed to keep the current restrictions in place until March, Health Minister Robin Swann said it was possible they could be needed until Easter, which this year falls in the first week of April.\nIt is understood this plan is being discussed across the four UK nations but ministers will have to consider that in the review next month.\nMinisters were also warned that restrictions would be eased on a step-by-step basis in line with reducing pressures on the health service and ensuring the vaccination programme is \"well advanced\" before any relaxations are agreed.\nMrs Foster pleaded with people struggling with their mental health during the lockdown to \"please seek help\".\nMore than 100 medically-trained military personnel are to be deployed to help health staff deal with the pressure the latest phase of the pandemic is placing on hospitals.\nThe chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said the \"sustained pressure on our health service\" would probably last for three to four weeks.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, 51 Covid-19 related deaths and 2,608 new cases of the virus were recorded on Thursday.\nSimon Hamilton, the chief executive of the Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce, said the extension of the lockdown would be of \"little surprise to most businesses\".\nThe Stormont executive has agreed how to allocate almost \u00a3300m to help businesses, education, tourism and transport during the next phase of the lockdown.\nA total of \u00a3100m is going towards the Local Restrictions Support Scheme, the grant for business premises forced to closed due to the restrictions.\nThere will also be \u00a316m for tourism and hospitality, two sectors which have largely been unable to operate.\nIn addition, two more support schemes for the sector have been opened.\nOne aimed at large tourism and hospitality businesses is offering a pot of \u00a326m, with the Department for Economy having identified 250 businesses that will be eligible.\nThe other is a \u00a34m scheme to support those who provide bed-and-breakfast accommodation.\nJanice Gault from the trade body the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said the schemes were a \"real lifeline for the sector\".\n\"Trading over the last year has been limited with reserves now severely depleted and businesses operating in survival mode,\" she added.\nAlso among those to receive the extra cash will be limited company directors, who had not received support since March.\nLast week, a scheme was announced to give directors \u00a31,000 grants which one director described as a \"kick in the teeth\" given that he had little to no income for the past 10 months.\nBut that scheme is to be boosted with another \u00a320m so the payments on offer will more than treble to \u00a33,500.\nLocal newspapers will also benefit from 12 months of rates relief."

      "text": "The Holyrood inquiry into the handling of harassment claims against Alex Salmond is using legal powers to seek documents from the Crown Office.\nThe documents include messages between SNP officials, civil servants and advisers relating to Mr Salmond's legal challenge to the complaints process.\nIt is the first time MSPs have issued such a formal request in the history of the Scottish Parliament.\nConvener Linda Fabiani said the action was necessary to continue its work.\nThe committee was established in the wake of a judicial review court case where the Scottish government admitted its internal investigation of two harassment complaints against Mr Salmond had been unlawful.\nThe government had to pay out more than \u00a3500,000 in legal expenses to the former first minister, who was later acquitted of 13 charges of sexual assault in a separate criminal trial.\nThe notice, formally issued by Holyrood chief executive David McGill, states that the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) \"may hold documents relevant and necessary for the committee to fulfil its remit\".\nThe committee is seeking the release of documents detailing text or WhatsApp communications between SNP chief operating officer Susan Ruddick and Scottish government ministers, civil servants or special advisers between August 2018 and January 2019, that may be relevant to the inquiry.\nIt also wants to see any documents linked to the leaking of complaints to the Daily Record newspaper in August 2018.\nMs Fabiani said: \"Throughout this inquiry, the committee has been determined to get as much information as possible to inform its task.\n\"This is a step that hasn't been taken lightly, and is a first for this Parliament, but which the committee felt was needed as it continues its vital work.\"\nThe Crown Office has been given until 17:00 on 29 January to respond to the notice.\nNever before in Holyrood's history has it attempted to use this legal power of compulsion. \nSection 23 of the Scotland Act makes it possible to force a witness to give evidence in person or - as in this case - to hand over documents. \nIt sounds straightforward but lots of legal terms and conditions apply. \nThat's especially true in this case where MSPs are trying to compel the Crown Office - in charge of prosecutions and headed up by the Lord Advocate. \nThe Lord Advocate has potential get-outs if he considers releasing documents would \"prejudice criminal proceedings\" or otherwise be \"contrary to the public interest\". \nThat public interest test could be key. \nClearly, MSPs think social media messages and other material held by the Crown Office could be relevant to their inquiry and should be released. \nThe Crown Office has argued that disclosing evidence gathered in a criminal case for other purposes risks undermining confidence in the police and prosecutors. \nThe Lord Advocate has a big call to make - has the prosecution service (which he runs) or the parliament (to which he is answerable as a minister) got the better sense of where - on balance - the public interest lies?\nIn other developments, Mr Salmond has been given a deadline by which to appear before the committee. \nThe former SNP leader has been given the option of giving evidence to the committee either in person in the Parliament or by appearing remotely on a number of dates in the first week of February. \nMs Fabiani said if this was not possible then the \"committee regrets that it will not be able to take oral evidence from you\" although he would be free to submit further written evidence. \nMr Salmond's lawyers had said he was only available in the second week of February.\nIn a letter to the committee, the former first minister said this was because he had still to complete two further submissions but the process had been \"hampered\" by the Scottish government's \"failure\" to release its legal advice and the ongoing bid to recover documents from the Crown Office. \nMr Salmond's appearance is much anticipated following his written submission earlier this month in which he alleged that Nicola Sturgeon misled parliament. \nMs Sturgeon, who \"entirely rejects\" his claims, is expected to give evidence in the coming weeks and has said she is looking forward to putting her side across. \nMeanwhile, the committee has once again written to the Scottish government urging it to waive legal privilege and release the advice it received from lawyers regarding the case.\nA Crown Office spokesman said: \"COPFS has received the correspondence from the committee and will respond in early course.\"\nA Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"We will consider the committee's letter - but the Scottish government has already taken unprecedented steps to provide the committee with access to relevant information to allow it to fulfil its remit.\n\"The government has, exceptionally, provided the committee with access to a summary of the legal advice on the judicial review on a confidential basis.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The prime minister says it is too soon to say whether lockdown will be lifted in the spring.\nBut with the most vulnerable to be offered vaccination by mid-February, what is standing in the way?\nLockdown looks to be having an impact on infection levels with the number of new cases starting to fall.\nBut there are only tentative signs this has filtered through to a slowing of new admissions to hospital.\nAnd even if they start coming down, the overall number of patients in hospital will remain high as patients are being discharged at a much slower rate than they are coming in.\nChris Hopson of NHS Providers, which represents hospital bosses, predicts hospitals will remain under the current \"intense pressure\" perhaps until the end of February.\nWith no headroom in the NHS, ministers will be cautious about lifting many of the restrictions, especially with the threat of the new faster-spreading variant.\nThere are no guarantees the government will meet the mid-February target.\nThe UK has certainly made a good start. Per head of population, only Israel, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have vaccinated more.\nOver the past week more than two million people have received their first dose. \nThat puts the government on track for achieving its aim of offering a vaccine to everyone over 70, the extremely clinically vulnerable and frontline health and care workers. \nBut the supply chain remains fragile. Pfizer has announced a slowdown in manufacturing for the next couple of weeks so it can upgrade its facilities and ramp up production in the spring.\nThe UK is less reliant on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine than other countries, as we manufacture the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine here.\nThere are millions of doses already made but not all of it has been through the final packaging process or safety checks.\nEnsuring this happens will be crucial to allowing the NHS to keep its foot on the accelerator, especially as the vaccination clinics will have to start factoring in giving second doses from late February onwards.\nThose close to the programme say it will be \"touch and go\" especially if extra supplies of the Pfizer vaccine do not come back on stream as quick as the company is saying they will.\nEven if the supply is good, there will still be lots of vulnerable people.\nNearly 90% of Covid deaths have been in the groups due to get the jab by mid-February.\nBut no vaccine is 100% effective and uptake will not be 100%.\nWhat is more there will still be many vulnerable people in the over-60s age group.\nAs we get further into spring, everyone over the age of 50, as well as younger adults with health conditions, will be offered a vaccine. \nBut even that may not be enough, according to some.\nModelling by the University of Warwick suggests that, even with 85% uptake, a complete lifting of restrictions in April could lead to very high levels of deaths.\n\"Vaccines are not a panacea,\" says Prof Matt Keeling, who led the research.\nAnd for younger age groups, who are at little risk of dying from the virus, there is still the risk of long-Covid, he says. \nAlthough he acknowledges there is still little hard data to quantify this, some studies have suggested one in 10 suffers long-lasting symptoms from infection.\nThe factor that could have a significant impact on spread is whether vaccination stops transmission. \nThe trials showed the vaccines were good at stopping symptoms developing.\nBut it is not yet known whether those who have been vaccinated will still be able to pass the virus on.\nMost people expect there will be some disruption to transmission but how much is not clear - and will not be for months.\nBut on the other side of all this is the huge impact lockdown has. \nThe first priority will, of course, be the re-opening of schools. \nRussell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, says everything must be done to make this happen.\nHe says while schools contributed to spread of the virus, they were not a \"significant driver\", adding schools were closed for the \"benefit of the population\" but at great expense to children.\nOnce schools are open some tough calls will have to be made - and this is where the debate is going to rage.\nBackbench Tory MPs are putting the pressure on the prime minister with the Covid Recovery Group calling for a \"gradually unwrapping\" of society from early March.\nIn the end, it is going to come down to what society is willing to tolerate.\nUK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty has spoken about \"de-risking\" Covid.\nHis point is that we will reach a situation at which the level of death and illness caused by Covid is at a level society can \"tolerate\" - just as we tolerate 7,000 to 20,000 people dying from flu every year.\nSociologist Prof Robert Dingwall, who advises the government on the science of human behaviour, believes that point will be reached sooner rather than later.\n\"I think we will see a pretty rapid lifting of restrictions in the spring and summer. \n\"There are some sections of the science community that want to pursue an elimination strategy - but once you start seeing fatality levels down at the level of flu I think the public will accept that.\""

      "text": "Four men have been jailed for the manslaughter of 39 Vietnamese migrants found dead in a lorry trailer in Essex.\nThe migrants died \"excruciatingly painful\" deaths, having suffocated in the container en route from Belgium to Purfleet in October 2019, a judge said.\nRonan Hughes, 41, and Gheorghe Nica, 43, played \"leading roles\" in the smuggling conspiracy and were jailed for 20 and 27 years respectively.\nAt the Old Bailey, two lorry drivers were also jailed for manslaughter.\nEamonn Harrison, 24, who towed the trailer to the Belgian port of Zeebrugge before their journey to the UK, was sentenced to 18 years.\nMaurice Robinson, 26, was given 13 years and four months, having collected the trailer and opened it in an industrial estate to find the migrants dead.\nThree others members of the people-smuggling gang were also sentenced for conspiracy to facilitate unlawful immigration.\nChristopher Kennedy, 24, from County Armagh, was jailed for seven years; Valentin Calota, 38, of Birmingham, for four-and-a-half years; and Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Hobart Road, Tilbury, Essex, was given a three-year sentence.\nSentencing, Mr Justice Sweeney said: \"I have no doubt that the conspiracy was a sophisticated, long-running and profitable one to smuggle mainly Vietnamese people across the channel.\"\nHe said on the fatal trip the temperature had been rising along with the carbon dioxide levels throughout, hitting 40C (104F) while the container was at sea on 22 October 2019.\n\"There were desperate attempts to contact the outside world by phone and to break through the roof of the container,\" the judge said.\n\"All were to no avail and, before the ship reached Purfleet, [the victims] all died in what must have been an excruciatingly painful death.\"\nThe victims had used a metal pole to try to punch through the roof but only managed to dent the interior.\nThe court heard some of their final desperate phone messages, including one where a man spoke with ragged breaths as he apologised to his family.\n\"I can't breathe,\" he said. \"I want to come back to my family. Have a good life.\"\nJustice Sweeney added: \"The willingness of the victims to try and enter the country illegally provides no excuse for what happened to them.\" \nDuring the trial, jurors were given a snapshot of the victims - who included a bricklayer, a university graduate and a nail bar technician - and their dreams of a better life. \nMany of their families borrowed heavily to fund their passage, relying on their potential future earnings once they got into the UK.\nThe father of Nguyen Huy Tung, one of two 15-year-olds in the container, later learned of his son's death via social media.\nHarrison, of Newry, County Down, claimed he did not know there were people in the trailer when he towed it to the Belgian port, and that he watched \"a wee bit of Netflix\" in bed as they were loaded on. \nRobinson, from County Armagh, collected the trailer when it arrived on UK shores just after midnight on 23 October.\nHis boss, Hughes, had messaged him: \"Give them air quickly don't let them out.\" \nRobinson gave a thumbs-up in reply. When Robinson stopped on a nearby industrial estate, he found that the migrants were all dead.\nHis barrister said Robinson, who admitted manslaughter, being part of the trafficking plot and money laundering, was \"horrified by what he saw\".\nThe trial examined three smuggling attempts by the gang - two that were successful on 11 and 18 October, and the final trip on 23 October. \nOn all three runs, Nica, of Basildon, Essex, had arranged cars and a van to transport the migrants at the UK end. \nWhen Robinson discovered the bodies, there was a series of telephone conversations between him and Nica and Hughes, of Tyholland, County Monaghan, Ireland, before the driver eventually dialled 999. \nIn his evidence, Nica said Robinson told him: \"I have a problem here - dead bodies in the trailer.\"\nWhile Hughes admitted manslaughter, both Nica and Harrison were convicted by a jury.\nMr Justice Sweeney said that in the conspiracy \"two played leading roles, namely - in order of importance - Hughes and Nica\".\nHe accepted Hughes was \"not at the very top of the conspiracy\" but said his role was \"pivotal... in that he ran a haulage business and supplied the trailers and drivers used to transport the migrants\".\nThe judge said Nica \"recruited and paid the drivers whose job it was to collect the migrants when they reached the drop-off site in this country and to drive them to the safe house(s) where they were to be held until payment\".\nHe added at the top of the conspiracy was a Vietnamese man called \"Fong\", who was based in London.\nMr Justice Sweeney told the defendants jailed for manslaughter they would serve two-thirds of the term in custody, instead of the usual half.\nEarlier this month, Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Barclay Road, Tottenham, north London, was sentenced, having admitted his limited role in the people-smuggling operation. It was accepted he was not a member of the organised crime group behind the smuggling operation.  \nDet Ch Insp Daniel Stoten said: \"May this serve as a warning to those who think it's OK to prey on the vulnerabilities of migrants and their families, transporting them in a way worse than we would transport animals. \n\"My message to you is that we will find you and we will stop you.\"\nHe said the victims died in an \"unimaginable way, because of the utter greed of these criminals\".\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "title": "Biden's inauguration speech calls for unity - it won't be easy",
      "tags": "Washington DC,US election 2020,Donald Trump,US politics,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "At 12:01, in the midst of his inaugural address, Joe Biden officially became the 46th president of the United States.\nHe was already well into outlining exactly how daunting a task he - and the nation - have ahead in what he called its \"winter of peril\".\nAmerica is facing a devastating pandemic which has resulted in massive job losses and business closures, a threatened environment, urgent cries for racial justice and resurgence in \"political extremism, white supremacy and domestic terrorism\".\nHis speech was not a laundry list of proposals and solutions. Those were reserved for his first 17 executive actions as president - on immigration, climate change, transgender rights and public health, among others. \nThe Biden administration has also frozen all of Trump's last-minute regulations pending further review.\nInstead, Biden used his speech to offer hope - and to argue, at times forcefully, that the nation must be united in facing the challenges ahead; that it has to move past its current \"uncivil war\".\n\"Without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury,\" he said. \"No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos.\" \n\"This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge,\" he continued. \"And unity is the path forward\".\nAt times, Biden's speech seemed a direct rebuttal to his predecessor's administration, although he did not mention Donald Trump by name.\nWhere Trump frequently spoke of American greatness and glorified its founders, Biden noted that the nation's history has been a \"constant struggle\" between its ideals and sometimes harsh realities.\nWhere Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway spoke of \"alternative facts\" almost four years ago, Biden said: \"There is truth and there are lies - lies told for power and for profit.\"\nBiden wrapped up his inaugural address by warning that America must not \"turn inward\" - both as individuals retreating into \"competing factions\" and as a nation on the world stage.\n\"We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again,\" he said.\nRhetorically, Biden turned the page from Trump's days of \"America first\". \nThe first 100 days of any administration are always important to a new president. What are his priorities? What will he try to accomplish when his political capital is at its highest?\nJoe Biden and his presidential team have had nearly three months to plan out his first actions upon taking the oath of office, but executive action is the (relatively) easy part. \nHis speech reflected the reality that he enters office with his top priorities already determined for him.\nHis government will be responsible for distributing the coronavirus vaccine in an efficient and equitable way. After that, he will have to focus on the societal and economic disruptions caused by the pandemic.\nThe virus has exacerbated income inequality and pushed many households to the brink of economic ruin. It's devastated the travel and hospitality industries and placed incredible strain on the finances of state and local governments.\nHis pledge to seek unity will be tested early, as he pushes a sharply divided Congress to pass another, massive round of pandemic stimulus aid. If he wants to enact it quickly, he will need Republican support in the Senate, and already there are signs that some on the right may be lining up in opposition to more spending.\nThen there's Trump's Senate impeachment trial, which will present yet another challenge to national unity. It will keep Trump's name in the news for weeks, as his defenders rally to his side and his detractors call for consequences for his actions.\nAfter that, Biden's potential political paths diverge. He has said he wants to improve healthcare in the US, address growing college debt, make new investments in infrastructure and tackle climate change. \nHe's pledged to push immigration reform legislation that includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented migrants - a political lightning rod that helped fuel Trump's first presidential run.\nWhat he prioritises, and how successful his first efforts are, could determine the overall success of his administration. To make lasting change - policies that can't be undone by future presidents - he will have to work with Congress.\nThe inauguration ceremony is over. But, as Biden noted in his speech, the American people face one of the most challenging times in their nation's history. \n\"We will be judged by how we resolve these cascading crises of our era,\" he said.\nBiden campaigned against Trump for the opportunity to face those crises. Now he has his chance."

      "tags": "Policing,GCHQ,Home Office,NSPCC,National Crime Agency",
      "text": "Some 320 of the UK's most dangerous child sex offenders have been arrested since the first coronavirus lockdown, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said.\nInvestigators have been focusing on tracking down offenders who operate online.\nThe operation led to a total of 4,760 arrests and 6,500 children safeguarded between April and September last year.\nMeanwhile, the Home Office has launched a strategy to collect detailed data about child grooming gangs.\nThe Tackling Child Sexual Abuse Strategy aims to identify and convict offenders who operate in groups by gathering more information about their characteristics, including ethnicity.\nIt also involves investing in the national child abuse image database to identify offenders more quickly, protecting police from frequently being exposed to indecent images, and enabling parents to ask officers if someone with access to their child is known to them for cases of abuse.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said some who had suffered child sexual abuse had told her they felt \"let down by the state\", and insisted she was \"determined to put this right\".\nRob Jones, an NCA director, welcomed the initiative \"at a time when the threat to children is more severe than it has ever been\", highlighting that last year there were at least 300,000 people posing a sexual threat to children in the UK.\nHe said the NCA was focusing on the most dangerous offenders \"as part of the whole system approach\".\n\"Many feel they can operate with impunity online - using anonymisation techniques, secure accounts and the dark web - but as we have shown with this operation they are wrong and we have the capabilities to track them down,\" he said.\nMr Jones added: \"These are not just images or videos being viewed online.\n\"What we are uncovering here is evidence of the horrific, real-world sexual abuse of children.\" \nOut of the 320 arrested as part of the NCA's operation targeting the UK's most dangerous child sex offenders, 122 were targeted by NCA officers.\nSeventeen were in positions of trust, including a volunteer with the Scouts, church youth group leaders, a social worker, primary school and college teachers, a hospital care assistant, a police officer, and a civil servant.\nIn the year ending March 2020 the NCA and UK policing made 7,212 arrests and safeguarded and protected 8,329 children. This was a 50% increase in arrests and a 10% increase in safeguards compared with the year ending March 2019.\nMs Patel said that the national strategy would tackle and respond to \"all forms of child sexual abuse, relentlessly going after abusers, whilst better protecting victims and survivors\".\nShe added: \"Crucially, it contains a commitment to collect higher quality data on the characteristics of offenders, so that the government can build a fuller picture of perpetrators, and tackle the abuse that has blighted many towns and cities across our country.\"\nThe government has pledged to support local authorities' responses to exploitation through funding for The Children's Society's Prevention Programme initiative, which has so far trained 13,363 professionals to spot signs of child abuse.\nThrough the Online Safety Bill, the Home Office has also said it will ensure technology companies are held to account for harmful content on their sites.\nThe Children's Society's chief executive, Mark Russell, has described the strategy as a \"golden opportunity to improve support for child victims of horrific crimes and send a clear signal that child sexual abuse and exploitation are crimes that will not be tolerated\".  \nThe scheme was also welcomed by GCHQ and charity NSPCC, which said it has received more than 40 calls a day about child sexual abuse since the pandemic began.\nGCHQ's director of serious and organised crime said: \"Our work to tackle systemic internet problems, the insight we provide into offender behaviour and our efforts alongside law enforcement to identify and pursue the worst offenders will help to ensure there is no safe space online for these people to operate.\"\nNSPCC chief executive Sir Peter Wanless said it \"rightly puts the emphasis on early intervention and action across government but added it \"must be backed up with serious investment in support for victims\" - and that children were still being exposed to abuse from teachers and social workers.\nSir Peter said: \"It's crucial that no young person is left unprotected which is why it's disappointing the government has not committed to closing the legal loophole that enables some adults to abuse their position of power to have sexual contact with 16 and 17-year-olds in their care.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK is at an \"extremely precarious\" point, according to the chief medical adviser, despite signs Covid infections are beginning to fall.\nThe virus's reproduction rate is estimated to be at or below one for the first time since early December. \nAnything below one means the epidemic is shrinking.\nBut cases are falling from a \"very, very high level\", Prof Chris Whitty said - and may still be increasing in some areas.\n\"A very small change and it could start taking off again from an extremely high base,\" he warned. \nSpeaking at a Number 10 press conference on Friday evening, the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said the \"awful\" death rate would stay high \"for a little while before it starts coming down\".\n\"That was always what was predicted...and I think the information about the new variant doesn't change that\".\nEarly evidence suggests the variant of coronavirus that emerged in the UK may be more deadly, although findings are preliminary and there is a high level of uncertainty. \nDr Susan Hopkins at Public Health England said there was \"evidence from some but not all data sources which suggests that the variant of concern which was first detected in the UK may lead to a higher risk of death than the non-variant. \n\"Evidence on this variant is still emerging and more work is under way to fully understand how it behaves.\" \nThe Department of Health and Social Care said while the UK's R or reproduction number, might be below one - meaning a shrinking epidemic - overall, \"cases remain dangerously high and...it is essential that everyone continues to stay at home, whether they have had the vaccine or not.\"\nMeanwhile, Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures suggested cases were decreasing slightly or levelling off across Britain. \nBut infections are falling more slowly than they did during the first lockdown - by somewhere around a quarter every fortnight compared with a halving back in April. \nA further 40,261 cases, and 1,401 deaths were recorded on Friday in the UK.\nMore than five million people had been given a first dose of the vaccine by 21 January, and about half a million had received their second dose.  \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has previously said it is \"too early\" to say whether England's Covid restrictions will be able to end in the spring. \nWhile cases are falling or stable across the rest of the UK, in Northern Ireland cases have continued to rise and the new, more infectious strain has overtaken the older variant of the virus as of the start of January. \nDuring the week ending 16 January, about one in 55 people in England had the virus, the ONS estimated, with one in 35 in London testing positive. \nOne in 100 people had the virus in Scotland and one in 70 in Wales.\nBut in Northern Ireland infections have shot up from an an estimated one in 200 people testing positive in the week to 2 January, to one in 60 last week. \nONS statistician Sarah Crofts said while fewer people were testing positive in England, \"rates remain high and we estimate the level of infection is still over one million people\". \nAnd, she pointed out, \"the picture across the UK is mixed\".\nA survey by tech company ZOE and King's College London, based on swabs of people with and without symptoms, also suggested the R number could be at 0.8.\nAnd it estimated symptomatic cases had fallen by a quarter since last week.  \nMeanwhile, the proportion of people testing positive for the new Covid variant has risen considerably in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, ONS data suggest.\nBut the new strain, which remains by far the main source of infections in England, has yet to overtake the old strain in Scotland and Wales.\nWithin England, the proportion of infections that appear to be due to the new variant remained stable, but the gap between the regions is narrowing. \nIn the figures covering 2 January, 80% of infections looked like the new variant in London compared to 30% in the North East. \nTwo weeks later, that gap had narrowed to 70% in London versus 50% in the North East.\nIt is not clear what is behind the small fall in London, but it may be down to behaviour change, or other variants like the South Africa strain now in circulation and diluting the numbers.\nFollow Rachel on Twitter"

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Retailing,UK economy,Shopping,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "Shoppers bought far fewer clothes last year as lockdowns meant people had less opportunity to socialise and go out. \nClothes sales slumped 25%, the biggest drop in 23 years when records began, official figures suggest.\nWhile shops have reported demand for certain clothing such as pyjamas and loungewear has risen, demand for going-out items has fallen sharply.\nAnd despite a pick-up in December, clothing sales remain lower than before the pandemic struck.\n\"With few opportunities to socialise during lockdown and many people working from home, the clothing sector has been one of the \"worst-affected by restrictions\", the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.\nGrowing numbers of High Street shops have faced financial difficulties due to the temporary store closures imposed during lockdowns.\nTopshop-owner Arcadia and competitors Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, Oasis and Warehouse have all slid into insolvency since lockdown measures were first imposed last March.\nThe inability to try clothes on in bricks-and-mortar shops, as well as restrictions on eating out meaning consumers are going out less, have all affected sales, the ONS suggested.\nAnd the slump in demand for fashion meant that British retail sales saw their largest annual fall on record in 2020.\nSales fell by 1.9% last year, when compared with 2019, the largest year-on-year fall since records began in 1997.\nRetail sales, including fuel, did see a small increase last month, growing by 0.3% when compared with November.\nIt came following the end of England's national lockdown on 2 December. Sales had slumped by 4.1% in November during a month-long shutdown.\nBut \"this was very clearly not a Merry Christmas for most of the High Street\", said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \n\"For most retailers it's the most crucial month of the year to get profit back on track but the large upswing in sales after the pain of the November lockdowns didn't materialise,\" she said.\nONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said that some sectors, however, had been \"able to buck the trend\" last year.\n\"The increased popularity of click-and-collect and people buying more items from home led to a strong year for overall internet sales, with record highs for food and household goods sales online.\"\nIn a sign of the way the pandemic has changed shopping habits, the value of online retail sales jumped by 46.1% in 2020 when compared with 2019 - the highest annual growth reported since 2008.\nOnline trade now accounts for more than one-third of all retail sales.\nRichard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, explained that the rise of online had \"polarised industry performance\".\n\"The gap widened between those retailers with the most sophisticated online propositions from those with legacy store-dependent business models,\" he said.\nOnline-only retailers such as Boohoo and Asos, for example, have reported strong sales figures in 2020. \nSupermarkets in particular have embraced the shift to digital, with online food store sales up 79.3% last year.\nThere was also better news from the John Lewis Partnership, which owns Waitrose, on Friday. It said that it would return a \u00a3300m emergency coronavirus loan to the government as trading went \"better than anticipated\" over Christmas. \nToday's figures show just how badly the clothing sector has been affected these last 12 months. \nFashion is the big retail loser from this pandemic. Who needs to splash out on the latest trends when we're working from home and not going out? And even when clothing shops are open, chances are you can't try things on. \nWith all of the Covid-19 measures in place, the fun has been sucked out of shopping. We haven't stopped spending, but most of it is going online. Boohoo and Asos have seen very strong sales growth, for instance. \nThe going's far harder for retailers with large numbers of physical stores. The pressures have already taken their toll on the likes of Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group and Debenhams. \nAnd things may well get worse on the high street before they better. Many retailers are worried about the end of the business rates holiday and of the temporary ban on eviction for non payment of rent in April. These will result in a big increase in costs when sales have yet to fully recover. \nBut Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, called for more help for non-essential shops and High Street retailers who continue to be affected by lockdown restrictions.\n\"With no end in sight for retailers closed in lockdown, many will struggle to survive under a mounting rent burden, and a return to full business rates in April,\" she said.\nShe called on government to offer \"targeted\" business rates relief to businesses worst-affected by the pandemic.\n\"Decisive action is needed to save jobs, shops and local communities, with town and city centres looking to be particularly hard hit unless the government acts now.\"\nEarlier in January, a report from the Centre for Retail Research said that 2020 was the worst for High Street job losses in more than 25 years, because of the acceleration towards online shopping.\nNearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost last year, up by almost a quarter from 2019, it said."

If you don't follow rules then the police will enforce them,\" she said.\nCurrently in England the fine for those attending illegal indoor gatherings stands at \u00a3200 - or \u00a3100 if paid early.\nFines of up to \u00a310,000 for holding large illegal gatherings of more than 30 people will still only apply to the organisers.\nPolice will continue to follow the strategy of engaging with the public, explaining the rules and encouraging compliance, but the Home Office has warned that in severe breaches of lockdown rules, offenders should expect to receive a fine.\nMs Patel said the government would \"not stand by while a small number of individuals put others at risk\".\nShe was joined at the briefing by NHS England regional medical director for London Dr Vin Diwakar, who compared breaking the rules to turning on a light in the middle of a blackout during the Blitz.\n\"It doesn't just put you at risk in your house, it puts your whole street and the whole of your community at risk,\" he said.\nWelcoming the fines announcement, Martin Hewitt, chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said large gatherings were \"dangerous, irresponsible, and totally unacceptable\".\nHe added: \"I hope that the likelihood of an increased fine acts as a disincentive for those people who are thinking of attending or organising such events.\"\nOfficial figures will be released next week showing how many fines have been given out since the start of this latest national lockdown, Mr Hewitt said. \nHowever, he stressed that \"forces are telling us there has been a significant increase\" in recent weeks. \n\"That's reflecting the fact that we've had more officers out on dedicated patrols taking targeted action against those small few who are letting everybody down,\" he said.\nAccording to Mr Hewitt, three police officers were injured in Brick Lane, east London, last week, after more than 40 people were found cramped indoors at a house party.\nMeanwhile, more than 150 people were found at a party in Hertfordshire, complete with music equipment including mixing decks and amplifiers, and another officer was injured.\nHe said forces in England had issued 250 fixed penalty notices (FPNs) to people organising large gatherings between late August, when regulations were introduced, and 17 January.\nIn some other recent examples of lockdown breaches:\nThe latest fines announcement comes after figures showed that assaults on emergency workers made up more than a quarter of Covid-related crimes prosecuted in the first six months of the pandemic.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said there were 1,688 such offences between 1 April and 30 September in England and Wales.\nThey were among almost 6,500 crimes related to coronavirus in that period.\nSome 1,137 charges were brought for breaking coronavirus laws, according to the figures published by the CPS - which cover completed prosecutions. \nOn Thursday, it was reported that another 1,290 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK, bringing the total to 94,580.\nAnd a further 37,892 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus were announced, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to 3,543,646."

Michael Buchanan finds a team of volunteers there battling to deal with the pandemic.\nThe family shuffled quietly past a crate of milk cartons. They came through the small porch, towards the open coffin. Inside was a woman - a loved one - who died of Covid two days ago. The coffin sat feet away from tins and packets to be distributed by the local food bank. The milk was the latest delivery. \nIt is impossible to capture the enormous consequences of the pandemic. But last Saturday lunchtime, this tragic image - one of grief and hardship coming together - came close, for me at least. \nCovid-19 has made extraordinary demands of so many different people, but what is currently happening at the Masjid Ibrahim and Islamic Centre in east London is truly remarkable. Situated on a busy road, with the noise of ambulance sirens regularly shattering its peaceful interior, the mosque has closed to communal prayer and is open for two other purposes - to provide a funeral service and a food bank to the local community. Both are inundated. \n\"We've had so many bodies coming in. It's quite shocking. It's one after another after another. We've never had that situation before,\" says Sofia Bhatti. Alongside her friend, Tabassum Khokhar - known as Tabs - the pair are unheralded heroes. They volunteer to wash the bodies of Covid-positive women prior to burial. \nThe practice, called Ghusl, is a sacred Islamic ritual and is usually performed by the deceased's relatives, who cleanse and shroud the body. But Covid restrictions mean families are currently denied that religious honour, so volunteers like Sofia and Tabs are taking on what they consider to be a privileged task. \n\"We actually believe that when we are shrouding here, that God is shrouding the soul at the same time,\" says Tabs, standing by a coffin. By day, she works as a teaching support worker in a local school, so the PPE that the mosque provides - bodysuit, footwear, two sets of gloves, masks and visors - is crucial for her. \"I make sure my PPE is secure because it's not just about me, it's about my family. I have an 81-year-old mother.\" \nThe women are seeing first hand - and in graphic detail - the pressure the NHS is under. \"Very often we see bodies coming in with a lot of medical equipment still attached to them,\" says Sofia. \"Tubes and pipes and catheters still attached. So it makes our job a little bit harder.\" One of the women they washed during my visit had died in the ambulance, never actually reaching hospital. \nThere are far more bodies than during the first peak and there is a larger age range. One day this week, the mosque was handling seven bodies. A few days earlier they said they'd processed 10 funerals, all arranged for free and paid for by donations. Before the pandemic, they'd handled two to three funerals a week. The two local hospital trusts in east London have each had more than 1,000 Covid deaths since the start of the pandemic. More have died at home.  \nThe borough of Newham, where the mosque sits, has suffered a disproportionate number of deaths. Home to the Olympic Park, the 2012 London games were meant to regenerate this area. Yet it retains high levels of poverty and overcrowded housing. Add in a diverse population, rich in south Asian culture, and large numbers of people who can't work from home and the virus has sadly ripped through its residents. \nIsfand Aslam said he's shocked by what's going on. His father, Mohammad, died on 3 January, a week after falling ill. His positive Covid test result arrived two days after his death. The 85-year-old was a committee member at the Masjid Ibrahim and despite his age had been in good health. \"It took a week between him passing away and getting buried. Initially I was getting a lot of condolences from friends. But by the end of that week I am giving condolences to three friends because their fathers had passed away. It's now got to the stage where everybody we know knows somebody who has passed away.\"\nThe sheer number of deaths is impacting the area's main Muslim cemetery. Normally, the Gardens of Peace buries three to four people each day. They're currently carrying out an average of 15 funerals daily. Overall, they are about 50% busier than usual. They can no longer promise burials within 24 hours, as per Muslim custom. \nDespite this, there is still a concerning number of people in the local area who either don't think Covid is real or are resistant to taking a vaccine. There was anger among some community leaders before Christmas when it emerged the Bangladeshi High Commission in London held a cultural evening to celebrate its independence. Photos from the event, on 16 December, showed a group - including the High Commissioner herself - standing close together with no masks or social distancing. The High Commission said performers had been Covid tested and it had issued 10 videos in Bangla urging British-Bangladeshis to adhere to UK government guidance.  \nTo counter disinformation among its members, an imam at the Masjid Ibrahim, Mohammad Ammar, filmed a short video of himself being injected with the vaccine and urged his congregation to follow suit. Imam Ammar has actually been furloughed by the mosque as it focusses all its resources on battling the pandemic, including feeding its local community. \nThe virus forced the mosque to open a food bank in March. It is still running 10 months on. On Monday night, I watched a steady stream of people gather in the gloom at the rear of the mosque to fill their bags. Most were collecting on behalf of a larger household, and the mosque says they're currently feeding 350 families each week, including students, refugees, people with no access to public funds and those who've lost income.  \nAmong those collecting food on Monday was Mohammad Rahman. A 42-year-old chef, he lost his job in an Indian restaurant three months ago. The married father of two boys - aged eight and six - told me he was already in rent arrears and struggling to pay his energy bills. \"My son says 'where is the pizza'? But I have no money. He says '[can I have] chicken and chips'? But I have no money. The shops are open, but no money\", he adds, taking his hands from his pockets. \nIn normal times, the Masjid Ibrahim would attract about 1,100 worshippers over three floors for Friday prayers, and there has been some pressure on the leadership to reopen for communal worship. But Asim Uddin, chairman of the mosque, says now is not the time. \"Prayers, yes, it's important. But right now what is the need? The need of the community is they want to be fed and they want a place where they can respectfully bury their loved ones. And the demand is overwhelming. Right now, it's better they stay home, and they can pray at home until the situation goes back to normal.\"\nMichael Buchanan is the BBC's social affairs correspondent and has been reporting on the impact of the pandemic on communities in the UK. Last year, he visited the town of Pontypool to find out what impact coronavirus restrictions were having in Wales."

      "tags": "EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,EU Customs Union,Brexit,Fashion",
      "text": "UK retailers could abandon goods EU customers want to return, with some even thinking of burning them because it is cheaper than bringing them home. \nThey say the new EU trade deal has put costly duties on returns at a time when firms are already struggling.\nThe BBC has been told UK High Street and luxury brands have a mounting volume of goods stuck with courier services on the continent. \nNone of the retailers would comment on the problem. \nAdam Mansell, boss of the UK Fashion & Textile Association (UKFT), said it's \"cheaper for retailers to write off the cost of the goods than dealing with it all, either abandoning or potentially burning them.\"\nSince 1 January, lots of European customers have been presented with an unexpected customs invoice when signing for goods they've ordered from the UK. These new customs charges are a result of the new EU trade deal with the UK. \n\"It's part of the ongoing small print of the deal,\" said Mr Mansell. \"If you're in Germany and buying goods from the UK, you as the German customer are the importer bringing goods into the EU.\n\"You then have a courier company knocking on the door giving you a customs clearance invoice that you need to pay to receive your goods.\"\nMany customers automatically reject the goods, refusing to pay the additional surcharges, leaving couriers to take them away.\nAbout 30% of items bought online are returned, according to figures from Statista. That has meant large volumes of goods are heading back to the UK. \nWhen goods arrive back at depots on the Continent, there is new customs paperwork to complete. \"Export clearance charge, import charge arrival, import VAT charge and depending on the goods a rules of origin document as well,\" said Mr Mansell. \n\"Lots of large businesses don't have a handle on it, never mind smaller ones.\"\nThe BBC has seen a document that states four major UK High Street fashion retailers are stockpiling returns in Belgium, Ireland and Germany. One brand will incur charges of almost \u00a320,000 to get the returns back.\nCouriers and freight businesses that ship from the UK to Europe are also experiencing delays getting goods to the Continent because of the new customs clearances.\n\"It's a bigger change than we thought possible,\" explained Shona Brown from Speedy Freight, a courier service. \"Before, we'd get the order to Germany and off the driver would go. \n\"Now we've got to do export entry detailing where was it made, the driver needs to go to the customs office at Dover, then customs in Germany on arrival and then sort out the VAT. There are so many hoops to jump through, it's so laborious.\"\n\"You've got to have manpower to figure out what to do. And with people working from home it's difficult. For small businesses, it is a huge thing for people to do,\" she added. \nUlla Vitting Richards runs her sustainable fashion brand VILDNIS from the UK. She has stopped exporting to her fastest growing market, the EU, because of the new customs processes.\n\"I've been involved in logistics before. I expected it to be bad and I am used to shipping to the USA which is difficult. But this is just mind-blowing,\" she said. \n\"Every day there is another layer. In the first two weeks we couldn't get answers. For two years we were told to get ready for Brexit. But for these we couldn't prepare.\"\nShe added: \"I don't think we can increase prices but we might just have to say that we can't make the business with the EU work. It is a real shame. There is a huge interest in sustainable fashion in Europe and we might have to walk away from it.\"\nUlla did speak with the Department for International Trade for help and advice. She was told that setting up a subsidiary distribution hub in Europe might be a good idea: \"He told me we'd be best off moving stock to a warehouse in Germany and get them to handle it.\"\nRetailers in the UK and Europe that trade across the new customs border are all still adapting to the rules. Hauliers and customs agents are facing a steep learning curve too. \nThe government said: \"Now the UK has left the EU customs union and Single Market, there are new rules and processes businesses will need to follow.\n\"We have encouraged companies new to dealing with customs declarations to appoint a specialist to deal with import and export declarations on their behalf - and we made more than \u00a380m available to expand the capacity of the customs agents market.\" \nIt added: \"Most businesses use a specialist such as a customs broker, freight forwarder or fast parcel operator to deal with this.\n\"The government will continue to work closely with businesses to ensure they are able to trade effectively under the new rules.\""

      "text": "A second coronavirus vaccine manufacturer has warned of supply issues to the European Union, compounding frustration in the bloc.\nAstraZeneca said a production problem meant the number of initial doses available would be lower than expected.\nThe fresh blow comes after some nations' inoculation programmes were slowed due to a cut in deliveries of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nThe EU Health Commissioner expressed \"deep dissatisfaction\" at the news.\nOfficials have not confirmed publicly how big the shortfall will be, but an unnamed EU official told Reuters news agency that deliveries would be reduced to 31m - a cut of 60% - in the first quarter of this year.\nThe drug firm had been set to deliver about 80 million doses to the 27 nations by March, according to the official who spoke to Reuters. \nThe AstraZeneca vaccine, developed with Oxford University, has not yet been approved by the EU's drug regulator but is expected to get the green light at the end of this month, paving the way for jabs to be given.\nA spokesman for AstraZeneca said on Friday that \"initial volumes will be lower than originally anticipated\" without giving further details.\nHis written statement blamed the discrepancy on \"reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain\" and said the firm was continuing to ramp up production volumes. \nNews of the delay comes amid criticism and frustration across the region about the speed of vaccination roll-outs.\nIsrael, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, and the US are all well ahead of EU nations in terms of doses given per capita so far.\nThe European Commission has co-ordinated orders for all member states, with vaccines then distributed based on their population size.\nVaccines are increasingly seen by experts as the only way out of the Covid-19 crisis, with many European nations struggling to cope with a deadly surge of the virus over the winter period. \nAustrian media have reported that only 600,000 of two million AstraZeneca doses promised by the end of March will arrive in the country on time, with the remaining 1.4m now being delivered in April.  \nA delay would be \"completely unacceptable\", Austrian Health Minister Rudolf Anschober said on Friday. \nAs for Pfizer, the US firm said it had to cut shipments for the next few weeks while it worked to increase capacity at its Belgian processing plant. The EU has ordered 600 million doses from Pfizer.  \nSome regions, including Germany's most populous state North-Rhine Westphalia and parts of Italy, said earlier this week that they were suspending giving first jabs of the two-dose vaccine because of the shortages.\nItaly and Poland have threatened to take legal action in response to the reduction in vaccine supply.\nMeanwhile Hungary's government, which has complained over the time it is taking EU regulators to approve the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, has reached a deal with Russia to buy up large quantities of its Sputnik V vaccine, even though it has not received EU approval.\nEuropean Council President Charles Michel, who led a call of EU leaders this week, said Thursday that officials were considering all ideas to try and stop future vaccine delays. \n\"All possible means will be examined to ensure rapid supply, including early distribution to avoid delays,\" he said.\nEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and Mr Michel both say they are still aiming for the target of 70% of the EU population being vaccinated by summer.\nThe total number of German Covid deaths climbed above 50,000 on Friday - a day after the country warned that it could close its borders if other EU countries were less strict in controlling the virus. Berlin sounded the alarm amid rising concern about new variants.\nEU leaders agreed late on Thursday to keep their internal borders open but warned non-essential travel might need to be restricted to curb the spread of the virus. \nMs von der Leyen said Thursday that more testing and \"targeted measures\" were needed throughout the EU in order to keep internal and external borders open. \nFor its part, France said it would impose tighter travel restrictions for European arrivals from Sunday, requiring a negative PCR Covid test within three days of travel.\nIn the Netherlands, a ban on all flights from the UK, South Africa and South American countries came into effect on Saturday to try and prevent new coronavirus variants gaining a foothold.\nLooking forward to the future, officials from EU nations reliant on tourism - including Spain and Greece - have floated the possibility of using vaccination certificates to allow for cross-border travel but there has been scepticism within the bloc.

      "text": "There was a \"significant failure\" in the way exam bodies in Wales handled awarding student grades in 2020, a report says.\nThe independent review found there was \"too much confidence\" in statistical models, and the appeals process in place was inadequate.\nQualifications Wales (QW) said it had learnt many lessons and WJEC exam board will look \"in detail\" at the findings.\nTeaching union UCAC described the report's findings as \"scathing\".\nIts release comes after it was announced this week that teachers will make 2021 grade assessments\nThe review was ordered by the Welsh Government following the outcry over initial examination results awarded in August for A-level students.\nIn the weeks after the coronavirus pandemic took hold, formal external exams in Wales were scrapped, with schools asked to provide grade assessments for sixth-form and GCSE pupils.\nHowever, it later emerged 42% of the A-level grades were lower than those submitted by teachers.\nIn her foreword the report panel's chairwoman Louise Casella, said substantial numbers of young people across Wales \"were left feeling bewildered and distressed as they received A level results that bore no relation to their expectation and their abilities\".\nThe result decision was reversed, and school's predicted grades reinstated, but not before \"some learners lost their university place and some were not able to progress as planned in 2020\", noted Ms Casella, who is also director of The Open University in Wales.\nThe review found that QW and the WJEC board would have known the \"scale of the outliers\" and had \"an insight\" into the likely number of appeals.\nBut the bodies failed to fully test \"alternative routes or approaches\" to the statistical models they used to standardise results.\nThe review added it was \"surprising\" QW did not explore additional safeguards, after having being previously warned about, and acknowledging that there were potential problems with the statistical process.\nThe report said it could not find evidence either WJEC or QW \"acknowledged, accepted or anticipated the scale of the issues\" nor the risk of unfairness to learners, and that it considered this a \"significant failure\".\nThe approach last summer had resulted in a \"significant breakdown\" in trust between the teaching profession and the regulator and examining body, added the report authors.\nIt said fairness must now be central to planning for 2021, avoiding automated algorithms to predict individual grades, and developing an appeals process.\nDelivering the report, the review panel chair added: \"There is now a real opportunity for the education sector of Wales to come together to develop and deliver a qualifications system that puts learners at its heart, not only for the cohort facing qualifications in 2021, but for the longer term.\"\nQW said the review had \"some useful findings and recommendations that we are already addressing\".\nChair David Jones and Chief Executive Philip Baker said: \"We would have welcomed greater engagement with the review panel so there was full consideration of all the issues.\"\nChief Executive of WJEC Ian Morgan, said he was \"disappointed with some aspects of the report\" but the exam board would \"look in detail at the findings to identify areas where we need to take action to continuously improve as an organisation.\"\nEducation Minister Kirsty Williams has welcomed the report and how it would help drive how students are graded by teachers and schools this summer.\n\"It is my sincere hope and expectation that our education system can continue to work together to support the progression of our learners in exam years, both through the delivery of these assessment arrangements and through a wider package of support,\" she said.\nUCAC Deputy General Secretary Rebecca Williams, said the report supported its call for external moderation of grades, to improve fairness to students.\n\"There are longer-term recommendations, including the need to be more ambitious in terms of reform of qualifications and assessment in relation to the new curriculum, and we look forward to discussing these over the coming months,\" she said."

He now presents a breakfast show in the UK.\nHe was initially supportive of President Trump after his surprise election win but became increasingly critical in the last 12 months.\n\"We had a very nice conversation... I always got on well with Trump,\" Morgan said of their October call, but added that Mr Trump's \"character flaws - the chronic narcissism, the desire to make everything about himself\" made him a \"useless leader\". \nOn their friendship, Morgan described Mr Trump's behaviour since the November presidential election as \"egregious\" and \"so obviously on a pathway\" to the Capitol Hill riots on 6 January. \n\"I just felt - no, I'm done with you now,\" Morgan said. \nYou may also be interested in: "

      "text": "The second impeachment trial of Donald Trump will begin next month under an agreement reached between Senate Democrats and Republicans.\nHouse of Representatives Democrats will send the charge of \"inciting insurrection\" to the Senate on Monday.\nBut arguments will not begin until the week of 8 February, allowing Mr Trump's lawyers two weeks to build a defence.\nDemocrats accuse the ex-president of instigating the deadly 6 January riot at the US Capitol.\nThe House last week paved the way for the Senate proceedings by charging Mr Trump with inciting the violence, which left five people dead. \nHis second impeachment trial will begin almost exactly a year after the Senate acquitted him on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. That case related to accusations he pressured Ukraine to help smear Joe Biden and his son.\nMr Trump's term ended on Wednesday and he left Washington, snubbing his successor Joe Biden's inauguration.\nHis speech to a rally ahead of the Capitol riot are at the heart of the case against him. The then-president told protesters near the White House to \"peacefully and patriotically\" make their voices heard as they prepared to march towards the US Capitol building, which houses the US Congress. He also told them to \"fight like hell\".\nTop Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said on Friday that the House would deliver the impeachment article - or charge - on Monday. \n\"The Senate will conduct a trial of the impeachment of Donald Trump. It will be a full trial. It will be a fair trial,\" Mr Schumer said, speaking on the floor of the Senate.\nHouse Democrats say the article will be passed to the upper chamber of Congress at 19:00 local time on Monday. Democratic impeachment managers, lawmakers from the House who will act as prosecutors during the Senate trial, will be sworn in on Tuesday.\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell's office said he was glad Mr Schumer had agreed to his request for more time during the pre-trial phase, and that the trial itself would begin on 9 February. \nA statement said: \"Especially given the fast and minimal process in the House, Republicans set out to ensure the Senate's next steps will respect former President Trump's rights and due process, the institution of the Senate, and the office of the presidency. \n\"That goal has been achieved. This is a win for due process and fairness.\" \nEarlier on Friday, President Biden also appeared to suggest he would prefer a later trial. He told reporters, referring to the urgent domestic issues that he wants to pass legislation to address: \"The more time we have to get up and running to meet these crises, the better.\"\nThe White House will however not say whether Mr Biden thinks Mr Trump should be convicted. \n\"[Joe Biden] is no longer in the Senate and it's up to the Senate and the Congress to hold the former president accountable,\" said press secretary Jen Psaki when asked on Friday.\nEven though Democrats now hold a narrow Senate majority, they would need the support of at least 17 Republicans in order to convict Mr Trump, because a two-thirds vote is required.\nBut Senator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, told CNN on Friday: \"The chances of getting a conviction are virtually nil.\"\nOnly five Republican senators - Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Susan Collins of Maine and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania - are seen as potential defectors. \nMr Trump will be the first former US president ever to be tried by the Senate. No president has ever been convicted in such proceedings, and if Mr Trump were found guilty he could end up being barred from future office.\nOn Friday, Mr Trump was approached by a reporter from the Washington Examiner at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida.\u00a0\nThe former president was asked about his future plans. \"We'll do something, but not just yet,\" he told the journalist from his regular table at the private club before an aide cut short the brief encounter.\u00a0\nMr Trump is residing five miles away at his other golf club, Mar-a-Lago, which he calls his \"Winter White House\"."

      "text": "Many staff at nurseries, pre-schools and childminders \"don't feel safe at work\", says the Early Years Alliance.\nThe group, representing early years providers, wants staff in this sector to be a higher priority for Covid testing and vaccinations.\nNurseries and settings for young children in England have been told to remain open during lockdown.\nThe government said the under-fives were \"unlikely to be playing a driving role in transmission\". \nThe Early Years Alliance received more than 3,500 responses in a survey of staff in nurseries or childcare settings and said these suggested widespread concerns - with half of those who replied saying they did not feel safe at work.\nNeil Leitch, chief executive of the group, said the safety worries were \"a cause for serious concern\". \nHe called on the government to implement rapid coronavirus testing among early years staff \"as a matter of urgency\", adding they should be \"given priority access to vaccinations in phase two of the rollout\".\nThere are currently no confirmed plans for lateral-flow testing in nurseries and pre-schools.\nBut the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is looking at whether some high-risk professions should be prioritised for vaccination. \nAnd Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the BBC's Breakfast programme he would \"very much like to see it\" once the most vulnerable groups had received their jabs. \nA Department for Education (DfE) spokesman said: \"Keeping nurseries and childminders open will support parents and deliver the crucial care and education for our youngest children.\n\"Current evidence suggests that pre-school children are less susceptible to infection and are unlikely to be playing a driving role in transmission.\"\nThe Early Years Alliance survey also found concerns that staff shortages would make it difficult for some nurseries and pre-school settings to stay open.\nDr Amelia Massoura, who runs Stepping Stone pre-school, in Sittingbourne, Kent, said: \"Out of six members of staff, four have contracted Covid-19.\n\"Fortunately, all have recovered well.\"\nVanessa Linehan, manager of Sandbrook Community Playgroup in Hackney in London, said: \"We are happy to stay open to support our families.\n\"But we want our staff to have testing and vaccinations as a priority. \n\"We encourage local authorities to prioritise appropriate testing for early-years staff through their community testing programmes,\" said the Department for Education spokesman.\nHowever, Labour's shadow education minister Tulip Siddiq accused the government of \"incompetence and neglect\", saying early-years staff \"deserve... proper access to testing\".\nShe questioned why \"the government has refused to publish the scientific basis for keeping early-years settings open in lockdown\" and called on it to \"urgently pull back from the brink of funding changes that could lead to viable early-years providers going bust\".\nThe government changed the funding formula for the early years sector in December, basing it on current attendance rather than pre-pandemic levels. \nAccording to the DfE, early years attendance is at 54% of the usual daily level, as of 14 January, leading to a shortfall in revenues.\nIn primary and secondary schools, which are open to vulnerable children and children of key workers only, average attendance levels have fallen to just 14%.\nRoughly half of nurseries and pre-schools and a third of childminders expect to be operating at a loss by the end of the spring term, based on current levels of government support, according to the survey. \n\"Early years providers are the only part of the education sector that the government has asked to remain open to all families,\" said Mr Leitch \n\"It is surely not too much to ask for the protection - both practical and financial - needed to ensure that we can continue to do so.\""

      "text": "Google has threatened to remove its search engine from Australia over the nation's attempt to make the tech giant share royalties with news publishers.\nAustralia is introducing a world-first law to make Google, Facebook and potentially other tech companies pay media outlets for their news content.\nBut the US firms have fought back, warning the law would make them withdraw some of their services.\nAustralian PM Scott Morrison said lawmakers would not yield to \"threats\".\nAustralia is far from Google's largest market, but the proposed news code is seen as a possible global test case for how governments could seek to regulate big tech firms.\nTech firms have faced increasing pressure to pay for news content in other countries, including France, where Google struck a landmark deal with media outlets on Thursday.\nIn Australia, the proposed news code would tie Google and Facebook to mediated negotiations with publishers over the value of news content, if no agreement could be reached first.\nGoogle Australia managing director Mel Silva told a Senate hearing on Friday that the laws were \"unworkable\". \n\"If this version of the code were to become law, it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia,\" she said.\nBut lawmakers challenged this, accusing Google of \"blackmail\" and bullying Australia for raising the reform.\nMr Morrison said his government remained committed to progressing the laws through parliament this year. \n\"Let me be clear: Australia makes our rules for things you can do in Australia. That's done in our parliament,\" he told reporters on Friday.\nGoogle is the dominant search engine in Australia and has been described by the government as a near-essential utility, with little market competition.\nThe government has argued that because the tech platforms gain customers from people who want to read the news, the tech giants should pay newsrooms a \"fair\" amount for their journalism.\nIn addition, it has argued that the financial support is needed for Australia's embattled news industry because a strong media is vital to democracy.\nMedia companies, including News Corp Australia, a unit of Rupert Murdoch's media empire, have lobbied hard for the government to force tech firms to the negotiating table amid a long-term decline in advertising revenue.\nMeanwhile, Google's revenues have increased markedly in the same period, amounting to more than $160bn (\u00a3117bn) globally in 2019. In the same year, Google was reported to have made $3.7bn in gross revenue in Australia.\nOf that revenue, $7.7m was generated from news content, Google said in a blog last year. \nGoogle's threat to remove its entire search product is its most severe yet. News accounts for just 12.5% of Google searches in Australia, according to lawmakers.\nIf the law is passed, the news code would initially apply only to Facebook and Google, the government says.\nIf Google withdrew its search engine, Australian internet users would be forced to use alternatives such as Microsoft's Bing, DuckDuckGo and Yahoo!\nThis is a highly unusual threat. \nGoogle dominates the search engine market with a nearly 90% market share. Almost all its revenue is from ads. For Google to threaten to pull out of an entire country suggests the company is worried. \nAustralia is nowhere near its biggest market. But Google execs are fearful about the precedent these new laws could set. \nGoogle has had a very profitable pandemic so far, while many local newspapers have struggled. That doesn't look good - Australian politicians aren't the first, and won't be the last, to point that out. \nGoogle says it wants to help fund original, local journalism. \nBut clearly it believes that what is being proposed in Australia could fundamentally hurt its business model if replicated elsewhere. \nMs Silva said the laws would set \"an untenable precedent for our businesses and the digital economy\" if Google had to pay for link and search results.\nThis was not compatible with the free-flowing share of information online or \"how the internet works\", she argued.\n\"We do not see a way, with the financial and operational risks, that we could continue to offer a service in Australia,\" she said.\nLast week, Google confirmed it was blocking Australian news sites from its search results for about 1% of local users. It said it was an experiment to test the value of Australian news services.\nFacebook last year also threatened to stop Australian users from sharing news stories on the platform if the law went ahead.\nThe social media giant repeated that position on Friday, with executive Simon Milner telling the Senate hearing it was \"a potential worse-case consequence\".\nHe said Facebook derived almost no commercial benefit from having news content on its platform.\nBoth firms have argued that news organisations already get the benefit of platforms driving readers to their websites. Google has also cited its Google News partnership as evidence it supports journalism.\nBy Katie Silver, business reporter\nAustralia's news industry is struggling. Of every A$100 (\u00a356; $77) spent on digital advertising, A$81 goes to Google and Facebook. And Covid-19 has only made this worse. \nWith companies reducing their digital advertising spend, a number of outlets in Australia have been forced to close.\nGoogle, by contrast, has been performing well. Last year the social media giant made almost $4bn from Australia, while paying $45m in tax. \nMeanwhile, Australia's competition watchdog has accused both Facebook and Google of misleading Australian consumers about how their data is used, launching inquiries into digital advertising and the app stores market.\nAustralians have expressed confusion and anger online at both sides. Some have debated whether they could get by using other search engines.\nOthers have questioned if the removal of the search engine would also remove Gmail, Google Maps and Google Home services - something the company has not made clear.\nEarlier this week, US trade representatives urged Australia to drop the laws which they said attempted regulation \"to the clear detriment of two US firms\".\nSir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, said Australia's plan would make the web \"unworkable around the world\"."

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

      "tags": "Companies,Sunderland,Nissan,European Union,Brexit,Car industry",
      "text": "Japanese car maker Nissan has told the BBC its Sunderland plant is secure for the long term as a result of the trade deal reached between the UK and the EU.\nIt said it will move additional battery production close to the plant where it has 6,000 direct employees and supports nearly 70,000 jobs in the supply chain.\nCurrently, the batteries in its Leaf electric cars are imported from Japan. \nNissan would not confirm if this would mean additional jobs at Sunderland, which is the UK's largest car plant.\nManufacturing the more powerful batteries in the UK will ensure its cars comply with trade rules agreed with the EU requiring at least 55% of the car's value to be derived from either the UK or the EU to qualify for zero tariffs when exported to the EU. \nSome 70% of the cars made in Sunderland are exported and the vast majority of them are sold in the EU.  \nNissan had issued stark warnings last year that if the UK left the EU without a trade deal, the resulting tariffs on cars and components would make the Sunderland plant \"unsustainable\". \nNissan's chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta told the BBC: \"The Brexit deal is positive for Nissan. Being the largest automaker in the UK we are taking this opportunity to redefine auto-making in the UK. \n\"It has created a competitive environment for Sunderland, not just inside the UK but outside as well. \n\"We've decided to localise the manufacture of the 62kWh battery in Sunderland so that all our products qualify [for tariff-free export to the EU]. We are committed to Sunderland for the long term under the business conditions that have been agreed.\"\nIt came as Nissan paused one of its two production lines in Sunderland on Friday as disruption at ports caused by the pandemic affected its supply chain.\nThe company said the move would affect the line which produces the Qashqai and Leaf, but work would resume next week.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng welcomed the firm's endorsement of Sunderland as a manufacturing base.\n\"Nissan's decision represents a genuine belief in Britain and a huge vote of confidence in our economy thanks to the certainty our trade deal with the EU delivers,\" he said.\n\"For the dedicated and highly-skilled workforce in Sunderland, it means the city will be home to Nissan's latest models for years to come and positions the company to capitalise on the wealth of benefits that will flow from electric vehicle production.\"\nIt's particularly welcome after the more guarded comments from the boss of Vauxhall's parent company last week. \nSpeaking as the tie-up between Fiat Chrsyler and Peugeot Citroen was christened with new umbrella name Stellantis, boss Carlos Tavares said that the future of its Ellesmere Port plant depended on the support the UK government was prepared to offer after its decision to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars after 2030. \n\"If you change, brutally, the rules and if you restrict the rules for business then there is at one point in time a problem,\" he said. \nLooking forward, he said it would make more sense to locate an electric vehicle factory closer to the larger EU market. \nIndustry voices welcomed the news from Nissan but reinforced the message from Vauxhall's owners that the government needs to do more to secure the future of the car industry as it electrifies.  \n\"This is obviously good news and will help the Nissan Leaf avoid any future tariffs, but we are going to need to see a lot more investment in battery production in the UK if we are to preserve the UK as a car manufacturer and exporter,\" said Professor David Bailey of Warwick University.\nThe head of trade body the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders agreed. \n\"The battery plant in Sunderland may be enough for Nissan's near-term plans to build tens of thousands of electric cars but the UK made 1.5 million cars last year and all will be partly electric by 2030,\" Mike Hawes said.\nAndy Palmer, former boss of Aston Martin and current chairman of electric bus maker Switch Mobility, has gone further. He says that 800,000 jobs are at risk if the UK government doesn't act now to foster battery investment. \n\"Without electric vehicle batteries made in the UK, the country's auto industry risks becoming an antiquated relic and overtaken by China, Japan, America and Europe.\"\nHe urged the UK government to use every lever at its disposal to make the UK attractive. \nUK car investment has fallen sharply since the UK voted to leave the EU. \nIn the five years to 2016 it averaged \u00a33.5bn per year. In the four years since it has averaged around \u00a31bn - a fall of 71% at a time when the technology and map of car production are going through their biggest revolution since the car was invented. \nThe Nissan decision is therefore a very welcome boost to the UK which is in an international scramble for the investment of the future which is happening right now.

      "text": "The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September.\nThe government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of \u00a32,500.\nAt first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%.\nThe most recent figures show 1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July - the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier.\nNearly one million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation.\nThe numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough.\nSome employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends.\nInternational travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs.\nMany forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. \nIf you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. \nThe selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay.\nIf you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: \nYou might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. \nThe amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. \nYou may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs. \nThere is lots of free benefits guidance and advice available, including: \nThe government says 11.6 million jobs have been supported by the scheme.\nFrom March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about \u00a366bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. \nThat's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid.\nHowever, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs. \nAt the start of the pandemic it was feared that more than one in 10 workers would become unemployed.\nInstead the unemployment rate is currently less than one in 20.

      "tags": "NI Health,Robin Swann,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It would be unrealistic to expect all lockdown restrictions in Northern Ireland to be lifted on 5 March, Health Minister Robin Swann has said.\nOn Thursday, the executive announced that the current restrictions, which have been in place since 26 December, would be extended to 5 March.\nBut ministers were also told restrictions may have to remain in place until after the Easter holidays.\nMr Swann said the decision to extend restrictions had not been easy.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, he said: \"Can I say that'll we'll have to extend them at that point [5 March]? At this time, no I can't.\n\"But it would, I think, be unrealistic to think that we'd be able to lift every restriction come that date because we do see where this virus is going, the trajectory it's taking, the large number of positive cases that we are managing but also the large number of hospital admissions that we currently have.\n\"There has to be a consideration and planning put into place - we know Covid's going to be with us for a very long time, we also know it will take time for our vaccination process to kick in and have that major effect.\"\nA lockdown closing non-essential retailers and encouraging employees to work from home began after Christmas.\nFamily gatherings are prohibited and people have been ordered to stay at home for all but essential reasons.\nSchools are closed to most pupils until after February's half-term break but a paper looking at reopening will be put to ministers at next week's executive meeting.\nThe Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church and the Methodist Church have all confirmed that in-person worship will continue to be suspended until 5 March in accordance with the executive's decision on the restrictions.\nThe churches say there are exceptions for weddings and funerals and private prayer.\nTwelve more Covid-19 related deaths were recorded in Northern Ireland on Friday, taking the overall death toll recorded by the Department of Health to 1,704.\nIt is a story that changes not only by the day but by the hour and is dictated by numbers. \nNever before have we scrutinised hospital figures so closely, especially this week. \nAnd the numbers are important as we know how many intensive care unit (ICU) beds are available across Northern Ireland and potentially how many will be required in the next 24 hours. \nOn Wednesday, 33 ICU beds were available - on Friday that dropped to 18.\nBut as we enter a difficult 72 hours, there is a feeling that the health system will cope. \nA regional approach to the crisis means no hospital is left to shoulder responsibility on its own.\nEvery afternoon a call is made about whether an additional \"pod\" - a bay of beds - is required to be opened at the Nightingale facility at Belfast City Hospital. \nIf not, it is felt that hospitals can hold their own for another 24 hours.\nCoping is good but comes at a terrible cost - keeping a lid on Covid-19 is only possible because so much else within hospitals has been cancelled.\nA heavy price has been paid and will continue to be paid for months, possibly years to come.\nOn Wednesday it was announced more than 100 medically-trained military personnel would be deployed  in Northern Ireland to help hospital staff deal with Covid-19 pressures after a request by Mr Swann.\nSpeaking at Stormont's Health Committee on Thursday, Sinn F\u00e9in MLA Pat Sheehan said: \"My only concern is that they [military personnel] don't get in the way of the real professionals who are doing the work to save lives.\n\"This is slamming the dead cat down on the table to deflect attention away from the inadequacies in the health department at the minute.\"\nOn Friday, Mr Swann responded by saying he was \"disappointed and disgusted\" by Mr Sheehan's comments.\nHe added: \"The majority of our health service workers are actually welcoming them because this is a tough period of time that we are entering into in the health service.\n\"To hear some of the comments where he's actually, I think, criticising the level of delivery that our health service has given over these past 10-12 months, I think is disappointing.\"\n\"It wouldn't be the language that would be reflective of his party leadership in regards to the assistance that we're receiving from the Army.\"\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, the Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president, had previously said her party's priority had \"always been to save lives\" and she would \"never rule out anything that actually supports the health service\".\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, said on critics of the move to deploy military medics were putting \"political intolerance before patients\".\nMr Swann also said the executive would \"not be found wanting\" in enforcing Covid-19 regulations.\nIt came after a district judge said on Wednesday that \"the powers-that-be made a significant error\" in making breaches of some rules punishable only with fines.\nDistrict Judge Michael Ranaghan told Dungannon Magistrates' Court he would have remanded two defendants from Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, in custody if he had \"the power to do so\".\nShania Devenney, 21, of Kilmacormick Drive, and Nathan Maguire, 20, of Carnmore Lodge, were charged with contravening the regulations when arrested by police who were alerted to anti-social behaviour.\nA police officer told the court there had been repeated parties at Ms Devenney's address this month.\nThe judge, granting bail, said: \"I cannot consider remanding in custody as these matters are fine-only.\n\"The powers-that-be made a significant error when drafting legislation in making these fine-only offences.\n\"Had I the power to do so I would definitely be remanding these two in custody.\"\nThe health minister said the executive had asked people \"to work with us\" and had increased the level of fines.\nAsked about the judge's comments about enforcement, Mr Swann said he was \"content enough to raise it with executive colleagues and ask the justice minister to have a look at that\".\nMr Swann added that the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland were abiding by the regulations as it is the \"right thing to do\".\nOn Tuesday, police revealed that 2,159 penalty notices had been issued during the pandemic, with fines starting at \u00a3200.\nThere have been 55 failure-to-isolate fines, which incur a \u00a31,000 fine."

      "tags": "Kamala Harris,US election 2020,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Kamala Harris has made history, becoming the first woman and first black and South Asian American to serve as US vice-president. \nSo what does the job involve? And what did Ms Harris do first?\nHistorically speaking, not a lot. It has been described as the least understood, most ridiculed and most often ignored constitutional role in the federal government, and for a long time it stayed that way.\n\"The role of the vice-president was, frankly, to just be that heartbeat away from the president,\" said Barbara Perry, the director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Centre. Unless the president died, or was seriously ill, the vice-president's job was largely to sit around and wait. \nFor some vice-presidents, the dynamic meant holding a job you hoped would never be needed. \"One of the vice-presidents in the early 20th Century said, 'Every day I ring the doorbell at the White House and hope the president will answer,'\" Ms Perry said. \nThat's not a role to take lightly. Nine of the country's 45 presidents has left office before the end of their term, eight by death - about one fifth of all presidents - giving their vice-presidents a sudden promotion. At 78 years old, Mr Biden is the oldest president to assume the office, putting added stress on his next-in-line. \nIt wasn't until the 1970s, under President Jimmy Carter, that the vice-president began to assume a bigger role. \nMr Carter, a former Georgia governor, had built his candidacy around being a political outsider. \"He knew he didn't know Washington,\" Ms Perry said. So when he won the nomination, he called on Walter Mondale, a long-time US senator, to show him the ropes and be a \"true governing partner\". \nWhile their close relationship was new, their strategic match followed a well-worn pattern of vice-presidents offering geographical or ideological balance to the president. \nThe practice has continued on most recent political tickets. Barack Obama, then a relative political newcomer, tapped Joe Biden, a 35-year veteran of the US Senate. Donald Trump went with Mike Pence, whose evangelical bona fides were thought to smooth over Mr Trump's image for the religious right. And Ms Harris offers a counter to Joe Biden's age, gender and race.\nWhat's more, this time the ceremonial role held by the vice-president as president of the Senate will prove crucial for Ms Harris' party. There is currently a 50-50 seat split between Democrats and Republicans in the upper chamber, and Ms Harris will cast the deciding ballot in any tie. \nAs she walked along Pennsylvania Avenue with her family in the inauguration parade, Vice-President Harris knew her ceremonial tasks were over.\n\"I'm just walking to work,\" she said.\nMoments later she was entering the White House, her new workplace, to join her new boss in tackling some pretty daunting challenges.\nShe has reportedly been in all the key meetings during the transition, helping to shape the Biden agenda, so would have had major input on the 15 executive orders he signed on Wednesday.\nIt wasn't long after arriving at the White House that she was off to the Senate, over which she now presides in her new job.\nThere she swore in three new senators, and gave a chuckle as she read out her own resignation.\nShe has not yet moved into the vice-presidential residence, so spent the night in her current address.\nOn Thursday morning she watched the virtual inaugural prayer service and received a daily intelligence briefing. \nMs Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff will set up home in a different white house - a 19th Century mansion on the grounds of the US Naval Observatory in north-west Washington. \nThe estate is close to the White House grounds, where Ms Harris will have her office, and not far from Georgetown University's law school, where Mr Emhoff, an attorney, is set to teach. \nTo get around, Ms Harris and Mr Emhoff will also have access to Air Force Two, a Boeing 757, and they will have round-the-clock security. \nWhile Mr Biden and Mr Obama often put their bromance on display during their time in the White House, close personal relationships between presidents and vice-presidents have not been the norm, Ms Perry said.\nBut since Mr Biden officially brought on Ms Harris this summer, it has seemed to be smooth sailing, Ms Perry said. \nMr Biden has said \"there's not a single decision I've made yet\" about his administration that he hasn't consulted with Ms Harris on first. She has also interviewed each of Biden's potential cabinet nominees.\nA friendly relationship makes sense between the two, considering it was Ms Harris' close relationship with Mr Biden's son, Beau - who died of brain cancer in 2015 - that reportedly sealed the deal for Mr Biden. \nIt's a surprise to some who remember Ms Harris' sharp debate-stage attacks aimed directly at Mr Biden when they were both competing for the Democratic nomination. \"Biden clearly lets bygones be bygones,\" Ms Perry said. \nMr Biden is likely to model Ms Harris' role after his own time as vice-president. \nWhen he introduced her as his running mate at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, he recalled the time he was chosen for the same job by Barack Obama in 2008. \nMr Obama asked what Mr Biden wanted from the role. \n\"I told him I wanted to be the last person in the room before he made important decisions,\" Mr Biden said. \"That's what I asked Kamala. I asked Kamala to be the last voice in the room. To always tell me the truth.\" \nMs Harris joined Mr Biden's team as a political star in her own right. Though her own presidential bid failed to find its focus and sputtered to an early halt, it earned her a devoted fan following (they call themselves the #KHive).\nAnd despite continued criticism from the left wing of her party, Ms Harris had one of the most liberal voting records in the US Senate, pursuing progressive causes like gay rights, immigration, legalisation of marijuana and gun control. She also has an extensive legal r\u00e9sum\u00e9, having served as California's top lawyer before her Senate bid. \nHer legal experience and advocacy for police reform will be useful in a White House that has promised to address \"systemic\" misconduct in US police forces. This summer, amid a wave of Black Lives Matters protests, Ms Harris was a vocal supporter of the demonstrations and called for a \"reimagining\" of US policing.\nBut as a vice-presidential \"first\" three times over, she will enter office shouldering heavy expectations. \"While I may be the first woman in this office,\" Ms Harris is fond of saying, \"I will not be the last.\" \nThe historic moment for black Americans is worth celebrating, said Jennifer Edwards, senior director at racial justice organisation Color of Change. \"But we learned time and time again that representation alone doesn't lead to transformative change.\"  \n\"Hundreds of thousands of black women have fought, organised and voted to reach this moment. Now, Vice-President Kamala Harris has a responsibility to represent demands of the people who ushered her into office,\" she said.  \nMs Edwards said she will be looking for progress in Covid-19 economic relief, on criminal justice and voting and election reform. \nAs the more left-wing half of the political partnership, Ms Harris may face blame for perceived shortfalls here, and elsewhere in their progressive agenda. \nAnd reports that Mr Biden will not seek re-election will mean a balancing act for Ms Harris - how to remain a loyal aide to Mr Biden while also plotting her own run. \nFirstly, it's crucial that the American public see the vice-president as competent, and able to take the reins as commander-in-chief at any moment.\nThis has not always been the case. President George Bush's deputy, Dan Quayle, for example, was \"not viewed as the brightest bulb in the drawer,\" Ms Perry said.\nThe impression was cemented during a visit to an elementary school. A student was called upon to write a word, 'potato', on the chalkboard. \"The student wrote 'potato' as it was correctly spelled,'\" Ms Perry said. But Vice-President Quayle chipped in, saying the word needed an E at the end. \nA vice-president should also avoid getting on their boss's bad side. \nSoon after his 1828 election, President Andrew Jackson developed a deep dislike of Vice-President John Calhoun. The two differed on policy and on Washington's social scene. The antipathy between the two grew so intense that Mr Calhoun became the first vice-president in US history to resign. \nStill, the title for worst vice-presidential mistake probably rests with the country's third, Aaron Burr. While in office, Mr Burr shot and killed his rival, American founding father Alexander Hamilton, in a duel. But while it ruined his reputation, Mr Burr still completed his term, sheltered from prosecution. "

      "text": "The Fire Brigades Union has held back firefighters from efforts to tackle the pandemic in England with \"unreasonable\" safety demands, a report claims.\nIn it, the fire service watchdog says the union has insisted on \"unworkable\" rules for testing and self-isolation.  \nThousands of firefighters assisted health and emergency services last year but in December, as vaccinations began, the FBU asked members not to volunteer.\nThe union says it cannot be sure its members will be safe if they do.\nThat is because councils and fire chiefs have pulled out of an agreement on health protection measures, it added.\nFor most of last year the agreement allowed firefighters to perform a range of additional duties, including delivering meals, driving ambulances and transporting bodies. \nFirefighters returning from roles in potential contact with Covid victims would spend several days self-isolating and being tested to show they were not infected.   \nBy December, when there was the prospect of firefighters helping with vaccinations, a row over the deal resulted in the union giving new advice to members\nThe FBU said in message on 9 December: \"At this time, members are asked not to volunteer and to suspend any expression of interest that they have registered until such time as satisfactory arrangements can be secured that allow a national agreement to be reached.\"\nOn 13 January, local councils, which employ firefighters, decided the agreement with the union \"was no longer sustainable or appropriate\", partly because of the requirements for staff to have tests and self-isolate.  \nThey said these made it impossible to run the fire service flexibly. Fire chiefs argued that police officers and paramedics did not have to isolate and await test results. \nThe FBU general secretary, Matt Wrack, told the BBC he still was not able to advise firefighters about additional Covid-related duties because the union did not know what the safety risks would be locally. \n\"I'm not prepared to ask people to volunteer if there aren't safety measures in place,\" he said. \"I don't want to see a deadly virus brought into workplaces when we have measures in place which have avoided it in the past several months.\"\nThe fire minister, Lord Stephen Greenhalgh, said: \"Brave firefighters have been prevented from stepping up to support the pandemic response because of the actions of the Fire Brigades Union.\" \nZoe Billingham, an inspector at Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Fire and Rescue Services, said many firefighters had contributed to the effort during the Covid crisis, but much more could have been done. \nShe described the union's position as \"deeply regrettable\" and \"not what the public would expect of a fire service\".\nThe inspectorate has released several reports calling for the modernisation of fire service working practices and criticising the FBU.  \nAccording to this one, the dispute between firefighters and their employers has held up vital work to protect lives.\nIn Greater Manchester requests to the fire service to help with NHS Track and Trace were delayed by 12 weeks. \nIn Cleveland, the fire and rescue service had to use non-operational support staff, rather than firefighters, to carry out temperature testing for the local authority.\nIn Suffolk and South Yorkshire, there were delays to plans for firefighters to help get into properties where residents were suffering from Covid. \nThe FBU says it was not given an opportunity to respond to these claims before the report was published. Mr Wrack dismissed it as poorly-sourced and politically-motivated.\nSome fire services have reached agreements with local branches of the union instead so that they can volunteer for the vaccination effort. \nLancashire Fire and Rescue Service said it had begun testing its staff twice a week and those giving vaccinations had also received them first.

      "tags": "Film,Daniel Craig,Cinemas,James Bond,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The release of the next James Bond film has been delayed for a third time because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nNo Time To Die had already been pushed back twice, and will now debut globally on 8 October, an announcement on the film's website said.\nIt had originally been due to hit screens in April 2020.\nThe film is the 25th instalment in the Bond franchise, and marks Daniel Craig's final appearance as British secret service agent 007.\nIt also features Lea Seydoux and Rami Malek.\nThe delay will come as a further blow to cinemas that have been forced to shut for months at a time because of lockdowns. \nEarlier this week, leading film-makers including Danny Boyle and Sir Steve McQueen wrote to the UK Government, calling for financial support for cinema chains because \"UK cinema stands on the edge of an abyss\".\nCineworld said in October, when No Time To Die was pushed back for the second time, that delays to big budget releases meant the industry was \"unviable\".\nBond's latest move sparked a flurry of other delays to major releases. Sony has pushed back Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Peter Rabbit 2, Jared Leto's Morbius, Tom Holland's Uncharted and Cinderella, which will star singer Camila Cabello; while Universal has moved Tom Hanks' Bios from April to November.\nThe UK Cinema Association said the decision to postpone No Time To Die again, \"while clearly disappointing, is at the same time not surprising given the current situation around Covid-19 in the UK as well as the US and other major film territories\".\nThe postponement of Daniel Craig's swansong and other films \"underlines the need for ongoing support for the UK cinema sector\", the trade body's chief executive Phil Clapp said.\nThe association is calling on the government to provide \"direct funding\" to chains, which represent 80% of ticket sales.\nOne of the major chains, Vue, said the delay was \"understandable\", and that the continuing attempts to release the film in cinemas \"is further testament to our shared belief in a bright future for the big screen\".\nHowever, the latest postponement could stoke speculation that the film may ultimately skip cinemas and be released on a streaming platform.\nMajor Disney titles like Pixar's Soul and its live-action remake of Mulan bypassed cinemas, premiering instead on the Disney+ streaming service.\nWonder Woman 1984, meanwhile, was made available in the US on the HBO Max streaming service on the same day it received a limited cinema release.\nLast year, Warner Bros announced its 2021 titles - including sci-fi epic Dune and The Matrix 4 - would all adopt a similar dual release pattern, escalating tensions between Hollywood and US movie theatres.\nThe Dig, a new historical drama starring Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan, was due to be released in selected UK cinemas this month. Now, the film will only be available on Netflix from 29 January.\nAsked whether No Time To Die might go down the same route, Fiennes - who will reprise his role as M in the film - recently told BBC News: \"That's a good question and I'm not really in a position to answer it.\n\"I would love the idea that people could go to the cinema and have the full effect of the big-screen energy behind the Bond, but I'm sure it's something the people who make these executive decisions are probably considering.\n\"I really hope we come through this so people can go to the cinema. Maybe they just have to hold their nerve. But of course we don't know, and there may be financial reasons or imperatives that [mean] they have to put it on a streaming system.\"\nIf No Time To Die is indeed released in cinemas in October, it will arrive a full six years on from the release of its 2015 predecessor Spectre.\nThat won't be far behind the six years and four months that separated the release of Licence to Kill in summer 1989 and GoldenEye in late 1995 - the biggest gap between two Bond films.\nThe last Bond film, 2015's Spectre, took almost $900m (\u00a3690m) at worldwide box offices.\nOther blockbusters to have been delayed by the pandemic include action sequel Top Gun: Maverick and Marvel's Black Widow.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nMinisters wrestling with how to ensure people with coronavirus obey laws to self-isolate are to consider paying \u00a3500 to anyone who tests positive. It's among options drawn up for England by the Department of Health to encourage people to stay at home, amid fears the current support leaves some unable to afford the time away from work. However, Treasury sources say funding a universal payment to the tune of \u00a3453m a week is unlikely.\nBritish retail sales saw their largest annual fall in history last year as the impact of coronavirus took its toll. Sales fell by 1.9% in 2020, when compared with 2019, official figures show. Clothes shops were hit hard, with a record annual fall of more than 25%. Meanwhile, UK government borrowing hit \u00a334.1bn last month, the highest December figure on record, as the cost of pandemic support weighed on the economy, the Office for National Statistics says.\nA Crown Office unit set up to probe Covid-related deaths is investigating cases at 474 care homes in Scotland, ahead of prosecutors' decisions on whether they should be the subject of a fatal accident inquiry or prosecution. Care homes say the investigation is \"disproportionate\". But Linda Duncan, whose 91-year-old mother Anne died last April, argues: \"A lot of the focus has been on the government response but we need this investigation to look at the private operators.\"\nHalf of all staff at nurseries, pre-schools and childminders \"don't... feel safe at work\", with about one in every 10 having tested positive since 1 December, according to an Early Years Alliance survey of more than 3,000 staff. Providers in England have been told to remain open to all children during lockdown and the government says under-fives are \"unlikely to be playing a driving role in transmission\". \nAs lockdown has forced families apart, grandparents have had to find new ways of keeping in touch with their grandchildren.

      "text": "\"Wholesale\" return of pupils to school after February half term is \"unlikely\", Wales' first minister has said. \nMark Drakeford said there were \"intermediate positions between where we are today, with very few children in school, and everybody being back\".\nPreviously, ministers said schools would stay closed to most until February half term unless Covid cases fell significantly. \nThose preparing for qualifications and very young children may return first.\nMr Drakeford told a coronavirus briefing on Friday he had recently chaired a meeting of the teaching unions and local education authorities.\n\"We all agreed that we would work purposefully together to find ways of bringing more young people back into the classroom,\" he said.\n\"Does that mean that we will see a wholesale return of every child in every classroom, every day of the week across Wales? I do think that that is probably unlikely.\n\"But there are intermediate positions between where we are today, with very few children in school, and everybody being back.\"\nHe said there had been \"practical, creative, imaginative\" proposals put forward which could mean some children being back in the classroom for some of the week.\nThese could include \"children preparing for qualifications [and] very young children for whom online learning really isn't a genuine possibility\".\n\"I certainly don't rule out making some of those things happen after the February half term, but I do think it's unlikely in the way you said that we would see every child back full-time in every classroom in the way that we would ideally wish to do,\" he added.\nAll schools and colleges moved to online learning before Christmas, following concerns from unions over the new coronavirus variant.\nThey have remained open for children of critical workers and vulnerable learners, as well as for learners who needed to complete essential exams or assessments.\nEarlier this month, when Education Minister Kirsty Williams said schools and colleges would stay closed to most pupils until the February half term, unions welcomed the news, saying the health and safety of pupils and staff \"had to be a priority\".\nBut, they added, teachers must now be given the vaccine as a priority, and pupils and staff must be protected before talks about reopening schools could begin.\nTeachers are still not on the priority list for immunisation, and have to wait to get the jab dependent on their age and if they have a medical condition.\nAt the time, Laura Doel, director of The National Association of Headteachers Cymru, said: \"Any plan that sees school staff return to face-to-face learning should be afforded as much protection as possible against the virus.\n\"Once these issues have been addressed, then we can discuss the orderly return to school we all want.\"\nOpposition parties have called for clear plans on how schools would return and for support to make sure pupils from poorer backgrounds did not fall behind due to a \"digital divide\".\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said: \"The Welsh Government must plan now for the gradual and safe reopening of schools, putting in place safety measures, and should lay out plans for a vaccination programme for schools staff.\"\nWelsh Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies called for the Welsh Government to publish evidence on its reasons for closing schools, bring forward vaccines for teachers, and said money must be made available for all pupils to access laptops for online learning."

      "tags": "Glastonbury,Glastonbury Festival,Live music,Music festivals,Music",
      "text": "Music festivals are \"still possible\" this summer, despite the cancellation of Glastonbury, says the head of the Association of Independent Festivals.\nPaul Reed said Glastonbury \"is a different beast to most festivals and most likely ran out of time due to the size and complexity of the event\".\nSmaller events could still happen if the government ensures organisers can access cancellation insurance, he said.\n\"For most festivals, the cut-off point is more likely the end of March.\"\nOn Thursday, Glastonbury organisers Michael and Emily Eavis called off their festival for the second year in a row because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"In spite of our efforts to move Heaven & Earth, it has become clear that we simply will not be able to make the festival happen,\" they said in a joint statement. \"We are so sorry to let you all down.\"\nTickets for the festival, which normally attracts 200,000 people and was due to take place in June, will roll over to 2022.\nGlastonbury is the UK's biggest music festival, but it was not the only event to cancel its plans on Thursday. The Country To Country festival, which was due to take place in March, also said its 2021 edition would not happen.\nThe three-day event, which attracts some of country music's biggest names to indoor venues in London, Dublin and Glasgow, said it had pulled the plug due to the \"current restrictions on mass gatherings and international travel\".\nThe announcements came as coronavirus deaths soared in England, with more than 8,500 deaths recorded in the past week. On Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was \"too early\" to say whether England's Covid restrictions would be lifted by the spring.\nGlastonbury's cancellation has raised fears for other music festivals this summer. However, the organisers of Glasgow's TRNSMT said there was \"reason to be optimistic\" that it could go ahead in July, with headliners Lewis Capaldi, Liam Gallagher and the Courteeners.\n\"Glastonbury is the biggest festival in the world and it's sad to see that, due to its enormous scale and taking several months to get the city-sized festival site ready, it's unable to go ahead this year,\" boss Geoff Ellis told Scotland's Daily Record.\n\"By comparison, TRNSMT is a much smaller city centre event with no camping. As such it takes us days rather than months to build TRNSMT. Therefore, we will continue to listen to and follow the advice from the government and remain positive about events later in the summer.\"\nHis comments were echoed by Bestival co-founder Rob Da Bank, who tweeted that \"festival season will happen in the UK this summer\", adding: \"Sadly Glasto is such a mammoth beast to plan it ran outta time.\"\nSacha Lord, co-founder of Manchester's Parklife festival, added that Glastonbury's cancellation was \"yet another blow\" to freelancers who work in the live music sector.\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast on Friday, Mr Reed said the UK was at a \"serious point in the pandemic and festivals only want to return when it is safe to do so\".\nHe added that festivals were currently struggling to get insurance for coronavirus-related cancellations. Last week, MPs from the House of Commons culture select committee wrote to the chancellor, urging him to launch a Covid-19 insurance scheme to protect live music.\nThe appeal was backed by more than 100 industry figures, including organisers of the TRNSMT and Parklife festivals. \"We do need government to intervene in this issue,\" said Mr Reed.\nIn a tweet on Thursday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden expressed his regret at Glastonbury's cancellation and said the government was \"looking at problems around getting insurance\".\nA government spokeswoman said on Friday they are in \"regular dialogue\" with public health experts to \"agree a realistic return date for festivals and other large events\". They added they were still helping festivals with the \u00a31.5bn Culture Recovery Fund, \"with many already receiving this support\".\nOther European countries, including Austria and Germany, have launched schemes to cover events that cannot be rescheduled, including music festivals. At present, England has a scheme protecting film and TV shoots, but not music.\nHowever, some festivals have been given support by the government's \u00a31.57bn Culture Recovery Fund, including Womad, End of the Road and Nozstock.\nMelvin Benn, whose company Festival Republic organises the Latitude, Download and the Reading & Leeds festivals, said that without an insurance scheme, other events would be left \"staring into the same barrel that Glastonbury stared into\".\n\"People can't afford to take that financial risk,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nThe government is holding \"early stage talks\" with insurers, confirmed Tim Thornhill of Tyser's Insurance, which counts Glastonbury amongst its clients.\n\"We have helped to put in place the film and TV restart scheme, which the chancellor explained saved 14,000 jobs,\" he said. \"So if we can do something for events, that would be welcome across the industry\".\nWhile there is \"no guarantee\" that insurance could be provided, he said there was \"significant urgency\" to finding a solution \"within the next few months\".\n\"It's really important that the government supports the industry,\" added Radiohead's Colin Greenwood. \"And they need to start thinking about that now, and not when we reach that point - say in October this year - when there are enough people vaccinated for [live music] to become safe.\n\"Nobody wants to go to anything, or take part in anything, that's going to turn into a super-spreader event,\" he said. \n\"But obviously there has to be a way out of this, through vaccination. And I think we need to make sure that systems are in place so we can get back into doing what we love.\"\nJulian Knight MP, chair of the culture select committee, said the government was working on insurance plans, because of the importance of festivals to British culture and the economy.\n\"I've been in to see the chancellor,\" he told BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat. \"Finally I think there is some movement. I understand that they are dropping some of the objections that they may have had, and that we may end up with an insurance scheme.\n\"However, there's a danger that it's too little too late.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "\"We were paying \u00a31,600 per container in November, this month we've been quoted over \u00a310,000,\" says Helen White. \nThe founder of start-up Houseof.com, which imports lighting from China, says the rise in shipping costs means she's making a loss on what she sells.\nShe's one of many UK importers facing soaring freight costs amid a global shipping crisis that may last months.\nA shortage of empty shipping containers in Asia and bottlenecks at the UK's deep sea ports are behind the problems.\nIt was hoped the backlogs could be cleared during the Chinese New Year holiday in February, but instead a coronavirus outbreak in China is adding to the uncertainty facing firms. \nIn the UK the difficulties in international shipping have coincided with problems faced by businesses trading with the EU after Brexit.\nOne Manchester-based freight forwarder said the logistics industry is facing the most challenging conditions he's seen in the 17 years he's been in the business.\nCraig Poole from Cardinal Maritime said during lockdowns, people have been turning to online shopping, and that's causing a surge in demand for goods from China. \nBut some companies can't absorb the skyrocketing freight costs that shipping lines are charging. That could lead to higher prices for consumers or businesses having to close. \n\"The really unfortunate thing is, the small businesses who can't afford to pay those rates are going to go under as a result,\" Mr Poole said.\nHelen White's lighting range is designed in the UK and manufactured in Guangzhou, China. \nShe said the six-fold increase in shipping costs is hard to take, especially when getting hold of a container \"is like gold dust\".\n\"It's really hard for a small business to absorb those costs. We'll be making a loss on the goods we're selling.\"\nAt the other end of the supply chain, Chinese manufacturers and logistics firms say they are equally frustrated.\nJohnny Tseng is the owner and director of Hong Kong-based J&B Clothing Company Ltd., which manufactures garments for some of the UK's most popular fashion sites including Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing.\nHe's been supplying clothes to British retailers for more than 40 years, but he says his family-run firm won't be able to absorb inflated shipping rates for much longer. \n\"To be honest I don't even know how we can survive if we carry on shipping things at this kind of cost.\"\nHe says he's now being quoted $14,000 to ship a container to the UK, when the usual price is $2,500. \nThe shortage of empty containers in China and congestion at UK ports caused some of his stock to miss the busy Christmas trading period. Now some customers are holding orders for their Autumn-Winter collections until next year. \n\"It's chaos,\" he said. \"We are making a loss. We take it as a loss leader and keep our fingers crossed it will go back to normal after Chinese New Year, but it is a major issue if it persists this way.\"\nUsually during the Chinese New Year holiday, factories in China shut down for two weeks.  There were hopes the pause in production would give UK ports a chance to clear the backlog of ships waiting to dock, and encourage shipping lines to move more empty containers back to Asia, which is a less profitable journey.\nBut rising numbers of coronavirus cases have prompted the Chinese authorities to stagger factory closing dates so that not all workers are travelling to their home regions at the same time. A worsening outbreak could lead to travel restrictions, in which case some factories may not stop production at all.\nCraig Poole says some companies have been caught out by factories closing earlier than planned.\n\"A lot of businesses that can't get those goods away are delaying orders until after Chinese New Year, so this situation could continue 'til March,\" he said.\nPatrick Lee from the Hong Kong-based Unique Logistics International said it could be even longer than that.\n\"Middle of the year at the earliest is what we're hearing from end customers in the UK, and also from some of our people in the industry. Some of the carriers as well,\" he said.\nMr Lee has called on the shipping lines to add more ships to help ease the backlog of stock orders building up at warehouses across China.\n\"They are increasing sailing but can increase a lot more. There are idle ships out there that they can reactivate without too much difficulty,\" he said. \nBut a spokeswoman for the World Shipping Council said carriers are using all available capacity.\n\"The demand for transportation service far exceeds supply. As in any free market, this puts upward pressure on rates,\" she said. \nShipping lines have been trying to drive down demand from British importers by charging a premium for deliveries to the UK, or bypassing the country's ports altogether.\nOne shipping line recently offered freight rates of $12,050 for a 40ft container from China to Southampton, but charged just $8,450 for the same container to travel from China to Rotterdam, Hamburg, or Antwerp.\nThe UK's largest container port at Felixstowe has been experiencing long delays since October. Congestion has also been a problem at the Port of Southampton, albeit to a lesser extent.\nThe bottlenecks were initially caused by a surge in imports as business activity picked up after the first wave of the pandemic. Huge shipments of PPE and the usual Christmas rush added to container volumes and ports struggled to cope. \n\"Most of the carriers just don't want UK cargo because of the issues when the vessels dock, so mainly they're favouring European ports and we are having to truck containers over,\" said freight forwarder Craig Poole.\nHe said that adds a cost of up to \u00a32,000 per container, and takes an extra seven to ten days to reach the delivery point in the UK. \nFor business-owners like Helen White, the difficulties affecting the shipping industry can't be solved quickly enough.\n\"Lots of little start-ups are really hurting,\" she said. \"It has been paired with logistical nightmares across Europe as well. It just feels like logistics is falling apart at the moment. It's hard to see where the resolution is.\""

      "tags": "NI Health,Robin Swann,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It would be unrealistic to expect all lockdown restrictions in Northern Ireland to be lifted on 5 March, Health Minister Robin Swann has said.\nOn Thursday, the executive announced that the current restrictions, which have been in place since 26 December, would be extended to 5 March.\nBut ministers were also told restrictions may have to remain in place until after the Easter holidays.\nMr Swann said the decision to extend restrictions had not been easy.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, he said: \"Can I say that'll we'll have to extend them at that point [5 March]? At this time, no I can't.\n\"But it would, I think, be unrealistic to think that we'd be able to lift every restriction come that date because we do see where this virus is going, the trajectory it's taking, the large number of positive cases that we are managing but also the large number of hospital admissions that we currently have.\n\"There has to be a consideration and planning put into place - we know Covid's going to be with us for a very long time, we also know it will take time for our vaccination process to kick in and have that major effect.\"\nA lockdown closing non-essential retailers and encouraging employees to work from home began after Christmas.\nFamily gatherings are prohibited and people have been ordered to stay at home for all but essential reasons.\nSchools are closed to most pupils until after February's half-term break but a paper looking at reopening will be put to ministers at next week's executive meeting.\nThe Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church and the Methodist Church have all confirmed that in-person worship will continue to be suspended until 5 March in accordance with the executive's decision on the restrictions.\nThe churches say there are exceptions for weddings and funerals and private prayer.\nTwelve more Covid-19 related deaths were recorded in Northern Ireland on Friday, taking the overall death toll recorded by the Department of Health to 1,704.\nIt is a story that changes not only by the day but by the hour and is dictated by numbers. \nNever before have we scrutinised hospital figures so closely, especially this week. \nAnd the numbers are important as we know how many intensive care unit (ICU) beds are available across Northern Ireland and potentially how many will be required in the next 24 hours. \nOn Wednesday, 33 ICU beds were available - on Friday that dropped to 18.\nBut as we enter a difficult 72 hours, there is a feeling that the health system will cope. \nA regional approach to the crisis means no hospital is left to shoulder responsibility on its own.\nEvery afternoon a call is made about whether an additional \"pod\" - a bay of beds - is required to be opened at the Nightingale facility at Belfast City Hospital. \nIf not, it is felt that hospitals can hold their own for another 24 hours.\nCoping is good but comes at a terrible cost - keeping a lid on Covid-19 is only possible because so much else within hospitals has been cancelled.\nA heavy price has been paid and will continue to be paid for months, possibly years to come.\nOn Wednesday it was announced more than 100 medically-trained military personnel would be deployed  in Northern Ireland to help hospital staff deal with Covid-19 pressures after a request by Mr Swann.\nSpeaking at Stormont's Health Committee on Thursday, Sinn F\u00e9in MLA Pat Sheehan said: \"My only concern is that they [military personnel] don't get in the way of the real professionals who are doing the work to save lives.\n\"This is slamming the dead cat down on the table to deflect attention away from the inadequacies in the health department at the minute.\"\nOn Friday, Mr Swann responded by saying he was \"disappointed and disgusted\" by Mr Sheehan's comments.\nHe added: \"The majority of our health service workers are actually welcoming them because this is a tough period of time that we are entering into in the health service.\n\"To hear some of the comments where he's actually, I think, criticising the level of delivery that our health service has given over these past 10-12 months, I think is disappointing.\"\n\"It wouldn't be the language that would be reflective of his party leadership in regards to the assistance that we're receiving from the Army.\"\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, the Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president, had previously said her party's priority had \"always been to save lives\" and she would \"never rule out anything that actually supports the health service\".\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, said on critics of the move to deploy military medics were putting \"political intolerance before patients\".\nMr Swann also said the executive would \"not be found wanting\" in enforcing Covid-19 regulations.\nIt came after a district judge said on Wednesday that \"the powers-that-be made a significant error\" in making breaches of some rules punishable only with fines.\nDistrict Judge Michael Ranaghan told Dungannon Magistrates' Court he would have remanded two defendants from Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, in custody if he had \"the power to do so\".\nShania Devenney, 21, of Kilmacormick Drive, and Nathan Maguire, 20, of Carnmore Lodge, were charged with contravening the regulations when arrested by police who were alerted to anti-social behaviour.\nA police officer told the court there had been repeated parties at Ms Devenney's address this month.\nThe judge, granting bail, said: \"I cannot consider remanding in custody as these matters are fine-only.\n\"The powers-that-be made a significant error when drafting legislation in making these fine-only offences.\n\"Had I the power to do so I would definitely be remanding these two in custody.\"\nThe health minister said the executive had asked people \"to work with us\" and had increased the level of fines.\nAsked about the judge's comments about enforcement, Mr Swann said he was \"content enough to raise it with executive colleagues and ask the justice minister to have a look at that\".\nMr Swann added that the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland were abiding by the regulations as it is the \"right thing to do\".\nOn Tuesday, police revealed that 2,159 penalty notices had been issued during the pandemic, with fines starting at \u00a3200.\nThere have been 55 failure-to-isolate fines, which incur a \u00a31,000 fine."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Retailing,UK economy,Shopping,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "Shoppers bought far fewer clothes last year as lockdowns meant people had less opportunity to socialise and go out. \nClothes sales slumped 25%, the biggest drop in 23 years when records began, official figures suggest.\nWhile shops have reported demand for certain clothing such as pyjamas and loungewear has risen, demand for going-out items has fallen sharply.\nAnd despite a pick-up in December, clothing sales remain lower than before the pandemic struck.\n\"With few opportunities to socialise during lockdown and many people working from home, the clothing sector has been one of the \"worst-affected by restrictions\", the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.\nGrowing numbers of High Street shops have faced financial difficulties due to the temporary store closures imposed during lockdowns.\nTopshop-owner Arcadia and competitors Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, Oasis and Warehouse have all slid into insolvency since lockdown measures were first imposed last March.\nThe inability to try clothes on in bricks-and-mortar shops, as well as restrictions on eating out meaning consumers are going out less, have all affected sales, the ONS suggested.\nAnd the slump in demand for fashion meant that British retail sales saw their largest annual fall on record in 2020.\nSales fell by 1.9% last year, when compared with 2019, the largest year-on-year fall since records began in 1997.\nRetail sales, including fuel, did see a small increase last month, growing by 0.3% when compared with November.\nIt came following the end of England's national lockdown on 2 December. Sales had slumped by 4.1% in November during a month-long shutdown.\nBut \"this was very clearly not a Merry Christmas for most of the High Street\", said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \n\"For most retailers it's the most crucial month of the year to get profit back on track but the large upswing in sales after the pain of the November lockdowns didn't materialise,\" she said.\nONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said that some sectors, however, had been \"able to buck the trend\" last year.\n\"The increased popularity of click-and-collect and people buying more items from home led to a strong year for overall internet sales, with record highs for food and household goods sales online.\"\nIn a sign of the way the pandemic has changed shopping habits, the value of online retail sales jumped by 46.1% in 2020 when compared with 2019 - the highest annual growth reported since 2008.\nOnline trade now accounts for more than one-third of all retail sales.\nRichard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, explained that the rise of online had \"polarised industry performance\".\n\"The gap widened between those retailers with the most sophisticated online propositions from those with legacy store-dependent business models,\" he said.\nOnline-only retailers such as Boohoo and Asos, for example, have reported strong sales figures in 2020. \nSupermarkets in particular have embraced the shift to digital, with online food store sales up 79.3% last year.\nThere was also better news from the John Lewis Partnership, which owns Waitrose, on Friday. It said that it would return a \u00a3300m emergency coronavirus loan to the government as trading went \"better than anticipated\" over Christmas. \nToday's figures show just how badly the clothing sector has been affected these last 12 months. \nFashion is the big retail loser from this pandemic. Who needs to splash out on the latest trends when we're working from home and not going out? And even when clothing shops are open, chances are you can't try things on. \nWith all of the Covid-19 measures in place, the fun has been sucked out of shopping. We haven't stopped spending, but most of it is going online. Boohoo and Asos have seen very strong sales growth, for instance. \nThe going's far harder for retailers with large numbers of physical stores. The pressures have already taken their toll on the likes of Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group and Debenhams. \nAnd things may well get worse on the high street before they better. Many retailers are worried about the end of the business rates holiday and of the temporary ban on eviction for non payment of rent in April. These will result in a big increase in costs when sales have yet to fully recover. \nBut Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, called for more help for non-essential shops and High Street retailers who continue to be affected by lockdown restrictions.\n\"With no end in sight for retailers closed in lockdown, many will struggle to survive under a mounting rent burden, and a return to full business rates in April,\" she said.\nShe called on government to offer \"targeted\" business rates relief to businesses worst-affected by the pandemic.\n\"Decisive action is needed to save jobs, shops and local communities, with town and city centres looking to be particularly hard hit unless the government acts now.\"\nEarlier in January, a report from the Centre for Retail Research said that 2020 was the worst for High Street job losses in more than 25 years, because of the acceleration towards online shopping.\nNearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost last year, up by almost a quarter from 2019, it said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It is \"too early\" to say whether England's Covid restrictions will be able to end in the spring, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.\nOnce the four priority groups have been vaccinated, by mid-February, \"we'll look then at how we're doing,\" he said.\nNearly two million people in the UK have had their first dose of vaccine in the past week, government figures show.\nScientist Marc Baguelin, who advises the government, has said restaurants and bars should not reopen before May. \nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson has said he \"certainly hopes\" schools in England can fully reopen before Easter, while Downing Street refused to be drawn on whether this would happen by then.\nA further 1,290 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test and there have been another 37,892 cases, according to the latest government figures. \nAnd almost five million people in the UK have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine.\nSpeaking after a study suggested infections might have increased at the start of the latest lockdown in England, Mr Johnson said it was \"absolutely crucial\" that people observed the restrictions. \nReferring to figures from the Imperial College London survey, he said they showed the new variant of the virus was \"not more deadly but it is much more contagious and the numbers are very great\". \nFigures published by Public Health England show cases - meaning people who come forward to get tested while they are infected - have fallen across England since early January.\nWith the two sets of figures pointing in different directions, it will be some time before it is known for sure how long it will take for lockdown to relieve the pressure on hospitals. \nDr Baguelin, from Imperial College, who sits on a sub-group of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said the premature opening of the hospitality sector would lead to a \"bump\" in Covid-19 cases.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme even a partial reopening would generate \"an increase in the R number\". An R number above one means the epidemic is growing.\n\"Something of this scale, if it was to happen earlier than May, would generate a bump in transmission, which is already really bad,\" he said.\n\"So you have a lot of pressure on hospitals, you will have another wave of some extent. At best you will keep on having very, very unsustainable level of pressure on the NHS.\" \nNHS England figures show one in 10 major hospital trusts had no spare adult critical care beds last week.\nThis is a debate that is going to start to dominate public discourse.\nWith the vaccination programme under way, there is huge clamour to know what will happen once the most vulnerable are vaccinated, by mid-February.\nThe problem is there are still so many unknowns.\nFirstly, it is hard to predict by how much lockdown will have reduced infection levels, considering there is a new faster-spreading variant to deal with.\nThe level of uptake will also be crucial. Surveys suggest as many as one in five may not have the vaccine - although the older, more vulnerable groups tend to be the most willing to be vaccinated.\nAnd the fact that no vaccine is 100% effective means come February there could still be significant numbers of very vulnerable people who are not protected.\nAnother factor is whether the vaccine stops transmissions - so-called sterilising vaccination.\nTrials have shown the vaccines are good at stopping symptoms developing. But that does not mean someone who has received a jab will not pass on the virus.\nIf it does not, that, of course, has implications on how many control measures have to be kept in place. It will take us at least until spring to know the answer to this.\nAt this stage, it seems hard to see much beyond the possible reopening of schools come March.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was an \"impossible question\" to ask how long the lockdown would need to last. \nUnder the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons.\nThis includes for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIn Northern Ireland, coronavirus lockdown restrictions will be extended until 5 March, BBC News understands.\nIn Scotland, lockdown has been extended until at least the middle of February, with most school pupils to continue learning from home.\nAnd in Wales health minister Vaughan Gething has said no \"significant easing\" of Wales' Covid restrictions should be expected when the current guidelines are reviewed this month.\nSir Keir added that the coronavirus vaccines were \"really good news\" but \"should not mask the fact that we have still got a very serious problem\".\nThe government is aiming to offer a vaccine to all over-70s, the extremely clinical vulnerable and health and care workers by mid-February.\nSixty-five new vaccination centres are opening in England, including a mosque in Birmingham and a cinema in Aylesbury.\nIn other developments: "

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "One of the mysteries of Covid-19 is why oxygen levels in the blood can drop to dangerously low levels without the patient noticing. \nIt is known as \"silent hypoxia\".\nAs a result, patients have been arriving in hospital in far worse health than they realised and, in some cases, too late to treat effectively. \nBut a potentially life-saving solution, in the form of a pulse oximeter, allows patients to monitor their oxygen levels at home, and costs about \u00a320. \nThey are being rolled out for high-risk Covid patients in the UK, and the doctor leading the scheme thinks everyone should consider buying one.\nA normal oxygen level in the blood is between 95% and 100%.\n\"With Covid, we were admitting patients with oxygen levels in the 70s or low-or-middle 80s,\" said Dr Matt Inada-Kim, a consultant in acute medicine at Hampshire Hospitals.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Inside Health: \"It was a really curious and scary presentation and really made us rethink what we were doing.\"  \nDr Inada-Kim became the national clinical lead of the Covid Oximetry@home project.\nA pulse oximeter slips over your middle finger and shines a light into the body. It measures how much of the light is absorbed in order to calculate oxygen levels in the blood. \nIn England, they are being given to people with Covid who are over 65, younger but have a health problem, or anyone doctors are concerned about. Similar schemes are being rolled out across the UK.\nPeople measure and record their oxygen levels three times a day. \nIf oxygen levels drop to 93% or 94%, then people speak to their GP or call 111. If they go below 92%, people should go to A&E or call 999 for an ambulance.\nStudies, which have not been reviewed by other scientists, have shown even small drops below 95% are linked to an increased risk of dying. \nDr Inada-Kim said: \"The point of this whole strategy is to try to get in early to prevent people getting that sick, by admitting patients at a more salvageable point in their illness.\"\nChris Harris, who is 70, was one of the first patients to benefit from the scheme.\nHe was being treated for a urinary infection in November last year, but then when he developed unexpected flu-like symptoms his GP sent him for a Covid test. It was positive.\n\"I don't mind admitting I was in tears, it was a very stressful, frightening time,\" he told Inside Health. \nHis oxygen levels dropped a couple of percentage points below the normal zone, so after a call with his GP, he went to hospital. \nAt this point he was still feeling fine, but things changed the day after he was admitted. \n\"My breathing started to get a little bit laboured, I had a high temperature as the days went on, [my oxygen levels] were progressively getting lower, they were in their 80s,\" he told me.\nChris was treated, did not need intensive care and has made a full recovery.\nHe said: \"I may have gone [to hospital] as the very last resort and that's the frightening thing. It was the oxygen meter that forced me to go, I would have just sat it out thinking I would recover. \n\"I am extremely lucky and very, very grateful.\"\nHis GP, Dr Caroline O'Keefe, says she has seen a massive increase in the number of people being monitored.\nShe said: \"On Christmas Day we were monitoring 44 patients, today I have 160 patients who I am monitoring daily. So we are certainly busy.\"\n\"We've had to quadruple the size of our team in the last two weeks.\" \nOverall, NHS England has supplied around 300,000 pulse oximeters for the home-monitoring scheme.\nDr Inada-Kim says there isn't definitive proof that the gadget saves lives and it could take until April to know for sure. However, the early signs are all positive.\n\"What we think we can see are the early seeds of a reduction in the length of stay after a hospital admission, an improvement in survival and a reduction in the pressures on the emergency services,\" he said.\nHe is so convinced of their role in tackling silent hypoxia that he said everyone should consider buying one. \n\"Personally I would, and I know a number of colleagues who have bought pulse oximeters to distribute to their loved ones,\" he said.\nHe advised checking they had a CE Kitemark and to avoid apps on smartphones, which he said were not as reliable. \nFollow James on Twitter."

      "text": "Ministers will discuss at a meeting on Monday whether to tighten restrictions at UK borders - including the possibility of hotel quarantines for travellers, the BBC has been told.\nAt a Downing Street news conference on Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson did not rule out taking further action. \nIt comes amid increased concerns over the spread of new coronavirus variants.\nUnder current travel curbs, almost all people arriving in the UK must test negative for Covid to be allowed entry.\nThe test must be taken in the 72 hours before travelling and anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to \u00a3500.\nAll passengers are also required to quarantine for up to 10 days, although the isolation period can be cut short with a second negative test after five days in England.\nThe only people not subject to the conditions are children under 11, hauliers, air, international rail and maritime crew, and passengers from the Common Travel Area - comprised of the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own quarantine rules, which differ slightly.\nAs of Monday, travel corridors, which exempted passengers arriving from some countries from quarantine, were suspended throughout the UK.\nAsked whether the government would bring in further measures at UK borders, Mr Johnson said: \"I really don't rule it out, we may need to take further measures still.\n\"We may need to go further to protect our borders.\n\"We don't want to put that [efforts to control Covid] at risk by having a new variant come back in.\"\nOne more infectious variant , which was first identified in Kent, has already spread widely across the UK.\nAnd, at the briefing, the prime minister announced that early evidence suggests this variant may be more deadly.\nOther new variants causing concern have been identified in South Africa and Brazil in the weeks since the Kent variant was discovered. \nThose discoveries led to direct flights to the UK from all South American countries and several southern African countries being suspended.\nScientists fear these variants discovered in other countries may interfere with the effectiveness of vaccines and evade parts of the immune system.\nWhile those travelling into the UK are asked to abide by the 10-day isolation and told they can be subject to checks, London mayor Sadiq Khan is among those who have called for the UK to adopt the use of enforced quarantine in hotel rooms.\nThe policy is among the measures in Australia that has limited the country to just 28,750 positive cases during the entire pandemic, fewer than the UK currently has every day.\nTravellers who choose to go to Australia have to pay for their rooms at one of a number of selected quarantine facilities - and have all their meals delivered to their room throughout a stay of at least 14 days. They get tested twice for Covid during that period and if they test positive their quarantine is extended for a further 14 days.\nMeanwhile, passengers arriving into London's Heathrow airport this week have complained of queues at passport control and what they described as poor social distancing, after the latest travel restrictions - requiring travellers to show proof of their negative Covid tests - came into force.\nOn Friday, former British ambassador Peter Westmacott posted a picture on Twitter of long queues at the airport. \nA government spokesman said people \"should not be travelling unless absolutely necessary\".\nThe statement added: \"You must have proof of a negative test and a completed passenger locator form before arriving. \n\"Border Force have been ramping up enforcement and those not complying could be fined \u00a3500.\n\"It's ultimately up to individual airports to ensure social distancing on site.\"\nWith all parts of the UK under strict virus rules amid high levels of infection, only essential foreign travel is permitted in the current advice from the Foreign Office.\nA further 40,261 cases, and 1,401 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported on Friday in the UK."

      "text": "David and Victoria Beckham have paid themselves \u00a321m from their sports and media business since 2019, according to the their latest accounts. \nThis is despite continued heavy losses at Ms Beckham's fashion business, where trade has worsened during the pandemic.\nProfit at David Beckham Ventures Limited (DBVL), the brand management firm owned by the former footballer and his wife, fell \u00a33.5m to \u00a311.3m in 2019.\nThis was in part due to money spent on expansion and charitable donations. \nHowever, the celebrity couple still paid themselves a \u00a314.5m dividend at the end of 2019, accounts show, and took a further \u00a37.1m in 2020. \nA spokesman attributed the payments to \"profitable performance\" at DBVL, which among other things manages Mr Beckham's strategic partnerships with Adidas and Haig Club whisky.\nHe also noted that the company's revenue climbed by \u00a3600,000 in 2019 to \u00a316.2m.\nHowever, Victoria Beckham Holdings (VBHL), which manages the former Spice Girl's fashion label, fared much worse during that time. \nLosses at the business - which is also backed by the Beckhams' former business partner Simon Fuller and private equity firm NEO investment Partners -  widened to \u00a316.6m during the year, following a loss of \u00a312.5m in 2018. \nIt marked the seventh year the brand has been in the red since it was founded in 2008.\nVBHL blamed costs associated with the launch of the Victoria Beckham Beauty business, a new cosmetics range in which the group has an 85% shareholding. \nIt also noted that total sales across the whole business were up by 7% in 2019. \nNevertheless, auditors BDO, who signed off on the accounts, warned that the business was now reliant on shareholder support to keep going which could \"cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern\".\nAs the pandemic hammered the business last April, VBHL had to borrow \u00a39.2m from its shareholders to repay an outstanding bank loan to HSBC after breaking its debt covenants.\nVBHL said it was doing all it could to \"navigate\" the coronavirus crisis, including taking \"all actions possible to conserve cash\". \n\"All non-essential expenditure is being deferred and hiring freezes have been implemented for open positions.to enable the company to navigate through this pandemic,\" it said.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It is \"too early\" to say whether England's Covid restrictions will be able to end in the spring, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.\nOnce the four priority groups have been vaccinated, by mid-February, \"we'll look then at how we're doing,\" he said.\nNearly two million people in the UK have had their first dose of vaccine in the past week, government figures show.\nScientist Marc Baguelin, who advises the government, has said restaurants and bars should not reopen before May. \nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson has said he \"certainly hopes\" schools in England can fully reopen before Easter, while Downing Street refused to be drawn on whether this would happen by then.\nA further 1,290 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test and there have been another 37,892 cases, according to the latest government figures. \nAnd almost five million people in the UK have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine.\nSpeaking after a study suggested infections might have increased at the start of the latest lockdown in England, Mr Johnson said it was \"absolutely crucial\" that people observed the restrictions. \nReferring to figures from the Imperial College London survey, he said they showed the new variant of the virus was \"not more deadly but it is much more contagious and the numbers are very great\". \nFigures published by Public Health England show cases - meaning people who come forward to get tested while they are infected - have fallen across England since early January.\nWith the two sets of figures pointing in different directions, it will be some time before it is known for sure how long it will take for lockdown to relieve the pressure on hospitals. \nDr Baguelin, from Imperial College, who sits on a sub-group of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said the premature opening of the hospitality sector would lead to a \"bump\" in Covid-19 cases.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme even a partial reopening would generate \"an increase in the R number\". An R number above one means the epidemic is growing.\n\"Something of this scale, if it was to happen earlier than May, would generate a bump in transmission, which is already really bad,\" he said.\n\"So you have a lot of pressure on hospitals, you will have another wave of some extent. At best you will keep on having very, very unsustainable level of pressure on the NHS.\" \nNHS England figures show one in 10 major hospital trusts had no spare adult critical care beds last week.\nThis is a debate that is going to start to dominate public discourse.\nWith the vaccination programme under way, there is huge clamour to know what will happen once the most vulnerable are vaccinated, by mid-February.\nThe problem is there are still so many unknowns.\nFirstly, it is hard to predict by how much lockdown will have reduced infection levels, considering there is a new faster-spreading variant to deal with.\nThe level of uptake will also be crucial. Surveys suggest as many as one in five may not have the vaccine - although the older, more vulnerable groups tend to be the most willing to be vaccinated.\nAnd the fact that no vaccine is 100% effective means come February there could still be significant numbers of very vulnerable people who are not protected.\nAnother factor is whether the vaccine stops transmissions - so-called sterilising vaccination.\nTrials have shown the vaccines are good at stopping symptoms developing. But that does not mean someone who has received a jab will not pass on the virus.\nIf it does not, that, of course, has implications on how many control measures have to be kept in place. It will take us at least until spring to know the answer to this.\nAt this stage, it seems hard to see much beyond the possible reopening of schools come March.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was an \"impossible question\" to ask how long the lockdown would need to last. \nUnder the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons.\nThis includes for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIn Northern Ireland, coronavirus lockdown restrictions will be extended until 5 March, BBC News understands.\nIn Scotland, lockdown has been extended until at least the middle of February, with most school pupils to continue learning from home.\nAnd in Wales health minister Vaughan Gething has said no \"significant easing\" of Wales' Covid restrictions should be expected when the current guidelines are reviewed this month.\nSir Keir added that the coronavirus vaccines were \"really good news\" but \"should not mask the fact that we have still got a very serious problem\".\nThe government is aiming to offer a vaccine to all over-70s, the extremely clinical vulnerable and health and care workers by mid-February.\nSixty-five new vaccination centres are opening in England, including a mosque in Birmingham and a cinema in Aylesbury.\nIn other developments: "

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": " The rate at which coronavirus infection is falling in the UK - as measured by the R number - has continued to level off. \nThe latest R estimate from the government's scientific advisory group Sage, is between 0.7 and 0.9, up slightly from the week before.\nIt means that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between seven and nine other people.\nThe R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread. \nR is the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average.\nMeasles has an R number of 15 in populations without immunity. \nThat means, on average, one person will spread measles to 15 others. \nCoronavirus - known officially as Sars-CoV-2 - would have a reproduction number of about three if no action was taken to stop it spreading.\nYou can't capture the moment people are infected. Instead, scientists work backwards.  \nData - such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus over time - is used to estimate how easily the virus is spreading. \nIf the R value is higher than one, then the number of cases keeps increasing.\nBut if the R number is lower the disease will eventually stop spreading, because not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.\nGovernments everywhere want to force the R number down from about three (the R number if we took no action) to below one.\nThe R number is not fixed. Instead, it changes as our behaviour changes or as immunity develops. \nMathematical modellers at Imperial College London attempted to track how the number changed as isolation, social distancing and the full lockdown were introduced in spring of 2020. \nBefore any measures came in, the R number was well above one and the conditions were ripe for a large outbreak. Successive restrictions brought it down, but it was not until full lockdown that it was driven below one. \nAlthough the R number across the UK is now between 0.7 and 0.9, there are regional differences.\nScotland's estimated R number is between 0.8 and 1.0, up slightly on the previous week.\nIn Wales the number is between 0.6 and 0.9 - while in Northern Ireland it remains between 0.75 and 0.95.\nIn England, the number is risen slightly to between 0.8 and 1.0.\nThe R number is one of the big three.\nAnother is severity - some people have a very mild disease that does not cause many problems. But coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, can be severe and deadly. \nThe last is the number of cases, which is important for deciding when to act. If you have a high number, but ease restrictions so the reproduction number is about one, then you will continue to have a high number of cases.\nA vaccination programme, like the one currently under way in the UK, is another way to bring down the reproduction number.\nA coronavirus patient would naturally infect three others on average, but if a vaccine could protect two of them from infection, then the reproduction number would fall from three to one."

      "text": "People with Covid in Northern Ireland can now stop self-isolating after five full days, if they have have two negative tests. \nThese rules are also in place in England, where the prime minister has said that there will \"soon be a time\" when self-isolation is not required.\nThe self-isolation period for anyone who develops symptoms or tests positive for Covid is five full days. \nThe day symptoms begin - or you test positive - is day zero. The next day is day one of self-isolation.\nYou can leave self-isolation after five full days if you have two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart.\nYou can take the first on day five. If it's negative, you can take another test 24 hours later on day six. If this is also negative - and you don't have a temperature - you can immediately end isolation. \nThe rules apply whether or not you are vaccinated.  \nThe current self-isolation regulations run out on 24 March.\nThe prime minister has told MPs he does not expect to renew the rules and said they could end sooner - if Covid data allows.\nHe said that \"as Covid becomes endemic\" (in other words, constantly present) the government will \"replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others\". \nThis would be similar to advice for other infectious diseases such as flu. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid also said he was \"optimistic\" the government would shortly be able to \"remove all restrictions around Covid\".\nIt is not clear whether the rest of the UK would follow suit. \nIn Scotland and Wales you must self-isolate for at least seven days as soon as symptoms appear.\nPeople without symptoms who have a positive LFT result should also self-isolate immediately. They don't need to take a PCR test, although clinically vulnerable people in Wales are advised to do so.\nYou can end self-isolation after two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart - the first no earlier than day six. If you don't have a temperature, you can stop self-isolating after the second negative test, on day seven.\nIf the day six test is positive, you can take two further tests on subsequent days.\nThe guidance applies whatever your vaccination status.\nAnyone leaving self-isolation is \"strongly advised\" to limit close contact with people in crowded or poorly-ventilated spaces. \nThey should work from home and minimise contact with people at higher risk from Covid.\nThe rules about self-isolation after contact with someone with Covid are broadly similar across the UK. \nIf you are fully vaccinated (two doses - three in Scotland), you don't have to self-isolate, but should take daily LFTs for seven days (or until 10 days since your last contact, if this is earlier). \nThis also applies to under-18s (18 years and four months in Scotland; 18 years and six months in England).\nIf any of the LFTs are positive, you must self-isolate from the date of the test.\nClose contacts of positive cases who are not fully vaccinated still have to self-isolate for the full 10 days. \nIn Scotland, they are advised to take one PCR test and continue isolating even if the result is negative. \nIn Wales, unvaccinated contacts are advised to take LFTs on days two and eight, even if they have no symptoms.\nAnyone who develops Covid symptoms during self-isolation should take a PCR test. \nSelf-isolation means staying at home and not going out.\nAdults shouldn't go to work and children shouldn't go to school. \nYou should order online groceries, or ask friends or family to deliver supplies.\nNo-one from outside your household should come inside, unless to deliver essential care.\nIf you have symptoms or test positive, you should: \nPeople on a low income who are told to isolate may be entitled to some financial help:"

      "tags": "Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Budget 2021,UK national debt,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "UK government borrowing hit \u00a334.1bn last month, the highest December figure on record, as the cost of pandemic support weighed on the economy.\nIt was also the third-highest borrowing figure in any month since records began in 1993, the Office for National Statistics said.\nThe figures underline Chancellor Rishi Sunak's problems as he prepares his March Budget.\nSeparately, a survey suggested activity at UK firms fell sharply this month.\nThe closely-watched Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) from IHS Markit/CIPS found a \"steep slump in business activity\" during in January as lockdown measures continued, and warned that \"a double-dip recession is on the cards\".\nGovernment borrowing for this financial year has now reached \u00a3270.8bn, which is \u00a3212.7bn more than a year ago, the ONS said. \nThe independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has estimated that borrowing could reach \u00a3393.5bn by the end of the financial year in March. \nA Budget had been expected to take place in autumn last year, but it was delayed because of the pandemic and will now take place on 3 March.\nMr Sunak has already imposed a pay freeze on at least 1.3 million public sector workers as part of efforts to contain government spending.\nThe increase in borrowing has led to a steep increase in the national debt, which now stands at \u00a32.13 trillion.\nThe UK's overall debt has now reached 99.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) - a level not seen since the early 1960s.\nBorrowing so far this financial year is at its highest level since monthly records began in 1993. The overall government deficit is still heading to its highest in peacetime. Having started to recover in late summer, the renewed shutdowns have again hit the numbers.\nThe actual amount of borrowing in December, at \u00a334.1bn, was five times last year's amount and exceeded in only two previous months at the start of the pandemic lockdowns. Spending on jobs support, including the furlough scheme, was \u00a310bn in the month alone. \nPurchases of vaccines, testing equipment and PPE also pushed up borrowing by \u00a39bn. Receipts of income tax, VAT and business rates were all around \u00a31bn less than last December.\nDespite the national debt now rising to just under 100% - the highest since the early 1960s - the interest paid on that debt was just \u00a3100m up on last December. \nThe chancellor said the figures showed it had been fiscally responsible to inject massive sums to support lives and livelihoods, but reiterated a message that he would look to return the public finances to a more sustainable footing when the recovery returns. The Budget in March will mark only a tentative start to this process.\nPaul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the latest borrowing figures, coupled with weak retail sales data, meant that the economy still needed the government's financial support. \n\"The chancellor should ensure that is the main focus of his Budget on 3 March and not a desire to reduce the budget deficit by raising taxes,\" he added.\nIn his reaction to the figures, Mr Sunak appeared to acknowledge that now was not the time for tax increases.\n\"Since the start of the pandemic we've invested over \u00a3280bn to protect jobs and livelihoods across the UK and support our economy and public services,\" he said.\n\"This has clearly been the fiscally responsible thing to do. But as I've said before, once our economy begins to recover, we should look to return the public finances to a more sustainable footing.\"\nNonetheless, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, pointed out that the Treasury would not tolerate a 10% deficit indefinitely.\n\"The timing of the next general election in 2024 suggests that Mr Sunak will not wait until the economy has fully recovered before actively tightening fiscal policy,\" he said.\n\"Accordingly, we expect taxes to rise sharply in 2022, in order to attempt to stabilise the debt-to-GDP ratio, while at the same time funding big demography-linked increases in health and pensions spending.\"\nThe government borrows in the financial markets, by selling bonds. \nA bond is a promise to make payments to whoever holds it on certain dates. There is a large payment on the final date - in effect, the repayment. \nThe buyers of these bonds, or \"gilts\", are mainly financial institutions, like pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. Private savers also buy some. \nYou can read more here about how countries borrow money.\nThe latest PMI survey from IHS Markit/CIPS was the lowest for eight months, coming in with an overall reading of 40.6. A figure below 50 implies a decline in activity.\n\"A steep slump in business activity in January puts the locked down UK economy on course to contract sharply in the first quarter of 2021, meaning a double-dip recession is on the cards,\" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.\n\"Services have once again been especially hard hit, but manufacturing has seen growth almost stall, blamed on a cocktail of Covid-19 and Brexit, which has led to increasingly widespread supply delays, rising costs and falling exports.\"\nDespite this, the survey also found companies were upbeat about longer-term prospects, thanks to progress being made with the vaccine rollout this year."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Contact tracing,Department of Health & Social Care,Self-isolation,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There are no plans to pay everyone in England who tests positive for Covid \u00a3500 to self-isolate, No 10 has said.\nThe PM's official spokesman said there was already a \u00a3500 payment available for those on low incomes who could not work from home and had to isolate.\nA universal \u00a3500 payment was among suggestions in a leaked Department of Health document.\nThere are fears the current financial support is not working because low paid workers cannot afford to self-isolate.\nBut a senior government source said the idea of extending the \u00a3500 payments to everyone who tests positive had been drawn up by officials and had not been considered by the prime minister. \nBBC Newsnight's Katie Razzall said ministers were aware self-isolation was crucial for stopping the spread of coronavirus and the \"options paper\" had been drawn up by civil servants at the Department of Health.\nShe said it would be discussed soon by the Covid operations committee chaired by Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, adding the move suggested there was an admission in government that too many people were not staying at home and a decision needed to be made quickly.\nThe story was first reported by the Guardian which said the options paper suggested the proposal could cost up to \u00a3453m per week - 12 times the cost of the current payouts.\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC he had not seen the leaked document but said the issue of financial support for people self-isolating was \"always kept under review\". \n\"We've got to consider all sorts of policies in order to make sure that people abide by the rules, are able to abide by the rules and we get the infection rate down,\" he said. \nBut the prime minister's official spokesman denied the government was planning to introduce the new payment, telling reporters: \"We've given local authorities \u00a370m for the scheme and they are able to provide extra payments on top of those \u00a3500 if they think it necessary.\n\"That \u00a3500 is on top of any other benefits and statutory sick pay that people are eligible for.\"\nAsked about document, the spokesman said he would not comment on a leaked paper. \nBy Ben Butcher, BBC Reality Check\nIt's impossible to say exactly what proportion of people stay at home for the full 10 days after being in contact with someone who has tested positive, however some evidence suggests the minority of people do.\nA government-backed study from September 2020 suggests that just 10.9% of people remained indoors for the full time. \nLabour has often cited this report when arguing that people cannot afford to miss work, but a closer look at it suggests that, of those who break the rules, just 8.9% do \"to go to work\". \nMost people reported going out for things like shopping or exercise, but also because they didn't think they needed to quarantine as they didn't develop symptoms. \nThis research is quite old (done before self-isolation grants came in) and has a relatively small sample size of just 400 people. \nHowever, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has also highlighted research that shows that most people don't completely follow the rules.\nThis research also suggests that those on lower incomes felt they were three times less able to self-isolate than those better off. \nBBC political correspondent Ben Wright said there was concern in government about the huge cost of the proposal for the Treasury. \nHowever, he said the issue of financial incentives and trying to get people to self-isolate was clearly a live discussion within government. \nIt became a legal requirement last September for anyone in England testing positive for coronavirus to self-isolate.\nThe \u00a3500 grant already available in England is funded by the government but administered by local authorities.\nThe same level of payment is available in Scotland and Wales with similar conditions attached. Northern Ireland offers a discretionary self-isolation grant that covers expenses, such as the cost of groceries.   \nThere is a list of specific criteria applicants must meet for the grant, but those who do not qualify for this payment and who are on a low income or may face financial hardship as a result of self-isolating can apply for a discretionary payment.\nHowever, there have been high rejection rates for this discretionary grant in England, figures obtained by Labour and reported by the BBC this week suggest. \nBetween October and December last year, three-quarters of the 49,877 applications were rejected, the data showed. \nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish government would welcome the introduction of a \u00a3500 payment, as the additional funds it would generate for Scotland could allow for a similar scheme to be set up.\nSpeaking at her regular coronavirus briefing, she said: \"We will see whether that transpires or not, but any extra resources for self-isolation we would use to support self-isolation.\"\nIn other developments:\nProf Susan Michie, an adviser on the government's Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme just 18% of people with symptoms were self-isolating for the full 10 days they were meant to.\nShe said financial support currently offered to people having to self-isolate was a \"key weakness\" of the government's pandemic strategy.\nSharon, a cleaner from Kent, told the BBC if no money were to come in for two weeks she would not be able to afford to self-isolate. \n\"I have a mortgage to pay,\" she said.\n\"I can't even afford to heat my property at the moment because my wages were cut and that \u00a3500 payment would make all the difference. I would be able to self-isolate. \n\"It wouldn't be enough money, but it would help.\"\nThe DoH said it would not comment on a leaked paper but stressed it was incumbent on everyone to help protect the NHS by staying at home and following the rules at \"one of the toughest moments of this pandemic\".\nA spokesman said \u00a350m was invested at the time the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme launched and it was providing a further \u00a320m to help support people on low incomes who need to self-isolate.\nPeople who have tested positive for coronavirus and those considered at risk of having been exposed to it must self-isolate.\nOther legal obligations to self-isolate in the UK include: \nWould \u00a3500 be enough to help you to self-isolate?

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,NI Health,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Coronavirus lockdown restrictions in Northern Ireland will be extended until 5 March, the first and deputy first ministers have said.\nThe executive backed the health minister's proposal on Thursday and will review the move on 18 February.\nBut ministers were also told that restrictions may have to remain in place until after the Easter holidays.\nA lockdown closing non-essential retailers and encouraging employees to work from home began after Christmas.\nFamily gatherings are prohibited and people have been ordered to stay at home for all but essential reasons.\nSchools are closed to most pupils until after February's half-term but a paper looking at reopening will be put to ministers at next week's executive meeting.\nThe lockdown came in response to a spike in the number of cases of coronavirus, which followed a relaxation of some rules in the run-up to Christmas.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said extending the restrictions was an \"appropriate and necessary response\" to tackle the \"imminent threat\" posed by Covid-19.\nShe said she understood it would be difficult for many people to accept, given the uncertainty facing families and businesses, but added: \"To not press forward would risk all of the hard-won gains.\"\nThe first and deputy first ministers were right to state just how tough this decision will be for many people.\nBut there's an acceptance among the public that restrictions would have to be extended, given how bad things are in our hospitals.\nTheir decision also suggests politicians have perhaps learned from the last wave of the pandemic, when restrictions were turned on and off sporadically, and the impact that had both on cases and the messaging. \nThey're not alone in sustaining tough lockdown measures, with other UK nations and the Republic of Ireland also keeping their restrictions in place for several more weeks.\nBeyond that, it is thought health officials also want to ensure the vaccination programme is also \"well advanced\" before any restrictions are relaxed.\nThe hope is that, by spring, the picture will have improved significantly. \nUntil then the price we are paying for relaxations before Christmas looks likely to keep rising.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she recognised the executive was asking a lot of everybody but insisted the measures were important.\n\"We don't know what will come after [5 March],\" she said.\nMs O'Neill said there was a commitment not to keep restrictions in place longer than necessary but decisions would have to be taken in line with the health advice and concerns about a new variant of the virus which is more transmissible.\nThe executive's decision comes as another 21 deaths were recorded by the Department of Health on Thursday.\nThe reproductive rate of the virus - known as the R-number - had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations.\nBut the latest estimate from the Department of Health says it is sitting between 0.65 and 0.85 for cases within the community but is still above one for hospital admissions and intensive care.\nWhile some may wonder why are restrictions are being extended when the executive's policy has always been based on this rate of infection, the difference is that this time around there are three times as many people in Northern Ireland's hospitals than there were in last April's peak.\nDaily case numbers are still significantly higher too.\nWhile ministers have agreed to keep the current restrictions in place until March, Health Minister Robin Swann said it was possible they could be needed until Easter, which this year falls in the first week of April.\nIt is understood this plan is being discussed across the four UK nations but ministers will have to consider that in the review next month.\nMinisters were also warned that restrictions would be eased on a step-by-step basis in line with reducing pressures on the health service and ensuring the vaccination programme is \"well advanced\" before any relaxations are agreed.\nMrs Foster pleaded with people struggling with their mental health during the lockdown to \"please seek help\".\nMore than 100 medically-trained military personnel are to be deployed to help health staff deal with the pressure the latest phase of the pandemic is placing on hospitals.\nThe chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said the \"sustained pressure on our health service\" would probably last for three to four weeks.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, 51 Covid-19 related deaths and 2,608 new cases of the virus were recorded on Thursday.\nSimon Hamilton, the chief executive of the Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce, said the extension of the lockdown would be of \"little surprise to most businesses\".\nThe Stormont executive has agreed how to allocate almost \u00a3300m to help businesses, education, tourism and transport during the next phase of the lockdown.\nA total of \u00a3100m is going towards the Local Restrictions Support Scheme, the grant for business premises forced to closed due to the restrictions.\nThere will also be \u00a316m for tourism and hospitality, two sectors which have largely been unable to operate.\nIn addition, two more support schemes for the sector have been opened.\nOne aimed at large tourism and hospitality businesses is offering a pot of \u00a326m, with the Department for Economy having identified 250 businesses that will be eligible.\nThe other is a \u00a34m scheme to support those who provide bed-and-breakfast accommodation.\nJanice Gault from the trade body the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said the schemes were a \"real lifeline for the sector\".\n\"Trading over the last year has been limited with reserves now severely depleted and businesses operating in survival mode,\" she added.\nAlso among those to receive the extra cash will be limited company directors, who had not received support since March.\nLast week, a scheme was announced to give directors \u00a31,000 grants which one director described as a \"kick in the teeth\" given that he had little to no income for the past 10 months.\nBut that scheme is to be boosted with another \u00a320m so the payments on offer will more than treble to \u00a33,500.\nLocal newspapers will also benefit from 12 months of rates relief."

      "text": "An investigation has found that four members of the Welsh Parliament drank alcohol on its premises, days after a Wales-wide alcohol ban came into force.\nThe Senedd has referred the \"possible breach\" of Covid rules to Cardiff Council and its own standards watchdog.\nConservative group leader Paul Davies has apologised and won the \"unanimous\" support of the group to stay in post.\nMr Davies, Tory chief whip Darren Millar and Labour's Alun Davies deny breaking any rules.\nAlun Davies has been suspended from the Labour group in the Senedd.\nBBC Wales has asked for clarification as to the identity of the fourth Senedd member investigators have referred to.\nOn 8 December, five individuals - four members of the Senedd (MS) and the Conservative group's chief of staff Paul Smith - were found to be consuming alcohol in the Senedd's licensed tearoom, according to an investigation by the Senedd Commission.\nFour days earlier a ban on the serving of alcohol in pubs and licensed premises across Wales had been imposed, leading the investigation to conclude the incident could amount to \"a possible breach\" of Covid-19 regulations.\nThe Senedd's Presiding Officer Elin Jones MS said the matter had been referred to Cardiff Council to investigate a possible licence breach.\n\"The regulations in place at the time imposed strict restrictions on members of the public with regard to the consumption of alcohol,\" she said.\n\"Given that the possible breach in question occurred as a result of the consumption of alcohol by Members of the Senedd, I have also written to the Standards Commissioner to ask him to investigate whether these Members acted in accordance with the duty in the Code of Conduct to conduct themselves in a manner which maintains and strengthens the public's trust and confidence in the integrity of the Senedd.\"\nIn a meeting earlier, the Conservative group in the Senedd met to discuss what a statement issued on behalf of group chair Janet Finch-Saunders MS detailed as \"events involving three members of the Group\" on 8 December.\n\"The Group extended its unanimous support for Paul Davies to continue in his post as Leader of the Group,\" the statement read.\nBBC Wales has been told by several sources that Mr Davies said in the meeting he had considered resigning as leader.\nIt is also understood the declaration of support was made before Tory group members had seen the Senedd investigation's conclusion.\nA grassroots Conservative Party member said it \"won't hold with the party membership\" if Mr Davies did not resign.\n\"The grassroots are on fire at the moment. He 100% needs to go now - his position is untenable,\" the member added.\nWhen asked his opinion at the latest Covid press conference, First Minister Mark Drakeford said he hoped the sole member of tearoom staff on duty that evening would not be blamed for the incident.\n\"I'm very anxious that this does not all result in that person carrying the can for what happened that evening,\" he said.\n\"That was a single female member of staff faced with a collection of senior Senedd members.\n\"The idea that the person, the staff member, was to blame seems to me completely incredulous and I very much hope that this does not head in that direction.\"\nPlaid Cymru MS Helen Mary Jones said: \"Failure to address the members' actions is a grave error of judgment on behalf of the Conservative Senedd group.\n\"Their leader and their chief whip [Mr Millar] should be setting an example in the middle of a pandemic rather than getting embroiled in an incident which is in danger of bringing the Senedd into disrepute.\n\"It would seem that the internal machinations of the Tory group is stopping them from doing the right thing,\" she added.\nCardiff Council confirmed the city licensing authority - a Shared Regulatory Service (SRS) also covering the Vale of Glamorgan - had been asked to investigate.\n\"The service works closely with South Wales Police to ensure that public protection and adherence to Covid regulations is maintained,\" a spokesperson said.  \n\"Once the investigation is concluded, and if a breach of the regulations has been found, SRS will take the necessary action, which could see a fixed penalty notice served or a prosecution in the courts.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Sunderland,Nissan,European Union,Brexit,Car industry",
      "text": "Japanese car maker Nissan has told the BBC its Sunderland plant is secure for the long term as a result of the trade deal reached between the UK and the EU.\nIt said it will move additional battery production close to the plant where it has 6,000 direct employees and supports nearly 70,000 jobs in the supply chain.\nCurrently, the batteries in its Leaf electric cars are imported from Japan. \nNissan would not confirm if this would mean additional jobs at Sunderland, which is the UK's largest car plant.\nManufacturing the more powerful batteries in the UK will ensure its cars comply with trade rules agreed with the EU requiring at least 55% of the car's value to be derived from either the UK or the EU to qualify for zero tariffs when exported to the EU. \nSome 70% of the cars made in Sunderland are exported and the vast majority of them are sold in the EU.  \nNissan had issued stark warnings last year that if the UK left the EU without a trade deal, the resulting tariffs on cars and components would make the Sunderland plant \"unsustainable\". \nNissan's chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta told the BBC: \"The Brexit deal is positive for Nissan. Being the largest automaker in the UK we are taking this opportunity to redefine auto-making in the UK. \n\"It has created a competitive environment for Sunderland, not just inside the UK but outside as well. \n\"We've decided to localise the manufacture of the 62kWh battery in Sunderland so that all our products qualify [for tariff-free export to the EU]. We are committed to Sunderland for the long term under the business conditions that have been agreed.\"\nIt came as Nissan paused one of its two production lines in Sunderland on Friday as disruption at ports caused by the pandemic affected its supply chain.\nThe company said the move would affect the line which produces the Qashqai and Leaf, but work would resume next week.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng welcomed the firm's endorsement of Sunderland as a manufacturing base.\n\"Nissan's decision represents a genuine belief in Britain and a huge vote of confidence in our economy thanks to the certainty our trade deal with the EU delivers,\" he said.\n\"For the dedicated and highly-skilled workforce in Sunderland, it means the city will be home to Nissan's latest models for years to come and positions the company to capitalise on the wealth of benefits that will flow from electric vehicle production.\"\nIt's particularly welcome after the more guarded comments from the boss of Vauxhall's parent company last week. \nSpeaking as the tie-up between Fiat Chrsyler and Peugeot Citroen was christened with new umbrella name Stellantis, boss Carlos Tavares said that the future of its Ellesmere Port plant depended on the support the UK government was prepared to offer after its decision to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars after 2030. \n\"If you change, brutally, the rules and if you restrict the rules for business then there is at one point in time a problem,\" he said. \nLooking forward, he said it would make more sense to locate an electric vehicle factory closer to the larger EU market. \nIndustry voices welcomed the news from Nissan but reinforced the message from Vauxhall's owners that the government needs to do more to secure the future of the car industry as it electrifies.  \n\"This is obviously good news and will help the Nissan Leaf avoid any future tariffs, but we are going to need to see a lot more investment in battery production in the UK if we are to preserve the UK as a car manufacturer and exporter,\" said Professor David Bailey of Warwick University.\nThe head of trade body the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders agreed. \n\"The battery plant in Sunderland may be enough for Nissan's near-term plans to build tens of thousands of electric cars but the UK made 1.5 million cars last year and all will be partly electric by 2030,\" Mike Hawes said.\nAndy Palmer, former boss of Aston Martin and current chairman of electric bus maker Switch Mobility, has gone further. He says that 800,000 jobs are at risk if the UK government doesn't act now to foster battery investment. \n\"Without electric vehicle batteries made in the UK, the country's auto industry risks becoming an antiquated relic and overtaken by China, Japan, America and Europe.\"\nHe urged the UK government to use every lever at its disposal to make the UK attractive. \nUK car investment has fallen sharply since the UK voted to leave the EU. \nIn the five years to 2016 it averaged \u00a33.5bn per year. In the four years since it has averaged around \u00a31bn - a fall of 71% at a time when the technology and map of car production are going through their biggest revolution since the car was invented. \nThe Nissan decision is therefore a very welcome boost to the UK which is in an international scramble for the investment of the future which is happening right now.

      "tags": "Glastonbury,Glastonbury Festival,Live music,Music festivals,Music",
      "text": "Music festivals are \"still possible\" this summer, despite the cancellation of Glastonbury, says the head of the Association of Independent Festivals.\nPaul Reed said Glastonbury \"is a different beast to most festivals and most likely ran out of time due to the size and complexity of the event\".\nSmaller events could still happen if the government ensures organisers can access cancellation insurance, he said.\n\"For most festivals, the cut-off point is more likely the end of March.\"\nOn Thursday, Glastonbury organisers Michael and Emily Eavis called off their festival for the second year in a row because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"In spite of our efforts to move Heaven & Earth, it has become clear that we simply will not be able to make the festival happen,\" they said in a joint statement. \"We are so sorry to let you all down.\"\nTickets for the festival, which normally attracts 200,000 people and was due to take place in June, will roll over to 2022.\nGlastonbury is the UK's biggest music festival, but it was not the only event to cancel its plans on Thursday. The Country To Country festival, which was due to take place in March, also said its 2021 edition would not happen.\nThe three-day event, which attracts some of country music's biggest names to indoor venues in London, Dublin and Glasgow, said it had pulled the plug due to the \"current restrictions on mass gatherings and international travel\".\nThe announcements came as coronavirus deaths soared in England, with more than 8,500 deaths recorded in the past week. On Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was \"too early\" to say whether England's Covid restrictions would be lifted by the spring.\nGlastonbury's cancellation has raised fears for other music festivals this summer. However, the organisers of Glasgow's TRNSMT said there was \"reason to be optimistic\" that it could go ahead in July, with headliners Lewis Capaldi, Liam Gallagher and the Courteeners.\n\"Glastonbury is the biggest festival in the world and it's sad to see that, due to its enormous scale and taking several months to get the city-sized festival site ready, it's unable to go ahead this year,\" boss Geoff Ellis told Scotland's Daily Record.\n\"By comparison, TRNSMT is a much smaller city centre event with no camping. As such it takes us days rather than months to build TRNSMT. Therefore, we will continue to listen to and follow the advice from the government and remain positive about events later in the summer.\"\nHis comments were echoed by Bestival co-founder Rob Da Bank, who tweeted that \"festival season will happen in the UK this summer\", adding: \"Sadly Glasto is such a mammoth beast to plan it ran outta time.\"\nSacha Lord, co-founder of Manchester's Parklife festival, added that Glastonbury's cancellation was \"yet another blow\" to freelancers who work in the live music sector.\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast on Friday, Mr Reed said the UK was at a \"serious point in the pandemic and festivals only want to return when it is safe to do so\".\nHe added that festivals were currently struggling to get insurance for coronavirus-related cancellations. Last week, MPs from the House of Commons culture select committee wrote to the chancellor, urging him to launch a Covid-19 insurance scheme to protect live music.\nThe appeal was backed by more than 100 industry figures, including organisers of the TRNSMT and Parklife festivals. \"We do need government to intervene in this issue,\" said Mr Reed.\nIn a tweet on Thursday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden expressed his regret at Glastonbury's cancellation and said the government was \"looking at problems around getting insurance\".\nA government spokeswoman said on Friday they are in \"regular dialogue\" with public health experts to \"agree a realistic return date for festivals and other large events\". They added they were still helping festivals with the \u00a31.5bn Culture Recovery Fund, \"with many already receiving this support\".\nOther European countries, including Austria and Germany, have launched schemes to cover events that cannot be rescheduled, including music festivals. At present, England has a scheme protecting film and TV shoots, but not music.\nHowever, some festivals have been given support by the government's \u00a31.57bn Culture Recovery Fund, including Womad, End of the Road and Nozstock.\nMelvin Benn, whose company Festival Republic organises the Latitude, Download and the Reading & Leeds festivals, said that without an insurance scheme, other events would be left \"staring into the same barrel that Glastonbury stared into\".\n\"People can't afford to take that financial risk,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nThe government is holding \"early stage talks\" with insurers, confirmed Tim Thornhill of Tyser's Insurance, which counts Glastonbury amongst its clients.\n\"We have helped to put in place the film and TV restart scheme, which the chancellor explained saved 14,000 jobs,\" he said. \"So if we can do something for events, that would be welcome across the industry\".\nWhile there is \"no guarantee\" that insurance could be provided, he said there was \"significant urgency\" to finding a solution \"within the next few months\".\n\"It's really important that the government supports the industry,\" added Radiohead's Colin Greenwood. \"And they need to start thinking about that now, and not when we reach that point - say in October this year - when there are enough people vaccinated for [live music] to become safe.\n\"Nobody wants to go to anything, or take part in anything, that's going to turn into a super-spreader event,\" he said. \n\"But obviously there has to be a way out of this, through vaccination. And I think we need to make sure that systems are in place so we can get back into doing what we love.\"\nJulian Knight MP, chair of the culture select committee, said the government was working on insurance plans, because of the importance of festivals to British culture and the economy.\n\"I've been in to see the chancellor,\" he told BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat. \"Finally I think there is some movement. I understand that they are dropping some of the objections that they may have had, and that we may end up with an insurance scheme.\n\"However, there's a danger that it's too little too late.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK is at an \"extremely precarious\" point, according to the chief medical adviser, despite signs Covid infections are beginning to fall.\nThe virus's reproduction rate is estimated to be at or below one for the first time since early December. \nAnything below one means the epidemic is shrinking.\nBut cases are falling from a \"very, very high level\", Prof Chris Whitty said - and may still be increasing in some areas.\n\"A very small change and it could start taking off again from an extremely high base,\" he warned. \nSpeaking at a Number 10 press conference on Friday evening, the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said the \"awful\" death rate would stay high \"for a little while before it starts coming down\".\n\"That was always what was predicted...and I think the information about the new variant doesn't change that\".\nEarly evidence suggests the variant of coronavirus that emerged in the UK may be more deadly, although findings are preliminary and there is a high level of uncertainty. \nDr Susan Hopkins at Public Health England said there was \"evidence from some but not all data sources which suggests that the variant of concern which was first detected in the UK may lead to a higher risk of death than the non-variant. \n\"Evidence on this variant is still emerging and more work is under way to fully understand how it behaves.\" \nThe Department of Health and Social Care said while the UK's R or reproduction number, might be below one - meaning a shrinking epidemic - overall, \"cases remain dangerously high and...it is essential that everyone continues to stay at home, whether they have had the vaccine or not.\"\nMeanwhile, Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures suggested cases were decreasing slightly or levelling off across Britain. \nBut infections are falling more slowly than they did during the first lockdown - by somewhere around a quarter every fortnight compared with a halving back in April. \nA further 40,261 cases, and 1,401 deaths were recorded on Friday in the UK.\nMore than five million people had been given a first dose of the vaccine by 21 January, and about half a million had received their second dose.  \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has previously said it is \"too early\" to say whether England's Covid restrictions will be able to end in the spring. \nWhile cases are falling or stable across the rest of the UK, in Northern Ireland cases have continued to rise and the new, more infectious strain has overtaken the older variant of the virus as of the start of January. \nDuring the week ending 16 January, about one in 55 people in England had the virus, the ONS estimated, with one in 35 in London testing positive. \nOne in 100 people had the virus in Scotland and one in 70 in Wales.\nBut in Northern Ireland infections have shot up from an an estimated one in 200 people testing positive in the week to 2 January, to one in 60 last week. \nONS statistician Sarah Crofts said while fewer people were testing positive in England, \"rates remain high and we estimate the level of infection is still over one million people\". \nAnd, she pointed out, \"the picture across the UK is mixed\".\nA survey by tech company ZOE and King's College London, based on swabs of people with and without symptoms, also suggested the R number could be at 0.8.\nAnd it estimated symptomatic cases had fallen by a quarter since last week.  \nMeanwhile, the proportion of people testing positive for the new Covid variant has risen considerably in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, ONS data suggest.\nBut the new strain, which remains by far the main source of infections in England, has yet to overtake the old strain in Scotland and Wales.\nWithin England, the proportion of infections that appear to be due to the new variant remained stable, but the gap between the regions is narrowing. \nIn the figures covering 2 January, 80% of infections looked like the new variant in London compared to 30% in the North East. \nTwo weeks later, that gap had narrowed to 70% in London versus 50% in the North East.\nIt is not clear what is behind the small fall in London, but it may be down to behaviour change, or other variants like the South Africa strain now in circulation and diluting the numbers.\nFollow Rachel on Twitter"

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nWe already knew that the Covid-19 variant first discovered in south-east England was more transmissible, but now - speaking at a Downing Street briefing - Prime Minister Boris Johnson has revealed it may also \"be associated with a higher degree of mortality\". On how much more deadly the UK strain might be, the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said if the old variant might lead to the deaths of 10 in 1,000 men in their 60s who caught the virus, the new variant might kill 13 or 14 in 1,000. However, he added: \"There's a lot of uncertainty around these numbers and we need more work to get a precise handle on it.\"\nWhile the new strain might be more deadly, the PM said that evidence \"continues to show that both the vaccines we're using remain effective both against the old variant and this new variant\". However, with regards to new strains in South Africa and Brazil, Sir Patrick said they might \"have certain features which means they might be less susceptible to vaccines\". At the same briefing, a question was asked about concerns people have had about having to wait up to 12 weeks between their first and second doses of the vaccine, and whether one dose offered sufficient protection. England's chief medical officer - Prof Chris Whitty - said the \"great majority of the protection\" was given by the first dose and the second dose would top that up and extend that over time. You can read more about how effective a single Covid vaccine dose might be here.\nThe UK's R number, a measure of whether the epidemic is growing or shrinking, is at or below one for the first time since early December. The government's scientific advisers have estimated the virus is reproducing at a rate of between 0.8 and 1. Anything below one means infections are in retreat. Earlier, Office for National Statistics figures suggested cases are decreasing slightly or levelling off across Britain. But Prof Whitty said about one in 55 people in England still had the virus. And in Northern Ireland, cases have continued to rise and the new, more infectious strain has overtaken the older variant. You can read more about the R number and why it matters here.\nVaccinations in parts of Europe are being held up and in some cases halted because of a cut in deliveries of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine. Germany's most populous state and several regions in Italy have suspended first jabs, while vaccinations for medics in Madrid have been stopped too. The US pharmaceutical firm has had to cut deliveries temporarily while cases in many European countries surge. Italy and Poland have threatened to take legal action in response to the reduction in vaccines. Pfizer said last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeks because of work to increase capacity at its Belgian processing plant. The EU has ordered 600 million doses from Pfizer and has also authorised the Moderna vaccine.\nPolice broke up a wedding party in north London, where they originally claimed about 400 people had gathered. Officers found the windows at the Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls' School, in Stamford Hill, had been covered when they arrived at 21:15 GMT on Thursday. Guests fled from the strictly Orthodox Charedi Jewish school when the police arrived. The organisers face a \u00a310,000 fine for breaking lockdown rules. The Met has since revised its estimate of guests at the event down to 150. A spokesman for the school, whose principal died in April after contracting coronavirus, said: \"We had no knowledge that the wedding was taking place. We are absolutely horrified about last night's event and condemn it in the strongest possible terms.\" You can read about the current rules for weddings here.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nIf you're struggling to understand why vaccinating the most vulnerable won't immediately end lockdown, health correspondent Nick Triggle explains the reasoning.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "title": "Covid: Biden signs executive orders on food aid and worker protections",
      "tags": "Donald Trump,US politics,Coronavirus pandemic,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden has issued two more executive orders as he continues to roll back his predecessor's agenda.\nHe signed one order on boosting food assistance and another on raising the federal minimum wage to $15.\nBrian Deese, director of the White House National Economic Council, said the action would \"provide a critical lifeline\" to millions of families. \nIt comes a day after the new US president signed a raft of orders to boost the fight against coronavirus.\nThis included expanding testing and accelerating vaccine distribution. \nMr Biden said it would take months to defeat the pandemic but America would \"get through this\" if people stood together.\nThe Trump administration was widely accused of failing to get to grips with the pandemic. \nThe US has recorded the highest coronavirus death toll of any country in the world, with more than 410,000 fatalities, according to data collated by John Hopkins University. It has recorded more than 24.6 million cases. \nMr Biden signed the two executive orders on Friday.\nThe first increases food aid for children who rely on school meals as a main source for nutrition, but are unable to access them because of remote learning.\nIt also creates a guarantee that workers can access unemployment benefits if they refuse a job on the grounds that it could jeopardise their health.\nThe second is aimed at expanding protections for federal workers, by restoring collective bargaining rights and promoting a $15 (\u00a311) hourly minimum wage. \nMr Deese said the orders were \"not a substitute\" for a $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill that Mr Biden wants Congress to pass, but an essential lifeline for people who need immediate assistance.\n\"The American people cannot afford to wait,\" he told reporters. \"So many are hanging by a thread. They need help, and we're committed to doing everything we can to provide that help as quickly as possible.\"\nThe day after taking office, Mr Biden signed 10 executive orders as part of a sweeping \"wartime\" Covid action plan.\nThis included increasing vaccinations and testing, and expanding the production of essential equipment.\nMr Biden said that the \"bold practical steps\" that he was taking would not come cheaply.\n\"Let me be clear - things will continue to get worse before they get better,\" he said, adding that he expected the number of dead to top half a million by next month.\n\"This is a wartime undertaking,\" he said, repeating that more Americans had already died in the pandemic than in the whole of World War Two.\nHe mentioned the vaccine, saying that its rollout had been a \"dismal failure so far\", and described his plan for 100 million jabs in his first 100 days in office as \"one of the greatest operational challenges our nation has ever taken on\".\nBut when challenged by a reporter who suggested the target might be too low, he snapped back: \"When I announced it you all said that it's not possible. Come on. Give me a break, man.\" \nSome US media commentators have argued that Mr Biden's goal of one million doses administered daily to Americans is not ambitious enough.\nThe daily average for coronavirus vaccine doses over the last week, including under the Trump administration, already sits at 980,000, according to the Bloomberg vaccine tracker.\nMr Biden also promised to be transparent about setbacks, and allow scientists to work free from political interference.\n\"I'm convinced the American people are ready to spare no effort to get this done,\" he concluded. \"We can do this if we stand together.\"\nSpeaking separately chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci spoke about the vaccine rollout, saying the Biden administration was \"amplifying\" the programme that was already there.\nIf, as hoped, 70-85% of the population was vaccinated by the end of summer, there would be \"a degree of normality\" by autumn, he said.\nDr Fauci said his main concern was persuading people who were sceptical about the vaccine to take it.\nHe added that the administration was in talks with manufacturers to produce more vaccine, amid reports of supply problems. Some regional officials say they have run out of available vaccine.\nNearly 20 million shots have been administered so far.\nDr Fauci, who served under Mr Trump, also welcomed the new administration's emphasis on science.\n\"The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know and what the evidence, what the science is... it is something of a liberating feeling,\" he said, whereas under Mr Trump, \"you didn't feel that you could actually say something and there wouldn't be any repercussions\".\nThe new administration has released a seven-point plan which includes efforts to facilitate effective distribution of vaccines and reliable access to testing.\nThe Trump administration had been criticised for a lack of strategy at the federal level.\n\"The American people deserve an urgent, robust and professional response to the growing public health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak,\" an introduction to the plan said.\nIt said Mr Biden believed the government \"must act swiftly and aggressively to help protect and support\" essential workers and the most vulnerable.\nAlthough executive orders do not require congressional approval, much of the funding for the planned measures is contained in the $1.9tn stimulus package announced by Mr Biden last week.\nHe will need co-operation from the Senate and House of Representatives for the package to be adopted smoothly.\nThe aim is to reopen most schools safely within 100 days, and establish vaccine centres at stadiums and community facilities. \nInternational travellers will need to test negative before departing for the US and self-quarantine for 14 days on arrival.\nOn top of the already announced rules on wearing masks and social distancing on all federal government property, face coverings will become mandatory in airports and on many planes, trains and buses. \nThere will be more funding for state and local officials to help tackle the pandemic, and a new office will be established to co-ordinate the national response. \nThe Defense Production Act will be used to speed up production of personal protective equipment and essential supplies needed for vaccine production. Mr Trump used the same piece of legislation to compel the production of items in short supply last year. \nIn a further break with the previous administration, Dr Fauci said the US would join the Covax scheme designed to deliver Covid vaccines to poor countries. \nSpeaking by video call to the World Health Organization in Geneva, he also stressed that the US would continue to provide funding for the WHO, in line with Mr Biden's move to reverse Mr Trump's decision to leave.

      "text": "Chinese rescue teams say it might be more than two weeks until they can save a group of miners trapped hundreds of metres underground. \nThey have been trapped since an explosion closed the entrance tunnel to the Hushan gold mine in Shandong province on 10 January.\nAuthorities made contact with 11 surviving miners a week after the blast, but one has since died.\nRescuers have drilled small holes to supply food and medicine to the men.\nThe cause of the explosion that sealed the mine entrance is still not known.\nThe fate of another 11 miners trapped by the blast is unclear - authorities have been unable to communicate with them despite lowering food and messages into other areas of the mine.\nThe group discovered alive told rescuers they had established communication with a lone miner about 100m below them, but had since lost touch with him.\nCurrently, rescue operations are trying to widen a narrow shaft to make it big enough to lift the miners out.\nHowever, drilling is proving difficult as it needs to get through particularly hard granite and the miners are trapped far from the surface. Rescuers face an added problem in that the mine is waterlogged and there's the risk the chamber where the miners are stuck could flood. \n\"The obstacles are just too huge, which means we need a least another 15 days or even more to reach the miners,\" Gong Haitao, deputy head of the local publicity department, said.\nThe debris standing in the way weighs about 70 tons, he added.\nThe entry into the mine was severely damaged and communication was cut off by the so far unexplained explosion.\nFor a week, there was no sign of life. Then, last Sunday, rescuers felt a pull on one of the ropes they were lowering into small shafts leading down into the dark.\nA paper note was then sent up on a rope from a group of 12 surviving miners - 11 trapped in one place and a 12th trapped further below. \nSince then, the contact with the 12th miner has been lost, while one of the group of 11, who had fallen into a coma after sustaining a head wound in the explosion, was on Thursday confirmed dead. \nMining accidents are not uncommon in China, where the industry safety regulations can be poorly enforced. In December last year, 23 miners died after a carbon monoxide leak at a coal mine. \nIn September, 16 workers were killed at another mine on the outskirts of Chongqing, also due to carbon monoxide. In December 2019, an explosion at a coal mine in Guizhou province, south-west China, killed at least 14 people.\nThe group of 10 known survivors are trapped in the dark some 600m (2,000ft) underground. They are in regular contact with the rescue teams. \nA communication line has been established and food and medicine can be lowered to them through a narrow shaft. \nWhile they've been receiving porridge and nutritional liquids, the miners a few days ago asked for a traditional meal of sausages. \nEight of them are thought to be doing well, while two are in poor health.

We are doing this to say a big 'no' to fake news and a big 'yes' to the vaccine,\" Sheikh Nuru said.\n\"Muslim scholars advise us to get the vaccine because the sanctity of life is important in Islam.\"\nDr Rizwan Alidina, a trustee of the mosque and member of the Birmingham and Solihull Clinical Commissioning Group said: \"The significance of the venue is obviously quite evident with particularly the Muslim community being one of the communities with a bit of a lower uptake than we would otherwise have expected.\"\nHe said there had been a good response to the opening of the centre at the mosque and hoped it would soon be carrying out between 300 and 500 vaccinations a day.\nNHS England regional medical director for London Dr Vin Diwakar told a Downing Street press conference some communities had \"legitimate and understandable concerns about the vaccines\".\nHe said despite it being a \"safe and effective vaccine\", for some Asian and black communities there were \"longstanding concerns\" that \"go back generations\".\nDr Diwakar said some people were \"told by their grandparents that experiments were done in the early part of the last century, that unethical experiments were done way back in the 60s\".\nSpeaking at the Downing Street briefing, Home Secretary Priti Patel also sought to counter disinformation targeted at people from minority ethnic backgrounds.\n\"This vaccine is safe for us all,\" she said.\n\"It will protect you and your family...

      "text": "Many staff at nurseries, pre-schools and childminders \"don't feel safe at work\", says the Early Years Alliance.\nThe group, representing early years providers, wants staff in this sector to be a higher priority for Covid testing and vaccinations.\nNurseries and settings for young children in England have been told to remain open during lockdown.\nThe government said the under-fives were \"unlikely to be playing a driving role in transmission\". \nThe Early Years Alliance received more than 3,500 responses in a survey of staff in nurseries or childcare settings and said these suggested widespread concerns - with half of those who replied saying they did not feel safe at work.\nNeil Leitch, chief executive of the group, said the safety worries were \"a cause for serious concern\". \nHe called on the government to implement rapid coronavirus testing among early years staff \"as a matter of urgency\", adding they should be \"given priority access to vaccinations in phase two of the rollout\".\nThere are currently no confirmed plans for lateral-flow testing in nurseries and pre-schools.\nBut the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is looking at whether some high-risk professions should be prioritised for vaccination. \nAnd Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the BBC's Breakfast programme he would \"very much like to see it\" once the most vulnerable groups had received their jabs. \nA Department for Education (DfE) spokesman said: \"Keeping nurseries and childminders open will support parents and deliver the crucial care and education for our youngest children.\n\"Current evidence suggests that pre-school children are less susceptible to infection and are unlikely to be playing a driving role in transmission.\"\nThe Early Years Alliance survey also found concerns that staff shortages would make it difficult for some nurseries and pre-school settings to stay open.\nDr Amelia Massoura, who runs Stepping Stone pre-school, in Sittingbourne, Kent, said: \"Out of six members of staff, four have contracted Covid-19.\n\"Fortunately, all have recovered well.\"\nVanessa Linehan, manager of Sandbrook Community Playgroup in Hackney in London, said: \"We are happy to stay open to support our families.\n\"But we want our staff to have testing and vaccinations as a priority. \n\"We encourage local authorities to prioritise appropriate testing for early-years staff through their community testing programmes,\" said the Department for Education spokesman.\nHowever, Labour's shadow education minister Tulip Siddiq accused the government of \"incompetence and neglect\", saying early-years staff \"deserve... proper access to testing\".\nShe questioned why \"the government has refused to publish the scientific basis for keeping early-years settings open in lockdown\" and called on it to \"urgently pull back from the brink of funding changes that could lead to viable early-years providers going bust\".\nThe government changed the funding formula for the early years sector in December, basing it on current attendance rather than pre-pandemic levels. \nAccording to the DfE, early years attendance is at 54% of the usual daily level, as of 14 January, leading to a shortfall in revenues.\nIn primary and secondary schools, which are open to vulnerable children and children of key workers only, average attendance levels have fallen to just 14%.\nRoughly half of nurseries and pre-schools and a third of childminders expect to be operating at a loss by the end of the spring term, based on current levels of government support, according to the survey. \n\"Early years providers are the only part of the education sector that the government has asked to remain open to all families,\" said Mr Leitch \n\"It is surely not too much to ask for the protection - both practical and financial - needed to ensure that we can continue to do so.\""

      "text": "Google has threatened to remove its search engine from Australia over the nation's attempt to make the tech giant share royalties with news publishers.\nAustralia is introducing a world-first law to make Google, Facebook and potentially other tech companies pay media outlets for their news content.\nBut the US firms have fought back, warning the law would make them withdraw some of their services.\nAustralian PM Scott Morrison said lawmakers would not yield to \"threats\".\nAustralia is far from Google's largest market, but the proposed news code is seen as a possible global test case for how governments could seek to regulate big tech firms.\nTech firms have faced increasing pressure to pay for news content in other countries, including France, where Google struck a landmark deal with media outlets on Thursday.\nIn Australia, the proposed news code would tie Google and Facebook to mediated negotiations with publishers over the value of news content, if no agreement could be reached first.\nGoogle Australia managing director Mel Silva told a Senate hearing on Friday that the laws were \"unworkable\". \n\"If this version of the code were to become law, it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia,\" she said.\nBut lawmakers challenged this, accusing Google of \"blackmail\" and bullying Australia for raising the reform.\nMr Morrison said his government remained committed to progressing the laws through parliament this year. \n\"Let me be clear: Australia makes our rules for things you can do in Australia. That's done in our parliament,\" he told reporters on Friday.\nGoogle is the dominant search engine in Australia and has been described by the government as a near-essential utility, with little market competition.\nThe government has argued that because the tech platforms gain customers from people who want to read the news, the tech giants should pay newsrooms a \"fair\" amount for their journalism.\nIn addition, it has argued that the financial support is needed for Australia's embattled news industry because a strong media is vital to democracy.\nMedia companies, including News Corp Australia, a unit of Rupert Murdoch's media empire, have lobbied hard for the government to force tech firms to the negotiating table amid a long-term decline in advertising revenue.\nMeanwhile, Google's revenues have increased markedly in the same period, amounting to more than $160bn (\u00a3117bn) globally in 2019. In the same year, Google was reported to have made $3.7bn in gross revenue in Australia.\nOf that revenue, $7.7m was generated from news content, Google said in a blog last year. \nGoogle's threat to remove its entire search product is its most severe yet. News accounts for just 12.5% of Google searches in Australia, according to lawmakers.\nIf the law is passed, the news code would initially apply only to Facebook and Google, the government says.\nIf Google withdrew its search engine, Australian internet users would be forced to use alternatives such as Microsoft's Bing, DuckDuckGo and Yahoo!\nThis is a highly unusual threat. \nGoogle dominates the search engine market with a nearly 90% market share. Almost all its revenue is from ads. For Google to threaten to pull out of an entire country suggests the company is worried. \nAustralia is nowhere near its biggest market. But Google execs are fearful about the precedent these new laws could set. \nGoogle has had a very profitable pandemic so far, while many local newspapers have struggled. That doesn't look good - Australian politicians aren't the first, and won't be the last, to point that out. \nGoogle says it wants to help fund original, local journalism. \nBut clearly it believes that what is being proposed in Australia could fundamentally hurt its business model if replicated elsewhere. \nMs Silva said the laws would set \"an untenable precedent for our businesses and the digital economy\" if Google had to pay for link and search results.\nThis was not compatible with the free-flowing share of information online or \"how the internet works\", she argued.\n\"We do not see a way, with the financial and operational risks, that we could continue to offer a service in Australia,\" she said.\nLast week, Google confirmed it was blocking Australian news sites from its search results for about 1% of local users. It said it was an experiment to test the value of Australian news services.\nFacebook last year also threatened to stop Australian users from sharing news stories on the platform if the law went ahead.\nThe social media giant repeated that position on Friday, with executive Simon Milner telling the Senate hearing it was \"a potential worse-case consequence\".\nHe said Facebook derived almost no commercial benefit from having news content on its platform.\nBoth firms have argued that news organisations already get the benefit of platforms driving readers to their websites. Google has also cited its Google News partnership as evidence it supports journalism.\nBy Katie Silver, business reporter\nAustralia's news industry is struggling. Of every A$100 (\u00a356; $77) spent on digital advertising, A$81 goes to Google and Facebook. And Covid-19 has only made this worse. \nWith companies reducing their digital advertising spend, a number of outlets in Australia have been forced to close.\nGoogle, by contrast, has been performing well. Last year the social media giant made almost $4bn from Australia, while paying $45m in tax. \nMeanwhile, Australia's competition watchdog has accused both Facebook and Google of misleading Australian consumers about how their data is used, launching inquiries into digital advertising and the app stores market.\nAustralians have expressed confusion and anger online at both sides. Some have debated whether they could get by using other search engines.\nOthers have questioned if the removal of the search engine would also remove Gmail, Google Maps and Google Home services - something the company has not made clear.\nEarlier this week, US trade representatives urged Australia to drop the laws which they said attempted regulation \"to the clear detriment of two US firms\".\nSir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, said Australia's plan would make the web \"unworkable around the world\"."

      "text": "Serious flooding which forced villagers from their homes was potentially caused by a mine shaft \"blow out\" during Storm Christoph, authorities have said.\nAbout 80 people were evacuated as water rushed through Skewen, Neath Port Talbot, on Thursday.\nResidents have been told they will not be able to return home this weekend or \"possibly longer\".\nThe Coal Authority said initial checks suggested water had built up in the shaft and flooded the village.\nCarl Banton, from the Coal Authority, said there had been a \"tremendous amount\" of rain recently and potentially a blockage in the drainage system could have caused the mine shaft to \"blow out\".\nMr Banton reassured people that officers had visually checked other mine shafts in the area and were \"not concerned\" any would collapse.\n\"The mine shaft in question is the one that was on actually on the water level, it has found its point of weakness,\" he said.\nA major incident was declared as water rushed into the village on Thursday, leaving eight streets underwater as Storm Christoph caused widespread flooding across Wales.\nOn Friday, as firefighters continued to pump water out of the village, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) confirmed the Tennant Canal had been polluted \"from mine water\".\nLate on Friday evening, Neath Port Talbot council said, for safety reasons, people forced to leave their homes would \"not be able to return home this weekend, and the wait could possibly longer\".\nA support centre will open at Abbey Primary School from Saturday, with council officers on site to help people access emergency support. \nThe Coal Authority, which manages the effects of historical coal mining, are investigating the cause of the flooding.\nMr Banton said initial findings showed there may have been a build-up of water on the hillside which had \"found its way out\" through the mine shaft, flooding the village.\n\"The flow appears to be subsiding... but what we are unsure of is if there is a feed of additional water into the mine workings, from the extensive mine workings on the hillside,\" he added.\nMr Banton said officers would drill down into the shaft and investigate on Saturday, in the hope that people could soon be allowed back into their homes.\n\"A lot of the mining in this area is very old... some of it dates back to the early 1800s... we have no details of how the shaft in question here was originally filled or capped,\" he said.\n\"We will ensure the mine shaft is properly capped and sorted out.\"\nMartyn Evans, of NRW, said officers were looking at how to minimise the risk of pollution to nearby rivers, and investigating any impacts on the River Neath.\n\"We have also carried out tests on other watercourses in the vicinity of the incident. Results indicate there has been no significant impact on those at present,\" he said.\nOn Thursday night a further 20 homes were evacuated by emergency services as the water continued to rush through the village.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed on Friday financial support would be made available to people affected by the recent floods, up to \u00a31,000 per household.\n\"This is the same level of support available a year ago when storms Ciara and Dennis hit Wales, just before the pandemic,\" he said.\nSkewen resident John Thomas said he returned home from a funeral with wife Lynne on Thursday to find their house had turned into \"a lake\", he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\nHe said: \"The water was around the level of the bottom of the doors so we couldn't go in, so we just had to stand there and watch this orange-coloured water just piling up and up and up.\"\nMr Thomas said that with water up to his waist, he was unable to get in to rescue possessions.\nHe added: \"We're in a bit of a dip on the road, so you could see it gradually coming up, they were worried it might have been a sinkhole because of the coal mines. \n\"It's definitely mine workings, just by looking at the colour of the water, it's an orange colour.\n\"Other people who were evacuated had the chance to move things upstairs, I didn't have a chance to do that because I couldn't get in to it.\"\nThe couple are now staying with their daughter, with everyone else who was evacuated from their homes finding accommodation and told to avoid the area.\nMore than 30 residents of Cwrt-Clwydi-Gwyn care home were among those moved as a precaution.\nTeresa Dalling, who lives in Dynevor Road, said she had spent the night fearing for her safety.\n\"I haven't slept. I was up the back door every two hours checking the water level,\" she said.\n\"I didn't know we lived near old mines and if there's been a collapse, my fear is more could follow and that's terrifying.\"\nUp to 45 firefighters were involved at the scene at the height of the flooding.\nIn a joint statement, the police, fire service and Neath Port Talbot Council urged people not to return to their homes until it was safe.\nCh Supt Trudi Meyrick said: \"We appreciate people are eager to get back to their homes and we are working with partners to allow this to happen as soon as it is safe to do so. \n\"In the meantime we ask people to please be patient as their safety is our top priority.\"\nDeputy Chief Fire Officer Roger Thomas, of Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service, said firefighters remained in the village, pumping out water.\nHe said: \"We will continue to monitor the situation and support our partner agencies and those affected over the next few days.\"\nNeath Port Talbot council said a local rest centre was available, and measures had been put in place to protect against Covid-19.\nChief executive Karen Jones said they would continue to support residents who had to leave their homes and they would ensure others had a safe place to go if further evacuations were necessary.\nNetwork Rail said engineers had checked for any potential damage to the railway line, but had found no \"cause for concern\".\nA severe flood warning remains in force for the Lower Dee Valley, from Llangollen to Trevalyn Meadows.\nThree flood warnings are in place for the River Wye at Monmouth, River Ritec at Tenby, and Bangor-on-Dee, where people were forced to leave their homes on Thursday as flooding saw a major incident declared. Eleven flood alerts are also in place.\nSnow and ice could also exacerbate issues for emergency services and those forced to leave their homes, with temperatures forecast to plummet in coming days."

      "tags": "Edinburgh,Care homes,Isle of Skye,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A special Crown Office unit set up to probe Covid-linked deaths is investigating cases at 474 care homes in Scotland, the BBC can reveal. \nThe unit was set up in May to gather information on the circumstances of all deaths in care homes.\nProsecutors will eventually decide if the deaths should be the subject of a fatal accident inquiry or prosecution.\nCare homes say the investigation is \"disproportionate\" and placing a huge burden on overstretched staff.  \nThe Covid-19 Deaths Investigation Team (CDIT) had received 2,242 death reports as of Monday. \nThe majority of them relate to people who lived in care homes. \nThe probe into Covid deaths, also known as Operation Koper, is gathering information on the circumstances of deaths at 474 care homes in Scotland.\nAmong the major outbreaks being considered by CDIT are those at Home Farm on Skye and Thornlea Nursing Home in Midlothian.\nBehind the Crown Office statistics are hundreds of families grieving for loved ones who died in Scotland's care homes.\nAlan Wightman's 88-year-old mother Helen died in May last year during a Covid outbreak at Scoonie House in Fife.\nHelen's death is part of the Crown Office probe and Mr Wightman's hopes for the investigation are that it looks \"at the bigger picture and appreciates that on the ground people were doing the best they could\".\nHe added: \"I thought that Scoonie House did the best they could in a very difficult situation, sourcing their own PPE and stopping people coming from hospital.\n\"My own view is that care homes were put in an impossible situation because we had successive governments which did not properly prepare for a pandemic, you only have to look at the lack of PPE at the beginning of the pandemic to see that.\"\nLinda Duncan's mother Anne, a care home resident in Edinburgh, died last April .\nMs Duncan, who is a lawyer for the BBC, was critical of the circumstances leading up to her 91-year-old mother's death and referred the case to the Crown Office probe. \nRenaissance Care, which owns the Letham Park care home where Anne lived, has previously insisted it had strictly followed guidelines at the time. \nMs Duncan said: \"I feel like I've not grieved properly, not been able to deal with it and I can't be the only one while all these questions about care homes have not been answered. \n\"A lot of the focus has been on the government response but we need this investigation to look at the private operators who run these homes, did they take all the steps they could have and did they call for help when they were in trouble?\"\nCDIT has a core team of 14 staff, including eight lawyers, who also work with other agencies such as the Care Inspectorate and Police Scotland. \nA total of 1,905 death reports were received by the end of December, with 1,553 of them relating to care homes. \nFigures issued by the Crown Office show that as of Monday it has now received a total of 2,242 death reports, including non-care home fatalities. \nBut many of these will include deaths retrospectively referred to CDIT rather than ones that have occurred in January.   \nDonald Macaskill, the chief executive of Scottish Care, which represents independent care homes, said the \"timing, extent and unequal treatment of the care home sector\" in the CDIT probe were causing \"considerable distress\" in the sector.\n\"Frontline staff and managers are spending huge amounts of time providing data and information for these investigations,\" he said.\n\"This would be challenging at the best of times but in the middle of a pandemic and with dozens of care homes fighting active outbreaks this has added to a real sense of exhaustion, dismay and disappointment.\n\"We believe these investigations are wholly disproportionate and are causing irreparable damage to the professional integrity of nurses and carers who are exhausted beyond measure in fighting the virus.\"\nA spokesman for the Crown Office said: \"CDIT receives and deals with those reports and will work with the relevant agencies to ensure that all necessary and appropriate investigations are undertaken and that each investigation progresses as expediently as it can.\""

      "tags": "Social media,TikTok,Russia,Alexei Navalny,Moscow,Vladimir Putin",
      "text": "Russian police have detained close aides of the jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny, as a string of nationwide protests gets under way.\nPolice have broken up demonstrations in the eastern Khabarovsk region, amid stern warnings for people to stay home.\nMr Navalny's supporters flooded social media with calls to rally at protests expected in dozens of cities later.\nHe is Russian leader Vladimir Putin's most high-profile critic.\nHe was arrested last Sunday after he flew back to Moscow from Berlin, where he had been recovering from a near-fatal nerve agent attack in Russia last August. \nOn his return, he was immediately taken into custody and found guilty of violating parole conditions. He says it is a trumped-up case designed to silence him.\nMore than 60m people have watched his new video about President Vladimir Putin's alleged luxury Black Sea palace.\nThe Kremlin denies the property belongs to the president.\nAmong those detained in Moscow on Thursday were his spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, and one of his lawyers, Lyubov Sobol. They face fines or short jail terms. \nMs Sobol, who has a young child, was later released. But Ms Yarmysh has now been jailed for nine days.\nProminent Navalny activists are also being held in the cities of Vladivostok, Novosibirsk and Krasnodar.\nUnauthorised rallies are being planned in more than 60 cities across Russia for Saturday. Moscow police say any unauthorised demonstrations and provocations will be \"immediately suppressed\".\nA thousand people were reported to have come onto the streets in the Khabarovsk region, with some of them already detained. \nMr Navalny's wife Yulia, who travelled back to Russia with him from Germany, said she would demonstrate in Moscow \"for myself, for him, for our children, for the values and the ideals that we share\".\nAlexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) has drawn millions of followers on social media, through slickly produced videos alleging large-scale official corruption. He has long denounced Mr Putin's administration as \"feudal\" and full of \"crooks and thieves\". \nFor a long time the Russian authorities made out that Alexei Navalny was irrelevant. Just a blogger. With a tiny following. No threat whatsoever.\nRecent events suggest the opposite. First Mr Navalny was targeted with a nerve agent, allegedly by a secret group of FSB state security hitmen. Instead of investigating the poisoning, Russia is investigating him: on his return from Germany the Kremlin critic was arrested. \nHaving put Mr Navalny behind bars, the authorities are putting pressure on his supporters. The Kremlin's greatest fear is of a Ukraine-style revolution in Russia that would sweep away those in power. \nThere's no indication that such a scenario is imminent. But with economic problems growing, the Kremlin will worry that Mr Navalny could act as a lightning rod for protest sentiment. That explains the police crackdown on Navalny allies ahead of Saturday's potential protests.\nPlus, this is getting personal. Mr Navalny's video about \"Putin's Palace\" on the Black Sea was designed to cause maximum embarrassment to the Russian president.\nIn the \"Putin's palace\" video Mr Navalny alleges that rich businessmen close to Mr Putin paid for a sumptuous 17,691sq m (190,424sq ft) palace for him at Gelendzhik, by the Black Sea.\nIt is alleged to have a casino, a theatre and many other comforts, including a vineyard and tea house in the sprawling grounds. The Kremlin dismissed the YouTube video as a \"pseudo-investigation\" aimed at earning money for Mr Navalny.\nProsecutors have warned people against protesting in support of Mr Navalny on Saturday. Russia's education ministry has told parents not to allow their children to attend. \nSome Russian celebrities in the arts and sports have pledged support for Mr Navalny. They include ice hockey star Artemi Panarin. \nFormer world chess champion Garry Kasparov - now a leading anti-Putin activist based in the US - tweeted that pro-Navalny posts were being widely blocked in Russia.\nIn a phone call to President Putin on Friday, EU Council President Charles Michel voiced \"grave concern\" about the jailing of Mr Navalny. \nMr Michel said the EU was \"united in its call on Russia to swiftly release Mr Navalny and proceed with the investigation into the assassination attempt on him, in full transparency and without further delay\".\nIn October, the EU imposed sanctions on six top Russian officials and a Russian chemical weapons research centre over the Novichok poisoning of Mr Navalny. \nThe Kremlin retaliated with tit-for-tat sanctions, denying any role in the attack and rejecting the expert finding that the Russian nerve agent had been used.\nThe social media app TikTok has a flood of videos from Russians promoting the protests planned for Saturday. The messages about Mr Navalny have been going viral for several days.\nA well-known Russian TikTok user, Slava Varfolomeyev, told BBC Russian: \"I go on TikTok and find that every third video is about 'Putin's palace', the detention of Navalny and the 23 January rally!\" \nHe said that on Thursday \"this swelled to a maximum: practically seven out of every 10 videos were on that topic [Navalny]\". TikTok's popularity is based on short-form videos. \nOn Wednesday Russia's official media watchdog, Roskomnadzor, demanded that TikTok take down any information \"encouraging minors to act illegally\", threatening large fines."

Mr Young suffered a head wound and two broken ribs.\nThe court heard passenger statements saying the bus appeared to be running late and the driver had been waving passengers on to the bus without scanning their tickets. \nMs Hughes said when Vice encountered traffic between Swansea University's Singleton campus and its Swansea Bay campus, he decided to take a different route, one he had taken several times before when driving a single-decker bus. \nShe said 21 passengers has been on board, 13 of whom were on the top deck.\nMs Hughes said Vice had driven past two height restriction warnings on the route.\nThe bus went under the stone arch of the railway bridge, but hit the lower steel bridge. \nIan Ibrahim, defending, said it had been \"without doubt a catastrophic error of judgement.\"\nHe added: \"He is consumed with guilt - he's been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and severe depression.\"\nJudge Geraint Williams said: \"That fatal error of yours resulted in the death of a promising young academic.\n\"Following the crash you stayed at the scene where you witnessed first-hand the carnage you had created. \n\"I can't think of a word short of carnage to describe the scene on the upstairs of that bus - but it could have been many, many times worse.\n\"The stark reality in this case is that your impatience that day robbed you of the care which ordinarily you applied to your professional driving.\"\nAt the time of her death, Ms Ren's family said in a statement: \"Jessica was the loving wife of Wenquang Wang, a devoted mother to five-year-old Yushu Wang and the cherished Daughter of Mingqi Ren.\n\"A much loved and talented academic, Jessica will be deeply missed by her family and her friends both in China and in Swansea and will leave a great void in their lives.\"\nIn a statement released after Ms Ren died, Swansea University said: \"We are deeply shocked and saddened to hear of the death of Jessica Jing Ren. \n\"Our thoughts are with Jessica's family at this time and we extend our deepest condolences at their tragic loss.\""

A joint investigation into the cause of the fire is under way.\nSocial media posts suggested that Mr Midgley and Mr Dyson were on a winter break in Scotland.\nA post on Mr Midgley's Instagram account on Saturday showed pictures of Cameron House Hotel and said: \"Home for the weekend.\"\nRelatives have been expressing their shock at news of the couple's deaths.\nMr Midgley's sister posted a picture of her brother and his partner on Facebook, while another relative wrote: \"I'm beyond heartbroken.\"\nKate Baxter wrote on Twitter: \"Such unbearably sad news.. RIP @SimonMidgleyPR, a shining star in our wonderfully close-knit industry.\"\nAccording to his Facebook page, Mr Midgley was a freelance journalist at the London Evening Standard and ran his own PR company, while Mr Dyson is believed to be a TV producer.\nPolice and firefighters remained at the scene on Tuesday morning, with the scale of the damage becoming more apparent.\nBBC Scotland's Andrew Black was allowed on site and said: \"The damage to the building is pretty extensive, especially the upper floors. There's a smell of burning wood and we could hear a fire alarm from part of the building still going off.\"\nThe BBC understands that a wedding due to take place at Cameron House hotel this weekend has been moved to another luxury hotel.\nIn a new statement, Cameron House's director, Andy Roger, praised the \"very swift actions of the emergency services\".\nHe said: \"Everyone associated with Cameron House Hotel is still coming to terms with the events of yesterday and we are all hugely conscious that two people tragically lost their lives in the fire. \n\"Their families and friends are foremost in our thoughts as we co-operate fully with the investigation teams to try to establish the circumstances surrounding this terrible incident. \n\"The emergency services were on the scene long into the night and I cannot praise their efforts highly enough. They are true heroes. The firemen bringing out a couple and their young child by ladder from a second-floor room was a heart-stopping moment for all those who witnessed it.\n\"We're also enormously grateful for the many, many offers of practical support and good wishes from the UK hospitality industry and also from the local community, which has rallied around to help. It's been a humbling experience, but we are a small, tight-knit community on Loch Lomond and a response like that is typical of our many friends and neighbours.\"\nMr Roger said the hotel had made arrangements for the vast majority of the guests to travel home or continue with their breaks and he thanked them for their patience and \"good spirits\".\nHe also paid tribute to the staff at Cameron House who he said had shown \"an enormous degree of care and teamwork throughout the last two days\".\nLocal people have been speaking of their shock and sadness at what happened at the hotel.\nOne woman told BBC Scotland: \"We are just very sad for all the families involved and so sorry for the people who work there.\"\nAnother added: \"It's absolutely horrific. I think the local community really feels it.\"\nReverend Ian Miller, a retired minister who lives locally and was called in to offer guests support in the aftermath of the fire, said those affected \"fell into two groups\".\n\"There were those in the side bedrooms which weren't really touched and they just realised they had escaped something terrible,\" he said.\n\"But for those in the main building then there were degrees of trauma. Some had escaped with virtually nothing.\n\"One man came out in his underwear. Another woman told me she just grabbed her baby, change bag and moved out.\"\nSpeaking on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, John Gow, from forensic investigations firm IFIC, said: \"There will be a number of strands to this investigation, running in tandem. \n\"Obviously, sadly, there is the death investigation due to the fatalities that occurred.\n\"There is the origin and cause investigation which is establishing how the fire started and spread throughout the property.\n\"It is also likely there will be an investigation to establish if the fire precaution measures were adequate and operated as they should.\"\nCameron House, an 18th Century mansion, was converted into a luxury hotel and resort in 1986.\nIt is a popular wedding venue and houses the Michelin-starred Martin Wishart at Loch Lomond restaurant."
