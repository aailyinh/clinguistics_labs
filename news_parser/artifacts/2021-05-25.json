      "text": "A hospital in Bolton has said it is taking \"urgent action\" to manage a surge in patients with Covid-19.\nRoyal Bolton Hospital said it had experienced \"one of the busiest days ever\" and urged people to attend A&E only \"if absolutely necessary\".\nGreater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said the government made a \"major communications error\" in not announcing new Covid travel advice for the town.\nBolton is among the areas hardest hit by the Indian variant of the virus.\nThe town recorded 452 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 21 May, the highest in England.\nThere were 865 cases recorded in the week to 14 May, rising to 1,300 the following week.\nRoyal Bolton said it was also placing an \"increased focus on discharges to free bed space\".\nDeputy chief executive Andy Ennis said a number of patients were discharged overnight but 41 patients with Covid remained on the wards, with eight in critical care.\nManchester City Council leader Sir Richard Leese, who is also health and care lead for the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, said the number of Covid patients at the hospital was still less than a third of what it was at the peak of the pandemic.\nHe said: \"Even though there is a high proportion of cases, that high proportion of cases is not translating into significant increases in hospitalisation, and, more importantly, it is not leading to more people in ICU.\"\nHe said those being admitted included people aged 35 to 60, and although some would have been eligible for one or two vaccinations, a bigger number of patients had only recently become eligible for the jab.\nMr Ennis said the hospital was \"taking urgent actions to ensure we can continue to manage this demand effectively\".\n\"Going into the bank holiday weekend and half term, which is always a busy time for the NHS, we anticipate this pressure continuing,\" he said.\n\"We urge the public to continue to take all necessary steps to protect themselves and others, follow the relevant national guidance, and to only attend our emergency department if absolutely necessary.\" \nAdvice against non-essential travel to Bolton in Greater Manchester and for people there to meet outside where possible was issued on 14 May.\nThe advice for Blackburn, Burnley, Kirklees, Bedford, Leicester, Hounslow and North Tyneside was published online on Friday, on a page in a section of the government's website which deals with the Covid-19 restrictions, and urges \"an extra cautious approach\".\nIn a joint statement, public health directors from all eight areas reiterated that the advice was guidance only.\nThey said they had been assured by government officials there were no legal restrictions on travel in or out of each of the areas and \"no local lockdowns\".\n\"We are all working together to boost testing and vaccination and to support self-isolation,\" they said, and also urged people to continue taking \"sensible public health precautions\".\nSpeaking during a virtual press conference, Mr Burnham said: \"It would appear guidance was reissued on Friday but has been amended and it would appear to put more emphasis around travel, hence the confusion that has been created.\n\"Nobody in our system was told about this change in the presentation of the guidance.\"\nAsked if residents should cancel holidays, Bolton Council leader David Greenhalgh said they should \"just behave sensibly\".\nHe said after speaking with government officials \"there are no added restrictions coming to Bolton, there is no local lockdown\".\nA spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said the government website would be updated to \"make it clearer\" local restrictions were not being imposed. \nAdvice about additional precautions people can take living in the areas would also be added, he said. \n\"This includes, wherever possible, trying to meet outdoors rather than indoors, keeping two metres apart from anyone you don't live with and minimising travel in and out the area.\"\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "The majority of new coronavirus cases in the UK are the so-called Indian variant - named the Delta variant by the World Health Organization.\nThis version - or mutation - was first spotted in India last October.\nViruses mutate all the time. Most variants are insignificant, but some can make a virus more contagious. \nUK scientists say the Delta variant - known as B.1.617.2 - is spreading more quickly than the Kent or Alpha variant, which was behind a surge in cases over the winter.\nThere have been almost 18,000 cases of the B.1.617.2 variant in England, just under 3,000 in Scotland, 189 in Wales and 37 in Northern Ireland. \nThe latest Public Health England figures up to 2 June showed the worst-hit areas were:\nHowever, just because it's the most common strain doesn't always mean there's lots of it about. \nIn West Lancashire and East Hertfordshire, for example, in the two weeks to 29 May the variant accounted for 100% of the cases analysed for variants. But this amounted to only nine individual infections each.\nNot all cases are analysed and a higher proportion are in areas with lots of the Delta variant, potentially skewing the figures. \nBut random swabbing carried out by the Office for National Statistics, which is not skewed in this way, also found a growing proportion of cases looked like they were the Delta variant. \nIt does appear to spread more easily than the Kent variant (B.1.1.7). \nTransmission rates for the Indian strain have been put at anywhere between 30 and 100% higher than for the Kent or Alpha variant. \nRoughly 12% of contacts of people with the Indian variant went on to develop coronavirus, compared with 8% of those who had the so-called Kent variant, according to Public Health England analysis - suggesting it is roughly 50% more transmissible. \nBut some of that could be the behaviour of humans, rather than the virus itself. \nWhen a variant spreads faster than others, it could be driven by the strain being more infectious, by differences in how close people get, or by different vaccination rates. \nFor instance, it's been pointed out some of the worst-affected areas have very low proportions of residents working from home.\nDespite fears over the Indian variant, most of the UK went ahead with easing restrictions on 17 May.\nHowever, the government has issued new guidance for people in eight areas of England with high numbers of cases\nPeople have been advised to minimise travelling in and out of Kirklees, Bedford, Blackburn with Darwen, Bolton, Burnley, Leicester, Hounslow and North Tyneside.\nIn addition, residents have been advised - wherever possible - to meet people outside, maintain social distancing of 2m (6ft) from people not in their household and work from home if they can. \nIt is not clear whether the next stage of easing in England will happen on 21 June, as was set out in the government's roadmap. \nThe prime minister and health secretary have indicated they will wait for another week's data before making a decision.\nMany countries already have bans on people from the UK and elsewhere entering. \nFrance has brought a ban on non-essential travel from the UK back into force in direct response to the spread of the India variant.

      "tags": "House of Commons,Conservative Party,Rob Roberts",
      "text": "A Tory politician faces being suspended from Parliament for six weeks after an independent panel found he sexually harassed a member of his staff.\nThe former employee told BBC Wales Rob Roberts repeatedly propositioned him and asked him to be \"less alluring\".\nThe Delyn MP said he apologised for a \"completely improper\" breach of trust \"in the MP-staff relationship\".\nMPs must decide whether to back the recommended suspension, but Labour and Plaid Cymru urged Mr Roberts to resign. \nA Conservative Party spokesperson apologised to the staff member for the \"inappropriate and unwarranted treatment they were subjected to by someone in a position of authority\".\nNumber 10's official spokesman said Mr Roberts had had the Conservative whip suspended, meaning he now sits as an independent MP in the Commons.\nEarlier this year, the party closed its investigation into the Delyn MP saying he had been \"rebuked\" but would remain a Tory Member of Parliament at that time.\nIn his first interview, Mr Roberts's former employee said he had been left \"uncomfortable,\" \"shocked\" and \"horrified\" by the MP's behaviour.\nIn June 2020, the ex-staff member decided to report the MP to Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) for sexual misconduct.\nIt is one of the first cases to be judged by the panel appointed to look at bullying and harassment cases last November.\nOn Tuesday the panel said Mr Roberts should be suspended for six weeks for breaching Parliament's sexual misconduct policy. \nThe complainant started working for the newly-elected Mr Roberts in early 2020, and said the MP made his \"first advance\" ten days later.\nThe staffer, who wishes to remain anonymous, told BBC Wales they were alone in a car together on a constituency visit when Mr Roberts said: \"I find you very attractive and alluring and I need you to make attempts to be less alluring in the office because it's becoming very difficult for me.\" \nThe staffer says he found the comment \"very uncomfortable\" but \"brushed it off\" because the MP was \"apologetic\".\nThat weekend, he says Mr Roberts had dinner with his friend and \"used it to ask permission to ask me out, or make a further advance\".\nDespite the friend \"heavily discouraging him from doing so\", the staffer said the next morning he looked in his work diary to see a \"one-to-one booked with Rob\".\nIn the one-to-one meeting, Mr Roberts told his staffer the advance he had made in the car was \"something I would like to pursue, and if you would like to pursue that too it would make me very happy\".\nThe staffer told BBC Wales: \"I felt incredibly uncomfortable, shocked, pretty horrified. \n\"I tried to be very nice and said 'I really like you as a boss, but I think it's best our relationship stays professional'.\"\nHe says over the next few days Mr Roberts then exhibited \"jealous behaviour\".\n\"When I was having lunch with people he'd ask who they were, were they a boy or a girl? \n\"I'd arrange to have drinks with friends in the evening or dinner with my sister and he'd say 'why are you going for drinks with them and not me?'\"\nThe employee says Mr Roberts had also made inappropriate remarks referring to the employee's sexuality. \nAfter Mr Roberts invited him for drinks, and he said he was busy, the staffer says the MP then \"booked drinks in the diary for the following Tuesday, outside of my hours, without giving me any go-ahead\". \n\"That was the point I thought: 'I just can't come into work anymore.' Because it's not really appropriate behaviour, deliberately forcing me to spend time with him around him and alcohol.\" \nMr Roberts's former staffer said he was \"in a constant haze\". \n\"I had to find excuses just to get out of the room. I was constantly uncomfortable.\" \nHe said he had to decide \"whether or not I was going to have to quit my job\" and had a lot of \"very difficult decisions to make\" when he raised what was happening with the party whips.\n\"You're labelling yourself often in many ways as a 'troublemaker' with the party higher-ups and you don't know how the party is going to react. \n\"There is a reason there are so few of these complaints that come forward - the fear people have about what's going to happen to their career. \n\"I had very little job security and we had a pandemic around the corner.\"\nThe staff member ended up moving to a different role in Parliament, and has now left the organisation completely. \n\"I was put in a position where I had to leave my job and I shouldn't have been put in that position,\" he said. \nThe staffer first spoke to the ICGS's sexual harassment service in March, and pursued a formal complaint in June after being made aware of other allegations about Mr Roberts - even after the party whips had spoken to the MP about his behaviour.\nIn July 2020, messages seen by BBC Wales also showed Mr Roberts inviting a 21-year-old female intern who was working in Parliament to \"fool around\" with him in April. \nThe MP also repeatedly propositioned her after she told him she was struggling with her mental health.\nThe female intern told BBC Wales the messages had made her feel \"really vulnerable\".\nThe male staff member told BBC Wales Mr Roberts made comments about him during the independent investigation, \"referring to me as 'attention-seeking', saying 'I'm trying to destroy his life and his career.' \n\"It is victim-shaming. \n\"A lot of the reason I've done this, and had to leave Parliament, is because I want to ensure that this doesn't happen to other people.\" \nIn deciding that a six-week suspension from Parliament was appropriate, the panel said Mr Roberts had committed a \"serious and persistent breach of the sexual misconduct policy\".\nThe panel said the MP had taken \"positive steps\" to improve his behaviour, but had \"demonstrated limited insight into the nature of his misconduct\".\n\"We remain concerned that he does not yet fully understand the significance of his behaviour or the full nature and extent of his wrongdoing,\" the report said.\nThe panel recognised Mr Roberts - who had come out as gay after 15 years of marriage - had been \"going through several challenges and significant changes in his personal life\" but said these \"do not excuse his sexual misconduct\".\nCommenting after the panel's findings, the former staff member said: \"I am very relieved that the report published today has found that Rob Roberts committed a serious and malicious breach of policies in place to protect staff from sexual misconduct and I will welcome the recommendation by the panel that he be suspended from the service of the House [of Commons]. \n\"This has been a long process and I am grateful to the Commissioner, the investigator and the members of the various panels for their considered approach to the facts in this case. \n\"I hope that the House will now reflect on the findings in the report and take quick action to uphold the suspension. I am pleased that this has shown the complaints procedure does work and I hope it gives confidence to others.\"\nThe report says Mr Roberts \"was informed of the sanction in March and appealed it, but his appeal was rejected on 17 May\".\nThe male staffer says Mr Roberts also appealed the ICGS investigation on three grounds including claiming the \"term of sexual harassment has been 'misused', he calls them 'romantic advances'\" - but his appeals were rejected by the independent panel.\nIn June 2020 MPs voted in favour of forming this independent panel of experts to deal with bullying and harassment allegations against them.\nThe panel is entirely independent of MPs and sanctions decided by the panel can include the suspension or expulsion of an MP - which then require a vote in Parliament - as well as less severe sanctions that can be imposed directly by the panel. \nIf an MP is suspended for at least 10 sitting days by Parliament's Standards Committee this triggers a recall petition - which can lead to a by-election if it gains enough signatures. \nHowever, sanctions imposed by this Independent Expert Panel, who judge more serious sexual harassment and bullying cases against MPs, do not automatically trigger the Recall of MPs Act 2015. \nChair of the Commons Committee on Standards, Rhondda MP Chris Bryant, said that was \"manifestly unfair\". \n\"I think it would be entirely dishonourable for a member to exploit that loophole and I think the government has to close it as a matter of urgency,\" he said.\n\"You would think that Parliament would want to have exactly the same set of rules for any kind of suspension from the House of Commons but, in particular, you would think that the sanctions against somebody for bullying and sexual harassment would be tougher even that for failing to register a gift, or something like that.\n\"But it looks as if we've got this all the wrong way around.\"\nA Conservative Party spokesperson said: \"We would like to apologise to the individual concerned for the inappropriate and unwarranted treatment they were subjected to by someone in a position of authority.\n\"There is no place for the behaviour they were subjected to and we praise their courage in coming forward.\n\"In light of the outcome of the Standards investigation Rob Roberts MP has had the Conservative Party Whip suspended.\" \nThe party launched its own investigation after BBC Wales published texts sent to the female intern and reported that Mr Roberts had admitted asking out a male parliamentary staff member. \nThe Conservative Party claimed it did not contact either staff member as part of its investigation because complaints were made by third-party complainants and had not come directly from the individuals involved.\nEarlier this year the party closed the investigation saying it had \"strongly rebuked\" Mr Roberts for his \"unacceptable\" conduct, but that he would remain a Conservative MP.  \nFollowing the report, Mr Roberts issued a statement, saying: \"In the first half of 2020, I was in a particularly challenging place personally and had taken the decision to leave my marriage of 15 years and come out as being gay.  \n\"At around the same time, I asked a male member of Parliamentary staff to dinner in the hope of striking up a personal relationship.  \n\"I recognise that this breach of trust in the MP-staff relationship was completely improper and should not have happened.\n\"I apologised at the time and do so again to the complainant but also to my colleagues, family and most importantly my constituents.\n\"I will continue to do my utmost to serve my constituency as I have over the past 18 months since my election, and this judgement will not alter my resolve to ensure that the people of Delyn get the assistance they need with pressing local issues.  \n\"It is the greatest honour of my life to represent the constituency in which I grew up and have lived my whole life, and I will work tirelessly to restore any faith which has been lost by this ruling.\"\nThe MP has not commented on the messages sent to the female intern. \nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said Rob Roberts \"should resign immediately\".\n\"The fact that such serious abuse doesn't automatically result in the recall of an MP is absurd and unjust and the Labour Party will support legislation to rectify that injustice,\" she tweeted. \n\"He should not be in his role for another single day more.\"\nLabour party chair Anneliese Dodds MP added: \"The Conservative government cannot dance around gaps in legislation if it is serious about upholding standards in public life. \n\"That is why we expect the government to take immediate action - Labour will support efforts to pass emergency legislation or measures to rectify this situation.\"\nPlaid Cymru Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said the independent panel's report had highlighted the \"sort of behaviour generally recognised, both within Parliament and outside Parliament, as being unacceptable\". \n\"I honestly don't think that you can, with honour, remain in post as a Member of Parliament and I would join the calls for him to stand down,\" she said, also urging the Conservative Party to \"consider how this looks\". \n\"Just removing the whip from him under these circumstances, at a time when so many of us within Parliament have worked to make fairer and more honourable arrangements for members of staff, the Conservative Party cannot be satisfied by just doing this really mild tap on the wrist and say that everything can go on as usual, and nobody will really notice.\" "

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has urged people not to \"lose heart\" despite Covid-19 case numbers in Scotland continuing to rise.\nThe first minister said cases across the country had doubled in the past fortnight.\nAnd Glasgow remains in level three, with the seven-day average of new infections rising from 112 per 100,000 people to nearly 139 since Friday.\nMs Sturgeon said there had been a \"bump in the road\" out of lockdown due to the new Indian variant.\nBut she said there were \"some positive signs\" that case numbers may be stabilising in areas with outbreaks, such as Glasgow and East Renfrewshire.\nAnd Ms Sturgeon said the vaccination programme could be working to \"break the link\" between rising case numbers and serious illnesses and deaths, saying this could mean tougher restrictions are no longer needed to control outbreaks.\nMs Sturgeon said there was a \"rise in cases overall\" across Scotland, with case numbers having doubled - albeit from a \"very low base\" - over the past 16 days.\nShe said the percentage of tests coming back positive was \"creeping up\" too.\nThere are particular concerns about Glasgow, where the number of cases continued to rise despite the city remaining under harsher restrictions than the rest of the country.\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon said it was \"important to recognise that the extensive public health efforts under way in Glasgow will take time to work through given the scale and complexity of the city\".\nAnd she said that \"just in the last two days or so we think we may have started to see signs that case numbers in Glasgow are stabilising\".\nThe first minister said the overall rise in cases was partly due to the easing of restrictions giving the virus more opportunity to spread, adding that new variants were \"another important factor\".\nMs Sturgeon said it was important to put the figures in context, with 97 patients in hospital now compared to more than 2,000 at the peak of the second wave in January.\nMs Sturgeon said increasing case numbers earlier in the pandemic had led \"as night follows day\" to increased hospital admissions and deaths within two to three weeks.\nAnd while she said \"significant degree of caution is still needed\", this situation may be changing thanks to the vaccine - which could lead to a change in approach.\nShe said: \"Increasingly we are monitoring whether and to what extent vaccination might be breaking that link between rising case numbers and significantly rising cases of serious illness and death.\n\"If that does prove to be the case, as we hope it will, we hope our response to this virus can increasingly evolve as well.\n\"In short, while care will still be needed, it might mean we don't have to react quite so aggressively with tough restrictions in the face of rising case numbers.\n\"Instead we hope we will be able to rely more on enhanced public health interventions like testing and vaccination, and good public health practices on the part of the public.\"\nA decision on restrictions in Glasgow will be made later in the week, with Ms Sturgeon saying this would be based not just on case numbers but also hospital and intensive care admissions.\nThere have also been concerns about the number of people coming forward for vaccine appointments, with around half of those booked in at one mass vaccination centre in Glasgow failing to turn up at the weekend.\nMs Sturgeon said there would be \"more than one factor at play\" behind this, ranging from address details not being up to date to younger people finding it harder to keep an appointment due to work.\nBut she stressed that \"uptake rates are very high\", saying that \"this is a relative thing and we want to nip it in the bud\".\nScottish Labour has urged the Scottish government to use \"every means necessary\" to get Glasgow out of lockdown, with leader Anas Sarwar calling for \"urgent action now\".\nHe said: \"We can't have Scotland's largest city and one of the major economic engines of the country stuck in perpetual lockdown.\n\"To be frank the action so far has been timid, the communication has been poor and the decision-making has been inconsistent.\"\nMr Sarwar called for the government to seek help from the Army to speed up the vaccination programme, with Ms Sturgeon replying that there will be \"no hesitation in doing that\" if needed.\nMeanwhile Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer said the Scottish government should deploy local surge testing \"much quicker, before these local outbreaks are well under way\".\nHe said: \"We need to get a place where you can rapidly deploy that capacity, go door to door in an area that looks like it's beginning to have an outbreak and get that under control as quickly as possible.\"\nLib Dem leader Willie Rennie raised concerns about the take-up rate of vaccines, saying \"many people\" in his constituency had missed out on appointments due to the \"clunky booking system\".\nMeanwhile the Scottish Conservatives called for new Health Secretary Humza Yousaf to make cutting waiting times an \"urgent priority\".\nHealth spokeswoman Annie Wells said: \"While there has rightly been a focus within our NHS on tackling covid, the number of patients waiting for key diagnostic tests is extremely concerning.\n\"The SNP's new health secretary must tackle these waiting times as a matter of urgency before they completely spiral out of control. \""

      "text": "Young Conservative members are calling on the party to reform its complaints process, citing a lack of clarity and transparency.\nA number have told BBC Wales they have raised these concerns as part of a Welsh Conservative internal review.\nYoung members have expressed frustration at the way the party has dealt with allegations of inappropriate behaviour against Delyn MP Rob Roberts. \nA Tory party spokesperson said it takes \"any complaint very seriously\".\nSpeaking to BBC Wales, one Welsh Conservative councillor said the party needed to get \"a HR professional in to deal with the complaints procedure in Wales\".\n\"The process for complaining is especially unclear for members doing voluntary work for the party,\" the councillor said.\nAnother party member told BBC Wales they \"wouldn't know how to register a complaint or raise a grievance. There's a lack of transparency\".\nAden Hallam, 24, has been a Conservative Party member for two years and has volunteered for the party at local and national elections.\nIn June, he started an online campaign to reform the way the party handles complaints against elected representatives. \nLast year, he made a sexual harassment complaint to the party about a Conservative councillor in England. He claims he received an acknowledgment of his complaint, but then had no response for over a year. \n\"Since then I haven't received a single email, phone call or letter from the Conservative Party regarding this complaint and it has been over a year now,\" he said.\nMr Hallam added the councillor then went \"on to have further successes within the party\".\n\"It was rather upsetting that I'd made a complaint of that nature, which was extremely serious and upsetting to me, to then see the party seemingly take no action against this individual and actually then reward them further down the line.\n\"It feels like they just didn't believe what had happened but it also feels like they just don't care.\"  \nHe said he was concerned \"the individual may do this again\".\nAfter BBC Wales approached the Conservative Party for comment they said they would get in touch with Mr Hallam.\nHe added: \"All I want from the party is to have a complaints system where people feel like justice is done, where people feel confident that if they are a victim of bullying, harassment, any sort of inappropriate behaviour that the party will make sure it is dealt with in any manner that is appropriate. \n\"I just feel the party needs to first of all admit there's a problem.\" \nMr Hallam posted about his own complaint on social media after allegations of inappropriate behaviour against the Conservative MP for Delyn, Rob Roberts, came to light. \nIn July, the Conservative Party said it was investigating Rob Roberts's behaviour after messages seen by BBC Wales showed Mr Roberts inviting a 21-year-old female intern to \"fool around\" with him.\nMr Roberts also admitted asking out another House of Commons employee, which resulted in them changing jobs. The MP told BBC Wales that he recognised the request to ask the staffer out \"was inappropriate,\" but did not comment on the messages sent to the intern.\nThe Conservative Party confirmed that the investigation into his behaviour was ongoing.  \nIt is facing increased scrutiny about its handling of complaints after the prime minister defended a decision not to suspend a Conservative MP and former minister who has been arrested and bailed on suspicion of rape.\nOther Conservative Party members in Wales, who wished to remain anonymous, have also raised concerns about the party's complaints process.\nOne member and chair of a local Conservative association in Wales said there needs to be \"a clear structure for who takes responsibility for complaints\".\n\"Do you deal with the association chair, the area chair, the Welsh board, or central office?\"\nThe member also criticised the party's handling of allegations against Rob Roberts, saying he should \"lose the whip\" and be suspended from the party's group in Westminster.\nAnother told BBC Wales the party should have acted more decisively in suspending Rob Roberts pending an investigation into the allegations against him. \n\"His actions were wrong, inappropriate, unacceptable and we want something done about it. We've exhausted our powers to complain internally\u2026 We don't really know what's going on.\n\"A proportionate response would be to withdraw the whip from him. This doesn't make things safe for young male and female members and activists, it sets the wrong tone.\"\nThe chair of a local young Conservative association in England said it took \"months\" of junior party members talking about the allegations against Rob Roberts before the party publicly announced an investigation.\n\"It was constantly pushed under the rug by the party - and only properly treated as it should be after the media covered it.\n\"Young workers for the party aren't being listened to when they knock on the door the first time around.\n\"I wouldn't know who to contact apart from emailing the standard CCHQ email - that's even as a co-chair for a young Conservatives association. The communication and bridge just isn't there.\"\nA Conservative Party spokesperson said: \"We take any complaint very seriously.  We have a Code of Conduct where people can report complaints in confidence.\n\"If an allegation of criminal wrongdoing is raised, we would advise the individual to contact the police.\"\nThere is currently an ongoing independent investigation into the Conservative Party's complaints procedures. \nIn response to the allegations, Rob Roberts told BBC Wales in July that he had invited a parliamentary staff member to dinner.\nHe said: \"My invitation was not accepted and the staff member did not feel comfortable about it.\n\"I do now recognise that it was inappropriate to have extended the invitation to a member of staff in the first place.\n\"However, I have found the last few months and the 'coming out' process to have been particularly challenging and the cause of a great deal of mental stress to me.\""

      "tags": "Blindness and visual-impairment",
      "text": "The vision of a completely blind man has been partially restored using light-sensing proteins first found in algae.\nThe man was treated with a type of therapy called optogenetics, which uses the proteins to control cells at the back of his eye.\nHe first knew it was working when he realised he could see the painted stripes of a pedestrian crossing.\nHe can now grab and count objects on a table, Nature Medicine reports. \nThe man, whose identity has not been revealed, lives in Brittany, France, and was treated in Paris.\nHe was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa - which leads to the death of light-sensing cells on the surface of the retina - 40 years ago. \nIt affects more than two million people worldwide, and although complete blindness is rare, the man has had no vision for the past two decades.\nHe was treated with optogenetics - a field new to medicine, but one that has long been a staple of fundamental neuroscience. \nIt uses light to control precisely the activity of brain cells and was used by the scientists to restore the ability of one of his eyes to detect light.\nThe technique is based on proteins, produced in algae, called channelrhodopsins, which change their behaviour in response to light. The microbes use them to move towards the light. \nThe first step in the treatment was gene therapy. The genetic instructions for making the rhodopsins were taken from algae and given to cells in the deep surviving layers of the retina at the back of his eye.\nNow when they were hit with light they would send an electrical signal to the brain. \nHowever, they would respond only to amber light, so the patient wore a pair of goggles with a video camera on the front and a projector on the back, to capture what was happening in the real world and project a version in the right wavelength onto the back of the eye. \nIt took months for high enough levels of the rhodopsins to build up in the eye and for the brain essentially to learn a new language to be able to see again.\nThe first sign it was working was when the patient was out on a walk and suddenly, the stripes of a pedestrian crossing appeared. \nDr Jos\u00e9-Alain Sahel, from the Institute of Vision, in Paris, said: \"This patient initially was a bit frustrated because it took a long time between the injection and the time he started to see something. \n\"But when he started to report spontaneously he was able to see the white stripes to come across the street you can imagine he was very excited. We were all excited.\"\nThe man does not have perfect sight, but the difference between no vision and even limited vision can be life-changing. \nProf Botond Roska, from the University of Basel, said: \"The findings provide proof-of-concept that using optogenetic therapy to partially restore vision is possible.\"\nThere are several other approaches being used to try to restore sight.\nOne includes repairing the genetic defects that cause disease, but retinitis pigmentosa can be down to mutations in more than 71 different genes, making that more of a challenge. \nAnother involves connecting a camera to electrodes implanted in the back of the eye. \nOptogenetics itself is also being researched in conditions such as Parkinson's disease, and to see whether it can enhance recovery from a stroke. \nJames Bainbridge, a professor of retinal studies at the UK's UCL, said the study was high-quality, but on just one patient. \n\"This exciting new technology might help people whose eyesight is very severely impaired,\" he said.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Social media,Belarus,Belarusian presidential election 2020,Svetlana Tikhanovskaya,Minsk,Alexander Lukashenko,European Union",
      "text": "Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich is under house arrest after the extraordinary diversion of his Ryanair flight from Greece, denounced by some as a \"state hijacking\".\nMr Protasevich, 26, was until November 2020 editor of the opposition Nexta channel on the Telegram messaging app. The channel was founded by fellow dissident Stepan Putilo and run from outside Belarus.\nNexta and Nexta Live, used for mobilising street protests, now have nearly two million subscribers, managing to get round heavy state censorship.\nMr Protasevich faces serious charges. He and Mr Putilo - who calls himself Stepan Svetlov - were put on Belarus's list of \"individuals involved in terrorist activity\" last year. The charge of causing mass unrest can be punished by up to 15 years in jail. But terror offences carry higher sentences and as he was led off the plane passengers quoted him saying \"I'll get the death penalty here\".\nMass protests erupted across Belarus after long-time leader Alexander Lukashenko claimed victory in a 9 August presidential election widely condemned as rigged, and a crackdown followed.\nHe had just been visiting Greece along with his Russian girlfriend, Sofia Sapega. The blogger had attended an economics conference in Athens along with other Belarusian dissidents before the couple spent some time on holiday in Crete. \nThey were flying back to Lithuania, where they were both living, when their jet was made to land in Minsk over a fake bomb threat. \nPassenger Monika Simkiene remembered seeing Mr Protasevich panicking as the flight was diverted. Another said he looked \"super scared\".\nOn the ground, he and Ms Sapega were led away by police, and later appeared in videos where they were shown making what appeared to be forced confessions to crimes against the Belarusian authorities.\nOn 25 June, it was revealed that both had been placed under house arrest. Ms Sapega in a flat on her own in Minsk, and Mr Protasevich at an undisclosed location, allegedly under secret police supervision.   \nHis fellow blogger Mr Putilo said they had once discussed the risks of flying over their home country.\n\"It's a real shame that Roman made this mistake, he said. \"But unfortunately Roman's colleagues say he had relaxed a bit in recent times, not feeling threats.\"\nThe small Nexta (pronounced \"nekhta\", meaning \"somebody\" in Belarusian) team is based in Poland but also works closely with Belarusian dissidents in neighbouring Lithuania. It was launched by Mr Putilo in 2015 as a YouTube music channel, but soon switched to focus on political content.\nTelegram, a secure messaging app for smartphones, is one of very few ways Belarusian dissidents have been able to organise.\nNexta Live's posts have included crowd-sourced photos and videos of police brutality and have informed people about opposition rallies and strikes.\nMr Protasevich now works for a different Telegram channel, Belamova. He stepped in to write for it after blogger Igor Losik was arrested by Belarusian authorities in June 2020.\nWhen once asked by BBC Russian if Nexta was a protest hub or a media outlet, Mr Protasevich said: \"It is hard to say who we are. I guess we are primarily Belarusians who would like to come home and live in a free country without dictatorship.\"\nHis anti-Lukashenko activities go back to 2011 - as a teenager he was expelled from school for taking part in a protest.\nHe was later admitted to the journalism department of Belarusian State University, but expelled from there too.\nIn 2014-15, he was in eastern Ukraine, spending time with the ultra-nationalist Azov Battalion when it was fighting Russian-backed rebels. \nHe says he was there as a journalist and got wounded in the chest, but there exists a contemporary interview with a Belarusian Azov fighter (in Russian) using the nom de guerre Kim, who fits Mr Protasevich's description and calls himself a soldier. \nWhile the exact nature of his involvement with Azov is difficult to know, Belarusian state media have seized upon it in an attempt to portray Mr Protasevich as an extremist.\nThe blogger left Belarus in 2019 and in January 2020 applied for Polish citizenship. \nHis parents moved to join him in Poland last August. His father Dmitry is an army reserve officer who lectured in ideology at a Belarusian military academy.\nSince his capture, Mr Protasevich has appeared in several videos apparently speaking under duress.\nIn one appearance on Belarusian state TV, he admitted trying to topple Mr Lukashenko.\nBelarusian rights group Viasna condemned the broadcast, saying: \"Everything Protasevich will say was said under duress - at the very least psychological duress.\"  \nHis father Dmitry said watching his son speaking was painful: \"No-one should believe these words because they were beaten out, through abuse and torture of my son.\"\nAt the end of the interview, the dissident broke down in tears and lifted his hands to his face, revealing marks on his wrists."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Glasgow,Humza Yousaf",
      "text": "Around half of people who were due to get a Covid jab at a mass vaccination centre in Glasgow failed to turn up over the weekend.\nThe BBC has learned a \"considerable\" number of no shows were recorded on both Saturday and Sunday at the Hydro.\nThe venue can administer a minimum of 4,000 vaccinations each day, with a capacity to scale up to 10,000.\nIt comes amid efforts to accelerate vaccination following a rise in cases in the city.\nThe BBC understands that the number of missed appointments at the Hydro was higher on Sunday than on Saturday.\nBoth NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the Scottish government said they were looking into the issue to establish if it was a localised issue or more widespread.\nThe Scottish Conservatives suggested there may have been an issue with people receiving their vaccination appointment letter on time while the Lib Dems pointed to younger age groups who they said \"move frequently\" and have less contact with their GP.\nIn Scotland, people are invited to vaccine appointments, usually by letter, rather than booking slots themselves.\nHealth Secretary Humza Yousaf, who received his first jab on Monday, said there had been a \"slight increase\" in those not attending appointments.\nHe said: \"My plea would be to please attend and if you can't attend the appointment you're given of course you do have details where you can switch appointments, rearrange and reschedule - which is really important to do.\"\nGlasgow City currently has the second highest coronavirus rate in Scotland at 136.8 cases per 100,000 people, having recorded 866 new positive tests in the seven days to 21 May. \nClackmannanshire has overtaken it for the highest case rate, at 139.7 per 100,000 although the number of positive tests is much smaller, at 72.\nGlasgow is the only council area in Scotland under level three Covid restrictions amid concerns over the prevalence of the variant first identified in India - referred to as the April 02 variant by the Scottish government.\nPeople aged 18 to 39 who live in postcodes G41, G42, G5, G51 or G52 in the southside of Glasgow are being offered jabs early to tackle surging cases.\nThe national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, confirmed there were bigger numbers of non-attendees than expected and that it was being looked into.\nHe told Radio Scotland's Drivetime with John Beattie: \"It's not simple, it will be a mixture of reasons. Some of it will be our fault, because we didn't send letters in time or the appointments didn't go where they were supposed to go. \n\"Some of it will be vaccine hesitancy and some will be complacency. But it doesn't matter if you didn't attend, we just want you to come. Make a new appointment and come back.\"\nHe also said he was optimistic that case numbers in Glasgow would stabilise and that the city might be able to move down to level two next week. \nThe Scottish government is now inviting 18-29 years to self-register after a successful trial for unpaid carers.\nA spokeswoman said: \"This age group is particularly mobile and having the ability to text these groups means they will receive details of their vaccination appointment regardless of where they are. \n\"This is particularly relevant for students who may have registered with a GP near their term time address but be heading home for the holidays. Therefore, once they receive their appointment details vie text or email they simply contact the helpline should they need to change the location.\"\nThe service is open between 24 May and 4 June and those who register for their vaccination during this period will be allocated the first available slots from mid-June until the end of July.\nBut anyone in this age group who does not register for whatever reason will still receive a blue envelope appointment.\nTo sign up, visit nhsinform.scot/under30register or call 0800 030 8013.\nUniversity of St Andrews psychologist Prof Stephen Reicher, who advises the UK and Scottish governments, said the message should be that it is important to get both jabs. But he said it was not as simple as assuming people were to blame for not going for their vaccinations.\nHe said: \"Sometimes it's a matter of practicality. Getting to the SECC if you have caring responsibilities over the weekend, or if you are a single parent and you have got to take a couple of buses to get there, it is quite tricky.\n\"It makes sense that rather than ask people to come to you, to go into communities, take mobile labs there to get people vaccinated.\n\"We also need to talk to people and understand what their concerns are.\"\nHospital admissions in Glasgow have increased recently, and the health secretary said the Scottish government would be monitoring whether this figure translates into more severe cases which require ICU treatment.\nMr Yousaf also said this new variant meant it was \"vitally important\" that people received both doses of the vaccination when it was offered.\n\"The second dose offers greater and longer lasting protection, and should not be missed,\" he said.\n\"We want everyone to come forward for a vaccine and we continue to work with community organisations to address any barriers people may experience to ensure that everyone is able to get an appointment.\n\"The vaccines we have are extremely safe and highly effective.\"\nThe Scottish Conservative health spokeswoman Annie Wells said the number of missed vaccine appointments was \"extremely concerning\" and called for further transparency from the government on the issue.\nShe said: \"If there are any issues with people receiving their appointment letters on time, then SNP ministers must give health boards the resources to ensure that people's details are fully up-to-date.\n\"That is even more important now as we encourage younger people to take up the vaccine and ensure we can safely ease restrictions in the coming weeks.\"\nScottish Liberal Democrat health spokesperson Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP added: \"Younger age groups are more likely to move frequently and have less contact with their GPs so the government should be exploring a range of options as to how they can get people registered and get their jab.\n\"If you did not receive your letter, please check with your GP.\""

      "tags": "UK economy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Government borrowing fell in April compared with the same month last year, as parts of the economy reopened after lockdown measures eased.\nBorrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was \u00a331.7bn, official figures show, which was \u00a315.6bn lower than April last year.\nHowever, the figure was the second highest for April since records began.\nBorrowing has been hitting record levels with billions being spent on measures such as furlough payments.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) now estimates that the government borrowed a total of \u00a3300.3bn in the financial year to March. While that was down slightly from its previous estimate of \u00a3303.1bn, it remains the highest level since the end of World War Two.\nThe ONS said the cost of measures to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic meant that day-to-day spending by the government rose by \u00a3204.1bn to \u00a3942.7bn last year.\nThe huge amount of borrowing over the past year has now pushed government debt up to \u00a32.17 trillion, which is 98.5% of GDP - a rate not seen since the early 1960s.\nApril's borrowing figure was lower than official forecasts. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the fiscal watchdog, had predicted borrowing would reach \u00a339bn last month.\nParts of the economy began to reopen in April, including pubs and restaurants as well as hairdressers and gyms.\nTax receipts in April were \u00a358bn, which was up slightly from the same month last year when receipts were \u00a354.2bn.\nThe government's borrowing figures were also boosted by smaller than expected interest payments on debt.\n\"April's public finances figures showed that the government's financial position isn't as bad as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted only two months ago, reinforcing our view that the tax hikes and spending cuts that most fear may be avoided,\" said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics.\nHow you view the latest figures on government borrowing depends on what you compare it with. \nThe amount borrowed in April - \u00a332bn - is very high by normal standards, about as much as the public sector was predicted, before the pandemic, to need to borrow over the whole financial year. But it is less than the \u00a339bn officially predicted by the OBR at the Budget two months ago. \nSimilarly, the revised figure for the whole financial year 2020/21 is \u00a3300bn - about ten times what was forecast pre-pandemic and the highest borrowing in peacetime.\nBut compare it to the \u00a3394bn predicted in November and there's room for optimism. \nSome economists now think there won't be a need for big spending cuts or tax rises to bring that figure down. Instead it will drop naturally as the economy expands, tax receipts from income tax, VAT and the like roll in and the government spends less supporting the economy.  \nIt's also worth remembering that government finances are about as unlike household finances as you could get; almost all the money the government's borrowed since the pandemic is owed to the Bank of England. In that light, the objective pressures to raise taxes or cut spending to reduce borrowing aren't at all urgent. Any decisions to do so will be born less from economic urgency and more from political judgment. \nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said public borrowing \"should continue to undershoot\" the OBR's forecast it published alongside the Budget in March amid expectations of a strong recovery in GDP.\nHowever, he said: \"The chancellor's room for manoeuvre on austerity measures will depend on the size of the long-term hit to potential GDP from the recent recession.  \n\"While 'scarring' should be smaller than after past recessions, given that the unemployment rate has remained low, we still see significant costs in the form of diminished investment and an unprecedented exodus of non-UK nationals.\"  "

We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nLocal councils in areas worst affected by the Indian Covid variant have insisted there are no restrictions on travel in their areas and \"no local lockdowns\". It follows complaints of confusion after the government updated guidance for Bolton, Blackburn, Kirklees, Bedford, Burnley, Leicester, Hounslow and North Tyneside which asked people not to meet indoors or travel unnecessarily. The councils said people could take \"sensible\" voluntary precautions. A No 10 source earlier denied it was imposing local lockdowns by stealth by updating the advice without an announcement.\nModerna has said its coronavirus vaccine is \"highly effective\" in teenagers aged 12 to 17. No cases of the virus were detected in a trial involving 3,732 adolescent volunteers who had two doses of the vaccine, compared to four cases in groups who had placebo injections. The company says it will send the data to regulators globally to seek approval for use of the jab in teenagers. Although teenagers rarely get seriously ill with Covid, they can spread the infection. Experts hope vaccinating them against the virus will help stop the pandemic. \nBill Shakespeare, the first man in the world to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, has died from an unrelated illness. Mr Shakespeare, 81, had his first jab in December at University Hospital Coventry shortly after 91-year-old Margaret Keenan. Coventry councillor Jayne Innes, a friend of Mr Shakespeare, said he would \"be remembered for many things, including a taste for mischief\". She added that the \"best tribute to Bill is to have the jab\".\nThree families whose loved ones died after catching Covid in hospital have said mistakes were made by NHS trusts. David Laws, David Smith and Debbie Burford all died with the virus. Mr Laws was admitted to Kent's William Harvey hospital with pneumonia in December. Despite being a vulnerable patient with leukaemia, his family say he was left on a trolley in a corridor overnight in A&E. He caught Covid and died in January, with the disease listed on his death certificate. An East Kent NHS Trust spokesman said they have \"strengthened infection prevention and control\".

The case is unarguable that this protocol is bad for Northern Ireland.\"\nDUP MPs Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Gavin Robinson, along with Lord Dodds, met the Brexit minister on Tuesday.\nThe trio told Lord Frost the protocol should be replaced, with Sir Jeffrey saying their message was \"clear and unambiguous\".\n\"The protocol has no support from any shade or quarter of unionism. Its imposition without the consent of both traditions in Northern Ireland and overriding of cross-community voting safeguards has seriously undermined support for devolution,\" Sir Jeffrey added.\nOutgoing First Minister Arlene Foster accused the EU of having a \"tin ear\" to concerns about the protocol. \n\"It is hugely disappointing, in spite of everything that has happened, the fact that we are talking about cancer drugs being prevented from coming into Northern Ireland,\" she said.\n\"The fact that there are more checks from Great Britain into Northern Ireland than there are in Rotterdam; that still the European Union and the European Commission have had a tin ear to the concerns and the absolutely genuine concerns of the people in Northern Ireland.\"\nOutgoing UUP leader Steve Aiken said Ms von der Leyen's remarks were \"tone deaf\", and urged her to engage with his party, \"the party that helped write and implement the Good Friday Agreement\". \nHe said: \"She is at best badly informed, or at worst, is wilfully misrepresenting the impact of the EU's failure to come to an acceptable agreement with the UK, and the people of Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, we are all stuck in the middle. \n\"Northern Ireland is being used as a bargaining chip between Brussels and London.\"\nBut Ms von der Leyen's comments were welcomed by Sinn F\u00e9in MP Chris Hazzard, who said Northern Ireland businesses wanted \"the protections the protocol provides\". \n\"It's time the British government stopped the charades and implement what it has already agreed,\" he said.\n\"We also need to see the economy minister in the north using the unique situation the protocol affords the north to attract investment and jobs.\" \nDuring Brexit negotiations, all sides agreed that protecting the Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority.\nIt meant keeping the land border between the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) and Northern Ireland (in the UK) open and avoiding new infrastructure like cameras and border posts. That was easy when the whole island of Ireland was part of the EU.\nBut after Brexit, a new arrangement was needed because the EU requires certain goods to be inspected at the point of entry into its single market.\nSo, the EU and the UK negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol, which came into force on 1 January 2021.\nThe Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) said Mrs Von der Leyen's comments \"showed how little she cares about peace and stability in Northern Ireland\". \nThe LCC was set up in 2015 to represent a range of individuals and views from the wider Protestant, unionist and loyalist communities.\nLoyalist paramilitary groups like the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association are also represented on it.\nLCC Chairman David Campbell said: \"I would appeal to her to start listening and to recognise that the imposition of the protocol on the people of Northern Ireland without their involvement or consent is unsustainable and actually contrary to many of the key founding tenets of the European Union.\"\nWhen Ursula von der Leyen talks about practical solutions, she is alluding to the technical negotiations which are happening right now between EU and UK officials. \nOfficials are crunching through about 30 different issues relating to the protocol -  everything from pet travel to VAT on second-hand cars to steel tariffs to medicines and the movement of plants. \nThey're working through those to see what can ease the implementation of the protocol on the ground. \nBut the difficulty is a dramatic shift is not going to happen at a technical level. \nIt's something where there needs to be a political commitment and, at the moment, there is no sign of the EU or the UK being prepared to make that big political compromise. \nLast week, an LCC member told MPs violence could not be ruled out if the protocol remained. \nThe organisation also met Lord Frost to discuss the protocol earlier this month.\nRioting erupted in some loyalist areas of Northern Ireland in April - with tensions around the protocol partly blamed.\nSince then, there has been a switch to demonstrations largely in the form of loyalist band parades and marches.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland is currently investigating about 303 unlawful parades against the protocol. \nMeanwhile, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has said she has sought legal advice over the DUP's absence at north-south meetings.\nThe DUP is boycotting some North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings due to its opposition to the protocol.\nMs Mallon told the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday that ministers are legally obliged to attend.\nEarlier this month, Agriculture Minister and DUP leader-designate Edwin Poots was criticised for preventing another north-south ministerial meeting from taking place."

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nPeople are advised not to travel into and out of areas hardest hit by the Indian variant of Covid-19 unless necessary, it has emerged. Health officials say it's spreading fastest in Bolton, Blackburn, Kirklees, Bedford, Burnley, Leicester, Hounslow and North Tyneside. But local politicians say constituents were not informed when the guidance was updated on Friday. \"Such an important announcement and they don't even have the decency to tell us,\" complains Labour's Bolton South East MP Yasmin Qureshi.\nTourism is set for a slow recovery from the pandemic, with spending by holidaymakers this year expected to be just half the level of 2019. Forecasts by the VisitBritain agency suggest domestic tourism will be worth \u00a351.4bn in 2021, down from \u00a391.6bn two years ago, while spending by foreign tourists is expected to fall from \u00a328.4bn to \u00a36.2bn.\nCabinet ministers have written to all councils in England, urging them to allow Parkrun events - the free, weekly, timed 5k runs - to resume, saying exercise is \"vital\" for mental and physical health. The Parkrun organisation delayed plans to reopen on 5 June, saying permission had been granted for the resumption at fewer than half of its venues - including many on local authority land.\nA campaigner is calling for more research into clear masks to stop deaf people feeling isolated. The government is due to review requirements around face coverings before 21 June but Melissa Julings, 35, says more work is needed to find better clear masks to help those who lip read.\nThey've had to wait a bit longer than the rest of the UK but people across Northern Ireland have been celebrating the return of many freedoms as lockdown eases.

      "tags": "Dewsbury,Huddersfield,Holmfirth,Mayor of West Yorkshire,Kirklees Council,Tracy Brabin",
      "text": "Surge testing for Covid will begin in parts of Kirklees on Wednesday, amid criticism of \"chaotic and confusing\" government travel guidance.\nThe advice for areas hardest hit by the Indian variant was published online on Friday without an announcement, with local leaders not formally notified. \nWest Yorkshire mayor Tracy Brabin called the decision to update the guidance without fanfare as \"shocking\". \nThe government said it intended to take a national approach to lifting rules. \nSpeaking in Dewsbury, Ms Brabin said: \"The community of Kirklees has absolutely suffered [over] this last year. We've been in some version of restrictions for over a year.\n\"Businesses have gone bust, people have lost loved ones, they've not been able to see the people they care about - and now a Friday teatime announcement that can change people's lives.\n\"It just feels so disrespectful.\"\nDoor-to-door testing is going to take place in Savile Town and Thornhill Lees, with people aged over 11 being invited to take PCR tests, Kirklees Council said.\nAll adults in those areas are being offered the chance to be vaccinated if they have not already received a first dose, it added.\nJonathan Hughes, 58, lives in Gomersal and planned to go to Edinburgh on 1 June to visit his son, but said the trip is now \"unlikely\" after the latest advice.\nMr Hughes, who has terminal cancer, said: \"There is a large point of me that would like to go 'to hell with what the rules are' but I've spent my life caring what the rules are so it's difficult for me to go all cavalier about it and not care about it now. \n\"A year ago, my oncologist advised that I plan for 'quality of life - not quantity'. The government's lack of clarity means that I'm increasingly unlikely to see much of either.\"\nJo Richmond, general manager of the Old Bridge Inn in Holmfirth, said: \"I don't think this has been communicated very well at all - I only found out about it because it came up on the news on my phone this morning.\n\"We've just had a brilliant opening week and it's a major worry that bookings could now be affected with people travelling into the area to stay at the hotel.\"\nShe said it seemed unfair that Holmfirth, which had a small number of Covid cases, was treated the same as larger towns like Dewsbury and Huddersfield because they were all within the Kirklees district.\nRakiya Maqsoon, 45, who commutes with her husband from Bradford to Dewsbury to run a market stall, said: \"If we're not meant to be commuting in and out, we've not been made aware of it.\n\"If it's not in law, what does it actually mean - how does it affect us? We'll still wear masks, keep hands clean and keep a social distance, but we'll still be commuting in. \n\"You've got to continue at some point to live a normal life,\" she added.\nMuhammad Muhammad, from Dewsbury, 55, said: \"Not everyone knows how to use the government website, a lot of my friends don't because we're old-school, we still use old mobile phones. \n\"It is concerning, everyone's getting ready for a grand reopening but I don't think there's going to be normality, is there, how things are going.\"\nAnalysis by Rob England, BBC England Data Unit\nCases in Kirklees have increased by 45% in the last seven days, compared with the previous week.\nIn the most recent data, the area had the fourth highest rate of infection in England, standing at just below 100 weekly cases per 100,000.\nThis isn't as extreme as some other parts of the country, such as Bolton, but the number of new cases being recorded do not show signs of slowing.\nThe majority of these cases seem to be in the younger age groups and to the north, such as Dewsbury Savile Town and Thornhill Lees, but not exclusively and there are hotspots appearing in the south in places like Honley and Brockholes.\nThought by the government to be one of the areas where the variant B.1.617.2 is \"spreading fastest\", according to the most recent data released, three of the 12 cases examined in Kirklees were identified as being from this variant, first identified in India.\nHowever, this only covers up to the 15 May, so it is possible more cases have been identified since.\nAdvice against travelling to Bolton in Greater Manchester and nearby Blackburn with Darwen, other than for essential reasons, and for people there to meet outside where possible, was issued on 14 May.\nIt was updated to include six more areas - Kirklees, Bedford, Burnley, Leicester, Hounslow and North Tyneside - on Friday. \nThe prime minister's official spokesman said the government wanted to encourage the public \"to exercise their good judgement\", rather than issuing \"top-down edicts\".\nKirklees Council leader Mr Pandor said he hoped it had been \"an error\" as the district's hospital rates and death rates were low.\n\"We are doing whatever we can to respond to the pandemic but the responsibility overall is the government's, he said.\n\"We will step up and do our part but we can't do it when there's no trust or no confidence in how they communicate with us. It's not on.\"\nWork and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said she was \"surprised\" to hear local leaders declare they had not been told about the fresh guidance.\n\"We have been working in close contact, so I'm surprised to hear people think this has come out of the blue - it hasn't,\" she told Sky News.\n\"It is about formalising on the record the guidance we believe people can and should follow in order to make sure we tackle and don't have more spread of the Indian variant.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "title": "NI surgical services must not be 'stood down again'",
      "tags": "Surgery,NI Health,Royal College reports",
      "text": "It is crucial that surgical services in Northern Ireland are not \"stood down\" again, according to a report by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS).   \nThe most recent statistics reveal that one in four people in Northern Ireland is on a waiting list.\nNorthern Ireland has the worst waiting times of any UK region.\nThe Health Minister Robin Swann said tackling waiting lists is a \"long-term task\" and needs \"long-term, recurrent funding\".\nThe college has said that a regional approach involving patient and surgical teams travelling to surgical hubs is the key to moving forward. \nSurgeons acknowledge that could involve additional travel for some people.\n\"The Action Plan for Surgical Recovery: 10 steps not 10 years\" has called for investment, waiting list and surgery plans, Covid-light sites in every trust area, surgical hubs and elective accountability. \nA Covid-light site is a hospital or unit where, as far as possible, only elective patients who do not have the virus are treated.\nFrom the start of the pandemic, almost all elective surgery was cancelled in Northern Ireland, as wards were closed and nurses moved to work solely in Covid areas. \nThe move only exacerbated the waiting list crisis.  \nCounty Antrim man Brian Revels, after developing a problem with his hip for several years, was told he would have to wait between four and five years before getting surgery.\nMr Revels then used his savings for private treatment. \nHe told BBC News NI that the \"operation took place within two days\".\nMr Revels has also gone privately for a hernia operation, after being told it too would take a couple of years. \nJohn Brennan, from Lambeg in County Antrim, is waiting for three different surgeries - hip, knee and cataract surgery.\nHe has been on the list for a hip replacement for four years and fell last Friday after his leg gave way.\n\"My consultant had told me he would like to have done the surgery in three months,\" he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"I would sometimes like to have been told my hip was broken but because it's the only way I am going to get the surgery.\n\"I would not wish this pain on anyone. \n\"There has to be an answer to all this. How much does it cost the NHS in painkillers alone?\" he asked.\nMark Taylor, Director for Northern Ireland at the RCS, said that since the pandemic, the situation has only \"worsened over the last year\" with the health service now in \"deep crisis\".  \n\"These patients will be waiting in pain and uncertainty, some of them unable to work, to go about day-to-day life,\" he added.\n\"They will be waiting for treatments ranging from hip and knee replacements to post-mastectomy breast reconstructions, and children's surgeries such as putting in vents for ear glue. \n\"The statistics also belie the true scale of the problem - some will seek expensive private treatment.\"\nThe plan by the RCS also details the need for additional recruitment and retention of staff, the launch of a comprehensive review of surgical services to support surgical trainees, the implementation of physical and mental wellbeing programmes and protected time for health professionals to learn. \nAccording to the College, more than 4,000 \"red flag\" cancer procedures, including surgery, have been cancelled since the beginning of the pandemic. \nPatients waiting for general surgery, trauma and orthopaedics, and ENT (ear, nose and throat) or urology procedures are worst affected. \nWaiting times for orthopaedics are especially bad and, in some areas, urgent cases can take between 1.5 years (80 weeks) and nearly 5 years (255 weeks) for treatment. \nChildren's surgery has also been severely affected with routine procedures taking anywhere between three and four years to be carried out. \nMr Taylor added that leaders in Northern Ireland are now faced with a choice to either continue to let things \"spiral out of control\" or to use the easing of Covid-19 pressures as a \"turning point and an opportunity to do things differently\". \n\"We must ensure that no matter where a patient lives in Northern Ireland they can expect the highest quality of surgical care,\" he said.\n\"Surgeons have already demonstrated great flexibility in adapting to the challenges of Covid-19 and the limitations placed on capacity. \n\"Protected surgical beds, Covid-19 light sites, a strong surgical team and surgical hubs are key parts to any meaningful solution. \n\"The Royal College of Surgeons stands ready to work with all stakeholders in delivering a surgical service fit for the 21st Century.\"\nIn a statement the health minister said the report highlighted the need for greater investment.  \n\"Sustained additional funding is not the answer by itself - but we cannot start fixing waiting lists without it,\" Robin Swann said.\n\"As minister I have tasked the system to be innovative, to be ambitious and to get as many services fully back online as quickly as possible. Already we are now breaking down Trust and administrative barriers at a far greater scale than ever before. \nMr Swann said clinicians and patients were now travelling to \"better utilise capacity\". \n\"The new regional day procedure centre at the Lagan Valley Hospital is a clear illustration of that. \n\"Over the next few weeks I will also be publishing the cancer recovery plan for Northern Ireland, an elective care framework and the urgent and emergency care review. \n\"These reports will detail both the immediate and longer term actions that are needed to bring down our waiting times. We must start putting this right. It is a long-term task however and it needs long-term, recurrent funding. \""

      "tags": "Belarus,Greece,Lithuania,Alexander Lukashenko,Ryanair,European Union",
      "text": "The father of a journalist who was arrested after his flight was diverted to Belarus has told the BBC he fears his son may be tortured.\nRoman Protasevich, 26, was on a flight from Greece which was rerouted to Minsk on Sunday over a supposed bomb threat.\nWestern countries accused Belarus of \"hijacking\" the Ryanair plane in order to arrest the dissident reporter.\nA video has also emerged of Mr Protasevich that appears to have been recorded under duress.\nIn the clip, which was released late on Monday, the journalist said he was in good health and seemingly confessed to crimes he had been charged with by the Belarusian state. But activists, including the country's main opposition leader, criticised the video and suggested Mr Protasevich was under pressure to admit wrongdoing.\nThe journalist's father, Dmitri Protasevich, told the BBC on Monday that he was \"really afraid\" of how his son would be treated by the authorities in his home country.\n\"We hope that he will cope. We are afraid to even think about it, but it's possible he could be beaten and tortured. We are really afraid of that,\" he said in a video call.\n\"We are really shocked and really upset,\" he said. \"This sort of thing shouldn't be happening in the 21st Century at the heart of Europe.\n\"We hope that the whole international community, including the European Union, will put unprecedented pressure on the authorities. We hope the pressure will work and the authorities will realise they've made a really big mistake.\"\nShortly after the footage of Mr Protasevich was released, the European Union said it had agreed to impose more sanctions on Belarus. It also called on airlines to avoid the country's airspace and gave the go-ahead to banning Belarusian airlines from flying over EU territory.\nBelarus sent a fighter jet to force flight FR4978 - which had departed from the Greek capital, Athens, and was bound for Lithuania - to land, claiming a bomb threat. It touched down in the capital Minsk at 13:16 local time (10:16 GMT) on Sunday.\nPolice then took Mr Protasevich away when the plane's 126 passengers disembarked. The activist, who witnesses said was \"super scared\", was arrested along with his girlfriend Sofia Sapega. \nMs Sapega's mother told the BBC that the 23-year-old had been taken to a Minsk jail, adding that the last word she managed to write on her WhatsApp messaging account was 'Mummy'. The accusations against her are unclear.\nBelarus is the only European country that still executes prisoners, and witnesses said Mr Protasevich told fellow passengers he feared he would face the death penalty. \nThree other passengers did not reach the plane's final destination, which was the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said he believed some Belarusian KGB agents also departed the plane at Minsk, but this has not been independently verified.\nBelarus said the flight had been diverted because of a bomb threat from the Palestinian militant group Hamas. A senior transport official read a letter to reporters that he claimed was from the militant group.\n\"If you do not fulfil our demands, the bomb will explode over Vilnius,\" it said. \nBut Hamas has denied any involvement. The group has no history or known capability of mounting operations outside Israel and the Palestinian territories. German leader Chancellor Angela Merkel said the Belarusian claim was \"completely implausible\".\nThe incident has drawn sharp condemnation from across the world, with countries urging the immediate release of Mr Protasevich and a full investigation.\nDozens of Belarusian officials, including President Alexander Lukashenko, are already under EU sanctions including travel bans and asset freezes, imposed in response to the repression on opponents.\nState media in Belarus said Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled the country since 1994, personally gave the order for the plane to be diverted. \nThe 66-year-old leader has cracked down on dissenting voices since winning a disputed election last August. Many opposition figures have been arrested, while others fled into exile.\nMr Protasevich is a former editor of Nexta, a media operation with a Telegram channel. He left Belarus in 2019 to live in exile in Lithuania. From there he covered the events of the 2020 presidential election, after which he was charged with terrorism and inciting riots.\nNexta played a key role for the opposition during the vote, which was won by Mr Lukashenko and is widely regarded as rigged. It has continued to do so in its aftermath, particularly with the government imposing news blackouts.\nMr Protasevich now works for a different Telegram channel, Belamova. He stepped in to write for it after blogger Igor Losik was arrested by the Belarusian authorities in June last year.\nWhere is Belarus? It has its ally Russia to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.\nWhy does it matter? Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Lukashenko has been nicknamed \"Europe's last dictator\" - he has been in power for 27 years.\nWhat's going on there? There is a huge opposition movement demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. The opposition movement and Western governments say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election. Officially he won by a landslide. A huge police crackdown has curbed street protests and sent opposition leaders to prison or into exile.\nWere you on the flight?

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has urged people not to \"lose heart\" despite Covid-19 case numbers in Scotland continuing to rise.\nThe first minister said cases across the country had doubled in the past fortnight.\nAnd Glasgow remains in level three, with the seven-day average of new infections rising from 112 per 100,000 people to nearly 139 since Friday.\nMs Sturgeon said there had been a \"bump in the road\" out of lockdown due to the new Indian variant.\nBut she said there were \"some positive signs\" that case numbers may be stabilising in areas with outbreaks, such as Glasgow and East Renfrewshire.\nAnd Ms Sturgeon said the vaccination programme could be working to \"break the link\" between rising case numbers and serious illnesses and deaths, saying this could mean tougher restrictions are no longer needed to control outbreaks.\nMs Sturgeon said there was a \"rise in cases overall\" across Scotland, with case numbers having doubled - albeit from a \"very low base\" - over the past 16 days.\nShe said the percentage of tests coming back positive was \"creeping up\" too.\nThere are particular concerns about Glasgow, where the number of cases continued to rise despite the city remaining under harsher restrictions than the rest of the country.\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon said it was \"important to recognise that the extensive public health efforts under way in Glasgow will take time to work through given the scale and complexity of the city\".\nAnd she said that \"just in the last two days or so we think we may have started to see signs that case numbers in Glasgow are stabilising\".\nThe first minister said the overall rise in cases was partly due to the easing of restrictions giving the virus more opportunity to spread, adding that new variants were \"another important factor\".\nMs Sturgeon said it was important to put the figures in context, with 97 patients in hospital now compared to more than 2,000 at the peak of the second wave in January.\nMs Sturgeon said increasing case numbers earlier in the pandemic had led \"as night follows day\" to increased hospital admissions and deaths within two to three weeks.\nAnd while she said \"significant degree of caution is still needed\", this situation may be changing thanks to the vaccine - which could lead to a change in approach.\nShe said: \"Increasingly we are monitoring whether and to what extent vaccination might be breaking that link between rising case numbers and significantly rising cases of serious illness and death.\n\"If that does prove to be the case, as we hope it will, we hope our response to this virus can increasingly evolve as well.\n\"In short, while care will still be needed, it might mean we don't have to react quite so aggressively with tough restrictions in the face of rising case numbers.\n\"Instead we hope we will be able to rely more on enhanced public health interventions like testing and vaccination, and good public health practices on the part of the public.\"\nA decision on restrictions in Glasgow will be made later in the week, with Ms Sturgeon saying this would be based not just on case numbers but also hospital and intensive care admissions.\nThere have also been concerns about the number of people coming forward for vaccine appointments, with around half of those booked in at one mass vaccination centre in Glasgow failing to turn up at the weekend.\nMs Sturgeon said there would be \"more than one factor at play\" behind this, ranging from address details not being up to date to younger people finding it harder to keep an appointment due to work.\nBut she stressed that \"uptake rates are very high\", saying that \"this is a relative thing and we want to nip it in the bud\".\nScottish Labour has urged the Scottish government to use \"every means necessary\" to get Glasgow out of lockdown, with leader Anas Sarwar calling for \"urgent action now\".\nHe said: \"We can't have Scotland's largest city and one of the major economic engines of the country stuck in perpetual lockdown.\n\"To be frank the action so far has been timid, the communication has been poor and the decision-making has been inconsistent.\"\nMr Sarwar called for the government to seek help from the Army to speed up the vaccination programme, with Ms Sturgeon replying that there will be \"no hesitation in doing that\" if needed.\nMeanwhile Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer said the Scottish government should deploy local surge testing \"much quicker, before these local outbreaks are well under way\".\nHe said: \"We need to get a place where you can rapidly deploy that capacity, go door to door in an area that looks like it's beginning to have an outbreak and get that under control as quickly as possible.\"\nLib Dem leader Willie Rennie raised concerns about the take-up rate of vaccines, saying \"many people\" in his constituency had missed out on appointments due to the \"clunky booking system\".\nMeanwhile the Scottish Conservatives called for new Health Secretary Humza Yousaf to make cutting waiting times an \"urgent priority\".\nHealth spokeswoman Annie Wells said: \"While there has rightly been a focus within our NHS on tackling covid, the number of patients waiting for key diagnostic tests is extremely concerning.\n\"The SNP's new health secretary must tackle these waiting times as a matter of urgency before they completely spiral out of control. \""

      "text": "There are \"grave concerns\" about the future of public swimming pools across Wales, according to the sport's governing body. \nSwim Wales has warned up to 10% - or 30 pools - may never open again, with rural areas worst hit. \nIts research suggests many of Wales' 307 pools have struggled financially while shut during most of the pandemic. \nThe Welsh government said it would spend \u00a37m this year to help provide more modern and accessible facilities. \nAlongside gyms and community centres, pools in Wales reopened on 3 May, but the bills have mounted after they were forced to stay closed for most of the last year. \n\"It's an astronomical cost running into the hundreds of thousands a year,\" said Angharad Collins, who heads up leisure services across Torfaen. \nCurrent Covid-19 restrictions mean 30 people can use an indoor swimming pool at one time, but Ms Collins said this made it difficult to cover costs. \nBut the chief executive of Torfaen Leisure Trusts - which is responsible for five sites across the county, including three pools - said they were vital for helping residents to stay fit and well. \n\"I had one lady come to us and say she had completely seized up through the pandemic and actually the pool was her oil,\" she said. \nMs Collins, who is also chairwoman of the Welsh Sports Association's Facilities Committee, warned the biggest challenge would be in four months' time with the end of financial support from both the UK and Welsh governments. \n\"I think it's feasible but we're going to need the public support. Every pool in Wales will need the public support to ensure they remain open,\" she added. \nThe cost is a concern shared by Simon Morgan, who took over the running of Cambrian Aquatics Centre in Connah's Quay, Flintshire, five years ago with other parents from a swimming group.\n\"It's half a million quid a year - it's really difficult when you have no income,\" he said. \nMr Morgan said support from the Welsh government and Sport Wales had been \"amazing\", but his priority was getting people back in the water. \n\"We had 1,200 in swimming lessons a week, now we're down to about 600... that really affects our ability to generate our own revenue,\" he added. \nMr Morgan said the pool was built in 1962 to stop people drowning in the nearby River Dee and had been a mainstay in the town ever since.  \nBut he said the coronavirus pandemic and the current restrictions made it difficult to have younger children in the pool as, with parents observing, the numbers allowed to swim were cut further. \nHis daughter Elena, 18, who learned to swim there as a child, said the situation was \"really sad\". \nShe is part of the national elite development squad and said she would not have raced for Wales without her local pool. \n\"Being a swimmer myself, I know how much I enjoy it and how much other people can enjoy it and it is disappointing how pools are struggling... it's just sad,\" she said. \nA report by Swim Wales found one in five pools had been completely closed for a year, with 80% \"inactive\" for 43 weeks out of 52. \nChief executive Fergus Feeney said he was most concerned about rural areas where facilities might already be scarce, with fewer customers. \n\"It's very hard to make ends meet with rural footfall and, if those facilities go from those communities, they'll be even worse off,\" he added. \nHe has called for a \"nationwide campaign\" to get people to use their local pools instead of losing them. \nThe age of pools is also a concern for the organisation, with more than half being at least 20 years old and having no investment since they were built. \nA Welsh government spokesman said physical activity would continue to play an important role in helping people to deal with the mental and physical effects of the past 14 months. \n\"That is why we have invested over \u00a340m to support sport and physical activity over the course of the pandemic and are investing an additional \u00a37m this year to provide more modern and accessible facilities,\" he said.\n\"We hope that more people will be able to access these facilities as the public health conditions improve and restrictions are eased.\""

      "tags": "Belarus,European Union",
      "text": "The EU has agreed to ramp up sanctions against Belarus, following the forced landing of a plane flying over its territory.\nOn 21 June, 78 Belarusian individuals and eight entities were added to the list of people and companies under the EU's travel ban and asset freeze.\nThe EU already bans Belarusian carriers from its airspace and airports. \nFurther economic sanctions will be considered by the EU leaders when they meet for a two day summit on 24 June. \nAround 3,300 flights flew over Belarus last week, according to aircraft tracking website Flightradar24, with 660 of those actually landing in the country.\nBelarus receives income from airlines that enter its airspace of up to \u20ac70,000 (\u00a360,000) each day, according to John Grant from the aviation analytics firm OAG.\nLosing this amount of money, he says, would be \"an inconvenience\" but would not have a significant impact on the economy of Belarus. \nInstead of flying over Belarus, airlines have the option of using Lithuanian or Latvian airspace for example, without adding too much time to a flight so the extra fuel costs incurred would not be great. \nMaps showing flight paths show some airlines are now diverting to avoid Belarus.\nOn 27 and 28 May, Russia, a key ally of Belarus, denied entry to its airspace to two European airlines because they planned to avoid flying over Belarus to get to Moscow. \nThe EU leaders will consider further economic sanctions when they meet for a two day summit on 24 June.  \nThe measures are likely to include action against the export of potash (a common fertilizer ingredient) as well as tobacco industry exports and petroleum products.\nBelarus has an estimated 20% of the world's reserves of potash and exports of this are one of its major sources of foreign currency.\nThe EU first introduced restrictive measures against Belarus in 2004, following the disappearance of two opposition politicians, a journalist and a businessman several years earlier. These included an arms embargo and a ban on \"the export of goods linked to internal repression\". \nThe EU imposed more sanctions against Belarus on 1 October 2020, in response to the \"brutality of the Belarusian authorities and in support of the democratic rights of the Belarusian people\". \nThese restrictions - a travel ban and asset freeze against individuals and entities associated with the government of Alexander Lukashenko -  have since been expanded. As of 21 June, the EU applies the restrictions to a total of 166 persons and 15 entities.\nThose on the list are forbidden from entering or transiting through EU territories and their assets in the EU are frozen. In addition, EU citizens and companies are forbidden from making funds available to any individual and company on the list\nThe UK expanded its sanctions on 21 June, by adding another 11 people and two entities to its list. The UK's restrictions now target a total of 99 people and nine organisations.\nThe US Treasury Department also said it was expanding the sanctions against Belarus, targeting 16 Belarus individuals and five entities. \nThe US has had sanctions against Belarus since 2006. These were tightened in 2008 and expanded in October 2020 to 24 individuals, in response to the 9 August presidential election and subsequent crackdown on opposition protests.\nOn 27 May, the G7 group of wealthy nations - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and Britain - issued a statement calling for \"accountability for the actions of the Belarusian authorities\" and threatening \"further sanctions as appropriate\".

      "text": "A 74-year-old man died while waiting 16 hours for an ambulance, an inquest heard.\nJoseph Edge's wife, Carole, called 999 in December 2019, worried about his low blood pressure, the hearing was told.\nThe ambulance service was facing \"unprecedented\" demand at the time and his case was not listed as a \"red\" priority, the inquest in Ruthin heard.\nCall handlers went on to ring every two hours to \"apologise and say they were busy\", said Ms Edge from Denbighshire.\nA post-mortem examination concluded Mr Edge's heart was enlarged and a main artery was blocked.\nDr Brian Rodgers, a Home Office pathologist, said Mr Edge \"could have died at any time\".\n\"A prompter response from the ambulance service may have led to a different outcome but I can't be certain,\" he wrote in a statement.\nElizabeth Dudley Jones, the assistant coroner for North Wales East and Central, concluded Mr Edge died of natural causes.\nShe said that, while patients with similar health problems could die at any time, she felt he was denied the opportunity for medical treatment which may have made a difference.\nGrandfather Mr Edge, a former plumber and mechanic who had retired early after suffering a heart attack and stroke at 48, died at his home in Llandegla.\nThe hearing was told he had fallen the day before and suffered a cut to his head, and a low blood pressure reading prompted his wife to call NHS Direct for advice.\nBut she gave up after several attempts to get through and called an out-of-hours number for their GP surgery and was then advised to dial 999.\nThe inquest in Ruthin was told she initially called for an ambulance at 13:15 GMT and by 17:15 \"they moved him up the list to urgent but they were still very busy\". \n\"The last call I received was around 3:15am,\" said Ms Edge's statement.\nAnticipating the arrival of an ambulance at 05:15 she went upstairs and found her husband \"cold and unresponsive\", she said.\n\"I phoned 999 again and a paramedic arrived within half an hour,\" she said.\n\"I'm very upset and annoyed about what has happened.\"\nThe hearing was told how 999 ambulance calls coded \"red\" had an eight-minute response time target but there was no set time for any other category of calls.\nMr Edge's case was coded as \"green 3\" but the call handler miscategorised the chief complaint, instead of prioritising \"near fainting\" as a main symptom or a \"green 2 category\" which meant the handler asked a different series of questions.\nWelsh Ambulance Service manager Gill Pleming, who gave evidence in person, said that even if he had been correctly categorised he would have been treated the same with priority but he would have received a clinical telephone assessment.\nAll resources were allocated to other incidents or at hospitals with 41 emergency cases being dealt with at 13:27, she said.\nAt 17:42, a clinician reviewed the call and, after hearing Mr Edge's latest blood pressure reading, his call was reprioritised to an urgent \"amber 2\".\nThe hearing was told ambulance service welfare calls continued until 03:33 but resources were still unavailable until a paramedic in a rapid response vehicle attended at 05:55.\nClaire Roche, the Welsh Ambulance Service's executive director of quality and nursing, said: \"We extend our deepest sympathies to Mr Edge's family at what we know will be a sad and difficult time.\n\"We acknowledge the coroner's conclusions and sincerely apologise to Mr Edge's family for what we agree was an unacceptable delay.\n\"We are an organisation committed to learning and will continue to work with the health board to improve our timeliness to respond to people when they need us.\""

      "tags": "Belarus,Greece,Ryanair Belarus flight diversion,Lithuania,Minsk,Alexander Lukashenko,Ryanair,European Union,Air France KLM",
      "text": "Several European airlines have said that they will not fly over Belarus, days after a dissident journalist was arrested on a flight diverted to Minsk.\nUkraine and Poland are stopping all flights to and from the country, while the UK is preventing Belarusian airlines from entering its airspace.\nWestern countries accuse Belarus of hijacking the Ryanair plane carrying journalist Roman Protasevich on Sunday.\nThe Greece-Lithuania flight was rerouted over a supposed bomb threat.\nBelarus authorities on Monday released video of Mr Protasevich that appears to have been recorded under duress.\nHe faces charges related to his reporting of last August's disputed election and subsequent crackdown on mass opposition protests, and has said he fears the death penalty after being placed on a terrorism list.\nBelarus is the only European country that still executes prisoners.\nAt a meeting in Brussels on Monday, the leaders of the 27 European Union member states called for the overflight ban, and promised further economic sanctions. \nOn Tuesday, the Belarusian transport ministry released a transcript of a conversation said to be between an air traffic controller in Minsk and a pilot on Sunday's Ryanair flight. \nAccording to the transcript, which has not been independently verified, Belarus suggested several times that the plane should land in Minsk on \"our recommendation\". \nThis appeared to contradict earlier statements from the Belarusian authorities that said the decision to land was made independently by the pilot.\nAt the Brussels summit, EU leaders told the bloc's airlines not to fly over Belarus.\nThey have also asked member states to suspend operating permits for its national carrier Belavia.\nAir France said it had \"suspended overflights of Belarusian airspace until further notice\". Finnish airline Finnair also announced a ban.\nAir France's Dutch subsidiary KLM, along with German carrier Lufthansa, Scandinavia's SAS and others, announced similar suspensions on Monday.\nSingapore Airlines also said it was rerouting flights to avoid Belarus.\nMeanwhile Polish national airline Lot said it had suspended both overflights and flights to and from Minsk, and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Ukrainian carriers were banned from flying over or into Belarus.\nThe UK, meanwhile, said Belarusian airlines would not be allowed to enter its airspace unless they had specific authorisation. \nBelavia said it was suspending flights to the UK and France until 30 October.\nBelarus, though not in the EU, borders three EU countries. Many flights to and from Asia as well as within Europe use its airspace.\nEarlier on Tuesday, European Council President Charles Michel shared a map of air traffic taken from the flight tracking website Flightradar24 in which there appeared to be no planes in Belarusian airspace. Some flights, however, have continued throughout the day.\nSome 400 flights use Belarusian airspace daily and 100 of these are by EU or UK carriers, according to the European air traffic agency, Eurocontrol. It has urged the airlines concerned to reroute through nearby countries.\n\"Frightening Lukashenko with sanctions is doomed to failure,\" declared one Russian newspaper this morning. \"It only eggs him on.\" \nThen the character analysis: \"He's cultivated the image of a thuggish hooligan.\" \nIt begs the question - can sanctions change a \"hooligan's\" behaviour? Previous attempts have failed. European leaders clearly felt that after the fake bomb scare, the diversion of Ryanair Flight 4978 to Minsk and the arrest of a political opponent on board, they needed to send a strong message that such a brazen act was unacceptable. Hence the new sanctions. It's unclear, though, how effective they will be. \nBanning Belarusian airlines from flying over EU territory and calling on EU-based carriers to avoid Belarusian airspace is a financial blow to Minsk. \nBut Mr Lukashenko will almost certainly use this as an excuse to say to those around him - and to the Belarusian people - \"Look, I told you so. The West is out to destroy Belarus, if not with bullets, then with sanctions.\" He will use it to batten down the hatches even more tightly in the face of an alleged external enemy. \nMight there come a point when those around the leader pause to consider where Belarus is heading - its isolation, the economic consequences of Mr Lukashenko's policies, not to mention the brutality of the crackdown on his opponents? \nAs long as Moscow is backing him, Mr Lukashenko will feel confident of riding things out. \nBelarus sent a fighter jet to force Ryanair flight FR4978 - which had departed from the Greek capital, Athens, and was bound for Vilnius in Lithuania - to land, claiming there was a bomb threat. It touched down in the capital Minsk at 13:16 local time (10:16 GMT) on Sunday.\nPolice then took Mr Protasevich away when the plane's 126 passengers disembarked. The activist, who witnesses said was \"super scared\", was arrested along with his girlfriend Sofia Sapega. \nThe incident has drawn sharp condemnation from across the world, with countries urging the immediate release of Mr Protasevich and a full investigation.\nMs Sapega's mother told the BBC that the 23-year-old had been taken to a Minsk jail, adding that the last word she managed to write on her WhatsApp messaging account was 'Mummy'. The accusations against her are unclear.\n\"I don't know what they can charge her with. For going on holiday with Roman Protasevich? It's his life. What he does is exclusively his choice,\" she said.\nBelarus said the flight had been diverted because of a bomb threat from the Palestinian militant group Hamas.\nBut Hamas has denied any involvement. German leader Chancellor Angela Merkel said the Belarusian claim was \"completely implausible\".\nDozens of Belarusian officials, including President Alexander Lukashenko, are already under EU sanctions including travel bans and asset freezes, imposed in response to the repression on opponents.\nThe 66-year-old leader has cracked down on dissenting voices since winning a disputed election last August. Many opposition figures have been arrested, while others fled into exile.\nOn Tuesday Belarus sentenced seven activists including senior opposition figure Pavel Severinets, to terms of four to seven years for their part in last year's protests, reports say.\nMr Protasevich is a former editor of Nexta, a media operation with a Telegram channel. He left Belarus in 2019 to live in exile in Lithuania. From there he covered the events of the 2020 presidential election, after which he was charged with terrorism and inciting riots.\nNexta played a key role for the opposition during the vote. It has continued to do so in its aftermath, particularly with the government imposing news blackouts.\nMr Protasevich now works for a different Telegram channel, Belamova. \nIn the video clip released after his arrest, he said he was in good health and seemingly confessed to crimes he had been charged with by the Belarusian state. \nBut activists, including the country's main opposition leader, criticised the video and suggested Mr Protasevich was under pressure to admit wrongdoing.\nMr Protasevich's father has told the BBC he fears his son may be tortured.\nDmitri Protasevich said on Monday he was \"really afraid\" of how his son would be treated by the authorities in his home country.\nWhere is Belarus? It has its ally Russia to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.\nWhy does it matter? Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Lukashenko has been nicknamed \"Europe's last dictator\" - he has been in power for 27 years.\nWhat's going on there? There is a huge opposition movement demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. The opposition movement and Western governments say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election. Officially he won by a landslide. A huge police crackdown has curbed street protests and sent opposition leaders to prison or into exile."

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Rob Roberts,Delyn",
      "text": "An MP who was accused of multiple allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards parliamentary staff is facing no further action from his party.\nThe Conservatives said they had \"strongly rebuked\" Delyn's Rob Roberts for his \"unacceptable\" conduct.\nBut a woman who Mr Roberts had asked to \"fool around\" with him said it was like \"he's gotten away with it\".\nShe said he should have had the whip removed. The party said it did not take decisions on the whip.\nMr Roberts was asked to comment.\nThe female former intern told BBC Wales: \"It's not one incident but multiple and he's a threat to our safety.\n\"He's gotten away with it, and that's not acceptable.\"\nShe added that the outcome of the party's investigation brought \"the morals and values of the Conservative Party under scrutiny if they are unwilling to stand up against sexual harassment and stand on the side of women - especially in the current climate.\" \nShe also criticised their decision of \"keeping him within the party and giving such a minimal punishment\".\nThe intern claimed that \"at no point\" was she contacted as part of the Conservative Party's investigation.\nRemoving the whip means that an MP is thrown out of their party.\nIn response, the Conservative party said it does not make decisions on the whip and that no official complaint was received by the party from anyone who claims to have been sexually harassed. \nIt added that complaints made to the party were not directly from individuals involved, but came from third parties.\nLabour and Liberal Democrat politicians had previously called for the Conservative Party to remove his party whip.\nMr Roberts was warned about future conduct by the party's co-chairman and was instructed to do safeguarding and social media training. \nIn July, messages seen by BBC Wales showed Mr Roberts inviting a 21-year-old female intern who was working in Parliament to \"fool around\" with him.\nThe intern had told BBC Wales the messages had made her feel \"really vulnerable\".\nHe also admitted asking out another House of Commons employee, which led them to move position.\nAt least two complaints were made about Mr Roberts to Parliament's independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS). \nThe Conservative Party had said the MP's conduct was completely unacceptable and launched a party investigation into his behaviour. \nOn Thursday evening, a Conservative Party spokesperson said: \"The investigation into Rob Roberts has concluded. \n\"Rob Roberts' conduct was found to be unacceptable under the party's code of conduct and he has been strongly rebuked.\n\"Mr Roberts has apologised for his behaviour and was instructed to undertake safeguarding and social media protection training.\" \nThe party have said complaints about Mr Roberts were examined by a panel constituted under the party's code of conduct, which was chaired by an independent QC. \nMr Roberts was elected as the Conservative MP for Delyn in north Wales in December 2019.\nHis seat was a gain from Labour in the so-called Red Wall and had been previously held by Labour MP David Hanson since 1992.\nLast year, the MP said he recognised the request to ask the staffer out \"was inappropriate\" but had not commented on the messages sent to the intern."

      "tags": "Asia,Yoga,India,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Doctors in India have hit out against yoga guru Baba Ramdev over his controversial statements against modern medicine. \nHe recently said that tens of thousands died of Covid after taking modern medicines and mocked patients for trying to get oxygen cylinders.\nThe guru withdrew his statement after the health minister criticised him. \nBut he again took a swipe at modern medicine on Monday for not having a cure for some diseases. \nModern, science-based medicine is the backbone of India's healthcare systems, but alternative therapies like ayurveda and homoeopathy are also hugely popular. Many gurus like Ramdev have launched successful businesses on the back of selling herbal medicines and products.\nIndia also has a Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (Ayush) to promote traditional systems.\nThe Indian Medical Association (IMA), an organisation that represents doctors in India, has criticised the guru for his \"insensitive\" remarks in the middle of the pandemic.\nDoctors the BBC spoke to said such statements from a guru with millions of followers were \"irresponsible and demoralising\".\nA video of Baba Ramdev mocking patients for trying to find oxygen went viral earlier this month. \nIt's not clear when he made the statement, but he is heard making references to oxygen shortages in several cities in April and May.\n\"God has given us free oxygen, why don't we breathe that? How can there be a shortage when God has filled the atmosphere with oxygen? Fools are looking for oxygen cylinders. Just breathe the free oxygen. Why are you complaining about shortage of oxygen and beds and crematoriums?\" he said.\nThe statement drew sharp criticism from doctors and families of Covid patients who demanded an apology. \nTwo weeks later, another video emerged in which he can be heard criticising doctors and blaming Covid deaths on them.\nMany doctors took to Twitter to express their anger. Some even demanded his arrest.  \nAs pressure grew, India's Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, who is also a doctor, issued a statement, asking the guru to withdraw his remarks.\n\"Allopathy [modern medicine] and the doctors attached to it have given new lives to millions of people. It's very unfortunate for you to say that people died from consuming allopathic medicines. \n\"We should not forget that this battle can only be won through united efforts. In this war, our doctors, nurses and other health workers are risking their lives to save people's lives. Their dedication towards serving mankind in this crisis is unparalleled and exemplary.\" \nOn Sunday, Baba Ramdev withdrew his controversial statement in a tweet. But a day later, he issued a letter asking the IMA why modern medicine had no cure for 25 diseases, including diabetes and hypertension. \nThis has again infuriated doctors. Prominent pulmonologist Dr A Fathahudeen, who has treated thousands of Covid patients, told the BBC that such statements cause lasting damage.\n\"For more than a year, healthcare workers like me have been in a war-like situation. We have saved tens of thousand of lives. It's really unfortunate, insulting and hurtful to read such statements,\" he said.\nDr Fathahudeen added that modern medicine had evolved over the years with constant research and studies. \"We follow evidence-based practice. At any given time, thousands of researchers are working to come up with cures. Look at the progress we have made in cancer treatment. We have to constantly evolve and learn. It's hard to trust any branch of medicine that offers absolute cure for every disease.\"\nHe also added that such statements create doubts in the mind of people when we need to have trust in medicines and vaccines in the middle of a raging pandemic.  \nHe shot to fame because of his televised yoga classes. Millions followed him and he received praise across the world for promoting yoga and healthy living.\nIn 2006, he helped launch Patanjali Ayurveda to sell herbal medicines and a few years later, the business expanded to selling almost everything, from flour, jeans, soaps, oils, biscuits and even cow urine from stores in even the remotest corners of the country. He was successful in translating his popularity into building a business empire. \nThe expansion of his business also coincided with the Hindu nationalist BJP coming to power in 2014.\nBaba Ramdev has openly supported both the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and even campaigned for the party. \nPatanjali Ayurveda launched Coronil - a combination of herbs used in traditional Indian medicine - in June last year and claimed that it could cure Covid. \nBut marketing of the product as Covid medicine had to stop after the government said there was no data to show it worked as a treatment. But it didn't ban Coronil, and said that it could be sold as an \"immunity booster\".\nThen in February, Patanjali supporters claimed that Coronil had been approved by the WHO - prompting it to issue a denial:\nDr Vardhan was criticised for attending an event with Baba Ramdev in February where claims about Coronil as a cure for Covid were repeated.\nCoronil was also found selling in some stores in the UK which led to the drug regulator there saying no such drug was authorised. \nIn 2018, Baba Ramdev launched a messaging app calling it \"a home-grown rival to WhatsApp\", but it was soon removed from app stores amid a furore over security flaws."

      "text": "Elliot Page has won praise for posing bare-chested for the first time since coming out as trans in December.\nAn Instagram post shared by the actor showed him smiling while posing in a pool in swimming shorts alongside the words #transjoy and #transisbeautiful.\nPage, 34, previously described his top surgery - where breast tissue is removed - as \"life-saving\".\nSpeaking to Oprah Winfrey last month he said it made him \"feel comfortable\" in his body \"for probably the first time\".\nThe Umbrella Academy star tearfully explained why his chest had brought him the \"most joy\" in transitioning.\n\"It's getting out of the shower and the towel's around your waist and you're looking at yourself in the mirror and you're just like, 'There I am'. And I'm not having the moment where I'm panicked,\" he said during the Apple TV interview.\nPage's Instagram post has already received over two million likes and a wave of supportive celebrity comments praising his new appearance.\n\"Dude I see why you crushed me on that workout!\" actor Justin Cornwell commented. \"Hot\" added singer Miley Cyrus, alongside a heart emoji. \nThe Vampire Diaries' Nina Dobrev said: \"You look amazing\u2026 and most of all happy.\" Julianne Moore, who starred with Page in the film Freeheld, wrote: \"Happy summer\" accompanied by a flame emoji.\nThe Good Place star Jameela Jamil also posted in recognition, tweeting that she was pleased to see Page \"thriving\".\nWinfrey, meanwhile, shared her support by reposting the image on the Oprah Daily Instagram account.\n\"This is what happiness looks like!\" she wrote. \"Looks like Elliot will be shining brighter than the sun this summer.\"\nPage, a prominent LGBT advocate, also used the pair's April interview to reveal how the surgery had given him a new energy in fighting for trans rights, \"because it is such a freeing, freeing experience\".\n\"Not only has it been life-changing for me, I do believe it's been life-saving and it's the case for so many people. And because there is such an attack on trans healthcare right now, when already there's such lack of access,\" he continued. \nPage was referring to laws in Arkansas and further legal fights across the US threatening to ban young transgender people from accessing certain medical treatments.\nKirrin Medcalf, Trans Community Engagement Lead at LGBT charity Stonewall, said the photo emphasised the positive impact that gender affirmation procedures can have upon a person's mental health.\n\"It's fantastic to see Elliot looking so comfortable and happy in his latest photo. Elliot's has always been a role model to a huge number of people, and it is wonderful that he can share his trans joy with the world. \n\"Seeing moments of gender euphoria also highlights how important it is for all trans people to be able to access appropriate and timely gender affirming healthcare,\" he said. \nFelix, 20 (He/Him):\n\"Looking at Elliot's image, it makes me feel proud to see another trans person - especially a celebrity in the public eye - proudly showing off their top surgery scars, as it increases a wider scope of positivity. \n\"However, as a person who has had to delay surgery due to the unbearable waiting times on the NHS, it makes me frustrated that people with more money and resources - such as celebrities - do not have to struggle in the same ways as people relying on state healthcare. \n\"In the UK, it can often up to 10 years, if not longer, to fully medically transition. We should not have to wait this long to feel comfortable in ourselves. \n\"I have been waiting to medically transition since I was 14. I am 20 now and haven't got anywhere. I am now planning to go to Poland after crowdsourcing funds to complete the surgery privately. I should not have to be at such inconvenience in order to be myself.\n\"That said, I think the wider impact of Elliot's post is good, as long as we keep having this conversation about privilege and how it plays into securing a medical transition. With each celebration of Elliot's visibility, I hope people will recognise those relying on personal crowdfunds.\"\nPage, who is Canadian-born, made his film breakthrough starring as a pregnant teenager in 2007's Juno - landing an Oscar nomination.\nOther major films include Inception and the X-Men series, before most recently starring as Vanya Hargreeves in Netflix superhero show Umbrella Academy.\nPage came out as gay in 2014, telling an audience in Las Vegas: \"I am tired of hiding and I am tired of lying by omission.\" After three years of marriage he announced his divorce from choreographer Emma Portner in February.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Monkton,Newton Stewart,Kilmarnock",
      "text": "A former prison officer has been convicted of murdering his friend and dumping her naked body in a forest.\nRoss Willox, 42, killed Emma Faulds, 39, after a party at his house in Monkton, South Ayrshire, in April 2019.\nHe went to elaborate lengths to cover his tracks but Ms Faulds' body was found six weeks later in the Galloway Forest, Dumfries and Galloway.\nThe discovery followed a massive search of the remote area, which was narrowed down by CCTV and mobile phone analysis.\nEmma's family wept as the verdict was delivered at the High Court in Glasgow.\nLord Mulholland told Willox he had committed \"a foul crime on a young woman loved by her family\".\n\"You would have visited upon them a lifetime of wondering if she was still alive had her body not been recovered as a result of the sterling work by the police and experts,\" added the judge.\nWillox, who had denied murder, will be sentenced next month.\nDespite the guilty verdict, it is still not known why he killed Emma - or how she died.\nPolice Scotland said there was nothing in his background to suggest he was capable of such a crime. \nDet Insp Peter Crombie, of the force's major investigation team, said: \"He would appear, on the face of it, to be an ordinary guy who led an ordinary life.\"\nEmma and Willox became friends when they worked together as prison wardens at HMP Kilmarnock.\nDetectives said the pair, who had a platonic relationship, had agreed to meet at his house for a party on Sunday 28 April 2019.\nEmma had told her parents of her plans, and confided to her sister Miriam that she was \"going to have a bit of a mad one\".\nAt about 20:00 Emma messaged a friend from Willox's home in Fairfield Park, Monkton, to say she planned to have a few drinks and stay over.\nA witness also told the jury he drove a drug dealer friend to the house after receiving a text from Emma at 23:30 asking for cocaine.\nWilliam Beattie said the door had been opened by a large man wearing a coat, and that as he drove away from the house he saw Emma sitting on a couch.\n\"I waved and she waved back,\" he said.\nEmma was usually in frequent contact with her loved ones, and her phone was described as \"an extension of her arm\".\nBut no-one heard from her the following day.\nHer mother, Margaret, said this was \"totally out of character\".\n\"She was in touch every day. My husband and I knew something was wrong.\"\nThe couple were visiting relatives in Brighton when they raised the alarm on 30 April.\nMrs Faulds had earlier received a call from Emma's employers at Kibble School in Paisley, Renfrewshire, saying she had not turned up for work.\n\"We were on edge and decided to report her missing because it was so unlike her,\" her father Ian told the trial.\nAt about 16:30 that day police officers broke in to Emma's flat in Fullerton Street, Kilmarnock, and discovered that her pet dog Maverick, who had been heard crying by a neighbour, was home alone.\nFriend Nicholas Wyper, told the jury: \"Maverick was her baby. Maverick never got left himself - ever.\"\nAs the last person to see her alive, Willox became the immediate focus of the investigation, codenamed Operation Solzen.\nHe told officers that Emma had decided to drive back to her flat, which was less than nine miles away, at about 23:00. \nHe said he joined her for the journey, and later took about a dozen lines of cocaine.\nWillox said Emma was \"positive and upbeat and enjoying herself. She was talking about her forthcoming 40th and talking about a cruise\".\nHe claimed to have gone home in a taxi at about 07:00 on 29 April.\nThe trial heard he twice called the police for updates on the case and gave different accounts to Emma's sister, Sarah, about how she left his home in Monkton.\nEmma's car was critical to the timeline. Footage from a dash-cam revealed the blue BMW 1 series was parked outside Willox's house at 17:39 on April 28.\nBut at about 07:25 the following day Emma's neighbour told the jury he saw a man driving the vehicle in Fullerton Street, Kilmarnock.\nThe driver was also captured on private CCTV wiping down the interior of the car, including the steering wheel and the dashboard. Willox's DNA was later found on a seat lever.\nThe jury heard Willox did not join Emma's family and friends when they put up posters and distributed leaflets around Ayrshire after she was reported missing.\nMiriam said she thought that was \"strange\", adding: \"Why would he not be trying to find her?\"\nAs the search for Emma intensified, experts began to plot Willox's movements using CCTV and cell site analysis of his mobile phones.\nThey also examined his background and discovered he used to build wind farms near the Galloway Forest, in Dumfries and Galloway.\nThis became critical when cameras picked up two journeys to the area in the days following Emma's disappearance.\nThe first, on 29 April, was made in his Mercedes SUV. The following day he made the trip in a Jaguar he bought for his wife, who was working abroad when Emma vanished.\nA police dog trained in the scent of dead bodies later gave a \"positive indication\" during the search of the car, by repeatedly barking at the boot area.\nCCTV footage was discovered showing Willox going into various shops in Ayr and buying bleach, rubber gloves and tins of outdoor disinfectant.\nDet Insp Crombie said: \"When we put all those pieces of evidence together it painted a suspicious picture of Ross Willox's movements.\"\nPolice drafted in search experts from the UK National Crime Agency, as well as an officer who had worked as a wind farm liaison and had intimate knowledge of the area.\nThe Galloway Forest Park covers around 300 square miles and Det Insp Crombie said some parts look \"like the surface of the moon\".\nDigital forensic experts examined the cell site analysis from Willox's phones and overlaid it with the CCTV, which had been recovered from the routes he took in the 48 hours after Emma vanished.\nAs a result, they were able to narrow the search area down to between 10 and 15 square miles.\nWillox was under surveillance when he was arrested at his mother's house on 8 May on suspicion of Emma's murder.\nThe circumstantial case also featured internet searches he had made on his best friend's iPad. These included \"can cars be traced by GPS?\" and \"can UK police trace your car without a warrant?\"\nOn 12 June, six weeks after Emma disappeared, her naked body was found in Glentrool Forest, east of Loch Moan.\nThe discovery was made by Det Con Ben Pacholek and his dog Bear, who had walked more than 200 miles during the inquiry.\nDet Insp Crombie said the hairs on the back of his neck stood up when he got the call to say that Emma's body had been found.\n\"It was quite an emotional moment,\" he added.\nA pathologist was unable to confirm how Emma died due to the \"degree of decomposition\".\nBut the jury was told that soil found on boots owned by Willox was a 92% match for mud at the remote spot where the body was recovered.\nProsecutor Paul Kearney told the jury Willox had made a \"determined attempt to create a false narrative to conceal and destroy evidence\". \nDet Insp Crombie described the killer as \"a selfish, arrogant monster\" and said he compounded the agony of Emma's loved ones by failing to admit his crime.\nHe added: \"They are still heartbroken and I know they miss her terribly every day. To put her family through that is unforgivable.\"\nIn a statement released after the guilty verdict, Emma's family said: \"We are absolutely devastated by Emma's death and her not being with us has left a tremendous void in all our lives.\n\"We cannot believe she was taken from us in such a violent way and what makes it even worse is that Ross Willox was supposed to be her friend.\n\"The court case has been arduous and hearing about what happened that night has been harrowing, but we are thankful that Willox has been found guilty and he will have to live forever with the consequences of his actions.\"\nWHO KILLED EMMA?

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic,Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board",
      "text": "There were Covid deaths in only four local authority areas in Wales, latest weekly figures show.\nThe number of deaths involving Covid-19 was six in the week up to 14 May, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). \nThis is up from five registered in the previous week but the figures in this period are the lowest we have seen since early September. \nThese accounted for 0.9% of all deaths.\nThe trend has been for a steady decline and is 88% fewer Covid deaths than registered two months ago. \nDuring the latest week, up to 14 May, there were no deaths in 18 out of Wales' local authority areas, including across the Aneurin Bevan, Cardiff and Vale, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas. \nWhen broken down by local authority area, there were two deaths in Swansea hospitals, two deaths in Bridgend - in a hospital and at home - and also a hospital death involving a Flintshire resident and another involving a Rhondda Cynon Taf care home resident.\nSo-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths from all causes with previous years, were 28 deaths (4.6%) above the five-year average, after being below normal for 10 successive weeks. \nLooking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at particular periods of a typical year is seen as a good measure of the pandemic. \nThe number of deaths from all causes in Wales rose to 640 in the week ending 14 May. The ONS urged caution in interpretation because the Early May Bank Holiday may have affected registrations.\nAll nations and regions of the UK saw above average deaths, with the West Midlands the highest proportion of excess deaths. \nWhen looking across the course of the pandemic so far, there have been 44,826 deaths from all causes in Wales, 7,878 (17.6%) mentioning Covid-19 on the death certificate. This was 5,529 deaths above the five-year average. \nWhen deaths occurring up to 14 May but counting later registrations are included, the total number of deaths involving Covid rises to 7,880. \nPublic Health Wales gives a daily snapshot of deaths being reported to it by health boards. This only includes deaths in hospitals and in some care homes but it only counts people who have tested positive for Covid.\nCurrently, there is a daily average of one death a day in Wales, by this measure.\nThe ONS figures take a few weeks to compile because they look at death certificates, signed by doctors and registered by families. \nBut they are regarded as giving the more complete picture.\nAs well as all hospital and care home deaths, they also include deaths in people's homes, hospices and other community settings.\nDoctors include Covid when they believe in their medical opinion it was suspected or confirmed and that it was a contributory cause of death.\nAcross England and Wales, Covid was the underlying cause of death in 71% of cases when it was mentioned on the death certificate in the latest week, so we can say the death was due to Covid."

      "tags": "Bolton,Bedford,North Tyneside Council,Leicester,Coronavirus testing,North Shields,Blackburn,Hounslow,Burnley,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Ministers have backtracked over travel advice for eight areas worst hit by the Indian virus variant, after a change in guidance led to widespread confusion.\nThe amended advice asks people to minimise travel into and out of Bolton, Blackburn, Kirklees, Bedford, Burnley, Leicester, Hounslow and North Tyneside.\nEarlier advice had asked people to avoid non-essential travel altogether.\nDowning Street has admitted it caused \"confusion\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman said: \"We've updated the guidance online to make it clearer that these are not local restrictions and we do acknowledge the confusion this caused [on Tuesday].\"\nIt came as Mr Johnson's former chief adviser Dominic Cummings gave evidence to a joint Commons committee hearing on key government decisions during the pandemic.\nMany people cancelled plans at short notice after it emerged on Monday that advice specifically for the eight areas had been published the previous week without any government announcement, which included asking people to avoid non-essential travel.\nThe new advice - updated on Tuesday evening - asks people in the affected areas to meet outdoors and stay two metres apart from anyone in other households, wherever those things are possible.\nThat advice also refers people to their local authorities' Covid guidance and says anyone travelling to red or amber list countries should arrange \"a testing or managed quarantine package\".\nShadow foreign secretary and MP for Wigan Lisa Nandy said people in many areas had \"stopped listening\" to official advice and that confused messaging had undermined public trust.\n\"We woke up on Monday morning to find apparently that guidance had been in force on the government's website since Friday, telling us not to move in and out of affected areas but nobody had bothered to tell us,\" she said.\nShe said that \"to treat us as an afterthought on a government website is to treat people's lives with absolute contempt.\"\nDr Bharat Pankhania, an infectious disease expert who advises local authorities on health plans, said confusion was leading to a fall in cooperation from the public.\nHe told Radio 4's Today programme that \"when people like us in local authorities start changing the game plan or do things without really explaining our actions, they stop eventually listening to us.\"\nAmong those considering cancelling plans as a result was Julie Suttar, from Aberdeen, who  told the BBC on Tuesday that she had booked a non-refundable hotel in Leicester to visit family she had not seen for more than a year.\n\"I can't believe it, I've been on the phone to my sister, in tears. Where's this come from? Where's the notice?\" she asked.\nThe uncertainty prompted a swift denial from Downing Street that it was imposing local lockdowns by stealth.\nThat came after several of the local authorities affected by the new advice said they had not been consulted about it - and only learned of its existence from journalists.\nIt has become an accepted fact that public health messaging during the pandemic needs to be clear and concise.  \nOn that test, government communications to people in the eight identified hotspot areas in England failed in recent days.  \nPeople in most of those communities were simply unaware of tighter new guidelines posted on the government website on a Friday afternoon. \nWhen they emerged late on Monday evening there was understandable frustration with the suggestion that people should not leave their council areas unless for essential reasons. \nThen it took nearly 24 hours for officials to clarify and amend the guidelines to simply minimising travel. \nThe row will blow over but it raises bigger long-term questions. \nMinisters say they want to shift from legal restrictions to public guidance as the roadmap progresses in England - in other words not using the law to dictate behaviour but giving the public enough information to allow them to moderate their own behaviour.  \nThis sounds fine in theory but recent events in the hotspot areas reveal the potential risks of this approach.  \nFailure to provide clarity on what people can or cannot do at a time of uncertainty might potentially cause confusion and frustration - the opposite of what is intended.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, local councils for the eight areas - which together represent more than two million people - emerged from a meeting with government officials and insisted there were no restrictions on travel in their areas and \"no local lockdowns\".\nThey said they were working to increase vaccination and testing - with Kirklees the latest area to announce door-to-door testing - as well as to support people self-isolating.\nGreater Manchester's Labour mayor Andy Burnham said the confusion over the advice was a \"major communications error\" which had a \"major effect on people's lives\".\nNorma Redfearn, Labour mayor of North Tyneside, said \"after a day of confusion\" it had been confirmed the area was \"at the same stage of the road map as the rest of the country\".\nOverall cases of Covid are at their highest rate for six months in Bolton, at 452.1 cases per 100,000 people.\nThe original guidance, published on a page titled \"what you can and cannot do\", advised people in the eight areas of England to meet outside where possible and avoid travelling in and out unless essential.\nIt was first published on 14 May to cover Bolton, Blackburn with Darwen and Bedford, before being updated, without an announcement, to include the six other areas on Friday.\nEfforts to contain the virus come as people aged 30 and 31 in England are being invited to book an appointment to receive their first dose of Covid vaccine.\nThe NHS is urging these million or so to take up the offer of a jab at one of the 1,600 available locations, including mosques, museums and rugby grounds, as well as pharmacies.\nNearly three-quarters of adults in the UK have already had one dose, and more than two-fifths have had two.\nOn Tuesday, the UK reported 15 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test and 2,493 new confirmed cases. Figures for reported deaths early in the week are sometimes higher due to weekend reporting delays."

      "text": "George Floyd's sister has boycotted a meeting with US President Joe Biden, saying he \"broke a promise\" to enact police reform legislation by the anniversary of her brother's death.\nWhile Bridgett Floyd attended a rally in Minneapolis, Minnesota, other family members lobbied Mr Biden at the White House to help pass the bill.\nThe George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is stalled on Capitol Hill.\nOn Tuesday cities in the US and abroad marked a year since Floyd's death.\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted last month of the murder of Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, after kneeling on his neck area for more than nine minutes as he was detained on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill. He faces up to 40 years in prison when sentenced on 25 June.\nMr Biden had set Tuesday as a deadline for signing police reform legislation.\nAfter meeting the president and Vice-President Kamala Harris at the White House, Floyd's brother, Philonise, told reporters: \"If you can make federal laws to protect the bird which is the bald eagle, then you can make federal laws to protect people of colour.\"\nFloyd's other brother, Terrence, said it had been \"a very productive conversation\" in the Oval Office.\nBut Bridgett Floyd - who instead held a moment of silence at a \"Celebration of Life\" event in a downtown Minneapolis park - explained why she did not go to Washington.\n\"I was going to DC for Biden to sign a bill,\" she said. \"Biden has not signed that bill. Biden has broke a promise.\"\nShe added a message for the president: \"Get your people in order.\"\nAfter meeting the Floyd family, the president issued a statement pledging to keep supporting the legislation.\n\"The battle for the soul of America has been a constant push and pull between the American ideal that we're all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart,\" the president said. \"At our best, the American ideal wins out. It must again.\"\nWhile Mr Biden, a Democrat, has led the way in publicly lobbying for passage of infrastructure and coronavirus stimulus bills, he has left much of the negotiations over police reform to lawmakers on Capitol Hill.\n\"We have been respecting the space needed for negotiators to have these discussions,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday as she declined to offer a new deadline for reaching an agreement.\nBut activists said Mr Biden needed to do more to help pass the bill.\n\"The president will need to step up to make sure we get it across the finish line,\" Judith Browne Dianis, executive director of the Advancement Project, a racial justice organisation, told AP news agency.\nSenate Democrats last June blocked a police reform bill proposed by a black Republican senator, Tim Scott of South Carolina. They argued it did not go far enough.\nNow Senate Republicans oppose a police reform bill passed in March by House of Representatives Democrats, the main stumbling block being its provision to make it easier for individual police officers to be sued and charged with crimes.\nMr Biden has also been pressed by Black Lives Matter and other activists to stop military equipment being supplied to police forces.\nOn the campaign trail last year, he called for the US to \"stop transferring weapons of war to police forces\".\nBut despite calls from House Democrats to issue an executive order to that effect, the White House has not acted.\nLegal cases surrounding Floyd's murder continue, meanwhile. \nEarlier in May a federal grand jury charged four ex-police officers - Alexander Keung, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, as well as Chauvin - with violating Floyd's civil rights. \nChauvin's defence team has requested a new trial, accusing both prosecutors and jurors of misconduct. \nIn New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio joined civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton in kneeling in silence for nine minutes and 29 seconds - the time that Chauvin knelt on Floyd.\nAcross the country, demonstrators gathered for a Black Lives Matter protest near City Hall in Los Angeles.\nAnd in Minneapolis, many gathered at the intersection where Floyd took his last breaths, which has been turned into a memorial site.\nEvents at \"George Floyd Square\" were briefly interrupted by gunfire. One person was reported injured as at least 20 rounds were fired.\nMinneapolis has been struggling with rising gun violence in the past year as nearly 200 officers in the city police department have resigned or gone on leave. A six-year-old girl was among those fatally shot in recent weeks.\nThere were also commemorative events on Tuesday for Floyd overseas. \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters his death was a \"tragedy\" and vowed to take more action in Canada to tackle racism.\nVigils and demonstrations also took place in cities across the UK, including Birmingham, Edinburgh, London, Manchester and Swansea.

      "tags": "Belarus,Minsk,Alexander Lukashenko,Air travel",
      "text": "Passengers on board a Ryanair flight from Athens have described their panic after they changed course on Sunday with no explanation.\nFlight FR4978 was nearing its final destination of Vilnius, Lithuania when it was suddenly forced to divert to Minsk.\nThe plane was accompanied by a fighter jet that had been scrambled to guide it to the Belarusian capital.\nSoon after its arrival, Belarus arrested one of the passengers - a dissident journalist called Roman Protasevich.\nBelarus has said the plane was diverted because of a bomb threat onboard. But after a search in Minsk, no explosives were found on the flight.\nIn the moments before all of this erupted, those onboard said everything had been calm and nothing appeared out of the ordinary.\nThe plane was flying over Belarus and had started making its gradual descent to Vilnius.\nSuddenly, the flight made an abrupt change of course, with no explanation from the captain.\n\"We all on the plane had panicked because we thought we were going to crash,\" Lithuanian passenger Raselle Grigoryeva told broadcaster ABC News. \n\"This was a sudden dive, changing the altitude very drastically. It was very violent. I've never felt this on an airplane. Everybody was in shock,\" she said.\nIt would be 15 minutes before the captain gave any sort of explanation over the intercom: they were being diverted east, to Minsk.\nOne person on the flight seemed especially panicked: Roman Protasevich.\nThe 26-year-old is a former editor of Nexta, a media operation with a Telegram channel. He left Belarus in 2019 to live in exile in Lithuania. From there he covered the events of the 2020 Belarus presidential election, after which he was charged with terrorism and inciting riots.\nA Lithuanian passenger, named only as Mantas, told Reuters news agency that the moment the pilot announced the diversion, Mr Protasevich stood up and opened an overhead locker containing his luggage.\n\"[He] took the luggage, and was trying to split things, like the computer he gave to his girlfriend,\" Mantas said. \"I think he made a mistake. There were plenty of people so he could give the things to me or other passengers and not the girlfriend, who was also, I think, arrested.\"\nAfter they touched down in Belarus, the plane was surrounded by Belarusian officials, fire crews and airport workers.\nBy this time, passengers were still unaware of the alleged bomb threat. One of those onboard, Saulius Danauskas, told news outlet Delfi that, in retrospect, it was clear the threat was some kind of ruse.\n\"People were standing around the plane doing nothing, looking pleased with themselves\" said Mr Danauskas.\n\"They didn't let us out for half an hour,\" he added. \"If there was a bomb on the plane, why would they not let us out?\".\nThose onboard were later told to descend in groups of five with their luggage, which was checked by officials. \nAn unnamed passenger told Delfi that Mr Protasevich was trembling when he left the plane, with officers around him \"all the time\". \n\"We asked him what was going on... he said: 'The death penalty awaits me here.'\"\nOthers described how Mr Protasevich had immediately identified himself to officers, who then appeared to confiscate his passport.\nMr Protasevich's luggage was checked with sniffer dogs, according to Mantas, before he was escorted to the airport terminal.\nAnother passenger told Reuters news agency that officers had used physical force when arresting the journalist, and that Mr Protasevich appeared \"super-scared\".\n\"I looked at him directly into his eyes and he was very sad,\" the passenger said.\nThe remaining passengers were kept at Minsk airport for hours as their luggage and paperwork were checked. \nSome only learned about the bomb threat after searching for information on the internet.\n\"There was no clear understanding of what was going on,\" said one passenger, Alyona Alymova, in a Facebook post.\nSoon afterwards, the plane and its remaining passengers resumed their journey to Vilnius, and finally arrived at 18:26 GMT.\n\"I want to see who will be responsible for this chaos,\" said one passenger in an Instagram post."

      "text": "Hundreds of women forced into giving up their babies for adoption in the 1950s, 60s and 70s have called on the prime minister to issue a government apology.\nUp to 250,000 women in Britain were coerced into handing over their babies because they were unmarried.\nMany of the women never had more children and say the loss caused them to lead a lifetime of grief.\nThey want the UK to follow Australia, which in 2013 was the first country to apologise for forced adoptions.\n\"It was the most shameful thing that could happen,\" says Jill Killington from Leeds. \nShe became pregnant in 1967, aged 16, and says being an unmarried mother \"was described as a fate worse than death\". \nShe recalls having to stay upstairs at her home to hide her growing tummy, so she was out of sight when anyone visited. \n\"My mother asked me to wear a wedding ring when I went out. It was a deeply humiliating time,\" she says. \nVeronica Smith became pregnant in 1965 while working as a nurse at a Butlin's Holiday Camp in Bognor Regis in West Sussex.  \nThe chilling reality of her situation hit home when she broke the news to her mother. \n\"My mother told me if my father found out it would kill him, so I never told him, ever.\"  \nInstead, Veronica was secretly sent to a mother and baby home in a part of London not far from her parents' house and she would meet up with her mother on Wimbledon railway station every Saturday. \n\"She would bring a blank airmail envelope and I would write a letter saying I was in Spain enjoying work and life. She would then take the letter home and show it to my father, who believed I was in Spain.\" \nLawyers examining the birth mothers' cases have focused on the period between 1945 and 1975 - before a change in adoption law - when around 500,000 babies were adopted in Britain, mostly from mothers who were under 24 and unmarried.\nTheir research suggests about half of those women faced sustained pressure to give up their babies from professionals, including doctors, midwives, workers in mother and baby homes and adoption staff in religious and council-run homes.\nAnn Keen was 17 when she became pregnant in 1966 and recalls a particularly cruel moment during the birth of her son. \n\"I wasn't given any pain relief,\" she says. \"The midwife said 'you'll remember this, so you won't be wicked again'.\" \nAnn says she wasn't even given the opportunity to say goodbye to her son. \n\"Eight days after giving birth, I went to the hospital nursery to see him and he wasn't there,\" she says. \n\"The midwife told me 'he's gone. He's in that room over there. They'll be happy and that's the last you'll see of him'.\"\nAnn says: \"It was coercion. The phrase they used was, 'This is for the best' and 'if you really love your baby, you should give him up'.\"\nFor Diana Defries, who was 16 when she became pregnant, it was a different kind of trauma. \nShe says the moment after she gave birth someone in the delivery room announced, \"this baby is flagged for adoption and I'll take her away\".\n\"I yelled to bring her back,\" says Diana. \"But the nurse then just walked past me and put my daughter on a table out of my reach. They all then left the room with just me and my crying baby. All I could croak was 'help me, please'.\n\"At that moment, I remember thinking, it would be better for me to die.\" \nDiana says: \"I do feel my social worker used coercion. The bullying wore me down\". \nTo enable an adoption, the women were supposed to sign consent forms. But some experts have doubts about the legality of some of the consent processes.\u202f \nSolicitor Carolynn Gallwey, who has acted for the birth mothers, says all of those she has spoken to said they had no choice but to sign the consent form.\nShe says there is also evidence to show some mothers' forms may have been signed by other people, such as their parents or even their GP.  \nOne document, shown to the BBC by a woman who didn't want to be named, suggests a judge in one of the adoption hearings questioned the authenticity of a signature. \nMs Gallwey said the women were also not told they were entitled to financial help or other kinds of support that might have meant they could have kept their children. \nMany of the adoptees who were given to new families in forced adoptions have also spoken of their shock at what happened to their birth mothers.\nSome of them say it has added to their own sense of loss.\nGaynor Weatherly, whose mother was 16 when she was born in 1963, says: \"It's like a piece of me has been missing. It can eat you up.\"\nGaynor says she has found happiness through her own marriage and children but that she feels \"cheated out of a different life\".\nSome of the adoptees were eventually reunited with their birth mothers, but it often took decades.\nRachel Langham, who was born to Veronica Smith, went to live in Canada after she was adopted.\nShe had a loving relationship with her adoptive parents, but says what happened to Veronica was \"inhumane\".\n\"I feel terrible empathy and sorrow for her and someone should apologise,\" Rachel says.\nIn her 40s, Rachel was reunited with Veronica. But building a relationship after so many years has been hard, and Veronica says these lifelong repercussions are one more reason why an apology is so essential.\nHundreds of women have now written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to say they deserve one from the UK government, on behalf of the institutions and individuals who treated them so badly. \nBirth mothers in Australia received the world's first government apology in 2013 when Julia Gillard, the prime minister at the time, apologised to around 150,000 women whose babies were taken from them. \nAnd three years ago, the Canadian Senate recommended the federal government issue an apology to 300,000 Canadian women. \nIn January of this year, the Irish Taoiseach, Micheal Martin, apologised to former residents of mother and baby homes in Ireland for the way they were treated over several decades. \nThe women in Britain, most of whom are now in their 70s and 80s, say an apology would bring lasting comfort.\nAnn Keen, who went on to become an MP and junior minister, says: \"I did not give up my son or abandon him. An apology would clear my name and my son's name. An historical injustice is what happened. It's time to say sorry.\" \nIn a statement, Children and Families minister Vicky Ford said: \"I want to express my deepest sympathy to all those affected by historic forced adoption. We cannot undo the past, but we can be reassured that our legislation and practices have been significantly strengthened since then.\"\u202f \n\u202fThe 1975\u202fand 1989 Children Acts\u202fand the 1976 Adoption Act were among the laws that have made it easier for\u202fadopted children\u202fand their birth mothers to regain contact with each other.

      "text": "Weekly Parkrun events should be allowed to resume in England, cabinet ministers Robert Jenrick and Oliver Dowden say.\nWriting to councils, the ministers said exercise was \"vital\" for physical and mental health.\nThe 5km local runs have yet to restart despite organised outdoor sport being allowed without a cap on numbers since 29 March under eased Covid rules.\nOn Friday, Parkrun said it had been forced to delay its planned reopening in England due to land permissions.\nThe organisation had hoped to restart events on 5 June after it was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, but fewer than half of its venues approved the runs.\nIt said 250 locations in England had given them permission to run on the planned date, but that this fell \"far short\" of the number needed to prevent overcrowding at the areas given the go ahead.\nIn a letter to all councils in England, the communities secretary, Mr Jenrick, and the culture secretary, Mr Dowden, said sport and physical activity were particularly important \"as we recover from the pandemic\". \nThe ministers acknowledged the pressures that local authorities were under to consider requests for organised outdoor sports safely, but they stressed these events were exempt from legal gathering limits and could take place with any number of participants as long as they were in line with Covid guidance.\nAround 150 landowners, including a number of local authorities, have either refused permission for Parkrun to return, or not yet replied to correspondence from the organisers, according to the letter.\nIt added: \"Parkrun needs approximately 80% of Parkruns to be allowed to go ahead to prevent people travelling across the country from areas without a Parkrun operating, to ones which are.\"\nThe letter said the government had been clear that Parkrun events were legally able to take place, with research showing mass-participation events such as marathons and fun runs can take place safely.\n\"In the interest of public health they should now restart,\" it said.\n\"We therefore strongly urge local authorities to ensure that they are applying their powers in a consistent and proportionate manner and progressing Parkrun's applications at pace in order to allow these events to return as soon as possible,\" Mr Jenrick and Mr Dowden said. \nParkrun says it is hoping runs can resume on 26 June in Northern Ireland and on 3 July in Scotland.

We will take action against sellers that are found to be in violation of our terms.\"\nProducts sold over the counter in the UK should contain no more than 0.1% hydrogen peroxide, while the legal limit for application by professional dentists is 6%. \nSix of the products that Which? tested contained more than 10% hydrogen peroxide. \nWhich? says consumers should seek help from a professional dentist if they want whiter teeth, as the procedure, if done incorrectly, can cause lasting damage. \nDr Paul Woodhouse, a director of the British Dental Association, warned: \"Hydrogen peroxide is a seriously strong chemical and not to be messed with. Dentists are trained in its usage and they also know what whitening products are effective to use and safe for teeth and gums.\n\"If you destroy gum tissue, you are never going to get it back and you lose your teeth. If it penetrates the surface of your tooth, which is likely, it's probably going to lead to the death of that tooth.\"\nIf you go the DIY route, look to buy teeth-whitening kits from a reputable high-street retailer, as the legal responsibilities to ensure products are safe are stronger there than on online marketplaces, says Which?\nIt's shared the findings with the Office for Product Safety and Standards. \nSue Davies, head of consumer protection policy at Which?, said: \"It's clear that self-regulation is not working, leaving people exposed to a flood of unsafe products online. \n\"It is absolutely crucial that online marketplaces are given greater legal responsibility for the safety of products sold on their sites, so that shoppers are far better protected from dangerous and illegal items.\"\nA spokesperson for the Office for Product Safety and Standards said: \"By law,\u202fcosmetics may be placed on the UK\u202fmarket\u202fonly if they are\u202fsafe. There are specific restrictions in place for products of this kind and we would urge anyone who is considering using teeth-whitening products to consult their dentist first.\n\"We continue to work with local Trading Standards and online platforms to identify unsafe products and ensure these are removed from sale - we expect the platforms to act swiftly when notified to keep people safe.\""

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "An MP is facing allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards two junior members of parliamentary staff.\nMessages seen by BBC Wales show Rob Roberts inviting a 21-year-old female intern to \"fool around\" with him.\nHe has also admitted asking out another House of Commons employee, which led them to move position.\nThe Conservative Party said the Delyn MP's conduct was completely unacceptable, and confirmed it is investigating.\nAt least two complaints have been made about Mr Roberts to Parliament's independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS), BBC Wales has been told.\nThe MP said he recognised the request to ask the staffer out \"was inappropriate\", but has not commented on the messages sent to the intern.\nLabour and Liberal Democrat politicians called for the allegations to be investigated and for the Conservative Party to remove his party whip.\nMr Roberts was elected as the Conservative MP for Delyn in north Wales in December 2019.\nHis seat was a gain from Labour in the so-called Red Wall and had been previously held by Labour MP David Hanson since 1992.\nMr Roberts propositioned the now former intern, who was working in Parliament at the time, in a series of messages in April this year.\nIn the messages, Mr Roberts referred to the intern's \"picture on Twitter earlier. Lovely legs\".\n\"Don't ignore me when I'm making you feel better,\" he told her.\nThe MP then went on to say that in future she might want to \"fool around with no strings, you might come and visit me in London\".\nLater in the exchange the MP, who has recently split from his wife and come out as gay, told the female intern that he \"might be gay but I enjoy\u2026 fun times\".\nThe woman, who did not respond to the request, explained to the MP that she was in an \"awful state\" and was struggling with her mental health, to which Mr Roberts responded: \"I was just thinking about fun times\u2026 Maybe if you thought of them too it might help you.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Wales, the former intern said the exchange made her feel \"incredibly sick\".\n\"I had had one of the worst days ever, and then I messaged him saying I'm crying, I'm not okay - and his solution to that was to proposition me,\" she said.\n\"I felt really vulnerable and I felt like I was being used to make him feel better about everything.\"\n\"I kind of felt backed into a corner about everything,\" the intern said. \n\"I was worried about my job first of all, and I was worried about being involved in politics and I felt like I had to respond, but I wasn't really comfortable responding.\"\nShe said she \"didn't really feel comfortable\" returning to Parliament after the messages.\n\"I didn't feel comfortable telling anyone I was friends with in politics about it because I thought it would affect my career in the future or if I wanted to be more politically involved that I'd be branded by all of this,\" she said.\n\"I couldn't speak up about it in case my name got implicated or I was blamed for everything.\"\nShe said the experience made her \"mental health worse\".\n\"The culture of politics can be quite toxic when it comes to these things especially when you're a girl dealing with an MP,\" she said.\n\"It was just horrific.\"\nIn a separate series of messages also seen by BBC Wales, Mr Roberts admitted asking another member of staff in Parliament out, resulting in them moving positions.\nHe said he told a male parliamentary staffer \"that I liked him and asked him to dinner\".\n\"Really poor judgement on my part, hands up. He didn't react very well because it created a problem for him that I felt that way,\" he said.\nIn a further message, Mr Roberts added: \"The chief whip was involved, lots of drama.\"\nIn response, Rob Roberts told BBC Wales that earlier this year he invited a parliamentary staff member to dinner. \nHe said: \"My invitation was not accepted and the staff member did not feel comfortable about it. \n\"I do now recognise that it was inappropriate to have extended the invitation to a member of staff in the first place.\n\"However, I have found the last few months and the 'coming out' process to have been particularly challenging and the cause of a great deal of mental stress to me. \n\"Creating a story from this interaction which has been dealt with amicably seems calculated to add to that stress, which is distressing.\"\nLabour MP for Warrington North Charlotte Nichols said she had made a complaint about Mr Roberts' behaviour to the ICGS.\n\"I know it's something that MPs have been trying to raise awareness of for a little while,\" she said. \"Complaints that have been made to the Conservative Party, complaints that have been made through the parliamentary complaints procedure, and it doesn't seem really like any action has been taken against him yet, which unfortunately to a lot of people who are outside observers looks like a kind of tacit support of his actions.\" \nWelsh Labour Gower MP Tonia Antoniazzi tweeted: \"The allegations about Tory MP Rob Roberts are very concerning and should be fully investigated.\"\nShe said it was \"unclear why he still holds the Tory whip\".\nJess Phillips, Yardley Labour MP, called for the party to deal with it as \"swiftly as they dealt with Julian Lewis\" - the Tory backbencher whose whip was removed after beating Chris Grayling to chair the Intelligence and Security Committee.\nActing Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey tweeted that the \"allegations are incredibly serious. We must make sure women are safe at work\".\n\"The Conservative Party must immediately remove the whip while they investigate, or they risk sending the message that this is acceptable conduct for a sitting MP.\"\nFollowing the opposition calls, a Conservative Party spokesperson said: \"An investigation into Rob Roberts MP's conduct is ongoing.\n\"While Mr Roberts has apologised for his behaviour and has been undertaking safeguarding and social media protection training, we are clear such conduct is completely unacceptable.\""

      "tags": "UK economy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Government borrowing fell in April compared with the same month last year, as parts of the economy reopened after lockdown measures eased.\nBorrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was \u00a331.7bn, official figures show, which was \u00a315.6bn lower than April last year.\nHowever, the figure was the second highest for April since records began.\nBorrowing has been hitting record levels with billions being spent on measures such as furlough payments.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) now estimates that the government borrowed a total of \u00a3300.3bn in the financial year to March. While that was down slightly from its previous estimate of \u00a3303.1bn, it remains the highest level since the end of World War Two.\nThe ONS said the cost of measures to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic meant that day-to-day spending by the government rose by \u00a3204.1bn to \u00a3942.7bn last year.\nThe huge amount of borrowing over the past year has now pushed government debt up to \u00a32.17 trillion, which is 98.5% of GDP - a rate not seen since the early 1960s.\nApril's borrowing figure was lower than official forecasts. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the fiscal watchdog, had predicted borrowing would reach \u00a339bn last month.\nParts of the economy began to reopen in April, including pubs and restaurants as well as hairdressers and gyms.\nTax receipts in April were \u00a358bn, which was up slightly from the same month last year when receipts were \u00a354.2bn.\nThe government's borrowing figures were also boosted by smaller than expected interest payments on debt.\n\"April's public finances figures showed that the government's financial position isn't as bad as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted only two months ago, reinforcing our view that the tax hikes and spending cuts that most fear may be avoided,\" said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics.\nHow you view the latest figures on government borrowing depends on what you compare it with. \nThe amount borrowed in April - \u00a332bn - is very high by normal standards, about as much as the public sector was predicted, before the pandemic, to need to borrow over the whole financial year. But it is less than the \u00a339bn officially predicted by the OBR at the Budget two months ago. \nSimilarly, the revised figure for the whole financial year 2020/21 is \u00a3300bn - about ten times what was forecast pre-pandemic and the highest borrowing in peacetime.\nBut compare it to the \u00a3394bn predicted in November and there's room for optimism. \nSome economists now think there won't be a need for big spending cuts or tax rises to bring that figure down. Instead it will drop naturally as the economy expands, tax receipts from income tax, VAT and the like roll in and the government spends less supporting the economy.  \nIt's also worth remembering that government finances are about as unlike household finances as you could get; almost all the money the government's borrowed since the pandemic is owed to the Bank of England. In that light, the objective pressures to raise taxes or cut spending to reduce borrowing aren't at all urgent. Any decisions to do so will be born less from economic urgency and more from political judgment. \nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said public borrowing \"should continue to undershoot\" the OBR's forecast it published alongside the Budget in March amid expectations of a strong recovery in GDP.\nHowever, he said: \"The chancellor's room for manoeuvre on austerity measures will depend on the size of the long-term hit to potential GDP from the recent recession.  \n\"While 'scarring' should be smaller than after past recessions, given that the unemployment rate has remained low, we still see significant costs in the form of diminished investment and an unprecedented exodus of non-UK nationals.\"  "

Italian and Egyptian investigators had originally tried to work on the case together but when Rome prosecutors pushed for a trial in late 2020, their counterparts in Cairo said there was \"insufficient evidence to support the accusation in court\".\nEgypt said evidence had been found that Regeni had been robbed by a criminal gang but that the killer had not been identified.\nAt the time of his disappearance, the 28-year-old PhD student was researching Egypt's independent trade unions, a controversial subject in a country where unofficial protest movements have faced a crackdown in recent years.\nHis body was found dumped in a ditch by a road near Cairo on 3 February 2016. An Italian post-mortem examination found he had been tortured \"in stages\" between 25 January and the day of his death. \nRome prosecutors went further, detailing \"acute physical suffering\" from kicks, punches, beatings, cuts and even burns from red-hot objects.\nEgyptian officials have admitted Regeni was being monitored and Italian investigators said in 2018 that people he had met while doing his research had betrayed him.\nThe four Egyptians all deny involvement in the student's disappearance and killing. Cairo prosecutors dropped all proceedings against them and a fifth suspect last December.\nGen Tariq Sabir, Col Usham Helmi, Col Athar Kamel Mohamed Ibrahim and Maj Magdi Ibrahim Abdelal Sharif all face charges in Italy of kidnapping Regeni. Maj Sharif is also accused of conspiring to inflict aggravated injuries and murder.\nThe student's parents, Paola Deffendi and Claudio Regeni, were at Tuesday's hearing to hear Judge Pierluigi Balestrieri rule that there was sufficient evidence to indict the four men. \nTheir lawyer, Alessandra Ballerini, told reporters that all the young man's rights had been violated, \"but today we have the well-founded hope that at least the right to the truth will not be denied Giulio\". \n\"It has taken us 64 months. But it is a good goal and a good starting point,\" she said. \nEgyptian officials did not comment immediately on the decision and as the four suspects' home details have not been given to the Italians, there is little chance of contacting them or that the Cairo government will agree to them attending the trial."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,Ursula von der Leyen,European Commission,Brexit",
      "text": "Brussels must show common sense and take a pragmatic approach to the NI Protocol, the UK government has said. \nIt said it was disappointed that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was not fully recognising the effects of the protocol.\nIt is the part of the Brexit deal that puts a trade border in the Irish Sea.\nMs von der Leyen said on Monday that there was no alternative but the \"full and correct implementation\" of the protocol.\nThe UK government said its priority was the Good Friday Agreement, while the European Union was focussed on the single market.\nTechnical talks to simplify the operation of the protocol are ongoing.\nThe protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are enforced at its ports - but it is strongly opposed to the protocol among unionists, who see it as separating Northern Ireland from the UK. \nIt was agreed by the United Kingdom and European Union in October 2019 and was subject to further negotiation and agreement in 2020.\nHowever, in recent weeks the UK government's rhetoric against the protocol has hardened.\nEarlier this month the UK's Brexit minister said it was hard to see how the current operation of the protocol was sustainable.\nThe UK was committed to working with the EU, but there needed to be a \"pragmatic, risk-based approach\" to challenges over the protocol, said a government spokesman. \n\"The protocol relies on the support of all communities in Northern Ireland so it is disappointing that there was not more recognition from the commission president of the impact that the current operation of the protocol is having in Northern Ireland,\" said the spokesman.\n\"While the EU prioritise protection of the single market and treat the regulatory boundary as if it were like any other external EU border, our focus remains on protecting the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in all its dimensions.\"\nSpeaking in Brussels on Monday night, Mrs Von der Leyen said the protocol was the \"only possible solution to ensure peace and stability in Northern Ireland while protecting the integrity of the EU single market\".\nShe added that any problems flowed from Brexit rather than the protocol, but the UK and EU had \"a common duty to do whatever we can to reduce tensions in Northern Ireland\".\nShe said the current technical talks were exploring practical solutions to help minimise disruption to everyday life in Northern Ireland.\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader-designate Edwin Poots said that costs for businesses in Northern Ireland of the protocol would \"spiral\" as 15,000 checks will ultimately have to be made every week on goods.\n\"This protocol will hurt every single individual in Northern Ireland,\" Mr Poots told the Stormont Assembly on Tuesday.\n\"I will continue to press hard with the UK government the issues that are at stake here. The case is unarguable that this protocol is bad for Northern Ireland.\"\nDUP MPs Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Gavin Robinson, along with Lord Dodds, met the Brexit minister on Tuesday.\nThe trio told Lord Frost the protocol should be replaced, with Sir Jeffrey saying their message was \"clear and unambiguous\".\n\"The protocol has no support from any shade or quarter of unionism. Its imposition without the consent of both traditions in Northern Ireland and overriding of cross-community voting safeguards has seriously undermined support for devolution,\" Sir Jeffrey added.\nOutgoing First Minister Arlene Foster accused the EU of having a \"tin ear\" to concerns about the protocol. \n\"It is hugely disappointing, in spite of everything that has happened, the fact that we are talking about cancer drugs being prevented from coming into Northern Ireland,\" she said.\n\"The fact that there are more checks from Great Britain into Northern Ireland than there are in Rotterdam; that still the European Union and the European Commission have had a tin ear to the concerns and the absolutely genuine concerns of the people in Northern Ireland.\"\nOutgoing UUP leader Steve Aiken said Ms von der Leyen's remarks were \"tone deaf\", and urged her to engage with his party, \"the party that helped write and implement the Good Friday Agreement\". \nHe said: \"She is at best badly informed, or at worst, is wilfully misrepresenting the impact of the EU's failure to come to an acceptable agreement with the UK, and the people of Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, we are all stuck in the middle. \n\"Northern Ireland is being used as a bargaining chip between Brussels and London.\"\nBut Ms von der Leyen's comments were welcomed by Sinn F\u00e9in MP Chris Hazzard, who said Northern Ireland businesses wanted \"the protections the protocol provides\". \n\"It's time the British government stopped the charades and implement what it has already agreed,\" he said.\n\"We also need to see the economy minister in the north using the unique situation the protocol affords the north to attract investment and jobs.\" \nDuring Brexit negotiations, all sides agreed that protecting the Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority.\nIt meant keeping the land border between the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) and Northern Ireland (in the UK) open and avoiding new infrastructure like cameras and border posts. That was easy when the whole island of Ireland was part of the EU.\nBut after Brexit, a new arrangement was needed because the EU requires certain goods to be inspected at the point of entry into its single market.\nSo, the EU and the UK negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol, which came into force on 1 January 2021.\nThe Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) said Mrs Von der Leyen's comments \"showed how little she cares about peace and stability in Northern Ireland\". \nThe LCC was set up in 2015 to represent a range of individuals and views from the wider Protestant, unionist and loyalist communities.\nLoyalist paramilitary groups like the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association are also represented on it.\nLCC Chairman David Campbell said: \"I would appeal to her to start listening and to recognise that the imposition of the protocol on the people of Northern Ireland without their involvement or consent is unsustainable and actually contrary to many of the key founding tenets of the European Union.\"\nWhen Ursula von der Leyen talks about practical solutions, she is alluding to the technical negotiations which are happening right now between EU and UK officials. \nOfficials are crunching through about 30 different issues relating to the protocol -  everything from pet travel to VAT on second-hand cars to steel tariffs to medicines and the movement of plants. \nThey're working through those to see what can ease the implementation of the protocol on the ground. \nBut the difficulty is a dramatic shift is not going to happen at a technical level. \nIt's something where there needs to be a political commitment and, at the moment, there is no sign of the EU or the UK being prepared to make that big political compromise. \nLast week, an LCC member told MPs violence could not be ruled out if the protocol remained. \nThe organisation also met Lord Frost to discuss the protocol earlier this month.\nRioting erupted in some loyalist areas of Northern Ireland in April - with tensions around the protocol partly blamed.\nSince then, there has been a switch to demonstrations largely in the form of loyalist band parades and marches.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland is currently investigating about 303 unlawful parades against the protocol. \nMeanwhile, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has said she has sought legal advice over the DUP's absence at north-south meetings.\nThe DUP is boycotting some North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings due to its opposition to the protocol.\nMs Mallon told the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday that ministers are legally obliged to attend.\nEarlier this month, Agriculture Minister and DUP leader-designate Edwin Poots was criticised for preventing another north-south ministerial meeting from taking place."

      "tags": "Kabul,Afghanistan,Taliban,US-Taliban peace talks,United States,Australia",
      "text": "Australia has said it will shut its embassy in Afghanistan's capital Kabul on Friday, as the withdrawal of international troops proceeds. \nIn a statement, Canberra talked of \"an increasingly uncertain security environment\" in the country.\nIt said Australian diplomats would visit Afghanistan regularly - but would be based elsewhere in the region. \nAfghanistan said it hoped the closure would be \"short-lived\" and Australia would continue its permanent presence.\n\"The closure of an embassy is also a cause for concern,\" it added in a statement. \"One question that may come to the minds of some people is: 'Why is Australia leaving Afghanistan in such a situation and why did it spend 20 years in this country?'\".\nThere are fears that the withdrawal of the US-led Nato force could plunge Afghanistan back into a full-scale war.\nIn April, US President Joe Biden said American troops would leave by 11 September, after 20 years of military involvement in Afghanistan. \"It is time to end America's longest war,\" Mr Biden said.\nAt least 2,500 US troops are part of the 9,600-strong Nato Afghan mission.\nOver the past two years, Australia has reduced the number of its troops in Afghanistan from more than 1,500 to about 80. \nUS and Nato officials have recently said that the Taliban, a hard-line Islamist movement, have so far failed to live up to commitments to reduce violence in Afghanistan.\nThe Australian statement was issued jointly by Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Foreign Minister Marise Payne on Tuesday.\n\"We will close our Embassy building on 28 May 2021,\" the document said, adding that \"it is Australia's expectation that this measure will be temporary and that we will resume a permanent presence in Kabul once circumstances permit.\n\"Australia remains committed to the bilateral relationship with Afghanistan, and we will continue to support the stability and development of Afghanistan in concert with other nations.\"\nThe statement did not say where in the region Australian diplomats would be relocated.\nThis announcement throws up a number of questions. The speed for starters - the embassy is due to close by the end of this week. Why so fast? \nWhat does that mean for Canberra's commitment to peace in Afghanistan? Just four weeks ago, the foreign minister was in Kabul reiterating her government's support. \nWhat's clear, however, is that there's a great deal of nervousness about the potential for increased violence - and not much confidence, it seems, in the ability of the Afghan leadership or troops to stop it.  \nWith an emboldened Taliban movement that sees the withdrawal of coalition troops as a victory, the Afghan government will need all the help it can get from its allies. In Australia's case, for now, it will have to be from a distance. \nA deal signed in February last year said the US and its Nato allies would withdraw all troops in 14 months if the Taliban upheld its promises, including not allowing al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas it controlled and proceeding with national peace talks.\nAs a condition of starting negotiations with the Afghan government, the Taliban also demanded the release of thousands of their men in a prisoner swap. \nAlthough the group stopped attacks on international forces as part of the historic agreement, it has continued to fight the Afghan government.\nEarlier this month, 60 people, mostly girls, were killed in explosions outside a secondary school in Kabul.\nNo-one has admitted carrying out the attack in Dasht-e-Barchi, an area often hit by Sunni Islamist militants.\nThe Afghan government blamed the Taliban for the attack, but the group denied involvement."

      "tags": "Tokyo,Travel,Japan,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The US has issued a travel warning for Japan over the country's Covid-19 surge, amid heightened scrutiny just weeks before the Tokyo Olympics. \nBut US Olympic officials have said they are confident their athletes will be able to take part safely in the Games.\nJapan already bans most travellers from entering the country.\nIt long had low numbers of Covid cases but is now seeing a fresh wave of infections pushing the healthcare system in some cities to its limit. \nJapan has recorded more than 700,000 infections and 12,000 Covid-19 deaths from the virus. \nThe US Center for Disease Control (CDC) said \"travellers should avoid all travel\" to the country, warning that in the \"current situation in Japan even fully vaccinated travellers may be at risk for getting and spreading\" Covid variants. \nLargely due to the global pandemic, the US currently has 151 countries at level four, its highest alert level, including most of Europe where large sports events go ahead under special Covid restrictions. \nJapan currently does not allow any tourists or business travellers into the country for fear of new strains of the virus. The Japanese ban includes people coming from the US being \"denied permission... unless there are exceptional circumstances\".\nLarge parts of the country are currently under a state of emergency to give regional authorities more power to enforce measures against the pandemic. \nDespite the growing crisis, the Tokyo Olympics are still scheduled to go ahead on 23 July after having been postponed from last year. \nPublic opinion in the country has seen a vast majority of people calling for the Games to be cancelled though, or postponed a second time. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has ruled out both those options.\nA lot of people in Japan will be hoping that the CDC warning for Americans not to travel to Japan is a precursor to the US Olympic Team pulling out of the Tokyo Olympics. \nWhy? Because most people in Japan want the Games cancelled, and a US team withdrawal would almost certainly force the Japanese government to pull the plug.\nFor weeks people here have been saying Japan won't cancel without some outside pressure. There's even a name for this in Japanese - it's called \"gaiatsu\".\nThose people look set to be disappointed. The US Olympic Committee says it is not changing its plans. Nor is the International Olympic Committee. \nLast Friday IOC vice president John Coates said the Olympics will go ahead \"even if Tokyo is still under a state of emergency\".\nThat statement did not make him many friends in Japan, where daily deaths from Covid are now higher than at any time during the pandemic, and where the healthcare system in parts of western Japan has been described as \"on the verge of collapse\".  \nThe United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) said the travel warning saying it would not affect their participation. \n\"We feel confident that the current mitigation practices in place for athletes and staff by both the USOPC and the Tokyo Organising Committee, coupled with the testing before travel, on arrival in Japan, and during Games time, will allow for safe participation of Team USA athletes this summer,\" it said in a statement.\nJapanese officials on Tuesday have responded to the US travel advisory, saying they did not expect it to have any impact.\n\"We believe that there is no change in the US position to support the Japanese government's determination to realise the hosting of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics,\" said chief cabinet secretary Katsunobu Kato.\nNo foreign travellers are allowed to attend the Games, and the Japanese government is also not ruling out the option of holding the event without any spectators, should the Covid situation get worse. \nLagging behind other developed nations in its vaccination efforts, Japan on Monday kicked off a mass vaccination programme in Tokyo and Osaka, the two cities which have been hit hardest by the new surge in infections. \nSo far, only about 1.9% of the population is fully vaccinated. Authorities hope that by the end of July, at least those aged 65 and above will have completed their vaccinations."

      "tags": "Princess Diana, Princess of Wales,BBC",
      "text": "An investigation into why the journalist Martin Bashir was rehired in 2016 will be published next week, BBC director general Tim Davie has said.   \nA recent inquiry by Lord Dyson found the corporation covered up \"deceitful behaviour\" by Bashir to secure an interview with Princess Diana in 1995.\nMr Davie said there was \"no doubt\" that rehiring Bashir years after the interview had been a \"big mistake\".\nHe added that Bashir was still working out a three-month paid notice period.\nMr Davie said the notice period started the moment he resigned and was almost up. \nThe BBC rehired Bashir as religion correspondent in late 2016, when questions had already been asked about his conduct surrounding the Panorama interview. He was later promoted to religion editor.\nEarlier this month it was confirmed he had stood down due to ongoing health issues.\nIn an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Davie, who took over the BBC's top job in September 2020, said a \"quick\" investigation into the decision to rehire Bashir was under way.\n\"We're interviewing people, getting the documents, and we should be able to publish something next week.\"\n\"There's no doubt with what you know now - it's a big mistake,\" he added.\nHe went on to say there were three reasons why he had accepted Bashir's resignation, which was offered before he had seen the Dyson report.\n\"The first was there were very significant medical care issues, which, in terms of Martin Bashir as a staff member, regardless of all the situation around it, is a factor,\" he said.\n\"The second is it allowed a clean break with no pay-off, which I thought was in the licence fee-payers' interest to make sure that there was a clean process.\n\"The third was there was no restraint in us getting to the truth. This was not an honourable discharge,\" he added.\nOn Monday, Julian Knight, chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, said the BBC had rehired and promoted Bashir \"who they know was a liar\" and asked whether he was rehired to \"keep his mouth shut\".\nLast week, James Harding, who was director of BBC News when Bashir was rehired, said he had not known the journalist had forged bank statements and, had he known, \"he wouldn't have got the job\".\nAsked whether he had consulted then-director general Lord Hall about the reappointment, Mr Harding, who left the BBC in 2018, did not answer directly but said he himself took responsibility.\nThe inquiry, published last week, found Bashir had faked bank statements designed to suggest Princess Diana was under surveillance - to win the trust of her brother Earl Spencer, and eventually gain access to the princess for the 1995 Panorama interview.\nAs media interest in the interview increased, the BBC covered up what it had learned about how Bashir secured the interview, the inquiry said.\nThe Duke of Cambridge said his mother was failed \"not just by a rogue reporter\" but by BBC bosses, and blamed the corporation's failings for fuelling his mother's paranoia and worsening his parents' relationship.\nThe prince said the original Panorama interview programme had \"effectively established a false narrative\" and should never be aired again.\nSpeaking to the Today programme, Mr Davie said he had \"no intention\" of airing Diana's Panorama interview ever again, but did not rule out using clips.\n\"I think we need to discuss clips and reflect on that,\" he said, adding: \"My view is you cannot now look at this interview free from the context in which it was secured.\"\nHe was also asked whether the BBC accepted there was a direct line between the forged documents, Bashir's actions and Diana dying in 1997 - as had been drawn by Earl Spencer.\n\"I think we fully accept the Dyson report. I think beyond that we are into speculation.\"\nHe said he did not have evidence that there was direct line. \"It's as simple as that - it's not a question of rejecting it,\" he added.\nMr Davie said some of the most disappointing and shocking elements from the report were around whistleblowing.\nGraphic designer Matt Wiessler had tried to expose Bashir's methods and complained that he had been sidelined after raising concerns that fake bank statements he mocked up for Bashir had been used to persuade Diana to do the interview.\n\"The very person who raised this - and I know many staff feel very strongly about this - suffered enormous impacts, which we're very sorry for,\" Mr Davie told the programme.\n\"That cannot happen again. We have improved processes but I want to look again at things.\"\nMr Davie said he was willing to meet Mr Wiessler, and reiterated a \"full, unconditional apology\" to him.\nAsked if he thought Mr Wiessler should be compensated, Mr Davie said it needed to go through a \"legal discussion\", adding: \"We'll engage in that discussion because clearly we were at fault.\"\nOn Monday, the BBC announced a review into its editorial policies.\nIts board said it had \"confidence\" that the \"processes and guidelines in today's BBC are much stronger than they were in 1995\" but it was \"right that we review the effectiveness of the BBC's editorial policies and governance in detail\"."

He had been living in a luxury villa near the resort town of Punta del Este, east of the capital.\nHe and three other inmates managed to escape through a hole in the prison roof in 2019, a scandal that prompted the resignation of Uruguay's prison chief. \nThe 'Ndrangheta are the most powerful mafia in Italy and are believed to control the supply of huge amounts of cocaine entering Europe from South America and elsewhere.\nEarlier this year, hundreds of suspected members of the 'Ndrangheta group went on trial as part of Italy's largest mafia trial in decades.\nYou might also be interested in:"

      "text": "The EU has decided to ban Belarusian airlines from European skies after a flight was diverted to Minsk on Sunday and a dissident journalist arrested.\nAt a meeting in Brussels, the leaders of the 27 member states also told EU airlines not to fly over Belarus, and promised further economic sanctions. \nRoman Protasevich, 26, was on a flight from Greece to Lithuania which was rerouted over a supposed bomb threat.\nWestern countries accused Belarus of hijacking the Ryanair plane.\nBelarus authorities on Monday released video of Mr Protasevich that appears to have been recorded under duress since his detention at Minsk airport.\nIn the clip, the journalist said he was in good health and seemingly confessed to crimes he had been charged with by the Belarusian state. \nBut activists, including the country's main opposition leader, criticised the video and suggested Mr Protasevich was under pressure to admit wrongdoing.\nUS President Joe Biden described the actions of the Belarusian authorities as \"outrageous\", saying they were \"shameful assaults on both political dissent and the freedom of the press\".\nMr Protasevich's father has told the BBC he fears his son may be tortured.\nDmitri Protasevich said on Monday he was \"really afraid\" of how his son would be treated by the authorities in his home country.\n\"We hope that he will cope. We are afraid to even think about it, but it's possible he could be beaten and tortured. We are really afraid of that,\" he said in a video call.\n\"We are really shocked and really upset,\" he said. \"This sort of thing shouldn't be happening in the 21st Century at the heart of Europe.\n\"We hope that the whole international community, including the European Union, will put unprecedented pressure on the authorities. We hope the pressure will work and the authorities will realise they've made a really big mistake.\"\nMajor European airlines have already begun rerouting flights away from Belarusian airspace. \nThe UK has suspended the operating permit for Belarusian state airline Belavia, and EU leaders have called on member states to take similar action.\nIn a separate development on Monday, Belarus expelled the Latvian ambassador and other diplomats after the Belarus national flag was replaced by a historical red-and-white flag used by the opposition at the Ice Hockey World Championships in the Latvian capital Riga.\nLatvia responded by expelling Belarus diplomats.\nBelarus sent a fighter jet to force Ryanair flight FR4978 - which had departed from the Greek capital, Athens, and was bound for Vilnius in Lithuania - to land, claiming there was a bomb threat. It touched down in the capital Minsk at 13:16 local time (10:16 GMT) on Sunday.\nPolice then took Mr Protasevich away when the plane's 126 passengers disembarked. The activist, who witnesses said was \"super scared\", was arrested along with his girlfriend Sofia Sapega. \nMs Sapega's mother told the BBC that the 23-year-old had been taken to a Minsk jail, adding that the last word she managed to write on her WhatsApp messaging account was 'Mummy'. The accusations against her are unclear.\nBelarus is the only European country that still executes prisoners, and witnesses said Mr Protasevich told fellow passengers he feared he would face the death penalty. \nThree other passengers did not reach the plane's final destination in Vilnius. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said he believed some Belarusian KGB agents also departed the plane at Minsk, but this has not been independently verified.\nBelarus said the flight had been diverted because of a bomb threat from the Palestinian militant group Hamas. A senior transport official read a letter to reporters that he claimed was from the militant group.\n\"If you do not fulfil our demands, the bomb will explode over Vilnius,\" it said. \nBut Hamas has denied any involvement. The group has no history or known capability of mounting operations outside Israel and the Palestinian territories. German leader Chancellor Angela Merkel said the Belarusian claim was \"completely implausible\".\nThe incident has drawn sharp condemnation from across the world, with countries urging the immediate release of Mr Protasevich and a full investigation.\nDozens of Belarusian officials, including President Alexander Lukashenko, are already under EU sanctions including travel bans and asset freezes, imposed in response to the repression on opponents.\nState media in Belarus said Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled the country since 1994, personally gave the order for the plane to be diverted. \nThe 66-year-old leader has cracked down on dissenting voices since winning a disputed election last August. Many opposition figures have been arrested, while others fled into exile.\nMr Protasevich is a former editor of Nexta, a media operation with a Telegram channel. He left Belarus in 2019 to live in exile in Lithuania. From there he covered the events of the 2020 presidential election, after which he was charged with terrorism and inciting riots.\nNexta played a key role for the opposition during the vote, which was won by Mr Lukashenko and is widely regarded as rigged. It has continued to do so in its aftermath, particularly with the government imposing news blackouts.\nMr Protasevich now works for a different Telegram channel, Belamova. He stepped in to write for it after blogger Igor Losik was arrested by the Belarusian authorities in June last year.\nWhere is Belarus? It has its ally Russia to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.\nWhy does it matter? Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Lukashenko has been nicknamed \"Europe's last dictator\" - he has been in power for 27 years.\nWhat's going on there? There is a huge opposition movement demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. The opposition movement and Western governments say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election. Officially he won by a landslide. A huge police crackdown has curbed street protests and sent opposition leaders to prison or into exile."

      "text": "The US will seek to rebuild its relations with the Palestinians by reopening its consulate in Jerusalem and providing aid to help rebuild Gaza, Secretary of State Antony Blinken says.\nAfter meeting President Mahmoud Abbas, Mr Blinken stressed the need to shore up the truce that ended the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas.\nBut he vowed to ensure the militant group that rules Gaza did not benefit.\nHe also reassured Israel of \"America's ironclad commitment\" to its security.\nAt least 242 people were killed in Gaza and 13 people were killed in Israel during 11 days of fierce fighting that ended on Friday with an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire.\nThe violence came after weeks of spiralling Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. \nHamas began firing rockets into Israel after warning it to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes from Israel on Gaza targets.\nMr Blinken travelled to Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, on Tuesday afternoon to hold talks with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\"I am here to underscore the commitment of the United States to rebuilding a relationship with the Palestinian Authority and with the Palestinian people, a relationship built on mutual respect and also a shared conviction that Palestinians and Israelis alike deserve equal measures of freedom, security, opportunity, and dignity,\" he told a joint news conference.\nThe Palestinians broke off contacts with former US President Donald Trump's administration and rejected his Middle East peace plan as biased towards Israel. \nWhen he took office, President Joe Biden promised to restore aid to the Palestinians that was cut by his predecessor and reopen the diplomatic missions he closed.\nMr Blinken announced on Tuesday that the US would seek to \"engage with and provide support to\" the Palestinian people by moving forward with the process of reopening its consulate in Jerusalem.\nThe consulate covered Palestinian affairs until 2019, when it was merged with the new embassy to Israel that the Trump administration controversially opened in Jerusalem the previous year. The merger marked a significant downgrade of the US diplomatic mission to the Palestinians.\nA senior Palestinian official told the AFP news agency that discussions were taking place over reopening the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) office in Washington DC, which was closed by the Trump administration.\nMr Blinken also said the US was working with the international community, the Palestinian Authority and Israel to assist in the relief and recovery efforts in Gaza, adding: \"We have to respond to the profound need to help people in this moment.\"\nHe said the Biden administration would provide $5.5m (\u00a33.9m) in immediate disaster assistance for Gaza and $32m for the emergency appeal by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa).  \nIt has also notified Congress of its intention to provide $75m in additional development and economic assistance for the Palestinians in 2021.  \nBut Mr Blinken stressed that Washington would ensure that Hamas, which controls Gaza, did not benefit. Hamas as a whole, or in some cases its military wing, is designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, European Union and United Kingdom, as well as other powers.\nMr Blinken started his three-day trip to the Middle East in Jerusalem earlier on Tuesday by meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\"I underscored America's ironclad commitment to Israel's security, and we discussed the importance of promoting peace, security, and dignity for all,\" Mr Blinken tweeted.\nMeanwhile, Mr Netanyahu thanked Washington for \"firmly supporting Israel's right of self-defence\" during the escalation.  \n\"We, too, will give meaning to our commitment to our self-defence: if Hamas breaks the calm and attacks Israel, our response will be very powerful,\" the prime minister warned.\nHe also said he had discussed with Mr Blinken replenishing the Iron Dome missile defence system that protects Israel from Palestinian rocket fire, and also ways to prevent Hamas rearming.\nMr Blinken said intense, behind-the-scenes diplomacy by President Biden had helped produce last week's ceasefire, and that \"now we believe we must build on it\".\nHe added: \"We know that to prevent a return to violence we have to use the space created to address a larger set of underlying issues and challenges. And that begins with tackling the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza and starting to rebuild.\"\nThe UN said on Sunday that 242 Palestinians, including 66 children and 38 women, were killed in the conflict, and that its human rights office had verified that at least 129 of them were civilians. \nIt added that at least 230 of the Palestinian fatalities were seemingly killed by Israeli forces, and that some of the casualties in Gaza might have resulted from rockets falling short.\nThe Israel Defense Forces said it killed more than 200 militants during the fighting. Hamas and Islamic Jihad have not given overall casualty figures for their fighters.\nIn Israel, 13 people, including two children and three foreign nationals, were killed by Palestinian rocket or other fire, or when running for shelter during rocket attacks, its medical service said.\nThe UN cited the Palestinian housing ministry as saying 258 buildings, comprising 1,042 housing and commercial units, were destroyed during the fighting. In addition, 769 housing units were severely damaged and 14,536 suffered minor damage.\nFifty-four education facilities, six hospitals and 11 primary healthcare facilities were also damaged, as was water, sanitation, and electric infrastructure, according to the UN.\nPalestinian officials put reconstruction costs at tens of millions of dollars.  \nThe Israeli government has not yet published its estimate for the damages, but many buildings and vehicles in Israel were damaged by rocket fire."

      "tags": "Tourism,UK economy,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "UK tourism is set for a slow recovery from the pandemic, with spending by holidaymakers this year expected to be just half the level of 2019.\nForecasts by the VisitBritain agency indicate that domestic tourism will be worth \u00a351.4bn in 2021, down from \u00a391.6bn two years ago.\nIts forecast for spending by foreign tourists in the UK is \u00a36.2bn, less than a quarter of the \u00a328.4bn in 2019.\nThe predictions come as UK tourism chiefs prepare for a summit on Tuesday.\nVisitBritain and VisitEngland are bringing industry leaders together - some in person, some virtually - to discuss priorities for helping the sector to recover and rebuild. \nLast year, the domestic tourism industry shrank by about two-thirds as coronavirus restrictions forced the cancellation or postponement of millions of people's travel plans. According to the tourism industry, that represented a \u00a358bn loss to the economy. \nDespite the gloomy forecasts for this year, tourism analysts have predicted that demand for UK holidays is likely to outstrip supply this summer, with many holidaymakers unable or unwilling to brave foreign travel amid continuing restrictions.\n\"We're offering a shadow of what we normally would and we'll struggle to break even,\" says Christine Thomas.\nThis is usually peak season at Elterwater Hostel in Cumbria, which she and her husband, Alan, own. They're in the heart of the Lake District and they would normally be close to fully booked, with fell-runners, walkers and school groups, not to mention overseas visitors.\nNow they're only about a third full. Even if more people want to come, Covid rules mean they can't fill all their 38 beds. People from different groups aren't allowed to share bathroom facilities and the hostel only has five showers.\nThey still provide hearty home-cooked meals, but you can't mingle with other visitors, like hostel guests often do. And the self-catering kitchen is closed.\nThe past year feels like a \"write-off\" they say. Hotels that can offer en suite rooms, or self-contained self-catering places are probably managing better, says Christine. \nAnd if the rules are eased further after 21 June, that could make a big difference.\n\"Hostels are basically social places. It's about people meeting each other and exchanging experiences,\" she says.\nLast week, the tourism agency launched a \u00a35m campaign entitled Escape the Everyday - Enjoy the UK this Summer.\nThe campaign is aimed at boosting domestic demand, with a focus on cities and city visitor attractions, as well as on areas that have been particularly hard hit by the lack of international visitors.\n\"Britain's tourism industry is a huge driver of our economy but has faced many challenges over the past year,\" said tourism minister Nigel Huddleston.\n\"We've provided more than \u00a325bn in support, and I have been impressed by VisitBritain/VisitEngland and the wider sector for its agile and innovative response, coming up with new ways to provide hospitality and entertainment while maintaining social distancing and protecting people's safety.\"\nBritish Tourist Authority chairman Lord Patrick McLoughlin said the sector had faced \"an unprecedented challenge\" during the pandemic.\n\"Tourism is a critical industry for our country, delivering jobs and economic growth across the nations and regions and strengthening our place on the world stage,\" he added.\nLord McLoughlin said that government's support measures, including the furlough scheme, the VAT cut for hospitality businesses and the business rates holiday, had been \"a lifeline\", helping many businesses survive and keeping people in jobs. \n\"We will continue to work with the UK government as it sets out its recovery plan and ambitions for tourism, and across the industry, to cement the recovery and the future of one of this country's greatest industries,\" he added."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic,Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board",
      "text": "There were Covid deaths in only four local authority areas in Wales, latest weekly figures show.\nThe number of deaths involving Covid-19 was six in the week up to 14 May, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). \nThis is up from five registered in the previous week but the figures in this period are the lowest we have seen since early September. \nThese accounted for 0.9% of all deaths.\nThe trend has been for a steady decline and is 88% fewer Covid deaths than registered two months ago. \nDuring the latest week, up to 14 May, there were no deaths in 18 out of Wales' local authority areas, including across the Aneurin Bevan, Cardiff and Vale, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas. \nWhen broken down by local authority area, there were two deaths in Swansea hospitals, two deaths in Bridgend - in a hospital and at home - and also a hospital death involving a Flintshire resident and another involving a Rhondda Cynon Taf care home resident.\nSo-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths from all causes with previous years, were 28 deaths (4.6%) above the five-year average, after being below normal for 10 successive weeks. \nLooking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at particular periods of a typical year is seen as a good measure of the pandemic. \nThe number of deaths from all causes in Wales rose to 640 in the week ending 14 May. The ONS urged caution in interpretation because the Early May Bank Holiday may have affected registrations.\nAll nations and regions of the UK saw above average deaths, with the West Midlands the highest proportion of excess deaths. \nWhen looking across the course of the pandemic so far, there have been 44,826 deaths from all causes in Wales, 7,878 (17.6%) mentioning Covid-19 on the death certificate. This was 5,529 deaths above the five-year average. \nWhen deaths occurring up to 14 May but counting later registrations are included, the total number of deaths involving Covid rises to 7,880. \nPublic Health Wales gives a daily snapshot of deaths being reported to it by health boards. This only includes deaths in hospitals and in some care homes but it only counts people who have tested positive for Covid.\nCurrently, there is a daily average of one death a day in Wales, by this measure.\nThe ONS figures take a few weeks to compile because they look at death certificates, signed by doctors and registered by families. \nBut they are regarded as giving the more complete picture.\nAs well as all hospital and care home deaths, they also include deaths in people's homes, hospices and other community settings.\nDoctors include Covid when they believe in their medical opinion it was suspected or confirmed and that it was a contributory cause of death.\nAcross England and Wales, Covid was the underlying cause of death in 71% of cases when it was mentioned on the death certificate in the latest week, so we can say the death was due to Covid."

      "text": "The UK government has told airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace after a Ryanair flight was diverted to Minsk and an opposition journalist arrested.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted that the move was necessary \"to keep passengers safe\".\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab told MPs the interception of the flight had been a \"shocking assault on civil aviation\".\nDissident journalist Roman Protasevich, 26, was removed from the plane and arrested at Minsk airport on Sunday.\nBelarus scrambled a fighter jet to force the plane - which was travelling from Athens in Greece to Vilnius, Lithuania - to land in the Belarusian capital after saying there had been a bomb threat. \nPolice took Mr Protasevich away when passengers disembarked.\nMr Shapps said he has also suspended the operating permit of Belarus' state airline, Belavia, effectively banning it from the UK.\nThe airline's timetable shows it operates a three-times weekly flight from Minsk to London's Gatwick airport.\nMr Raab told the House of Commons the interception was a \"shocking assault on civil aviation and an assault on international law\".\nHe added that further sanctions were being considered against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's regime and that the country's ambassador in London had been summoned so the UK could convey its \"condemnation of these acts\".\nThe foreign secretary also called for the release of Mr Protasevich from the \"spurious charges\" he faces.\n\"Mr Lukashenko's regime must be held to account for such reckless and dangerous behaviour,\" Mr Raab added.\nHe said the UK was working to explore \"every potential diplomatic option\" and was \"actively considering and co-ordinating with our allies on further sanctions on those responsible for this outlandish conduct\". \nLabour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy condemned Belarus' act of \"modern piracy\" which she said had amounted to a state hijacking, and was an \"assault on the freedoms of the air and on freedom of speech\". \nShe added: \"Unless the consequences are swift, robust and co-ordinated it will create an extraordinarily dangerous precedent that will put journalists, dissidents and activists from the UK or anywhere else at risk every time they board a plane.\"\nConservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, urged the government to call for the suspension of energy pipelines in Belarus.\nHe welcomed the government's new rules on flights, and asked Mr Raab if he would go \"one step further\" and \"call for a suspension\" of the Nord Stream 2 and Yamal energy pipelines that run through Belarus \"which is where the money comes from that supports this tyrannous regime\". \nMr Raab said the UK would \"consider and consult with our partners and see what further action they are willing to take as well\".\nThe EU imposed sanctions against Belarus on 1 October last year, in response to the \"brutality of the Belarusian authorities and in support of the democratic rights of the Belarusian people\".\nThese restrictions - a travel ban and asset freeze against individuals associated with the government of President Lukashenko - have since been expanded to include 88 individuals and seven organisations.\nThose on the list are forbidden from entering or transiting through EU territories and their assets in the EU are frozen. In addition, EU citizens and companies are forbidden from making funds available to any individual and company on the list.\nThe UK mirrors the current EU sanctions. \nMr Raab told reporters on Monday that Britain would not wait for the EU to issue sanctions against Belarus first.\nHe said: \"No, in the past we've led the way. We will continue to do so. But I do think it's important that we co-ordinate with our international partners to see what is the most effective means and way of applying additional pressure on the Lukashenko regime.\"\nQuestioned on whether restrictions on sovereign debt, potash and oil companies could come under consideration for possible sanctions, Mr Raab said: \"We won't take anything off the table\".\nThe interception has attracted widespread criticism from across the European Union, with countries calling for the immediate release of Mr Protasevich and a full investigation.\nRyanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told Irish Newstalk radio earlier that the interception was a \"case of state-sponsored hijacking... state-sponsored piracy\".\n\"It appears the intent of the authorities was to remove a journalist and his travelling companion... we believe there were some KGB agents offloaded at the airport as well,\" Mr O'Leary added.\nA spokesperson for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said following the government's decision it had \"suspended all foreign carrier permits held by Belarusian air carriers until further notice\" - a move which applies to scheduled and charter operators.\n\"The Civil Aviation Authority has also issued a notice to all UK-registered airlines requesting that they avoid overflight of any territory of the Republic of Belarus,\" the spokesperson added.\nHe is a former editor of Nexta, a media outlet with a Telegram channel that played a key role for political opposition during last year's elections in Belarus. \nMr Protasevich left Belarus in 2019 to live in exile in Lithuania. From there he covered the events of the 2020 presidential election, after which he was charged with terrorism and inciting riots.\nThe election, won by incumbent President Lukashenko, is widely believed to have been rigged.\nPresident Lukashenko, who has been in power for 27 years, has been nicknamed \"Europe's last dictator\".\nMr Protasevich was in Athens to attend an economic conference along with Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the opposition leader who claimed victory in the election and who also lives in exile in Lithuania.\nHe now works for a different Telegram channel, Belamova. He stepped in to write for it after blogger Igor Losik was arrested by the Belarusian authorities in June last year.\nMr Protasevich is being held in a detention centre in Minsk, Belarus' interior ministry has told state media in a statement.\nThe ministry said the opposition journalist had not complained of ill health while in custody.\nEarlier his father, Dmitry, told the BBC he feared his son may be tortured in custody and could face the death penalty."

There should be a search and rescue operation... to protect lives at sea.\"\n\"The Mediterranean is the biggest graveyard in the world,\" she said. \"It shouldn't be like this.\"\nReacting to the photos, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said: \"Images of bodies of babies and toddlers washed up on a beach in Libya are unacceptable.\"\nOne of the images posted online shows a small child in a polka dot one-piece sleepsuit. Sand has partially obscured the body.\nAnother photo is of a woman in green trousers spread eagle on the sand, her top pulled up over her head.\nOscar Camps is the founder of Proactiva Open Arms. He tweeted photos of the bodies on Monday, of \"young children and women who had only dreams and ambitions to live\", saying they had been left there for three days.\nFreelance journalist Nancy Porsia - who has also posted images of the bodies online - tweeted however that a contact of hers found the bodies on Saturday and informed the authorities, who buried them the same day in Abu Qamash cemetery.\nEurope is grappling with a fresh influx of people heading to the continent across the Mediterranean. Some 13,000 people have already arrived in Italy this year, with warmer weather in the area raising fears of even more people trying to make the crossing. \nAnd in the western Mediterranean last week, some 8,000 people including children swam or waded around a border fence to get to the Spanish territory of Ceuta from Morocco. Authorities returned several thousand soon after.\nIn 2015, the image of drowned three-year-old Aylan Kurdi sparked global outrage. The Syrian child was photographed lying face down on the sand in Turkey after his family tried to reach Europe. "

      "text": "Government advice has emerged urging people not to travel into and out of areas hit by the coronavirus variant first found in India, unless necessary.\nThe guidance for Kirklees, Bedford, Burnley, Leicester, Hounslow and North Tyneside says people in these areas should try to avoid meeting indoors. \nThe advice was published online on Friday without an announcement and urges \"an extra cautious approach\".\nA Downing Street source denied it was a local lockdown by stealth.\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said the government wanted to encourage the public \"to exercise their good judgement\", rather than issuing \"top-down edicts\". \nAdvice against travelling to Bolton in Greater Manchester and nearby Blackburn with Darwen, other than for essential reasons, and for people there to meet outside where possible, had been issued on 14 May. It was updated to include the six other areas on Friday.\nGreater Manchester's Labour Mayor Andy Burnham said issuing the advice without warning was a \"major communications error\" which had a \"major effect on people's lives\" and a government minister should issue a clarification.\nDavid Greenhalgh, Conservative leader of Bolton Council said he had been assured there were \"no added restrictions coming to Bolton\" and \"no local lockdown\". \nBolton recorded 451 overall cases per 100,000 people in the week to 20 May, the highest in England, as the Royal Bolton Hospital said it would take \"urgent action\" to manage an increase in Covid patients. \nMeanwhile, the UK reported 15 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test and 2,493 new confirmed cases. Tuesday's figures for reported deaths are sometimes higher due to weekend reporting delays.\nSeveral of the local authorities affected by the new advice - which represent more than two million residents combined - said they were not consulted about it.\nLeicester's director of public health Prof Ivan Browne said people in the area should continue to follow the national guidance and \"there is no justification for Leicester to be treated differently to the rest of the country\" - as it has lower levels of the Indian variant than other parts of the country. \nNorth Tyneside Council said officials did not know about it until Monday, while leaders in Lancashire said they would discuss the new guidance with the government later.\nBlackburn with Darwen's director of public health Dominic Harrison said the affected areas \"were not consulted with, warned of, notified about, or alerted to this guidance\".\nBut the Downing Street source told the BBC all the areas were informed about the latest advice.\nThe guidance, published on a page titled \"what you can and cannot do\", advises people in the eight areas of England to:\nIn a fiery Commons exchange, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi to \"withdraw this guidance now\".\nMr Ashworth, Labour MP for Leicester South, asked what families with trips planned and couples with weddings arranged should do this coming bank holiday weekend.\nMr Zahawi urged leaders to work together and said the government was asking people in the eight areas \"to be cautious, to be careful\".\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock used a Downing Street briefing last Wednesday to urge vulnerable people to have their second dose of a vaccine to guard against the Indian virus variant.\nMr Hancock announced an increase in surge testing in six areas where the variant was circulating, but did not outline any specific rules or travel guidance.\nYasmin Qureshi, Labour MP for Bolton South East and shadow international development minister, said she had not been informed of any new advice and was \"gobsmacked\" by the updated guidance.\n\"They're making such an important announcement and they don't even have the decency to tell us or tell our constituents,\" she said - adding that many people would have made plans to travel over the bank holiday weekend.\nShe said it was \"not clear\" whether \"this is advisory or legally obligatory\" and described the move as \"incompetence\" on the part of the government.\nThe Downing Street source said it was advice, not law, and that all the areas had proceeded with step three of England's roadmap out of lockdown on 17 May.\nThe Indian variant is on its way to becoming dominant in the UK, pushing out the Kent variant that caused the deadly winter surge.\nBut the implications of that are uncertain. In some areas, such as the north west of England, it is pushing up infection rates as well as replacing the Kent variant.\nElsewhere it just seems to be replacing the Kent variant without having much of an impact on the amount of virus circulating.\nGovernment scientists always warned the easing of restrictions would lead to an increase in cases - and that is now more certain with what seems to be a more infectious variant circulating.\nWhat no one knows at the moment is how large that increase will be and what impact it will have on hospital cases.\nThe UK is in a very different position than when the Kent variant started taking off.\nInfection levels are low - we have one of the lowest rates in Europe - and the vaccination programme is well advanced.\nBut there is still a risk of a big wave of serious illness. The difficulty scientists face is quantifying that risk, which makes deciding the proportionate response very hard.\nLayla Moran, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on coronavirus, said the advice risked confusing people.\nShe said: \"This is a major change to policy that will have a huge impact on people's lives. Simply updating the government website without an official announcement is a recipe for confusion and uncertainty.\n\"Local people and public health leaders in these areas need urgent clarity from the government. Matt Hancock must come before Parliament and make a public statement to explain these new rules.\"\nNewly-elected West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin added the change could cause \"anxiety and confusion\".\nSkipping birthday celebrations and cancelling trips to see relatives are among the impacts of the sudden revelation of government advice against non-essential travel to eight areas in England.\nJulie Suttar, from Aberdeen, booked a hotel in Leicester as part of a planned trip to visit family she has not seen since the pandemic began.\n\"I can't believe it, I've been on the phone to my sister, in tears. Where's this come from? Where's the notice?\" she asks.\n\"My Travelodge is non-refundable, \u00a350 down the drain, on top of other deposits and holiday costs lost last year.\"\nElizabeth Pannell, from Kirklees, did not arrange a first birthday party for her son due to all the uncertainty - a decision she feels has been vindicated with the new advice.\n\"I held off organising anything because of Covid, and now I'm so glad I did,\" she says.\n\"It's sad that, yet again, Covid has ruined any chance for this little boy to have a normal day with his family.\"\nOn Friday, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said travel restrictions would apply to Bolton, Blackburn with Darwen and Bedford, as she urged people to reconsider plans to visit the areas."

      "text": "People across Northern Ireland have been celebrating the return of many freedoms as lockdown eases.\nRestaurants, cafes, bars and other hospitality venues can operate indoors from Monday in another sign of a return to normality.\nSix people from two households can now meet indoors in homes, and non-essential travel is allowed to the rest of the UK.\nOutgoing First Minister Arlene Foster urged people to remain careful.\n\"We're very pleased to have reached this point in our journey coming out of Covid restrictions and of course we're asking people to be sensible, but also to enjoy the newfound freedoms that they have,\" she said.\nThe lockdown-easing measures were agreed by ministers last week. \nA traffic light system will be in place for foreign travel, with 12 countries on Northern Ireland's so-called \"green list\", including Portugal.\nPeople going to countries that appear on the green list do not need to quarantine on their return.\nBut those returning from the likes of Portugal will be asked to take a PCR test after they arrive home.\nEngland, Scotland and Wales have already implemented similar systems, with the first travellers heading off on holiday last week.\nIf returning from a country on the UK's red list, passengers must book and enter hotel quarantine.\nNon-essential travel from Northern Ireland to other parts of the Common Travel Area (CTA - the UK, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands and Isle of Man) is now allowed, and people will not be required to isolate on return if they have visited family or friends in other parts of the area.\nAt last Thursday's executive meeting, ministers also backed the reopening of hotels and B&Bs from Monday and the attendance of spectators at outdoor sport events - up to 500 may be permitted. \nPubs and restaurants are now allowed to trade indoors with a maximum of six people per table from a maximum of six households, or up to 10 people provided they are all from the same household.\nOwner of the Harbour Cafe at Belfast's docks, Marty Gibson, said he was ready to open and had reduced the seating capacity from about 40 to 20. \n\"We have done everything we can do - sanitisers, distancing and track and trace in place. We just have to see how we go,\" he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\nHowever, he added that businesses would still need financial help. \n\"Landlords are still looking for rent and there are still wages to pay and overheads, which haven't decreased in price.\" \nEconomy Minister Diane Dodds said the continued easing of restrictions was a \"huge step forward for Northern Ireland's economy\".\n\"Our businesses are looking forward to reopening but they are also responsible. It's about doing things safely and making sure we don't take any steps backward,\" she told Good Morning Ulster.\nMrs Dodds also said NI tourism drives would be launched in the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill welcomed the moves, but urged people to remain cautious and careful given the prevalence, particularly in Great Britain, of the so-called Indian variant of the virus. \nOther measures easing from Monday include increased numbers permitted for indoor gatherings - not including domestic settings - to allow for community events such as mother-and-toddler groups to resume.\nNational Trust houses and other properties in Northern Ireland are reopening their doors to visitors from Monday. \nSome small properties or places which cannot accommodate social distancing will reopen later once Covid restrictions are lifted or when repair or redisplay work is completed, said the National Trust.\nUp to 1,000 fans were allowed to attend Friday's Irish Cup final at Mourneview Park in Lurgan, County Armagh.\nBut spectators will not be allowed back for Derry City's game against St Patrick's Athletic on Monday night.\nThe decision was taken after discussions with public health officials, \"based on the current high rates of Covid-19 transmission in the city\", according to a statement on the club's website.\nPeople in England, Scotland and Wales have been allowed to meet in each other's homes and enjoy indoor hospitality since last Monday."

      "title": "Belarus plane: What happens with a military jet interception?",
      "tags": "Belarus,Greece,Lithuania,Minsk,Alexander Lukashenko,Ryanair,European Union",
      "text": "\"If a military aircraft intercepts you and gives you command,  you obey\". That was the view of one pilot who spoke to the BBC, who said the decision of Belarus to force down a passenger aircraft was \"absolutely reckless\".\nBelarus scrambled a fighter jet to divert a Ryanair passenger plane - flying from Greece, bound for Lithuania - to land in Minsk on Sunday, claiming a bomb was on board. None was found.\nPolice then took opposition journalist Roman Protasevich away when the plane landed in the Belarus capital. It was an airport that the pilots did not have on their flight plans. \nThose within aviation called this a \"major diplomatic incident\", so serious that those we spoke to cannot remember anything similar.\nWhen an aircraft flies through international skies, aircraft have the nationality of the state in which they are registered. \nIn this case, the Ryanair plane is understood to be registered in Poland to \"Ryanair Sun\", a subsidiary of the Irish airline. When the plane is flying, regardless of its position in the skies, it remains of Polish nationality. \n\"To interfere with an aircraft in flight is a diplomatic incident involving the state of registration,\" said a senior industry source from a major aviation business. \nA pilot added that \"this is a huge contravention of so many international agreements\". \nThe law allowing planes to overfly countries without the need to land is the \"First Freedom of the Air\" and these freedoms of the air are essential to enable passengers and traffic to move from one country to another around the world.\nThe decision by Belarus to intercept a passenger aircraft in the air and force it to land in a third country breaks this code. It's for this reason the boss of Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, has described the situation as \"state sponsored piracy\".\nBut Belarus has not signed the International Air Services Transit Agreement, which is what embodies the \"First Freedom of the Air\" and a list of other codes. \nA military escort or interception happens primarily for safety reasons, according to aviation experts. If passengers on board the flight, and those in towns and cities on the ground, are at risk then states will respond to protect accordingly.\nIf Air Traffic Control (ATC) temporarily loses radio contact with an aircraft, operators will immediately work to re-establish radio communication. But if that doesn't happen and the flight deck crew fails to respond on its two frequencies, the military can be deployed.\n\"The fighter comes to attract your attention and [get you to] call in - and to make sure you've not been hijacked and about to crash into a capital city. ATC is very nervous when radio goes silent with aircraft after 9/11\",\" explained one pilot. \nAlternatively, if a captain calls over the radio with one of a number of \"squawk codes\" to signal that the aircraft is in distress, a military escort can also be deployed. There are a number of scenarios in which one of these codes might be used - including a mechanical emergency, a loss of communications or a discreet way to tell ATC you've been subject to unlawful interference.\nIf military jets are scrambled to escort a plane in the sky, the jets take up formation ahead of the passenger aircraft.\n\"The captain sits on the left-hand side of the aircraft. You'll have a jet who'll pull up on the left-hand side so there is a clear line of sight for the captain,\" says one senior industry source. He adds if there is a second jet, they might take a position on the right-hand side or behind the plane.  \nAt this point, the military jets will be trying to contact the passenger aircraft on an International Emergency Frequency. In the event that there are no comms because radios have failed, there is a booklet of interception signals which are manoeuvres that determine what you have to do. \n\"They flash their lights at night. By day they rock their wings which means follow me, and you have to follow,\" explains the pilot.\nOn Monday, private Facebook groups for pilots were alive with discussion about the interception, with many talking about criticisms levelled at pilots for following the military jets to Minsk instead of continuing to Lithuania.\n\"If a military aircraft intercepts you - and gives you command - you obey. You can't not obey command. You have no option but to follow orders. It's like on the ground, when police tell you to do something,\" the pilot added.\nEvery flight has a flight plan that is filed with Eurocontrol. This has everything from lift-off at runway one, involving all elements of the route and flight and right through to touch-down at runway two. But interception means that plan can be almost wiped out.   \n\"Pilots would then be extremely worried. They don't know why and what's happening. Where are we going to? What's the airport like? What is the weather like? We don't have approach plates for it; these would be some of my worries,\" added the pilot from a major UK airline. \nThe problem is that in interception scenarios like this one, the pilots may not be thoroughly prepared for the flight path they may be asked to follow and therefore there can be a higher degree of risk for all.\n\"You are thrown into what's happening, you no longer have control of the flight plan and the full safety oversight that comes with that,\" explained one senior industry source, adding \"without knowing the plan your situational awareness is degraded, as is the ability to plan your own flight path to a safe touch down.\"\nUK flights have now been asked to avoid Belarusian airspace in the wake of the plane diversion.\nUK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted on Monday that he had instructed the Civil Aviation Authority to request airlines to make the move \"in order to keep passengers safe\". The operating permit for the Belarusian national airline Belavia has also been suspended.\nMany details are still to emerge, including a detailed time line of events from the sky above Belarus on Sunday morning. But for one airline, two passengers and an entire continent, a major diplomatic incident is now developing.\nDue to the diplomatic and security situation regarding this flight incident, aviation industry figures did not want to be named for this article.\nWhere is Belarus? It has its ally Russia to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.\nWhy does it matter? Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Lukashenko has been nicknamed \"Europe's last dictator\" - he has been in power for 27 years.\nWhat's going on there? There is a huge opposition movement demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. The opposition movement and Western governments say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election. Officially he won by a landslide. A huge police crackdown has curbed street protests and sent opposition leaders to prison or into exile."

      "text": "UN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has demanded the immediate release of Mali's President Bah Ndaw and PM Moctar Ouane, who have been detained by soldiers.\nThey were driven by soldiers to a military camp near the capital, Bamako. \nThe two men have been leading an interim government which took power after a military coup last August. \nThey were detained just hours after a government reshuffle in which two army officers who took part in the coup were replaced. \nLate on Monday, Mr Ouane told AFP in a phone call that soldiers \"came to get him\". The news agency said the line was then cut.\nDefence Minister Souleymane Doucour\u00e9 has also reportedly been detained. \nThe African Union, the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), the EU and the US have also condemned the arrests, saying Mali's top politicians must be released without any preconditions.\nBy Beverly Ochieng, BBC Monitoring\nIbrahim Boubaca Ke\u00efta was ousted as president last year following weeks of anti-government protests over rising insecurity, alleged corruption and a failing economy.\nHis removal was generally celebrated - but the slow pace of change over the last nine months has been causing tensions.\nAn ongoing strike by the main union is in its second week and threatens to cripple the economy.\nThe interim government - overseeing the 18-month transition - agreed to appoint a new broader-based cabinet in the face of these problems and the threat of renewed protests.\nCol Sadio Camara and Col Modibo Kone, who served as ministers of defence and security respectively, were dropped.\nThe opposition group behind the protests last year, M5 RFP, is also infuriated that it did not get rewarded with any ministerial positions.  \nPlus public confidence is waning over the army leaders' ability to tackle the Islamist insurgency that has spilled into neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger. \nA previous coup in 2012 led to militant Islamists exploiting the chaos and seizing the north of the country. \nFrench troops helped regain territory, but attacks continue as the insurgents capitalise on the persistent political instability in the region.\nDiscussions are ongoing at the Kati military camp, where the president and prime minister are being held.\nThe talks have also involved members of the M5 RFP. The group has been critical of the prime minister, so may be angling to replace him, reports BBC World Service Africa editor Will Ross.\nA delegation from Ecowas, which played a key role in setting up the transitional government, is also due to visit Bamako."

      "tags": "Islamophobia",
      "text": "Boris Johnson's comments about women wearing the burka have given an impression that the Tories are \"insensitive to Muslim communities\", an independent review has said. \nThe prime minister ordered a report in 2019 into how the party handles discrimination allegations.\nIt found anti-Muslim views were seen at local association and individual level.\nBut claims of \"institutional racism\" were not borne out by evidence of the way complaints were handled.\nHowever, there is \"clear evidence\" the Conservative party's complaints system is \"in need of overhaul\", according to Professor Swaran Singh's independent review.\nThe report warned it \"should make for uncomfortable reading for the party\".\nIn a statement Prof Singh said: \"For those unable or unwilling to read all of its 44,000 words, here's a summary: we found evidence of discrimination, and while the problem is not systemic the party must now act to root it out.\"\nResponding to the report, Conservative party co-chair Amanda Milling apologised \"to anyone who has been hurt by discriminatory behaviour of others or failed by our system\".\nShe said the party accepted all the recommendations and would publish a plan to implement them in six weeks' time.   \nFormer Conservative Chancellor Sajid Javid said the report contained \"distressing examples of anti-Muslim sentiment\" but insisted that Mr Johnson was not Islamophobic and \"respects anyone from any background, any community\".\nAnother former cabinet minister - and long-standing critic of the party over Islamophobia - Baroness Sayeeda Warsi told Sky News the report showed that \"the party was institutionally racist\" and said the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) should investigate.\nShe also described the prime minister's apology as \"mealy-mouthed\" but added there was \"an acceptance that what he said was wrong\".\nLabour's shadow equalities secretary Marsha de Cordova said the report was \"a damning indictment of the discrimination rife in the Conservative Party, and it goes all the way up to the prime minister\".\nShe urged Mr Johnson to make a \"full and proper apology\" for his burka comments and to acknowledge \"the pain and hurt he has caused in the Muslim community\".\nThe Muslim Council of Britain gave a \"guarded welcome\" to the report but said \"it does not address the structural nature of Islamophobia in the Party\" or \"how racism had impacted many elements of its culture\".\nThe report was commissioned in December 2019 after accusations of Islamophobic behaviour by some Conservative party members and representatives.\nIt considered cases including allegations against Zac Goldsmith's London mayoral campaign against Sadiq Khan in 2016, and comments made by Boris Johnson in a Telegraph column in 2018, when he wrote that women wearing burkas looked like \"letter boxes\" or \"bank robbers\".\nThe review said such cases \"give an impression to some of a party and leadership insensitive to Muslim communities\".\nSpeaking to the inquiry, Mr Johnson said: \"I am obviously sorry for any offence taken\" and added he would not \"use some of the offending language from my past writings\" now.\nConcerning his 2016 London mayoral campaign, the report said Zac Goldsmith - now Lord Goldsmith \"accepts poor judgement in the way his campaign was conducted but forcefully denies harbouring anti-Muslim sentiments or using such sentiments for political advantage\".\nThe report also found:\n\"Judging by the extent of complaints and findings of misconduct by the party itself that relate to anti-Muslim words and conduct, anti-Muslim sentiment remains a problem within the party,\" the report added.\n\"This is damaging to the party, and alienates a significant section of society.\"\nThe Singh report said the Conservatives should, within six weeks, publish a plan laying out how it intends to tackle the failings highlighted by the investigation.\nIt also recommended producing a code of conduct and said at least one member of every party association should receive training on the complaints process.\nResponding to Prof Singh's report, the Equality and Human Rights Commission said it would assess the report and await the Conservative Party's response.\nThe Conservative Party has been accused of failing to tackle Islamophobia within its ranks for a number of years.\nIn 2018, the then-chairman of the Conservative Muslim Forum Mohammed Amin, accused his party of putting \"electoral concerns\" ahead of \"decisive action\" on tackling Islamophobia.\nThe Conservatives' first female Muslim cabinet minister, Baroness Warsi, has also long decried her party's response to the issue, accusing it of \"turning a blind eye\" and becoming \"institutionally Islamophobic\".\nDuring the 2019 race to lead the Conservative party, then-home secretary Sajid Javid challenged all of his fellow contenders - including eventual winner Mr Johnson - to hold an external investigation into the allegations."

Hypothermia, with intoxication, was said to be the most probable reason for her death.\nFulton, now aged 20, was remanded in custody at the High Court in Edinburgh.\nHe will be sentenced next month following background reports.\nThe court heard that Fulton met Mhari through social media site Yubo.\nBefore they met, he sent her a message which read: \"It is freezing today should've worn my pimp coat\". In a later message he wrote: \"Ur gonna freeze to death OMG.\"\nAfter she was found dead he told police he was aware Mhari was 15 years old.\nHe said he had bought a large bottle of vodka for them to share after he travelled to Edinburgh from Livingston to meet her.\nFulton told police Mhari had been so intoxicated that she kept falling off a bench and could not walk.\nHe claimed he was starting to panic and knew he needed to get the last train home. He maintained he told her several times he was leaving, but did not get a response as she was \"unable to speak\".\nThe following day the shop worker sent her a text stating: \"Are you alive?\" He said he was \"freaking out\" because he had not heard from her.\nAdvocate depute Alex Prentice told the court after his meeting with Mhari, Fulton had texted a friend the next day.\nIn a message he wrote: \"I had no choice but to leave, what was I supposed to do?\" and \"I got her drunk she's 15\".\nHe told another friend: \"That girl has a family and if I had stayed she would be alive.\"\nMr Prentice said pathologists considered hypothermia, with intoxication, was the most probable reason for the Portobello High School pupil's death.\nFulton pleaded guilty to culpable homicide. He admitted taking part in sexual activity with the schoolgirl, culpably and recklessly endangering her health and life, and exposing her to risk of injury and death.\nHe had provided her with alcohol which resulted in her becoming intoxicated and incapable of looking after herself.\nFulton, from Livingston, West Lothian, abandoned the girl \"in a remote and exposed location\" in a state of partial undress without means to contact anyone and failed to seek help for her.\nThe culpable homicide charge stated he behaved with \"utter disregard\" for the consequences of his actions towards her.\nIn impact statements, Mhari's parents described her as \"a much-loved daughter\".\nMhari had asked her mother, Donna O'Neill, if she could go to the city's Christmas market with a friend. Her mother agreed and told her she had to be home by 21:00.\nWhen she failed to return home her family began looking for her and contacted her friends, before reporting her to police as a missing person at about midnight.\nDet Insp Susan Balfour from Police Scotland's major investigation team said: \"This has been a distressing time for Mhari's family and our thoughts remain with them and her friends.\n\"We welcome the conviction of Ewan Fulton and hope it brings some comfort to Mhari's loved ones.\""

      "tags": "Bolton,Bedford,North Tyneside Council,Leicester,Coronavirus testing,North Shields,Blackburn,Hounslow,Burnley,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Government advice has emerged urging people not to travel into and out of areas hit by the coronavirus variant first found in India, unless necessary.\nThe guidance for Kirklees, Bedford, Burnley, Leicester, Hounslow and North Tyneside says people in these areas should try to avoid meeting indoors. \nThe advice was published online on Friday without an announcement and urges \"an extra cautious approach\".\nA Downing Street source denied it was a local lockdown by stealth.\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said the government wanted to encourage the public \"to exercise their good judgement\", rather than issuing \"top-down edicts\". \nAdvice against travelling to Bolton in Greater Manchester and nearby Blackburn with Darwen, other than for essential reasons, and for people there to meet outside where possible, had been issued on 14 May. It was updated to include the six other areas on Friday.\nGreater Manchester's Labour Mayor Andy Burnham said issuing the advice without warning was a \"major communications error\" which had a \"major effect on people's lives\" and a government minister should issue a clarification.\nDavid Greenhalgh, Conservative leader of Bolton Council said he had been assured there were \"no added restrictions coming to Bolton\" and \"no local lockdown\". \nBolton recorded 451 overall cases per 100,000 people in the week to 20 May, the highest in England, as the Royal Bolton Hospital said it would take \"urgent action\" to manage an increase in Covid patients. \nMeanwhile, the UK reported 15 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test and 2,493 new confirmed cases. Tuesday's figures for reported deaths are sometimes higher due to weekend reporting delays.\nSeveral of the local authorities affected by the new advice - which represent more than two million residents combined - said they were not consulted about it.\nLeicester's director of public health Prof Ivan Browne said people in the area should continue to follow the national guidance and \"there is no justification for Leicester to be treated differently to the rest of the country\" - as it has lower levels of the Indian variant than other parts of the country. \nNorth Tyneside Council said officials did not know about it until Monday, while leaders in Lancashire said they would discuss the new guidance with the government later.\nBlackburn with Darwen's director of public health Dominic Harrison said the affected areas \"were not consulted with, warned of, notified about, or alerted to this guidance\".\nBut the Downing Street source told the BBC all the areas were informed about the latest advice.\nThe guidance, published on a page titled \"what you can and cannot do\", advises people in the eight areas of England to:\nIn a fiery Commons exchange, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi to \"withdraw this guidance now\".\nMr Ashworth, Labour MP for Leicester South, asked what families with trips planned and couples with weddings arranged should do this coming bank holiday weekend.\nMr Zahawi urged leaders to work together and said the government was asking people in the eight areas \"to be cautious, to be careful\".\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock used a Downing Street briefing last Wednesday to urge vulnerable people to have their second dose of a vaccine to guard against the Indian virus variant.\nMr Hancock announced an increase in surge testing in six areas where the variant was circulating, but did not outline any specific rules or travel guidance.\nYasmin Qureshi, Labour MP for Bolton South East and shadow international development minister, said she had not been informed of any new advice and was \"gobsmacked\" by the updated guidance.\n\"They're making such an important announcement and they don't even have the decency to tell us or tell our constituents,\" she said - adding that many people would have made plans to travel over the bank holiday weekend.\nShe said it was \"not clear\" whether \"this is advisory or legally obligatory\" and described the move as \"incompetence\" on the part of the government.\nThe Downing Street source said it was advice, not law, and that all the areas had proceeded with step three of England's roadmap out of lockdown on 17 May.\nThe Indian variant is on its way to becoming dominant in the UK, pushing out the Kent variant that caused the deadly winter surge.\nBut the implications of that are uncertain. In some areas, such as the north west of England, it is pushing up infection rates as well as replacing the Kent variant.\nElsewhere it just seems to be replacing the Kent variant without having much of an impact on the amount of virus circulating.\nGovernment scientists always warned the easing of restrictions would lead to an increase in cases - and that is now more certain with what seems to be a more infectious variant circulating.\nWhat no one knows at the moment is how large that increase will be and what impact it will have on hospital cases.\nThe UK is in a very different position than when the Kent variant started taking off.\nInfection levels are low - we have one of the lowest rates in Europe - and the vaccination programme is well advanced.\nBut there is still a risk of a big wave of serious illness. The difficulty scientists face is quantifying that risk, which makes deciding the proportionate response very hard.\nLayla Moran, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on coronavirus, said the advice risked confusing people.\nShe said: \"This is a major change to policy that will have a huge impact on people's lives. Simply updating the government website without an official announcement is a recipe for confusion and uncertainty.\n\"Local people and public health leaders in these areas need urgent clarity from the government. Matt Hancock must come before Parliament and make a public statement to explain these new rules.\"\nNewly-elected West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin added the change could cause \"anxiety and confusion\".\nSkipping birthday celebrations and cancelling trips to see relatives are among the impacts of the sudden revelation of government advice against non-essential travel to eight areas in England.\nJulie Suttar, from Aberdeen, booked a hotel in Leicester as part of a planned trip to visit family she has not seen since the pandemic began.\n\"I can't believe it, I've been on the phone to my sister, in tears. Where's this come from? Where's the notice?\" she asks.\n\"My Travelodge is non-refundable, \u00a350 down the drain, on top of other deposits and holiday costs lost last year.\"\nElizabeth Pannell, from Kirklees, did not arrange a first birthday party for her son due to all the uncertainty - a decision she feels has been vindicated with the new advice.\n\"I held off organising anything because of Covid, and now I'm so glad I did,\" she says.\n\"It's sad that, yet again, Covid has ruined any chance for this little boy to have a normal day with his family.\"\nOn Friday, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said travel restrictions would apply to Bolton, Blackburn with Darwen and Bedford, as she urged people to reconsider plans to visit the areas."

      "text": "Prominent Black Lives Matter activist Sasha Johnson is critically ill after being shot in the head, her party says.\nThe Taking the Initiative Party (TTIP) said she was being treated in intensive care after being \"brutally attacked\" in the early hours of Sunday.\nThe 27-year-old has life-threatening injuries following the shooting on Consort Road, in Peckham, south London.\nTTIP said Ms Johnson had undergone an operation and remained in critical care, in recovery post-surgery.\nA vigil was held in Ruskin Park, close to King's College Hospital, where Ms Johnson is being treated.\nWell-wishers played African drums and prayed for Ms Johnson to pull through.\nOne speaker told the crowd: \"In every community there are good eggs and bad eggs and we have to make sure those bad eggs are held accountable for their actions.\n\"Because it's not acceptable for those bad eggs to be attacking our warriors - be they male or female.\n\"Warriors who are out there every day without pay working for our families, working for our communities.\"\nPolice said at this stage there was no evidence the attack was targeted.\nAfter fears grew among other activists that it was a targeted attack, Charles Gordon, one of TTIP's founding members said: \"I would like to say that we need to stay cautious and aware; the truth is that we don't know what has happened here.\"\nA party spokesman said: \"Whilst we understand there is much speculation around the nature of the incident, our priority is Sasha's health and recovery.\"\nDetectives said there was currently nothing to suggest the shooting victim had received any credible threats against her, and have appealed for witnesses.\nThey have not confirmed her identity.\nEarlier, Imarn Ayton, a friend of Ms Johnson's, told the BBC doctors had carried out surgery on her fellow activist, which had gone well and she was \"now with her parents\".\nShe said Ms Johnson had been at a party or gathering when she was injured but she did not believe \"she was the intended victim\".\n\"As far as I am aware... this incident is more related to rival gangs as opposed to her activism,\" Ms Ayton said.\nDetectives from the Met's Specialist Crime Command have been investigating at the scene and the surrounding area and are pursuing a number of lines of inquiry. \nIt is believed the shooting happened near a house where a party was taking place and a number of people may have been in the area, a Met Police statement said.\nThe Taking the Initiative Party said the attack followed \"numerous death threats\".\nDet Ch Insp Jimi Tele said: \"This was a shocking incident that has left a young woman with very serious injuries. Our thoughts are with her family who are being provided with support at this terribly difficult time.\"\nHe added: \"If you saw anything suspicious in the Consort Road area in the early hours of Sunday morning, or if you have heard information since that could help detectives, it is crucial that you get in touch.\"\nDr Darren Henry, who knew Ms Johnson through community activism campaigns, called on those speculating about the shooting to \"let the police do their jobs\".\n\"Like any shocking or horrendous crime in our community, we hope that the offenders are brought to justice and that there is no bias and no racism.\n\"Let the police do their watching and monitoring, but we are out here as well doing our watching and our monitoring.\"\nTributes on social media have been pouring in from all over the world since the shocking attack on the young mother.\nTamika Mallory, a well-known US activist posted on her Instagram account: \"Pull through sis! People think it's a game out here. Smh. #SashaJohnson\", while Labour MP for Tottenham David Lammy tweeted: \"This is gut wrenching. Praying for Sasha Johnson, her family and friends that she makes a full recovery #BlackLivesMatter\".\nAnd Harriet Harman, the Labour MP for Camberwell and Peckham, tweeted: \"Whoever carried out this dreadful shooting of Sasha Johnson needs to be caught quickly. Give any info you have to MPSSouthwark. Reported death threats will need to be investigated. Wishing her a full recovery. With thanks to the NHS for much needed expertise and care.\"\nMs Johnson was a well known anti-racism campaigner who organised a Black Lives Matter protest last summer, in her home city of Oxford. \nMany have praised her courage and determination to stand up for the rights of black people, tirelessly calling out injustices and inequality. \nMs Johnson has previously spoken about living in a society where her black sons would be accepted and which had a better system that could help them grow. She said she was determined to carry on campaigning and wanted to make a difference within her own community. \nMs Johnson, who works in community activism and community support and got a first in social care from Ruskin College in Oxford, has been a leading figure in the Black Lives Matter movement in the UK and is a member of the Taking the Initiative Party's leadership committee.\nIn its manifesto, the party describes itself as aiming \"to create real change in communities across the UK by setting the agenda in government\". \nIt said it wanted to do this by putting forward \"exceptional candidates who truly represent their communities, winning seats to create a Parliament that looks like the society it leads\". \nIn a statement on Instagram, the party said Ms Johnson is a mother of two and a \"powerful voice\" who has always been fighting for black people and against the injustices that affect the black community.\n\"Let's all come together and pray for Sasha, pray for her recovery and show our support to her family and loved ones,\" the statement said.\nBlack Lives Matters UK said it was shocked by the shooting of \"a young mother and fearless political campaigner who was at the forefront of many BLM protests last summer\".\nIt said that while she was not part of the organisation, \"she impressively founded a new Black-led political party and was dedicated to resist anti-Black racism\".\nThe group added: \"Any attempt to intimidate or silence her, is an attack on all of us.\""

      "tags": "Schools,NSPCC",
      "text": "Teachers say they do not feel equipped to deal with peer-on-peer sexual abuse because they have had no training.\nMore than 1,500 UK teachers replied to a questionnaire from BBC Radio 4's File on 4 and teachers' union the NASUWT. \nMore than half said they did not think adequate procedures were in place in their schools to deal with  abuse.\nMany are also unsure how to deliver elements of a new sex-and-relationships curriculum, which the government says third parties might now help with.\nIn England, the Department for Education has introduced a compulsory Sex and Relationships Education (RSE) curriculum in all schools, focusing on relationships in primary schools and sex and relationships in secondaries.\nIt has also asked Ofsted to review peer-on-peer safeguarding procedures. \nOf the teachers surveyed, almost a third said they had witnessed peer-on-peer sexual harassment or abuse and almost one in 10 said they saw it on a weekly basis.\nThe debate about a culture of sexual abuse at schools has escalated in recent months after a website set up for victims to post their experiences anonymously gained more than 16,000 posts - some from children as young as nine.\nThe Everyone's Invited website publishes anonymous allegations which refer mostly to sexual harassment carried out against young women by young men at their school or university.\nThe government has now launched a dedicated hotline with the NSPCC for young people who feel they have been harassed and abused. \nSince the helpline launched at the beginning of April, it has received more than 350 calls, and 65 referrals have been made to agencies including social services and the police.\nAmina is now 19 and still trying to come to terms with what happened to her at high school. She says her harassment started when she was in Year 7, aged 11.\n\"I started to get bullied and people were making rumours up about me. They were saying I would go home with so many different guys and have sex with them - that was really upsetting for me.\n\"It was during the summertime and we were practising for PE, and then I'm sitting there with my friends and then there's this group of boys next to us. And then I just feel a hand on my back, forcing me onto the floor and then this boy starts grinding on me, and I think during that moment - I just completely froze.  \n\"And then I look up at my teacher and then he looks at me and then he looks away. I just felt so alone in that moment. Part of me felt like it was my fault because of other people's responses. I remember telling myself just to stay strong and just wait until I got home to cry.\"\nAmina is now being supported by the Rape Crisis charity.\nThe new RSE curriculum in England was introduced in September 2020. \nAndrew Fellows, associate head of policy at child-protection charity the NSPCC, says that while the new lessons are a positive development, schools have not been given the support and guidance to deliver the new curriculum effectively.\n\"Coercive control, sexual consent, healthy relationships, online safety, pornography - that's all in there. \n\"But what schools haven't been given is the guidance and the support to cover that and to deliver that in a way that works for their students,\" he said.\nFlora Cooper, head teacher of Crowmarsh Primary School in Oxfordshire, where staff have just started to teach the new RSE lessons, said: \"In terms of external training, we've not had any. \n\"We actually haven't seen much being offered in terms of training and it is absolutely in the training - that's what is essential, which we don't have.  \n\"Until the teachers are confident with the delivery of the content, then I don't think any of them will be confident and fully teaching the children the full curriculum. It feels as though we are on our own.\"\nOfsted is currently conducting a review of safeguarding policies and practices relating to sexual abuse in state and independent schools and colleges. \nIt was ordered by the government after thousands of young people - mostly girls and young women - contacted the Everyone's Invited website.\nChildren's Minister Vicky Ford said: \"We've seen these enormously worrying and very shocking allegations that have come through the Everyone's Invited site. \n\"One of the things that Ofsted will be looking at in this review is, are schools getting enough training and support? Do they need, for example, third parties to come in and train elements of that curriculum?\"\nAnyone who has suffered sexual abuse at school can contact the dedicated NSPCC helpline on 0800 136 663.\nFile on 4 is on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 on Tuesday, May 25 and then available on BBC Sounds."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Public health,Exercise,Torfaen County Borough Council,Connahs Quay",
      "text": "There are \"grave concerns\" about the future of public swimming pools across Wales, according to the sport's governing body. \nSwim Wales has warned up to 10% - or 30 pools - may never open again, with rural areas worst hit. \nIts research suggests many of Wales' 307 pools have struggled financially while shut during most of the pandemic. \nThe Welsh government said it would spend \u00a37m this year to help provide more modern and accessible facilities. \nAlongside gyms and community centres, pools in Wales reopened on 3 May, but the bills have mounted after they were forced to stay closed for most of the last year. \n\"It's an astronomical cost running into the hundreds of thousands a year,\" said Angharad Collins, who heads up leisure services across Torfaen. \nCurrent Covid-19 restrictions mean 30 people can use an indoor swimming pool at one time, but Ms Collins said this made it difficult to cover costs. \nBut the chief executive of Torfaen Leisure Trusts - which is responsible for five sites across the county, including three pools - said they were vital for helping residents to stay fit and well. \n\"I had one lady come to us and say she had completely seized up through the pandemic and actually the pool was her oil,\" she said. \nMs Collins, who is also chairwoman of the Welsh Sports Association's Facilities Committee, warned the biggest challenge would be in four months' time with the end of financial support from both the UK and Welsh governments. \n\"I think it's feasible but we're going to need the public support. Every pool in Wales will need the public support to ensure they remain open,\" she added. \nThe cost is a concern shared by Simon Morgan, who took over the running of Cambrian Aquatics Centre in Connah's Quay, Flintshire, five years ago with other parents from a swimming group.\n\"It's half a million quid a year - it's really difficult when you have no income,\" he said. \nMr Morgan said support from the Welsh government and Sport Wales had been \"amazing\", but his priority was getting people back in the water. \n\"We had 1,200 in swimming lessons a week, now we're down to about 600... that really affects our ability to generate our own revenue,\" he added. \nMr Morgan said the pool was built in 1962 to stop people drowning in the nearby River Dee and had been a mainstay in the town ever since.  \nBut he said the coronavirus pandemic and the current restrictions made it difficult to have younger children in the pool as, with parents observing, the numbers allowed to swim were cut further. \nHis daughter Elena, 18, who learned to swim there as a child, said the situation was \"really sad\". \nShe is part of the national elite development squad and said she would not have raced for Wales without her local pool. \n\"Being a swimmer myself, I know how much I enjoy it and how much other people can enjoy it and it is disappointing how pools are struggling... it's just sad,\" she said. \nA report by Swim Wales found one in five pools had been completely closed for a year, with 80% \"inactive\" for 43 weeks out of 52. \nChief executive Fergus Feeney said he was most concerned about rural areas where facilities might already be scarce, with fewer customers. \n\"It's very hard to make ends meet with rural footfall and, if those facilities go from those communities, they'll be even worse off,\" he added. \nHe has called for a \"nationwide campaign\" to get people to use their local pools instead of losing them. \nThe age of pools is also a concern for the organisation, with more than half being at least 20 years old and having no investment since they were built. \nA Welsh government spokesman said physical activity would continue to play an important role in helping people to deal with the mental and physical effects of the past 14 months. \n\"That is why we have invested over \u00a340m to support sport and physical activity over the course of the pandemic and are investing an additional \u00a37m this year to provide more modern and accessible facilities,\" he said.\n\"We hope that more people will be able to access these facilities as the public health conditions improve and restrictions are eased.\""

We just have to see how we go,\" he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\nHowever, he added that businesses would still need financial help. \n\"Landlords are still looking for rent and there are still wages to pay and overheads, which haven't decreased in price.\" \nEconomy Minister Diane Dodds said the continued easing of restrictions was a \"huge step forward for Northern Ireland's economy\".\n\"Our businesses are looking forward to reopening but they are also responsible. It's about doing things safely and making sure we don't take any steps backward,\" she told Good Morning Ulster.\nMrs Dodds also said NI tourism drives would be launched in the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill welcomed the moves, but urged people to remain cautious and careful given the prevalence, particularly in Great Britain, of the so-called Indian variant of the virus. \nOther measures easing from Monday include increased numbers permitted for indoor gatherings - not including domestic settings - to allow for community events such as mother-and-toddler groups to resume.\nNational Trust houses and other properties in Northern Ireland are reopening their doors to visitors from Monday. \nSome small properties or places which cannot accommodate social distancing will reopen later once Covid restrictions are lifted or when repair or redisplay work is completed, said the National Trust.\nUp to 1,000 fans were allowed to attend Friday's Irish Cup final at Mourneview Park in Lurgan, County Armagh.\nBut spectators will not be allowed back for Derry City's game against St Patrick's Athletic on Monday night.\nThe decision was taken after discussions with public health officials, \"based on the current high rates of Covid-19 transmission in the city\", according to a statement on the club's website.\nPeople in England, Scotland and Wales have been allowed to meet in each other's homes and enjoy indoor hospitality since last Monday."

After decades of war in the country, many families have little financial security and parents stay at home to care for the youngest in their families.\nChildren cross the border to Iran on dangerous journeys to find work to support their families and are left vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.\nIn a statement, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: \"The seismic impact of the pandemic on the UK economy has forced us to take tough but necessary decisions, including temporarily reducing the overall amount we spend on aid. \n\"We will still spend more than \u00a310 billion this year to and improve global health, fight poverty and tackle climate change.\n\"We have protected War Child's UK Aid Match funding because we value their work and the results they will deliver. \n\"All UK Aid Match commitments will be protected, as set out in the foreign secretary's written ministerial statement. In some cases there will be a delay in releasing the guaranteed funding\".\nFollowing the economic shock of the coronavirus crisis, the chancellor last November cut the UK foreign aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of total national income - a reduction of around \u00a34bn.\nRishi Sunak said the government had to make \"tough choices\". Even with the reduction UK is still be the second-highest aid donor in the G7 group of major economies.\nBBC Newsnight is on BBC Two at 22:45 BST."

      "tags": "Princess Diana, Princess of Wales,BBC",
      "text": "The BBC is to review its editorial practices and investigate how journalist Martin Bashir was rehired, following an inquiry into his interview with Diana, Princess of Wales.\nLord Dyson's report found the BBC covered up \"deceitful behaviour\" used by Bashir to secure the interview.\nThe BBC board accepted the findings in full and reiterated its apology.\nCulture minister John Whittingdale told MPs that the BBC had \"damaged its reputation\" in the UK and abroad.\nThe inquiry, published last week, found Bashir had faked bank statements designed to suggest Princess Diana was under surveillance - to win the trust of her brother Earl Spencer, and eventually gain access to the princess for the 1995 Panorama interview.\nAs media interest in the interview increased, the BBC covered up what it had learned about how Bashir secured the interview, the inquiry said.\nThe Duke of Cambridge said his mother was failed \"not just by a rogue reporter\" but by BBC bosses.\nThe BBC rehired Bashir as religion correspondent in 2016, when questions had already been asked about his conduct. \nIt said the post was filled after a competitive interview process. \nBut Mr Knight, chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, told the House of Commons on Monday the BBC rehired and promoted Bashir \"who they know was a liar.\"\nHe said: \"My sources suggest Mr Bashir wasn't interviewed, he was simply appointed. Hardly a highly competitive process.\"\nHowever, the BBC said Mr Knight was not correct on that point, adding: \"We can confirm there was an interview process for this position, and that Martin Bashir was interviewed as part of that.\"\nMr Knight also said the Dyson report left more unanswered questions such as \"who was precisely involved in the 25-year cover-up and instituted the action against whistleblowers?\"\nHe also asked: \"Was Bashir rehired in essence so that he would keep his mouth shut?\"\nBashir, who was promoted to religion editor after his rehiring, has since resigned without a pay-off.\nThe BBC board said in a statement it hoped to ensure the \"mistakes of the past\" could not be repeated.\n\"We accepted Lord Dyson's findings in full and reiterate the apology we have offered to all those affected by the failings identified,\" it said. \n\"We recognise the impact that the events it describes has had on so many people, not least those whose lives were personally affected by what happened. We also acknowledge that audiences had a right to expect better from the BBC.\"\nThe board said it had \"confidence\" that the \"processes and guidelines in today's BBC are much stronger than they were in 1995\".\nBut it said \"it is right that we review the effectiveness of the BBC's editorial policies and governance in detail\".\nDame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom's chief executive, said: \"We've told the BBC that we expect its review to draw from a range of broadcasting expertise. We have also highlighted the need for greater openness and transparency at the BBC in order to maintain public trust, and will pay close attention to the review as it proceeds.\"\nBBC chairman Richard Sharp told the BBC's World at One: \"I take comfort from the fact that Martin Bashir is no longer here. I don't take comfort yet from understanding why he was rehired. We will find that out.\"\nAsked what he knew of Bashir's rehiring, including whether due diligence was carried out, he said: \"I actually don't know, that is being examined by the executive and they will report to the board on that. \"I want to see the facts.\"\nMr Sharp said that there was \"no doubt... that the practices adopted in advance of the interview were entirely unacceptable in any ethical news journalism broadcasting entity, and that was a clear failure\".\nHe added: \"It's also clear that the approach to reviewing the programme and the practices failed. And that's a separate failure which was identified in the prince's statement to do with governance, accountability and scrutiny.\"\nMr Whittingdale told the Commons on Monday the government should not interfere in editorial decisions, but ensure there was \"a strong and robust system of governance at the BBC with effective external oversight.\"\nHe said: \"The BBC has been and should be a beacon, setting standards to which others can aspire. That it has fallen short so badly has damaged its reputation both here and across the world.\"\nMr Whittingdale said there was \"no question of dismantling the BBC or defunding it\".\nThe BBC now needs urgently to demonstrate that these failings have been addressed and that this can never happen again, he said.\nThe Panorama interview featured Princess Diana giving an extraordinarily frank account of her marriage to the Prince of Wales, famously saying \"there were three of us in this marriage\" - a reference to her husband's affair with the future Duchess of Cornwall and admitting to an affair of her own.\nRichard Sharp's intervention is significant partly because it is the first time a BBC figure has spoken since Prince William's statement.\nHe made clear that his concern was not only the (lack of) integrity of the original broadcast, but the \"culture\" that allowed Bashir's deceit and the subsequent \"woeful\" investigation.\nThe focus of this story is moving on, as Sharp acknowledged, to why Bashir was rehired by the BBC in 2016.\nHe was an employee of the BBC until this month.\nAs the clamour for reforms grow, this re-entry of Bashir to the BBC, and his subsequent promotion, undermines any hopes the corporation had that it could argue this all belongs to the past.\nJames Harding, who was director of BBC News when Bashir was rehired, said last week that he had not known the journalist had forged bank statements and, had he known, \"he wouldn't have got the job\".\nAsked about whether he had consulted then-director general Lord Hall about the reappointment, Mr Harding, who left the BBC at the beginning of 2018, did not answer directly but said he himself took responsibility for Bashir's rehiring.\nLord Dyson's report, published last Thursday, said the BBC had fallen short of \"high standards of integrity and transparency\" over the interview.\nThe report said an internal BBC investigation in 1996, led by Lord Hall, into the initial complaints had been \"woefully ineffective\". \nThe independent inquiry was commissioned by the BBC last year, after Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, questioned Bashir's tactics to get the interview.\nLord Dyson found that Bashir had lied to BBC managers about deceiving Earl Spencer with the forged bank statements. \nThe inquiry said Bashir told his bosses he had not shown the fake documents to anyone.\nThe report described significant parts of Bashir's account of the events of 1995 as \"incredible, unreliable, and in some cases dishonest\".\nBashir has said mocking up the documents \"was a stupid thing to do\" and that he regretted it, but said they had had no bearing on Diana's decision to be interviewed.\nSpeaking to the Sunday Times, Bashir said he was \"deeply sorry\" to her sons, the dukes of Cambridge and Sussex.\nBut he rejected Prince William's claim that he had fuelled her paranoia, saying they were close and he \"loved\" her.\nFollowing the report's publication, the Duke of Cambridge said the deception fuelled his mother's paranoia and worsened his parents' relationship. \nDue to the way it was obtained, Prince William has said the interview should not be shown again."

      "text": "Discount supermarket Lidl has been ordered to stop selling a redesigned gin bottle that looks too similar to an upmarket rival.\nA senior judge has told the retailer the redesign of its Hampstead gin breaches the trademarks of premium brand Hendrick's.\nAt the Court of Session in Edinburgh, Lord Clark awarded an interim interdict to the makers of Hendrick's gin. \nThe temporary order stops Lidl selling the redesigned bottles in Scotland.\nThe decision comes just months after M&S took action against Aldi over its Colin the Caterpillar cake lookalike.\nIt argued the supermarket's Cuthbert the Caterpillar cake infringed its Colin the Caterpillar trademark, that their similarities led consumers to believe they were of the same standard and that the product \"rode on the coat-tails\" of M&S's reputation.\nWilliam Grant and Sons Irish Brands Ltd instructed lawyers to to take legal steps, believing the retail giant's Hampstead gin brand resembled their own product, which is distilled in the Ayrshire town of Girvan. \nThe company claimed the supermarket redesigned the Hampstead gin bottle to resemble the \"apothecary-style bottle\" used by Hendrick's. \nThe legal team argued that the redesign changed the colour of the diamond-shaped label from white to a similar pale colour used on the bottle in the Hendrick's trademark.\nThey argued that the look of the label was changed to look like the Hendrick's label and the bottle was changed to a similar dark colour.\nThe lawyers also said the redesign contained images of cucumbers which alluded to the fact that Hendrick's was infused with cucumber.\nWilliam Grant's lawyers asked for a temporary order which would force Lidl to stop selling the redesigned Hampstead gin. The firm feared sales of Hendrick's gin could be harmed by the cheaper rival.\nLord Clark agreed and said that the drinks firm's legal team shown there was a case that Lidl had breached section 10 (3) Trade Marks Act 1994.\nIn a written judgement issued on Tuesday, Lord Clark wrote: \"I accept that the pursuer in the present case has not (as yet) provided a sufficient basis to show a reasonable prospect of success in establishing a change in the economic behaviour of the average consumer or a serious likelihood that such a change will occur in the future. I do however recognise that there is at least some risk to the pursuer of harm to the brand. \n\"I take that factor into account and find that there is a reasonable prospect of success for the pursuer in showing that the defenders intended to benefit from the reputation and goodwill of the pursuer's mark. \n\"Whether or not there was a deliberate intention to deceive, there is a sufficient basis for showing that there was an intention to benefit. It is difficult to view the re-design, including the change in colour of the bottle, as accidental or coincidental. \n\"I therefore conclude that there is a reasonable prospect of success on the part of the pursuer in showing a change in economic behaviour or a real likelihood of such a change by customers who buy from Lidl.\"\nDuring an earlier court hearing, social media comments about the redesign of Hampstead gin, which retails for \u00a315.99, were read out. \nOne said: \"Hmmm...Reminds me of another gin, but I just can't put my finger on it...\" - which was followed by laughing emojis).\nAnother person commented: \"Looks a lot like another bottle of gin\" - which was followed by a winking emoji.\nIn his judgement, Lord Clark said that Lidl could sell the Hampstead gin brand but in a form which differs from its current design. \nLidl said it was disappointed by the ruling. \nA spokesman said: \"We note the court's decision and have closely adhered to the requirements outlined within the ruling.\n\"We continue to liaise directly with the parties involved and hope to reach a satisfactory resolution in due course.\""

      "tags": "Schools,Florida,Dress code,United States",
      "text": "A Florida high school is facing a backlash for altering the yearbook photos of 80 female students to add clothing to their chests and shoulders.\nThe school district told local media the changes were made to ensure the photos met the dress code, which says girls' shirts must be \"modest\".\nBut critics pointed to yearbook photos of male students left unedited despite violating the same standards. \nThe digital alterations were made without permission, the students say.\nBartram Trail High School's yearbook co-ordinator - a female teacher - made the decision to edit the photos after determining they had violated the dress code, the St Johns County school district said.\nA disclaimer on Bartram Trail's website warns students that their yearbook photos may be digitally edited to be consistent with the dress code. \nBut some students have called the alterations distressing and accused the school of sexism.\n\"The double standard in the yearbook is more so that they looked at our body and thought just a little bit of skin showing was sexual,\" Bartram Trail student Riley O'Keefe, 15, told CBS affiliate WJAX News.\n\"But then they looked at the boys, for the swim team photos and other sports photos and thought that was fine, and that's really upsetting and uncomfortable.\"\nIn a statement to WJAX, the district said the school's previous policy was to remove all photos that violated the dress code, and this year's edits were to make sure all students were included.\nFollowing the criticism, Bartram Trail, a government-run high school near Jacksonville with about 2,500 students, has said they will issue refunds for the $100 (\u00a370) yearbook to parents upset by the changes. \nThe district's dress code for the 2020-2021 school year says that girls' tops and shirts \"must cover the entire shoulder\" and must be \"modest and not revealing or distracting\". \"Excessive make-up\" is not permitted and all students are prohibited from donning \"extreme hairstyles\". \nEnforcement of the dress code differs between schools, according to the district. \nBartram Trail's application of these rules stirred local controversy earlier this year when 31 students received dress code violations in a single day. Several of the female students - around 15 and 16 years old - said at the time they were asked to unzip their sweaters and jackets in front of teachers and other students to reveal tank tops and bras underneath. \nIn response, Riley created an online petition asking for changes to the dress code which, she says, \"is clearly based on the sexualisation of young women\". With the code making national headlines again, the petition now has more than 5,000 signatures. \nUS dress codes have been criticised in recent years, with some saying they are applied in ways that shame young women and girls about their bodies. \nA 2018 study in Washington, DC, by the National Women's Law Center found that black girls and students with curvier bodies were disproportionately targeted. \nRiley's mother, Stephanie Fabre, told the BBC the incident \"drew attention to something that wasn't a problem to begin with\".\n\"Nobody would have looked at that yearbook and looked at these pictures and thought anything of them other than they were beautiful ninth graders,\" she says.\n\"Some of these edits have drawn mass bullying and emotional stress on some of these girls, because their pictures were so poorly photoshopped that they're being used as memes now and circulating on Snapchat, and that's horrible.\"\nMs Fabre added that some families are demanding an apology from the school, changes to the dress code and a reissue of the yearbooks with the original photos.\nBut not all parents are against the rules. Another Bartram mother, Rachel D'aquin, told WJAX that she approved of the edits.\n\"If parents aren't teaching at home how daughters should dress and dress decently, then the school has to parent.\""

      "text": "Texas legislators have passed a bill which would allow most people to carry concealed handguns without a permit. \nCurrent state rules require those carrying handguns to have a licence, training and background checks.\nBut Texas's Republican-run senate has voted to drop the restrictions, despite warnings from gun control groups that the measures could put lives at risk.\nSupporters say the new measures would allow Texans to better defend themselves in public.\nThe bill has been sent to Governor Greg Abbott, who has said he will sign it into law.\nTexas has some of the loosest gun laws in the US and already allows rifles to be carried in public without a licence.\nThe new measure would allow anyone aged 21 or older to carry a handgun unless they have past criminal convictions or legal restrictions on them.\nSupporters of the new rules, often known as \"constitutional carry\", say they would allow Texans to better defend themselves in public and abolish unnecessary limits on the constitutional right to bear arms.\n\"This is a simple restoration of Texans' constitutional right under the Second Amendment, a right of the people to keep and bear arms,\" state Senator Charles Schwertner, a Republican, said on Monday, the Texas Tribune reports.\nCritics say the bill puts lives at risk. Beverly Powell, a Democratic senator, raised safety concerns from some law enforcement groups that opposed the bill.\n\"If I sit down at a restaurant with a gentleman or a woman who has a holster on their side and a gun in it, I want to know that person is well-trained in the use of that gun,\" she said.\nGun control groups point to mass shootings in Texas in recent years. Two shootings in August 2019 killed 30 people, a shooting at a high school in 2018 left 10 people dead and 27 people were killed in a shooting at a church in 2017.\nThe bill would still allow businesses to ban guns on their property and keep federal background checks for some gun purchases.\nAfter passing in a 18-13 vote in the senate on Monday, the bill will now go to Mr Abbott, who has already indicated that he will sign it into law.\n\"We should have 'constitutional carry' in Texas,\" he told local radio last month."

      "title": "Max Mosley: Privacy campaigner and ex-motorsport boss dies at 81",
      "text": "Former motorsport boss Max Mosley, who later became a privacy campaigner, has died aged 81.\nEx-Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone said it was \"like losing a brother\".\nMr Mosley, who had been suffering from cancer, led motorsport's governing body the FIA from 1993 to 2009.\nHe also campaigned for tighter press regulation after winning \u00a360,000 damages from the News of the World when it wrongly published a story alleging he had attended a Nazi-themed orgy.\nMr Mosley, in his role as FIA president, initiated widespread reforms of safety procedures in Formula 1 following the death of Ayrton Senna in 1994.\nMr Ecclestone added: \"He did, a lot of good things not just for motorsport, also the [car] industry. He was very good in making sure people built cars that were safe.\"\nCurrent FIA president Jean Todt said in a tweet he was \"deeply saddened\" by the news, adding that Mr Mosley \"strongly contributed to reinforcing safety on track and on the roads\".\nMeanwhile, a spokesman for F1 described Mr Mosley as \"a huge figure in the transition\" of the sport. \nMr Mosley - the son of 1930s British fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley - took his privacy action against Sunday tabloid the News of the World in 2008 over the paper's story.\nThe newspaper had secretly filmed him with five prostitutes and later published a front-page story.\nA judge ruled there was no substance to the allegation that there had been a Nazi theme to the sex party and found that his privacy had been breached. The High Court also said the article was not in the public interest.\nAlthough Mr Mosley was awarded damages, everyone had learned the details of his sexual preferences, and he argued money alone could not restore his reputation.\nHe went on to seek reform of celebrity privacy laws, making a bid in 2011 for newspapers to warn people before exposing their private lives. \nHis case was unsuccessful, but it led Mr Mosley to use some of his family fortune to support victims of the Fleet Street phone-hacking scandal.\nHe also backed the independent press regulator Impress through a family charity, which Mr Mosley set up in his son Alexander's memory, after he died in 2009.\nMr Mosley said in 2011 that the story had a \"very bad effect\" on Alexander, whose death was ruled as being due to non-dependent drug abuse.\nImpress chief executive Ed Procter said Mr Mosley improved access to justice for victims of press misconduct and put \"his own resources behind efforts to ensure that these issues will not be forgotten\".\nHacked Off, which was set up in response to phone-hacking, said it was thanks to Mr Mosley's \"courage and generosity that the movement for a more ethical press remains so effective today\".\nAnd media lawyer Mark Stephens, who represented phone-hacking victims, described Mr Mosley as \"effectively the author of modern privacy law\".\nMax Mosley was one of the most influential and important figures in motorsport over the last half-century - and also among the most controversial.\nWith a brilliant intellect and a devious, sometimes malicious mind, he was arguably better suited to a career in politics.\nBut he was the son of the 1930s British fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley, and in his youth was involved in his father's post-war political party the Union Movement. He realised his personal history would prevent him from entering Parliament, so he directed his attention towards motorsport instead.\nMosley was a fascinating and contradictory character. Urbane and charming, he was never less than engaging on a personal level.\nBut not everyone felt so kindly towards this patrician and sometimes patronising figure. Mosley had a vindictive streak. His political and legal abilities were widely admired, but not everyone found him easy to like.\nBorn in London on 13 April, 1940, Mr Mosley studied physics at Christ Church, Oxford, and later turned to law and became a barrister.\nAfter a brief career as a racing driver in the late 1960s, in which he rose to race in Formula 2, he co-founded the racing car constructor March in 1970 with Robin Herd, Alan Rees and Graham Coaker - the company name formed from the initial letters of their surnames.\nThe company won its first three Formula 1 races in 1970 and later diversified into other forms of motorsport, but by the end of 1977 Mr Mosley had left the company to work full-time in motorsport politics.\nHe joined forces with Bernie Ecclestone at the Formula 1 Constructors' Association (FOCA) and the two fought a bitter political war for control of the sport with the governing body, then called FISA, in 1980 and 1981.\nThe arguments were finally settled with the so-called Concorde Agreement, which essentially set up the structure of the sport that remains in place to this day - FOCA, later to be renamed F1, held the commercial rights, while FISA controlled the rules.\nMr Mosley left motorsport in 1982 to work for the Conservative Party but returned four years later to become president of the FISA manufacturers' commission.\nHe used the role as a springboard to launch a bid for the presidency of FISA in 1991. Mr Mosley then became president of its parent body the FIA, the international automobile federation, when the two were merged in 1993.\nHe quickly established a modus operandi as a president who was proactive, provocative and controversial.\nIn 1993, he instigated a ban on driver aids such as traction control and active suspension against the wishes of the teams. And his combative approach, in which he used a vast intellect to devise clever strategy and often Machiavellian tactics, continued over his near two-decade stay in his role.\nHis biggest challenge came a year later, when Ayrton Senna was killed in an accident at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix that was broadcast live around the world - just 24 hours after Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger died in a crash during qualifying for the same race.\nAs a global sporting icon, and an almost God-like figure in his native Brazil, Mr Senna's death raised serious questions about safety in Formula 1, and world leaders contacted Mr Mosley questioning the sport's position.\nRecognising the threat to the sport's existence, Mr Mosley introduced a series of changes to the cars, setting in motion a new approach whereby the safety of the drivers and spectators was central to the ethos of motorsport and attempts were made to constantly improve it.\nIn this, he was backed by Mr Ecclestone, and supported by the FIA medical delegate Professor Sid Watkins and the FIA F1 director Charlie Whiting. Together they changed the face of the sport.\nAs FIA president he also turned his attention to road cars, and was central in introducing the EuroNCAP crash testing programme. \nThis required manufacturers to meet minimum safety standards in their cars for the first time and has played a significant role in reducing the number of deaths in road accidents.\nBut the longer Mr Mosley remained in situ, the more F1 teams began to become uncomfortable with what they saw as an authoritarian and arbitrary approach, along with sometimes questionable methods and motives.\nMr Mosley's reputation with the F1 teams was badly damaged by his deal to remove the TV rights to F1 from Foca and sell them on a 100-year lease to Mr Ecclestone's companies for what many considered to be a paltry one-off figure of $360m in 1995.\nHis antagonistic style of running the sport continued through the 2000s and the beginning of the end of his time at the FIA came with the News Of The World's story.\nHe survived the initial outcry but when in 2009 he tried to introduce a budget cap into F1, the big teams had had enough.\nThe latest of many political fights began, and this time Mr Mosley lost. The major teams and car manufacturers threatened to set up a rival championship, and to bring them back into the fold Mr Mosley had to agree not to seek a further term as president when his latest one expired in October 2009."
