      "text": "In February last year, when people brought coronavirus home to Wales from half-term holidays in Europe, things \"got much more real very, very quickly\", Health Minister Vaughan Gething says.\nThe first Welsh case was confirmed on 28 February in someone who had been to northern Italy.\nPreparations ramped up over the next two weeks. By 13 March routine NHS work was put on hold.\nBut political opponents at the time said there was a lack of urgency. They wanted schools shut and big gatherings cancelled.\nEven after the Welsh Rugby Union called off the match against Scotland on 14 March, ministers said their scientific advice did not show it would save lives.\nAfter that weekend the situation changed.\nStartling research said the NHS would face colossal pressure without drastic action.\nThe following Monday - the day Wales' first coronavirus-related death was announced - Mr Gething was at an emergency UK government meeting in Whitehall.\nEven before then he says \"we knew that we were going to have a significant impact, but didn't still understand quite how big an impact it would have at that point\".\nMr Gething recalls being shown papers in an emergency briefing room at the Welsh government's headquarters in Cathays Park, Cardiff.\n\"Eye-watering numbers\" were being talked about, he says.\n\"The reasonable worst case scenario was genuine apocalypse - you know, hundreds of thousands of deaths in a year.\"\nSo did they miss an opportunity to act sooner?\nAn earlier lockdown could have saved more lives, Mr Gething says, but he can't say when it ought to have happened.\n\"At that time we made choices based on the best evidence and science,\" he says.\n\"If we had the evidence we have now, we would make different choices.\n\"I think we'd have gone into lockdown earlier.\"\nConservative shadow health minister Angela Burns says the Welsh government could have acted more nimbly, for example by buying personal protective equipment (PPE) sooner.\n\"But, you know, we have got to remember this came out of leftfield,\" she says.\n\"We can look back with hindsight and say an awful lot of mistakes were made, but I think that in the heat of the moment, trying to work out what to do best, how serious it was, I think is a very difficult call.\"\nRhun ap Iorwerth, of Plaid Cymru, says the lockdown came too late, but he claims years of failing to prepare the health and care sector meant the crisis hit harder.\n\"These are the issues that were deeply, deeply ingrained and they came back to bite us in a horrific way that we've learned over the past year,\" he says.\nWelsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds says the devolved administrations had limited room to manoeuvre last spring.\n\"I think it would have been very difficult for us to have made a unilateral decision at that point,\" she says. \n\"We are an island and we have to operate in that way.\"\nIn March and April, more than a thousand patients were discharged from hospital into care homes without a test.\nBy the time routine testing was introduced in care homes last April, many had suffered devastating losses.\nThe same policy of discharging without a test, described by a Commons report as an \"appalling\" error, was adopted in England.\nBut Mr Gething rejects the findings of a Senedd committee which concluded care homes were \"badly let down\" because the government responded too slowly.\n\"I think the health committee were wrong\", the minister says.\nHe points to research that found coronavirus outbreaks in care homes could not be blamed on patients who were discharged to free up hospital beds. The size and type of home was a much bigger factor, it found.\nOpponents are unconvinced.\nThe policy was \"total lunacy\", says Mrs Burns, while Mr ap Iorwerth says he has \"no doubt\" it was a mistake.\nBy now, Wales and the UK are among the best-performing nations for mass coronavirus testing, according to a report this month.\nBut it took until last summer to build a mass-testing system.\nMr Gething says Public Health Wales ordered testing material in January, but imports were \"held up in other countries beyond our control\".\nLocal lockdowns and the Wales-wide firebreak in late October and November could not stop a second wave. They could only delay it.\nFor Plaid Cymru, Mr ap Iorwerth maintains a longer firebreak \"would have been useful\".\nMrs Burns, of the Welsh Conservatives, says there was \"a little bit too much jumping around\" between national and local restrictions in the autumn.\nIn December, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the firebreak \"did everything we hoped it would\" by suppressing the virus for three weeks, but a sense of \"fatigue\" meant not everyone was following the strict rules.\nSoon it was clear a new more infectious variant was spreading rapidly, plunging the whole of the UK back into lockdown by Christmas.\nMore than half of Welsh adults have had a first dose as part of one of the world's fastest vaccine programmes.\nBut Mrs Burns credits a \"masterstroke\" by Boris Johnson's UK government.\nLast summer it started ordering big supplies of vaccines before it knew whether any of them would actually work.\nThe gamble has \"paid off - and look at us compared to so many other parts of the world\", Mrs Burns says.\nMr Gething also applauds the UK government's decision.\nHe says: \"I think they have got a number of things wrong. But actually the way they went about looking to procure vaccines early, it was the right call.\"\nEventually there will be an inquiry into how the pandemic was handled.\nMark Drakeford says the Welsh government's actions should be scrutinised as part of a UK-wide inquiry.\nBut Mr ap Iorwerth says that's \"dodging responsibility\" and a Welsh inquiry is needed.\nFor the Liberal Democrats, Ms Dodds says there should be Welsh and UK inquiries, as do Conservatives in the Senedd.\nWhat sort of inquiry and when are decisions for the winners of May's Senedd election.\nBut they'll have to keep battling the crisis too, says Mr Gething.\n\"With all the success that we've seen in our vaccination program there are still really difficult days ahead of us,\" he says.\n\"Whoever is the next government will have some very difficult choices to make if we're going to keep Wales safe.\""

      "tags": "Policing,Domestic abuse",
      "text": "UK police forces have received more than 800 allegations of domestic abuse against officers and staff over the last five years, BBC research has revealed.\nJust 43 cases - about 5% of the total - were prosecuted. \nVictims of domestic abuse have told the BBC they do not believe their complaints were properly investigated.  \nThe National Police Chiefs Council said there was \"no place in policing for people who abuse others\".\nIn April, the BBC revealed the Metropolitan Police was investigating allegations that a serving officer raped two of his female colleagues.\nThe officer was not charged and has not been suspended but is on restricted duties pending a misconduct hearing more than three years after the allegations were reported.  \nThe women were awarded compensation but one of them says \"we were just cast aside and not cared for\".\nSince then more than 20 other police officers and staff from across the UK have contacted the BBC with their own stories of domestic abuse by colleagues. \nThey told Radio 4's File on 4 programme they were concerned how police deal with domestic violence allegations made against their own officers.\nSarah, a Met officer who doesn't want to be identified, says she was abused by an older, more senior male colleague with whom she had a baby.\nDescribing one attack she endured she said he burst into their bedroom and began pulling her hair and shaking her head around.\n\"He then punched me in the arm, and then a couple of like open hand strikes on my back and threw me on the floor. And it was only when the baby was crying that he then stopped. I had bruising from the top of my bum all the way down to my knee on the side of my leg where he slammed the door on me.\"\nSarah ended the relationship and reported the incident months later to Kent Police. She showed officers a photo of the bruising, which the BBC has seen. \nBut an official police report concluded she had fallen against the door and Sarah was told it was too late to press charges.\nThe male officer was served with a non-molestation order to stop him contacting Sarah but he was allowed to visit their home to pick up his belongings accompanied by another officer.\nKent Police later apologised for the visit.\n\"I didn't feel safe despite working in a police building surrounded by police officers,\" she said. \"If anything I felt more at risk because he was able to manipulate colleagues into checking on me or intimidating me. It felt just as scary as my home had been.\"\nThe male officer was later arrested and charged with breaching an injunction. The case then went to court but Sarah was told Kent Police had failed to send over all the evidence in time. Instead of a  conviction, the court issued a restraining order.\nIn a statement the force said: \"The public should be assured that reports of domestic abuse to Kent Police - no matter the circumstances - will be handled in a sensitive and compassionate way with investigations carried out to the highest possible standard.\"\nHer employer, the Metropolitan police said tackling domestic abuse was a priority, including when its own staff are accused. \nThe victims who contacted the BBC were all unhappy about the way the police investigated their complaints.\n'Lucy' spent 10 years working on domestic abuse cases but resigned over the way she says her force treated victims.\n\"We know there are going to be bad officers. But actually, we don't deal with them in the right way,\" she said. \"And we're letting down victims to be further victimised, pushed out and be silenced. I just couldn't stay. I'd rather be unemployed and poor than to continue serving that kind of organisation.\"\nLucy believes police officers are often unwilling to investigate each other. \n\"They have that almost unconscious bias towards believing their colleagues wouldn't do it,\" she said.\nShe said she also believes offending officers are effective at covering their tracks. \"They're aware of the criminal justice system, so they will know things like what kind of evidence is required to meet a charge... how to potentially clean a crime scene, where to target injuries...They are untouchable.\"\nLouisa Rolfe of The National Police Chiefs Council said: \"Policing relies on the confidence of victims for us to do our job and to do our job effectively. \n\"There is no place in policing for people who abuse others. The vast majority of us are very intolerant of this and are horrified.\"\nShe added: \"Prosecuting people for domestic abuse, whether they are police officers or in all walks of life, is something that we are really focussed on but does prove challenging.\"\nDavid Tucker of the College of Policing, said: \"Our guidance is clear that police officers and staff who are suspected of domestic abuse-related offences should not be treated differently to any other suspect.\"\nHe said the college recommended considering involving another force in investigations in appropriate cases of police domestic abuse.\nThe college is currently leading an investigation into how allegations of domestic abuse - where officers are suspects - are being treated, with a report due at the end of the year.\nIn the last five years, 829 allegations of domestic abuse have been made against police officers or staff, according to a freedom of information request by File on Four. \nVictims Commissioner Dame Vera Baird said when an allegation is made against an officer it should be sent immediately to another force to investigate it independently. \n\"That is the only way to satisfy the outsider from this very collective, centralised, hierarchical, brotherly organisation... And frankly, in my view, it is the only way they'll get a good investigation,\" she said.\n\"It's imperative an independent investigation is carried out into the allegation just as you should for any allegation.\" "

      "text": "US actress Lisa Banes has died aged 65 after being involved in a scooter collision in New York, police confirmed on Tuesday.\nBanes was perhaps best known for playing Marybeth Elliott, the mother of Amy - the titular Gone Girl in David Fincher's 2014 psychological thriller.\nShe also appeared in films like Cocktail and A Cure for Wellness.\nActor and director Seth MacFarlane led the tributes, saying her death was \"a tremendous loss\".\nNew York police confirmed to the BBC that Banes was hit by a scooter as she walked across a pedestrian crossing in Manhattan on 4 June.\nSuffering from a head injury, she was taken to hospital, and subsequently died on Monday.\n\"The scooter then fled the location, continuing northbound,\" the NYPD [New York Police Department] said in a statement.\n\"There are no arrests and the investigation remains ongoing.\"\nHer wife Kathryn Kranhold paid tribute on Twitter.\nBanes hailed from Cleveland, Ohio and rose to prominence in the 1980s in a variety of TV shows and Broadway stage plays. But it was for her role as Marybeth Elliott, the mother of Rosamund Pike's character Amy Elliott in Gone Girl, that she became known to a wider audience.\nThe film found Banes' character's son-in-law, Ben Affleck's Nick Dunne, become the prime suspect in the sudden disappearance of his wife, Amy.\nIt received four Golden Globe nominations, including best actress for Pike.\nSpeaking to reporters on the red carpet ahead of the Gone Girl premiere in 2014, Banes said she embraced the character right away.\n\"I have an affinity for her,\" she smiled. \"You know she's a good WASP [White Anglo-Saxon Protestant] - so it sort of seeped in right away.\"\nShe added: \"The wonderful thing about this movie is not everything you work on everyone is sort of together, having a good time. We all just bonded so much.\"\n\"We really dig each other and that's like gold, you can't buy that,\" she noted.\nBane's other big screen credits included Gore Verbinski's A Cure for Wellness, and Freedom Writers; while she made TV appearances in shows like Trials of Rosie O'Neill, The King of Queens and Six Feet Under.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Social care workers should be paid at least \u00a310 an hour, Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives have said.\nPlaid Cymru called for \"equality of treatment for health and social care staff\".\nIn a Senedd debate the Welsh Conservatives called for a reformed pay settlement for the sector.\nIt comes after a minister said workers could get the \"Real Living Wage\" rate if Labour formed the next Welsh government after May's Senedd election.\nSocial care is funded by local councils, through the cash they get from the Welsh Government and council tax.\nCare workers are not subject to the same overarching pay deals agreed with staff working in the NHS.\nThe Real Living Wage is currently rated at \u00a39.50 an hour - Plaid said while all health workers earn at least the real living wage, that is not the case in the care sector.\nIt is higher than the National Living Wage, which is \u00a38.72 for over 25s. The Living Wage foundation says the Real Living Wage is the only rate based on what people need to live.\nPlaid Cymru's Senedd motion calling for a minimum of \u00a310 an hour for social care workers and criticising the UK government's recommendation on health care pay failed to pass - with nine votes for, and 38 against.\nIt comes as Health Minister Vaughan Gething announced a new bonus payment for health and social care staff.\nAhead of the debate called by Plaid on Wednesday, Mr ap Iorwerth said: \"If the other political parties in Wales are serious about this, they will have the chance to back Plaid Cymru's motion in the Senedd today, and commit to delivering a reformed pay and retention settlement for health and social care staff, including a guaranteed minimum of \u00a310 an hour for care workers.\"\nConservative health spokeswoman Angela Burns said the Welsh Conservatives would implement the \"full recommendations\" of the NHS pay review body \"as an absolute minimum\".\nShe added: \"That would be in tandem with our commitment to introduce a reformed pay and retention settlement for health and social care staff, including on a recruit, retain and retrain policy, and a minimum salary of \u00a310 an hour for care staff.\"\nWelsh Labour's Health Minister Vaughan Gething said his government do not want \"improved pay to be introduced that is then offset by poorer terms and conditions\".\n\"The majority of care and support is commissioned, and the current arrangements tend to result in low, minimum wages for our front-line workforce.\" \nOn Tuesday, Health Minister Vaughan Gething ruled out tax rises to improve social care \"in the near future\".\nMinisters had started looking at proposals to fund social care, including tax rises, prior to the pandemic.\nInstead, he said an incoming government could \"work towards\" introducing the real living wage at an estimated cost of \u00a319m in the first year."

It's an incredibly rare sighting.\"\n\"I think people will travel to see it, people are looking at it as a once-in-a-century bird,\" he said.\nEgyptian vultures can be found in parts of southern Spain and northern France.\nProf Bearhop said he believed it was likely the bird came from France and became confused while migrating for some reason. \nThe bird of prey is in decline worldwide, making the sighting even rarer. \nIt has been featured in Egyptian hieroglyphs, and is one of the only birds of prey known to use tools when hunting.\nThe identification of the species will be done by the British Birds Rarities Committee, and then passed to the British Ornithologists Union Records Committee to be verified or not as a true wild bird sighting.\nFollow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "text": "Arlene Foster has urged Northern Ireland's political parties to stick to a language and cultural deal they agreed to in January 2020.\nSpeaking in the Stormont assembly ahead of her resignation as first minister on Monday, Mrs Foster said the deal was \"the only model for success\".\nSinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald said the UK government had to move a law on Irish language through Westminster.\nThe issue has long been a sticking point for Stormont's political parties.\nMrs Foster's departure as first minister came six weeks after she was ousted as Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader.\nIn her statement to the assembly, she also said she would continue to speak up for women in public life.\nWhen Mrs Foster resigned, Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle O'Neill also lost her position as deputy first minister because the roles are a joint office.\nThere is now a seven-day period for the approval of a new first minister and deputy first minister by the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in.\nSinn F\u00e9in has suggested it may not support a new DUP first minister unless legislation on the Irish language is approved by ministers before 10 July.\nMrs Foster said parties should support the deal on culture - which included language legislation - in the New Decade, New Approach deal, which restored devolution to Northern Ireland in January 2020.\nShe said: \"My team and I sought and secured a cultural package that would see a range of measures to advance identities and protect them for future generations.\n\"This is the only model for success - not one step forward for some and one step back for others.\"\nThe deal included an Office of Identity and Cultural Expression, an Irish language commissioner and a commissioner to enhance and develop the language and culture of the Ulster-Scots/Ulster-British tradition.\nOn Monday morning Edwin Poots, who replaced Mrs Foster as DUP leader last month, said he intended to support Irish language legislation but not necessarily before the next assembly election in May 2022.\nSpeaking after a Sinn F\u00e9in meeting with the UK government on Monday evening, Ms McDonald said her party would have preferred the legislation to be delivered through the Stormont as agreed.\nShe said Sinn F\u00e9in had \"engaged intensively\" with Mr Poots and his party.\n\"He has told us that they will not be delivering [the legislation] during the existing assembly mandate,\" she said.\n\"It is now incumbent on the British and Irish governments to act.\"\nSpeaking in the assembly, Mrs Foster said she would now spend more time with her family \"whether they like it or not\".\n\"It's just as well, Mr Speaker, I am such a good daughter, wife and mother,\" she added, in an apparent reference to Mr Poots' statement in 2016 when Mrs Foster became first minister that her \"most important job\" remained \"that of a wife, mother and daughter\".\nMrs Foster said she had unfinished business to ensure Northern Ireland succeeded in its new century.\n\"I will contribute in whatever way I can to see Northern Ireland advance politically, socially, economically and culturally as part of the UK,\" she said.\n\"Strong, functioning devolution is vital to this.\"\nShe also called for changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol - the part of the Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland within the EU single market for goods - which she said had thrown relations between the UK and Ireland and the UK and EU \"out of balance\".\nShe said: \"If Brussels continues to think the protocol is enough, they are in denial.\n\"Imbalance and instability in the context of Northern Ireland is a truly dangerous cocktail.\n\"Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom and needs to be treated as such.\"\nShe didn't sing this time but she used a joke comparing her final speech to Father Ted Crilly's at the Golden Clerics.\nIt wasn't that - for a start there were very few barbs, although Edwin Poots was probably the target when she talked about being a better wife and mother.\nOn the issue which now threatens the existence of devolution - language - she praised the cultural package in the New Decade, New Approach Agreement, saying a step forward for one was a step backwards for others.\nAnd she took a final swipe at the Northern Ireland Protocol saying \"Northern Ireland is part of the UK and needs to be treated as such\", accusing Brussels of being in denial.\nBut that is now a problem for others.\nMrs Foster, however, says she has \"unfinished business\", whatever that will be.\nMrs Foster served as first minister from January 2016 to January 2017 - when the Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed - and again from January 2020.\nShe stood down as DUP leader after an internal party revolt, with at least 22 assembly members (MLAs) and four MPs signing a letter of no confidence.\nHer departure prompted a series of resignations within the DUP, with several councillors and party members expressing their anger about how she was ousted.\nSpeaking last week, Mrs Foster said she was sad about the manner of her departure, but was \"looking forward\" to new possibilities.\nA sitting of the assembly to nominate a new first minister and deputy first minister could take place next Monday.\nMr Poots has said he will nominate his party colleague Paul Givan to become the new first minister.\nSinn F\u00e9in must nominate a candidate for deputy first minister or a first minister is unable to take office.\nIf the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in fail to nominate first and deputy first ministers, the Northern Ireland secretary is obliged to call an election within a reasonable time.\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he feared that if the Stormont institutions collapsed they would not come back.\nHe said \"grown up\" politicians \"make a commitment and get it done\".\n\"They don't threaten the whole edifice of government just because they don't get their own way,\" he said.\nUlster Unionist leader Doug Beattie said the deadlock over language laws was a \"serious situation where our institutions could fall and our people could suffer\".\nHe called on Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP to  \"put the people first and come up with an agreement\".\nThe DUP's other new ministers affirmed the pledge of office and took up their posts on Monday afternoon.\nMichelle McIlveen replaced Peter Weir as education minister while Paul Frew took over from Diane Dodds as economy minister.\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said it was essential that the transition to new leadership was \"as smooth as possible\".\n\"The people of Northern Ireland need strong political leadership,\" he said."

      "title": "Covid-19: Scotland to delay easing restrictions and NHS to 'finish the job' on jabs",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nScotland is likely to delay its easing of Covid-19 restrictions, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. The whole country had been due to move to level zero restrictions - a \"nearly normal\" state - on 28 June, but Ms Sturgeon told MSPs she expected it to be delayed for three weeks so that more people can be vaccinated. Scotland's Covid case rate is five times the level it was in May. \"We need to buy sufficient time for vaccination to get ahead and stay ahead of the virus,\" she said. A formal decision on the delay will be made next week. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a delay to England's lockdown easing on Monday.\nFootage of a BBC journalist being abused by anti-lockdown protesters has been condemned by the prime minister. Footage shared on social media showed Newsnight political editor Nicholas Watt being followed by a crowd shouting \"traitor\" and accusing him of lying about lockdowns being legal. The crowd had gathered outside Downing Street to protest against the decision to delay England's lifting of restrictions. Boris Johnson said it was \"disgraceful to see the hounding of Nick Watt doing his job\", adding: \"The media must be able to report the facts without fear or favour - they are the lifeblood of our democracy.\"\nCovid-19 cases in Blackburn with Darwen - the location of England's worst outbreak of the Delta variant - may have peaked, figures from Public Health England suggest. The local authority area overtook Bolton in May to have the country's highest infection rate. But council leaders said surge testing and vaccinations had begun to have an impact. The infection rate appears to have peaked at 667 cases per 100,000 people in the week up to 7 June, and in the most recent figure is 599 cases per 100,000.\n\"If you can go into a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office,\" is the message from Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman. The investment bank boss told a conference he would be \"very disappointed\" if US-based workers had not returned by September. While the bank is not yet setting a minimum number of days workers have to be in the office, Mr Gorman warned that could change. \"Make no mistake about it. We do our work inside Morgan Stanley offices, and that's where we teach, that's where our interns learn, that's how we develop people,\" he said.\nAll adults in England will be able to book their first Covid vaccination by the end of the week, according to NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens. He said the health service would \"finish the job\" of the vaccination programme to the \"greatest extent possible\" over the next four weeks - with the aim to offer second doses to two-thirds of adults by 19 July when restrictions are now set to ease. So far nearly 42 million people in the UK have received their first jab while more than 30 million are fully vaccinated.

      "text": "A deep-water search for the body of a one-year-old girl, believed murdered by her father, is continuing off Tenerife in the Canary Islands.\nAn investigating judge alleges Anna Gimeno Zimmermann and her six-year-old sister Olivia were killed by their father Tom\u00e1s to \"cause the greatest pain imaginable\" to their mother.\nOlivia's body was found in the sea on Thursday, in a bag tied to an anchor.\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said the whole country was in shock.\nThere have been nationwide protests against domestic violence, with hundreds of people - especially women and children - holding dolls and soft toys in memory of the young girls.\nAnna and Olivia were reported missing on 27 April, after Mr Gimeno arranged to spend the afternoon with them. He is also missing, presumed dead by the Spanish Civil Guard.\nA nine-page report by an investigating magistrate was released on Saturday and details have been reported in the Spanish press. Based on the police investigation, it outlines what Mr Gimeno, 37, is alleged to have done leading up to his daughters' deaths, and afterwards.\nTom\u00e1s Gimeno and the girls' mother, Beatriz Zimmermann, had dated since they were teenagers but broke up last year during the pandemic. While both had formed new relationships, Mr Gimeno would send Ms Zimmermann \"offensive and insulting\" messages, the magistrate's report says.\nIt concludes that Mr Gimeno \"most likely\" murdered his daughters in a \"planned and premeditated fashion\", including leaving his pet dog, bank cards with the pin numbers, and car keys at his parents' house. He also gave his new girlfriend \u20ac6,200 ($7,500; \u00a35,400) in cash and a goodbye letter.\nThe court document alleges Mr Gimeno killed his daughters in his house on the day they were reported missing. It says he then drove their bodies to the port, sailed his boat out to deep water off the coast of Tenerife and, at about 22:30, threw bags containing the bodies overboard, having weighed them down with heavy objects.\nHe \"sought to create uncertainty as to the destination of his daughters by hiding their bodies in places... where he thought that they would never be found\", the report alleges.\n\"All of this after announcing to his ex-wife, as well as his relatives, that he was leaving with Olivia and Anna and that they would never be seen again.\"\nThe next afternoon, his boat was found drifting at sea. Anna's car seat was also discovered floating in the water.\nOlivia's body was found in the bag 44 days later, at a depth of 1,000m (3,280ft). Another bag next to it was empty.\nOn Sunday, the children's mother published an open letter to the public.\nBeatriz Zimmermann wrote that it was \"the most monstrous act a person can commit: killing their own innocent children\".\n\"When they told me the news, the world came crashing down on me, and as hard as it is, at least now I can mourn their loss,\" she said.\n\"It hurts my soul that I can't have saved their lives. I wish I had been there at that moment holding their hands so we could die together... But that couldn't be, because Tom\u00e1s wanted me to suffer searching endlessly for them all my life.\"\nThe sisters' case has shaken Spain, and there have been a number of protests against gender-based violence. \nOn Friday, about 1,000 people - mainly women and children - came out to protest in Santa Cruz de Tenerife. One young girl was holding a sign that read \"Stop killing us,\" reports Spanish daily El Pa\u00eds.\nSince 2013, 39 minors have been killed in Spain either by their father or a partner or former partner of their mother, the government says.\nThis year alone, 19 women have been killed because of gender-based violence in Spain, according to statistics from the Spanish government.\nIf you are affected by issues raised in this article, help and support from organisations in the UK is available via the BBC Action Line."

      "text": "As Wales' coronavirus death toll passes 5,000 people, we are sharing some of your tributes to those who have died with Covid-19 during the pandemic. \nCheryl Saunders, from Abercarn in Caerphilly county, spent her whole 40-year career working in the NHS as a medical secretary in respiratory medicine, first of all in Caerphilly Miners' Hospital and later at Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr in nearby Ystrad Mynach. \nShe still worked in respiratory medicine at the start of the pandemic, but was forced to stop working in the summer after being diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal - or kidney - cancer. \nThe mother-of-two and grandmother to twin three-year-old girls tested positive for coronavirus while in hospital and died, where she worked, at Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr, on 27 October 2020, at the age of 62. \nHer desk at the hospital remains empty, where a candle burns in her memory. \nTommy Owen, from Pontardawe in Neath Port Talbot, worked as a bricklayer for the local authority from his teens until his retirement at the age of 63. \nThe eldest of five, Tommy fell ill in early April after catching the virus. \nHe was taken to Singleton Hospital in Swansea, where his family were unable to see him, before he died, aged 76, on 11 April. \nHe is survived by his son and two of his siblings.\nMarried couple Sharon and Malcolm Bamford died within days of each other on the same intensive care unit at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. \nSharon worked at the hospital as a health care assistant at Singleton Hospital in Swansea for \"many years\", and in the haematology and oncology ward since 2005.\nShe died on 21 April 2020 at the age of 63, just a few days after her husband Malcolm. \nAt the time of her death, the health board said the mother-of-two was \"highly thought of by all patients\" and \"loved by her colleagues and friends within the team\". \nLike so many in Wales, coal merchant John Williams was affectionately known across his local community by his job title. \n\"John the Coal\", from Merthyr Tydfil, died at Prince Charles Hospital in his hometown on 25 November after contracting Covid-19. \nJohn was married for 52 years. \nRosalind Cadwallader spent the majority of her career working as an \"exceptional\" cook at the brickworks in Buttington, Powys, where her husband was the manager. \nAfter the works closed and her husband died, in 1999, Rosalind moved to Welshpool, before spending the final few years of her life at the Rhyallt Nursing Home in the town after the onset of Alzheimer's disease. \nA \"very generous lady who is greatly missed,\" Rosalind had three children, seven grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.\nShe died at her nursing home at the age of 88 on 24 April last year. \nCyril Barton, from Cardiff, died on 7 January 2021, aged 95, at University Hospital of Wales after contracting coronavirus shortly before Christmas. \nCyril served as a bomb aimer and bomber navigator in the RAF during World War Two, before playing a handful of matches in defence for Cardiff City after the end of the war. \nHe later worked for an advertising agency for more than 30 years. \nCyril was born in Grangetown, before moving to the Whitchurch area of Cardiff in 1955, when he bought his first and only house. \nHe was married to his wife Norma for 71 years and had two children and four grandchildren. \nHe is pictured on his 90th birthday having flown a Tiger Moth plane, 72 years after learning to do so in South Africa during the war. \nBeverley Ford, from Ferndale in Rhondda Cynon Taf, was a healthcare support worker with the learning disability service for 36 years. \nShe began working at Hensol Hospital in 1984, before moving to Brynafon Learning Disability Unit in Ferndale in 2003. \nColleagues of the 55-year-old said she was \"always going above and beyond\". \nShe died in December after contracting coronavirus. \nGillian Dare, from Caerphilly, was a care home manager, working as across several homes for Caerphilly council until her retirement 11 years ago. \nShe died on 30 December at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil at the age of 71.\nHer grandson said she was a \"caring person who was larger than life,\" who spent \"all the time she could with family\". \nRetired electrician Keith Board, from Cardiff, died with coronavirus just a few months after his 80th birthday. \nKeith was married for more than 55 years to his wife Bernice and had three children and four grandchildren. \nHis family described him as a \"social person\" who \"truly loved living and energised the room he was in with happiness\". \nKeith died at University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff on 8 October. \nFor one family, who all lived in the same block of flats in Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, coronavirus was especially devastating. \nGladys Lewis, 74, and her sons Dean, 44, and Darren, 42, each died within five days of each other last autumn after contracting the virus. \nDean's widow, Claire, told the BBC after their deaths that David Lewis was \"broken\" after losing his wife and two children. \nA joint funeral was held for the family, in order to allow them to be together, while mourners clapped the coffins on the way to church. \nStaff nurse Terry Andrews worked in hospital in Denbigh throughout his career. \nTerry died on 15 April last year at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, at the age of 75. \nHe was married to his wife for 54 years and had two children, and his family said he would \"always be our hero\". \nMargaret Thomas was inspired to be a nurse by her Auntie Mary, a midwife, before spending a career caring for people across Swansea. \nAfter being trained at the nursing school in Craig y Nos, Powys, Margaret then worked at Swansea

memories\". \nVenice May Morris, from Barmouth, Gwynedd, died on 25 January 2021 after testing positive for Covid-19. \nHer family said they will host a memorial, in which people can take part in Venice's favourite activity - bingo - as soon as they are able to do so. \nAndrew Woolhouse worked as a porter at Llandough Hospital in Cardiff. \nHe became the sixth member of staff working for the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board to die with the virus earlier this month, at the age of 55. \nThe health board's chief executive, Len Richards, said after his death that Andrew \"often went the extra mile for our patients will be missed profoundly by everyone at Cardiff and Vale UHB\".\nJohn Whitfield was born in Dorrington, Lincolnshire, in 1942, and lived there, in Yorkshire and in Buenos Aires before moving to Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, at the age of 12. \nIn Penarth, he met his wife Sandra, who he married in 1968 and with whom he had three daughters. \nJohn became a teacher

      "title": "Daniel Morgan: Last chance for family in Britain's most-investigated, unsolved murder",
      "text": "The final report into the death of Daniel Morgan - Britain's most-investigated, unsolved murder - has been published. In 1987, the private investigator was found dead in the car park of the Golden Lion pub in south London, with an axe in his head. Despite five separate police inquiries, spanning more than two decades, no-one has been convicted of his murder. \nThe family believe police corruption, and reluctance to confront it, could explain the murder and the failed investigations.\n10 March 1987\nPrivate investigator Daniel Morgan, 37, and his business partner at Southern Investigations, Jonathan Rees, meet for a drink in the Golden Lion pub in Sydenham, south-east London. Both leave the pub about 21:00.\nBy 21:30, Rees meets another man, professional bodyguard Paul Goodridge, in the Beulah Spa pub, three miles away in Crystal Palace.\nAt 21:40, a BBC sound producer pulls into the car park of the Golden Lion and finds Daniel Morgan's body. He is lying face up with an axe embedded in his head.\nDaniel's brother Alastair Morgan travels from his Hampshire home to London - to offer help, and observe the investigation.\nMarch 1987 \nDet Sgt Sid Fillery, who knows Rees and has moonlighted in the past for Southern Investigations, is initially assigned to the murder investigation. He is taken off the case after several days.\nApril 1987\nSix people are arrested on suspicion of the murder of the private investigator from Cwmbran in south Wales - including Jonathan Rees, Sid Fillery and Rees's brothers-in-law Glenn and Garry Vian. All are later released without charge.\nMay 1987\nBryan Madagan, Daniel's former employer, tells police he believes Daniel was trying to sell a story about police corruption to a newspaper. Later, others tell the family similar accounts. The family begin to suspect this may have been part of the reason Daniel was killed.\nApril 1988\nKevin Lennon, the accountant at Southern Investigations, tells the inquest that Morgan and Rees had fallen out. He believes Rees was \"determined\" to have Morgan killed with the help of his friends in the police. \nRees denies murder. Lennon's testimony is undermined when it emerges he has been convicted of tax fraud. \nThe inquest returns a verdict of unlawful killing, and the family begin raising the case with their local MPs.\n1988\nFillery leaves the Metropolitan Police and starts to work for Southern Investigations with Rees.\nHampshire Police are called in to look at the handling of the first murder inquiry, and allegations that Met Police officers could have been involved in Daniel Morgan's death. \nJuly  1988 \nUnder the supervision of the Police Complaints Authority, Hampshire Police are appointed to investigate allegations that police were involved in Morgan's murder.\nFebruary 1989\nThree arrests are made, and Rees and bodyguard Goodridge are charged with murder. \nJean Wisden, Goodridge's girlfriend, is charged with perverting the course of justice. \nIn May, all charges are dropped.\nMarch 1990\nThe Police Complaints Authority reports the findings of the Hampshire inquiry into the Met Police.\n\"No evidence of involvement by any police officer in the murder,\" is the conclusion, with \"no evidence to support [Kevin] Lennon's allegations,\" made at the 1988 inquest.\nHampshire Police also find \"no evidence to suggest any member of the murder investigation team took deliberate action to prevent the murder being properly detected\".\nThere are \"no grounds for disciplinary action against any officer [found moonlighting for Southern Investigations] other than strict admonishment\".\n1990\nRees and Fillery start working regularly for tabloid newspapers, including the News of the World.\nIn November 1997, Alastair Morgan and his local MP, the then culture secretary Chris Smith, are assured by senior Met officers, including Commissioner Sir Paul Condon, that Daniel's case will be reviewed.\nWhat happens next will lead to convictions, but not for murder.\nMet teams gather evidence - some of it covertly by bugging the south London office of Southern Investigations.\nApril 1999 \nA police bug picks up a conversation between Rees and a client. The men discuss planting drugs on the client's wife so he would get custody of their son. \nNearly six months later, several people - including Rees - are charged with conspiracy to supply Class A and B drugs, and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. \nFour people are later convicted, including Rees, who is sentenced to seven years.\nThe Morgan family keep up the pressure on the Met, and a new investigation - Operation Abelard - begins in the summer of 2001. \nPolice buy the house next door to suspect Glenn Vian, so they can conduct surveillance.\nJune 2002 \nA reward of \u00a350,000 is offered for information leading to the killer - and a reconstruction of the murder is featured on the BBC's Crimewatch. \nDet Ch Supt David Cook fronts the appeal. He will later become the case's senior investigating officer (SIO).  \nHe and his wife, police officer and Crimewatch presenter Jacqui Hames, are put under surveillance by the News of the World. Jacqui Hames later gave evidence to the Leveson inquiry - the public inquiry into the practices of the British press following the phone hacking scandal. She said there was \"in some way some collusion between people at the News of the World, and people who are suspected of committing the murder of Daniel Morgan\".\nOctober 2002\nJames Cook and the Vian brothers are arrested on suspicion of murder. In December, Rees is questioned in prison.\nSeptember 2003\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) says there is insufficient evidence for a murder prosecution. \nOctober 2004\nFrustrated yet again, the Morgan family secure a meeting with the minister responsible for policing, Hazel Blears, to call for a public inquiry into Daniel's case. Their request is refused.\nOctober 2005\nDaniel's murder is discussed by the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) - the body at that time responsible for scrutinising the work of the Met. \nIt tells the Met Commissioner Ian Blair to produce a new report on the case. He admits the first murder inquiry in 1987 was \"compromised\".\nJanuary 2006\nAssistant Commissioner John Yates writes in a report that the investigation had unearthed some new evidence and information: \n\"This was presented to Treasury Counsel for review. His conclusion was that he was satisfied that we now know the identity of those responsible for Daniel Morgan's murder but that the evidence available did not meet the threshold to enable a prosecution to be commenced.\" \nNearly 20 years after Daniel Morgan was killed, a new police investigation begins. It would nearly lead to a full criminal trial.\nMarch 2006\nPolice work with three supergrass witnesses - criminals who are giving information. The process is complex and requires an independent team to handle these witnesses. \nNovember 2006\nDaniel Morgan's murder features on Crimewatch again. \nApril 2008\nFour suspects are charged with murder - Rees, Glenn and Garry Vian, and another man, James Cook.\nSid Fillery is charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice. \nFebruary 2009\nMet deputy assistant commissioner John Yates tells then Mayor of London Boris Johnson that Daniel Morgan's case \"is one of the most deplorable episodes in the entire history of the Metropolitan Police Service. This family has been treated disgracefully.\"\nSeptember 2009\nLegal arguments for the trial of the suspects begin at the Old Bailey.\nMarch 2011\nThe case collapses before the start of the trial, and all four men are acquitted.\nThe judge rules the three supergrasses cannot stand as witnesses.\nActing Met commissioner Timothy Godwin acknowledges \"the repeated failure of the MPS [Metropolitan Police Service] over the years to confront the role played by police corruption in protecting those responsible for the murder from being brought to justice\".\nAugust 2011\nThe Morgan family meet Home Secretary Theresa May to ask for a public judicial inquiry.\nMay 2013\nThe Daniel Morgan Independent Panel (DMIP) is formally announced - with Baroness Nuala O'Loan appointed chair the following year.\nIts remit is to \"shine a light on the circumstances of Daniel Morgan's murder, its background and the handling of the case over the period since 1987\".\nFebruary 2017 \nFirst judgment is made in a claim for malicious prosecution and misfeasance in public office - brought by Fillery, Rees and the Vian brothers against the commissioner of the Met. \nFillery wins damages. The other claims are initially dismissed.\nJuly 2018\nRees and the Vian brothers win their claim on appeal. \nJuly 2019\nRees and the Vian brothers are awarded total of \u00a3414,000 in damages. The judge awards the sum to \"highlight and condemn the egregious and shameful behaviour of a senior and experienced police officer\" - referring to Det Ch Supt David Cook, who oversaw the investigation.\nThe evidence of a man called Gary Eaton had been excluded from the potential trial because the officer was found to have compromised Eaton's interview.\nSince the collapse of the case, Det Ch Supt David Cook has been repeatedly investigated over his conduct in the investigation, although the CPS has found insufficient evidence to prosecute. Because of this, he was unable to give evidence to the panel before 2020.\nThe panel completed its report this spring, and was expecting to send it to the Home Office on 14 May, with its publication in Parliament the following Monday. After an initial delay, Home Secretary Priti Patel told the panel she needed more time to assess the report for national security, and to ensure it was in alignment with the Human Rights Act. On 8 June, the Home Office said the report would be published to Parliament on 15 June, and nothing would be blanked out."

      "title": "Australia trade deal will not hit UK farmers, says Liz Truss",
      "tags": "UK trade tariffs,Agriculture,Trade,Australia",
      "text": "A new trade deal between the UK and Australia will not harm British farmers' livelihoods, the trade secretary has told the BBC.  \nLiz Truss denied that imports of Australian beef would flood the UK and said British export markets would grow. \nThe pact - the first to be built from scratch since the UK left the EU - will cover British goods such as cars, Scotch whisky, biscuits and ceramics.\nBut some UK farmers fear they may be undercut on price and standards.\nSpeaking to the BBC's World at One programme, Ms Truss said: \"At the moment there are extremely small quantities of Australian beef coming into the UK.\n\"So what we'd be looking at here is over time some of the EU imports [lost due to Brexit] being replaced by Australian imports.\"\nShe added that the deal - which is seen as an important step towards the UK joining a wider Asia Pacific free-trade agreement - would also create opportunities. \n\"We can see the evidence, that sales of British beef international are growing to places like Asia-Pacific and the United States because people want to buy high quality British products produced in a high animal welfare way,\" Ms Truss said.\nShe said by 2030, 66% of the world's middle classes will be in Asia and they want to buy products such as whisky, cars, beef, and lamb from the UK. \"We need to be positive about what we've got to sell rather than being defensive,\" she said.\nHowever, Dominic Goudie, head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation, expressed concern about the lack of detail in the deal.\n\"It is now vital that we know the detail of what has been agreed to help businesses understand and begin to prepare for the new terms of trade,\" he said.\n\"The terms must also ensure that consumers have continued confidence that any agreement maintains the highest food safety and animal welfare standards.\"\nNational Farmers' Union president President Minette Batters said: \"While the government has previously been keen to highlight how our free trade agreements will uphold our high standards of food production, there has always been a question mark over how this can be achieved while opening up our markets to food produced to different standards. \n\"We will need to know more about any provisions on animal welfare and the environment to ensure our high standards of production are not undermined by the terms of this deal.\"\nUnder the deal with Australia, the government says farmers will be protected by a cap on tariff-free imports for 15 years, using tariff rate quotas and other safeguards. \nBut some UK farmers have concerns there will be no meaningful safeguards in place to stop them being undercut by cheap imports.\nFarmers in Australia are allowed to use some hormone growth promoters, pesticides, and feed additives that are banned in the UK.\nThe UK Trade and Business Commission is worried that Australian farming operates on a scale that UK counterparts cannot compete with, saying Australia contains eight of the 10 largest farms in the world, including one which is larger than Israel.\nAccording to the UK's National Farmers Union, Australian farmers are able to produce beef at a lower cost of production, and could undercut farmers in the UK.\nBut Ms Truss said the deal would be fully scrutinised by the Trade and Agriculture Commission and MPs could block it if they were not happy. \nShe added that it would create better access for UK digital and financial services and better arrangements for UK citizens who want to work in Australia.\nWelsh lamb and Australian wine are said to have been on the menu as Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison settled the deal over dinner - but ultimately this deal is more significant in symbolic than economic terms. \nFor the government's own estimates say the new arrangements may add just 0.02% to our GDP, and the impact on prices is negligible. \nBut this, the first bespoke deal of the post-Brexit era, signifies global Britain's ambitions. The hope is that this paves the way for more alliances beyond the EU - starting with a group of trans-Pacific nations, the CPTPP. They only buy 8% of our exports - and we have deals already with the majority of members. But the ultimate hope is that key partners - such as the US - might also join. \nIt also symbolises though, the sacrifices that may be needed to get deals. British farmers fear they will face more competition from Australian counterparts on their home soil. Australian farmers say they won't be flooding the market. The UK is so far away that even the 80% increase in Australian imports the government predicts equates to 0.1% of total UK imports. \nIt'll be a while before the detail of this deal can be publicly scrutinised - even by those who'll be affected. But the concern is that this sets a marker, that  agriculture may be up for grabs when it comes to compromise in future and far bigger trade deals.\nThe UK government has signed a long list of trade deals over the past year, but they have been rollovers of those the UK already had as part of the EU.\nIn 2019-20, trade in goods and services between Australia and the UK was valued at \u00a320.1bn. The government says the deal will boost UK industries that employ 3.5 million people across the country. \nMetals, wine and machines have formed the biggest goods exports from Australia to the UK, while Australia's main UK imports are cars, medicines and alcoholic drinks.\nTrade in meat between the two countries is small at present, with 14% of sheep meat imports to the UK coming from Australia and just 0.15% of all Australian beef exports going to the UK.\n\"A deal would be good for my exports if there's a drop in the tariffs but if we start importing more I might be faced with more competition here,\" says Mary Quicke, owner of Devon-based artisan cheesemaker Quicke's.\nShe exports about 10% of her produce to Australia, but is more concerned about Europe. \"I would rather they had another look at the Brexit deal and ironed out a lot of the problems there.\n\"There's a dreadful amount of paperwork for exporting to the EU right now, it's a complete nightmare.\n\"I want to preserve our beautiful patchwork of British farms, so I'm cautious. Our milk is produced with half the carbon footprint of milk worldwide so it's really important that we don't just create a worse environmental footprint.\"\nThe deal marks the end of what has essentially been a 50-year lock-out for Australian farmers, who have struggled to navigate Brussels' restrictions, tariffs and quotas.\nThe president of the Australian National Farmers' Federation said it had been very difficult to break into the UK because it was \"way too expensive and way too far\".\nAustralian farmers have also been looking to diversify due to the increased tensions between Australia and China. In the past year, China has imposed tariffs and restrictions on everything from Australian beef, barley and wine, to rock lobster and coal."

      "text": "Early warning signs of self-harm can appear in children almost a decade before it starts, say researchers. \nThe team at the University of Cambridge found two distinct groups that were more likely to harm themselves. \nThe first included those who struggle to control their emotions, and the second featured youngsters more willing to take risks than others their age. \nThe findings may mean there is a large window of opportunity to improve children's mental health.  \nAbout one-in-six in the study reported self-harming by the age of 14. Self-harm is in turn linked to a higher risk of suicide.\n\"Our current way of supporting them is overwhelmed, we typically wait for problems to escalate and then intervene to see if we can do anything,\" Dr Duncan Astle, one of the researchers, told the BBC.\n\"We really need to shift to a preventative, proactive model.\"\nThe team used a type of artificial intelligence to analyse data from 11,000 children, who were born in the UK around the turn of the millennium. \nThe AI looked for patterns in the data to understand which children were more likely to self-harm, and what increased their risk. \nThe results have been published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.\nThe first group had a long history of mental health disorders. Difficulty controlling their emotions, being bullied, and parents with mental health problems all increased the risk.\nEven having emotional regulation difficulties at the age of five led to a 30-50% higher risk as a teenager.\n\"The second, much larger group was much more surprising, as they don't show the usual traits that are associated with those who self-harm,\" said researcher Stepheni Uh.\nTheir higher risk was linked to risk-taking behaviours, and lacking a supportive group of friends.\nPoor sleep and low-self esteem increased the risk of self-harm in both groups. \nHowever, the researchers say the findings show there is an opportunity to intervene and reduce the chances of children self-harming. \nThey suggest programmes to boost children's self-esteem, anti-bullying measures in schools, and advice on improving quality of sleep could reduce self-harm later in life. \nThis study is also part of a larger project to understand the origins of mental health disorders, and find new ways of preventing them.\nMiss Uh added: \"This approach has the potential to explore how adversity may impact brain and child development in different groups of children.\n\"It could also help us understand the consequences of adversity, such as other mental health problems they may face as adolescents.\"\nTom Madders, from the charity YoungMinds, said: \"We welcome any new research in this area, especially if it results in more early support for young people.  \n\"While there is higher awareness about mental health than in the past, many young people who self-harm still find it hard to reach out for help until they hit crisis point. \n\"For those who do seek help, it can still be really difficult to get early support.\"\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Care homes,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid vaccinations are to become compulsory for staff at care homes in England, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.\nMr Hancock said it was a \"sensible and reasonable step\" and he would consult on extending it to the NHS.\nThere are no plans to extend mandatory vaccinations beyond health and care workers, he said.\nWorkers will have 16 weeks to get both jabs from the time regulations are approved by Parliament.\nIf they do not, they face being redeployed away from front-line care or potentially losing their job.\nMr Hancock told the House of Commons that the \"vast majority of staff in care homes\" were vaccinated, but not all of them.\n\"We know that the vaccine not only protects you but protects those around you,\" he said, adding that compulsory vaccinations in care homes and hospitals would save lives.\nCare organisations have warned that compulsory vaccinations could cause significant difficulties in a sector that already struggles to recruit enough people.\nThe government, however, is believed to have considerable concerns about low take-up of the vaccine in some areas, including London.\nA Whitehall source told the BBC that guidance to doctors that they should take the Hepatitis B vaccine suggested there is a precedent for mandatory vaccination.\nThe requirement will also apply to volunteers at care homes and those visiting for other work, such as healthcare workers, tradespeople, hairdressers and beauticians.\nWorkers who can prove they are medically exempt from getting the vaccine will not be affected.\nThere will be also be exemptions for visiting family and friends, under-18s, emergency services and people undertaking urgent maintenance work.\nGovernments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have said they have no plans to make Covid jabs mandatory for care home staff.\nIt comes as the UK recorded a further 9,055 confirmed Covid cases and nine more deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nAnother 190,033 people received a first dose of the vaccine on Tuesday, bringing the total with at least one dose to more than 42 million - or 79.8% of adults. \nMore than 30 million people - 57.8% of adults - have had both doses after a further 230,666 second jabs were given out.\nThe move to mandatory vaccinations for care home staff in England follows a consultation by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), launched in April, two months after the government said it had met its target of offering all front-line care workers a first dose of a vaccine by mid-February.\nAt the time, it said 47% of English care homes for older people had more than a fifth of staff yet to take up the vaccine, despite staff at all eligible care homes having been offered vaccines, with the vast majority of homes having had repeat visits by vaccine teams.\nDr Susan Hopkins, strategic response director for Covid-19 at Public Health England, said there are \"pros and cons to any debate on mandatory vaccination\", with the \"pro\" being that those caring for the most vulnerable in care homes would be vaccinated, thus minimising the risks to residents.\nShe said a possible downside could be that \"people may vote with their feet, and not want to have the vaccine, and therefore not work in a care home, and that could lead to staff supply issues in care homes\".\nDr Hopkins said there had been \"excellent uptake\" of the vaccine, adding: \"I think where people are hesitant, we need to work harder to make them understand why the vaccines work.\"\nThe British Medical Association, which represents doctors, warned compulsion was \"a blunt instrument that carries its own risks\".\nIt added: \"While some healthcare workers are already required to be immunised against certain conditions to work in certain areas, any specific proposal for the compulsory requirement for all staff to be vaccinated against Covid-19 would raise new ethical and legal implications.\"\nMike Padgham, chairman of the Independent Care Group (ICG) which represents care homes in Yorkshire, said he was disappointed by the decision and concerned it could cause legal disputes for providers.\nHe told the Today programme: \"People should be vaccinated, every member of staff should take up the vaccine, but I just think persuasion rather than coercion or compulsion is the way to deal with it.\"\nSusan Lord, whose mother lives in a care home in Leeds, said whilst it was \"great\" staff in the home had been vaccinated, she was \"concerned\" by the idea of mandatory jabs targeted solely at care workers.\nMs Lord, from High Wycombe, told BBC News: \"If someone has been working in care for years and isn't able to have the vaccine or has strong objections to having it, it seems a little bit unfair that they're going to lose their job\".\nShe said most care home staff only work in one place and are regularly tested, so it seems \"a little bit harsh\". \nMr Padgham said the sector already had a \"recruitment crisis\", saying: \"We're frightened that this is going to put more people off coming into social care and that's going to be difficult.\"\nCaroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK said: \"Every care home resident would want to be cared for by someone who had been vaccinated, but if a compulsory approach leads to some care workers quitting it will make existing chronic staff shortages even worse.\"\n\"With or without mandatory vaccination,\" she said an approach of \"peer-to-peer persuasion\" should be taken in care homes, \"because this approach has been found to work well\". \nLow uptake among care home staff was a big concern when the vaccine programme was launched - similar issues are seen with the annual flu jab.\nEfforts have been made to convince staff of the need to get vaccinated - there have been advertising campaigns targeting them, webinars held by health leaders and repeat visits made to homes by vaccination teams.\nThere are plenty of places where there has been good uptake.\nBut there are also significant numbers of places where fewer than 80% of staff have been vaccinated - the threshold deemed essential to keep the virus out if 90% of residents are also vaccinated.\nThose working in the sector say there are a variety of reasons staff have cited - cultural reasons and concerns about safety. One common issue has been (unfounded) worries about its impact on fertility as the workforce is young and predominantly female.\nThis move raises lots of concerns from individual rights to its potential to force staff out from a sector that is already short of workers.\nBut the counter argument is that the vulnerabilities of residents and the closed environments they live in require drastic action.\nKelly Andrews, national care lead of the GMB union and a former care worker told BBC News: \"We should not have forced vaccinations in social care, this is pushing the workforce away from social care in an area that we're already struggling to recruit and retain\".\nIn a survey of about 1,000 of its carers, the GMB said, more than a third indicated they would quit their jobs if vaccines were mandated.\nIn the care sector in England there have been more than 40,000 deaths involving Covid.\nAdditional reporting by Joseph Lee."

      "text": "The pilot of a flight that was diverted to Belarus, allowing the arrest of an opposition journalist, had been warned that a bomb would detonate if it continued to Lithuania, according to Ryanair's boss.\nMichael O'Leary said the pilot tried to seek advice from the airline, but was given false excuses by officials that Ryanair was not answering the phone.\nHe called the incident \"a premeditated breach\" of global aviation rules.\nBelarus denies it was a forced landing.\nJournalist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega were arrested after the plane landed in Belarus's capital Minsk. Both remain in prison.\nRyanair flight FR4978 was travelling from the Greek capital, Athens, to Vilnius in Lithuania on Sunday 23 May when it made an abrupt change of course over Belarus, some 10km (six miles) from the Lithuanian border.\nThe incident has drawn condemnation from the EU, UK and other Western nations. They reacted by banning state carrier Belavia from their airports and ordering airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace.\nIn a detailed account, Mr O'Leary told a British parliamentary committee on Tuesday of the series of events that led to the plane's diversion.\nHe said Minsk air traffic control told the pilot they had received \"a credible threat that if the aircraft entered Lithuanian air space, or attempted to land at Vilnius airport... a bomb on board would be detonated\".\nThe pilot \"repeatedly\" requested to speak to Ryanair's operations control centre after the bomb threat came through, but \"Minsk gave excuses that Ryanair in Poland were not answering the phone\", he said. \nMr O'Leary explained that flights in this area would normally be diverted to Poland or the Baltic states, but that the pilot was given no option but to land in Minsk. \nWhen the pilot asked what the threat level was, he was told it was a red alert \"which gave him no alternative\", he said.\nThe plane was \"brought down under false pretences using Minsk Air Traffic Control and it seems clear two passengers were removed against their will and detained\", he said.\nFollowing the plane's landing, Mr O'Leary said the crew were pressured into confirming on video that they had voluntarily diverted to Minsk but that they refused to do so. \nWhen the plane took off again, he said there were five passengers missing - Mr Protasevich, Ms Sapega and three \"unidentified persons\", whom he said he understood from security agencies to be \"KGB types\". \nThe three individuals, who included a Greek passenger, told Belarus TV they had been travelling to Belarus anyway so decided not to go on to Lithuania.\nAn unverified transcript from the Belarusian transport ministry has previously shown that air traffic controllers told the pilot \"you have [a] bomb on board and it can be activated over Vilnius\". \nThe comments by Mr O'Leary came a day after Belarus air force chief Igor Golub said there was \"no interception, no forced diversion from the state border or forced landing of the Ryanair plane\". \nHe was speaking at a news conference in Minsk where Mr Protasevich - former editor of the opposition Nexta channel on the Telegram messaging app - also appeared. A BBC reporter who was initially at the media briefing said the 26-year-old was clearly appearing under duress.\nMr Protasevich had also made appearances on state TV in which he has praised Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko and admitted attempting to topple him. In one appearance, marks were visible on his wrists. Human rights and opposition campaigners say he was tortured. \nMr Protasevich has been put on the Belarus terrorism list and is accused of inciting unrest. Ms Sapega - who is Russian - has been charged with inciting social discord and enmity. \nAuthoritarian Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko, in power since 1994, has cracked down hard on opponents since claiming victory in an August election widely condemned as rigged. Opposition leaders have been jailed or forced into exile."

      "text": "China has accused Nato of slandering its peaceful development after alliance leaders warned about \"systemic challenges\" coming from Beijing. \nChina's actions, including expanding its nuclear arsenal, threatened \"rules-based international order\", Nato said. \nIt was the first time Nato had placed China at the centre of its agenda. \nIn its response, China said its defence policy was \"defensive in nature\" and urged Nato to \"devote more of its energy to promoting dialogue\". \n\"Our pursuit of defence and military modernisation is justified, reasonable, open and transparent,\" China's mission to the European Union said in a statement.\nIt added that Nato should view China's development in a \"rational manner\" and \"stop taking China's legitimate interests and rights as an excuse to manipulate bloc politics, create confrontation and fuel geopolitical competition\". \nChina's rebuttal came on the same day that it flew 28 air force jets into Taiwan's air defence zone, the island's government said. It is the fifth incursion this month, and the largest to date.\nNato's statement came at the end of a one-day summit in Brussels on Monday. \nIt marked Joe Biden's first Nato meeting as US president. \nThe powerful political and military alliance between 30 European and North American countries sees Russia as a main threat. Mr Biden is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva on Wednesday.\nAccording to the summit's communiqu\u00e9 (concluding statement), China's \"stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to Alliance security\".  \n\"We remain concerned with China's frequent lack of transparency and use of disinformation,\" it says.\nNato chief Jens Stoltenberg told reporters: \"We're not entering a new Cold War and China is not our adversary, not our enemy.\"\nBut, he added: \"We need to address together, as the alliance, the challenges that the rise of China poses to our security\".\nChina is one of the world's leading military and economic powers, whose ruling Communist Party has a tight grip on politics, daily life and much of society.\nThe Chinese military currently has the largest armed forces in the world, with over two million personnel on active duty.\nNato has become increasingly concerned about the growing military capabilities of China, which it sees as a threat to the security and democratic values of its members.\nIn recent years, the alliance has also grown wary of China's activities in Africa, where it has established a military base in Djibouti.\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"When it comes to China, I don't think anybody around the table wants to descend into a new Cold War with China.\"\nNato's tough message on China followed criticism of the country by the G7, a group of major economies that met for a summit in England last week.\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 G7 leaders criticised China for alleged human rights abuses and demanded a transparent investigation of the origins of Covid-19 in the country.\nIn response, China accused the G7 of \"lies, rumours and baseless accusations\" in a statement through its embassy in the UK.\nCorrection 20th July 2021: An earlier version of this article reported that China has set up army bases in Africa and this has been amended to make clear that it has established one military base in Africa, at Djibouti."

      "text": "The Scottish government has announced a further easing of the Covid rules.\nGuidance urging people to work from home wherever possible is to be relaxed in favour of a \"hybrid\" system of office and remote working from Monday 31 January.\nRestrictions on large outdoor events came to an end on 17 January, then rules on indoor events and venues, including the need for table service in hospitality premises, were lifted on 24 January.\nNew guidance on working from home will come into effect on Monday 31 January.\nThis will recommend that employers consider a hybrid working system, with staff spending some time in the office and some time at home.\nBusinesses had previously been asked to enable staff to work from home where possible.\nThe requirement for physical distancing in settings where certain people are exempt from wearing face coverings - like those leading religious services or carrying out some receptionist duties - will be reduced from 2m to 1m from 31 January.\nAnd face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities with children under the age of five.\nFrom Friday 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to take a test after they arrive in Scotland.\nThose who are not fully vaccinated will still have to take a pre-departure test no more than two days before they travel, then take a PCR test on or before day two after their arrival.\nA raft of new measures introduced in December in response to the spread of the Omicron variant have already been removed.\nThese included limits on the number of people who could attend large public events; restrictions in pubs, restaurants and other indoor public places; and the closure of nightclubs.\nAdults and children aged 12 and over still have to wear face coverings in all the same indoor settings as before, such as shops, hospitality venues and public transport.\nBusinesses are legally required to take steps to reduce the spread of Covid, including physical distancing and screens.\nIn hospitality, face coverings can be removed while dancing, drinking and dining. Indoor venues are required to reduce crowding and collect the contact details of customers to help with Test and Protect.\nRetail and other sectors also have to ensure social distancing and manage customer flow.\nThe two-metre distancing rule remains in healthcare settings such as hospitals, doctors' surgeries and dentists.\nA vaccine passport scheme was introduced last year for entry to:\nUnder the scheme, anyone over the age of 18 must show proof - if asked - that they are fully vaccinated, or a negative lateral flow test.\nIf it is more than four months since your second jab you will need to show proof of a booster to be classed as fully vaccinated. The app has been updated to include boosters.\nProof of a negative LFD test will be needed before people can visit someone in hospital or a care home, or accompany someone to a medical appointment.\nPeople who test positive for Covid in Scotland will be allowed to exit self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests.\nThe first of these tests must be taken on the sixth day after testing positive and then at least 24 hours later. \nIn addition, household contacts of people with the virus can take a lateral flow test every day for seven days rather than going into self-isolation.\nThis applies to everyone in the household under the age of 18 or anyone over that age who has had the first, second and booster Covid jabs. \nIf one of these tests is positive, self-isolation will then be required for that person.\nAnyone identified as a close contact who is over 18 and four months old and not fully vaccinated will still be asked to self-isolate for 10 days and take a PCR test.\nFor those with symptoms of Covid, the advice remains to book a PCR test.\nHowever, people returning a positive lateral flow test who have no symptoms will no longer be required to take a PCR test to confirm the result. \nInstead, they will be asked to isolate immediately and report their result online so that Test and Protect can start the contact tracing process.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said no changes to the guidance for schools were being recommended at this stage - although this was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nPupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the one-metre social distancing rule is still in place.\nMs Sturgeon said young people wanted to see the back of masks as soon as possible, but that many understood they provided \"important protection\". She said the issue \"requires and will receive careful consideration\".\nAll secondary school children are being asked to take a lateral flow test twice a week. \nWhole classes no longer need to self-isolate when a pupil tests positive, with only the closest contacts of positive cases required to test and isolate.\nCarbon dioxide monitors - which assess how well-ventilated a space is - are also required in schools and childcare settings.\nUniversity and college students are being asked to test twice a week and before socialising with other households.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The prime minister is determined the remaining coronavirus restrictions in England will be lifted on 19 July, No 10 says, despite concern that a rise in deaths could force a change of plan.\nBoris Johnson said the measures must remain in place until then because of the rapid spread of the Delta variant.\nAll adults will be able to book a jab by the end of the week, NHS chiefs say.\nBut some Tory MPs fear a further delay to lockdown easing amid warnings of a return to hundreds of deaths a day.\nA further 10 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK on Tuesday, and 7,673 more cases.\nSir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said the health service would \"finish the job\" of the vaccination programme to the \"greatest extent possible\" over the next four weeks.\nHe said he expected that all those over the age of 18 would be able to book \"by the end of this week\", and that the NHS aimed to offer second doses to two thirds of adults by 19 July.\nSo far, nearly 42 million people in the UK have received their first dose, and just over 30 million have had their second.\nIn Scotland, the easing of restrictions is likely to be pushed back by three weeks so more people can be vaccinated against the virus, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday. \nAll of Scotland had been due to move to the lowest level zero of its five-tier system from 28 June. This new date will bring Scotland into line with England.\nOn Monday, Mr Johnson announced a four-week delay to the planned easing of lockdown restrictions in England on 21 June, after scientific advisers warned of a \"significant resurgence\" in people needing hospital treatment if it went ahead.\nHe said 19 July would be the \"terminus date\" for the remaining restrictions on social contact, and the delay would allow more people to get vaccinated.\nA few restrictions are being lifted on 21 June, including the limit on wedding guest numbers.\nAnd 15 coronavirus pilot events will continue as planned, including some upcoming Euro 2020 games, Wimbledon and arts and music performances. Attendees will have to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative test. \nThe announcement that the vaccine rollout would be accelerated came as Prof Graham Medley, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the numbers of people dying from coronavirus would rise.\n\"The question is really as to what level they will rise,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"It is possible we could end up with a situation whereby the numbers of people going to hospital really mean that the government have to take some kind of action that they don't want to.\"\nBut he added that the government has had to do this throughout the pandemic.\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said the delay was \"extremely welcome\" and he hoped it would be \"enough\".\nHe told BBC Breakfast there was \"very promising evidence\" that the vaccination rollout meant there were fewer serious cases of coronavirus, and that getting more people vaccinated would allow England  to \"get ahead of this current wave\".\nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said he shared the prime minister's confidence about the 19 July end date.\n\"One can never predict the future with perfect confidence,\" he told BBC Breakfast. \n\"But insofar as we can be confident about anything in this complex world, we can be confident that the increased level of vaccination that we will have by 19 July should allow us to further relax restrictions.\"\nHowever, Mark Harper, chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of Tory MPs, said \"we could have moved ahead perfectly safely\" without the delay.\nHe told LBC radio that the prime minister's comments about 19 July were \"exactly the same words as he was using about 21 June\".\n\"So some of us, I'm afraid, are a bit worried that we're not going to actually move forward on 19 July,\" he said.\nLabour, meanwhile, has accused the government of incompetence over its handling of Covid variants, saying lax border policies led to the Delta variant entering the country.\n\"Rather than red-listing this variant, we essentially gave it the red carpet treatment as 20,000 people were allowed to arrive from India over a number of weeks in April, even though the warning signs were there,\" shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said. \n\"That essentially seeded this Delta variant across the country.\"\nThe confidence among ministers that all remaining restrictions will lift on 19 July is understandable given the extent of the vaccine rollout.\nBut behind the scenes, the one fear is what to do if cases are still rising at that point.\nInfections are currently climbing sharply and modellers believe this could lead to more than 1,000 hospital admissions a day later in the summer.\nThat is equivalent to what the NHS would face for all types of respiratory illness in the middle of a bad winter.\nThe hope is that in a couple of weeks infection levels will have started to flatten, and maybe even fall, as the virus hits the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme.\nBut there are no guarantees of that.\nKnowing the peak of this wave is still to come will make the final decision harder if hospitalisations climb as expected.\nBut the fact remains Covid is always going to present a risk. Exactly how much is hard to quantify at this stage, although it will of course be much much lower than it was before.\nIn the end it will come down to balancing that extra risk against the need to get back our old way of life and reducing the harms caused by our response to Covid.\nThe extension of restrictions will be put to a Commons vote, which could trigger a sizeable Conservative backbench rebellion, with a debate expected on Wednesday. \nNew analysis by Public Health England showed two doses of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine were highly effective at preventing hospital admissions from the Delta variant.\nPHE said the effectiveness was comparable to against the Alpha variant which was previously dominant in the UK. \nMr Johnson said the gap between doses for over-40s in England would be reduced from 12 to eight weeks. \nAnd the target to offer all adults a first dose will be brought forward to 19 July. \nHospitality, wedding and night-time entertainment businesses are among those to have criticised the delay.\nThe government has said it will not extend the furlough scheme or other financial support further, despite the delay to the unlocking roadmap. \nDowning Street said local authorities have \u00a31bn of unspent money to support businesses, which could be used to pay business rates or contribute to furlough payments.\nUnder the furlough scheme, the government covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they cannot work because of the pandemic. \nThe scheme is due to run until the end of September but employers will have to help cover the cost from July. \nPlans for easing coronavirus restrictions differ in all four UK nations. Limits on indoor gatherings in Northern Ireland are scheduled to be relaxed on 21 June and the rules in Wales will be reviewed on 25 June.\nHave you or your business been affected by the delay to restrictions easing in England?

      "tags": "NHS Tayside,NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde,Coronavirus vaccines,NHS Lothian,Glasgow,NHS Ayrshire and Arran,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid cases are rising rapidly in Scotland, with eight council areas now above the Scottish government's level four threshold.\nThe number of Covid patients in Scottish hospitals is also increasing - particularly in the worst-hit health boards.\nThere are early indications the vaccination programme may have reduced the number of people needing hospital treatment, but public health experts say the dominance of the Delta strain is causing a \"complicated\" picture to emerge.\nWhat do we know about hospital admissions in the health boards most affected by the recent rise in cases?\nAs of 11 June, Dundee had the highest Covid case rate in Scotland, recording almost 295 weekly cases per 100,000 people - a rate not seen in the area since January when Scotland was in full lockdown.\nSouth Ayrshire, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Clackmannanshire, Glasgow, Perth and Kinross and Angus all have rates of more than 150 cases per 100,000, the threshold for level three.\nIn fact, only 10 Scottish councils would currently qualify to be in level two or lower, going by case rates alone.\nCase rates are a crucial measure for the Scottish government when determining which level a local authority should be placed in - but they're not the only indicator.\nOther figures include the percentage of positive cases and projected demand on local NHS services.\nProf Aziz Sheikh, director of Edinburgh's Usher Institute which examines population health, said the increases were being driven by the Delta variant which had taken hold \"very rapidly\" in Scotland.\nThe professor told BBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that the strain, first detected in India, now accounted for three-quarters of cases here.\nIn Scotland's largest health board - NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) - cases have been rising steadily for about six weeks.\nThe number being treated in the region's hospitals has also risen, but there are indications the figure could be stabilising at a much lower level than we saw in the autumn.\nThis chart shows the relationship between confirmed Covid cases in NHSGGC and the daily figure published on the number of Covid patients being treated.\nPatient numbers do not seem to be rising as fast as they were in the autumn, but it's important to note that there is always a delay of a few weeks between a rise in cases and an increase in hospital admissions.\nCases have also been going up very quickly in NHS Tayside, driven by outbreaks in Dundee, Perth and Kinross and Angus.\nThe really steep rise only began two weeks ago, so it's difficult to determine now the impact this will have on Covid hospital admissions.\nDifferent patterns are emerging in the other two health boards experiencing a fast rise in Covid cases.\nIn NHS Lothian, patient numbers have been fluctuating around a similar level over the last few weeks, whereas in NHS Ayrshire and Arran there has been a recent rise in patient numbers - but the figure may now be stabilising.\nIt's clear from all the health boards, that a proportion of people who get sick from Covid still need to go to hospital.\nBut Prof Sheikh, who also sits on the Scottish government's Covid Advisory Group, said the numbers appeared lower so far.\n\"We're already seeing increasing number of hospitalisations across Scotland. [It's] nothing like the kind of previous peaks that we've seen yet, but there is a lag at typically between infections and people contracting symptoms and ending up in hospital. So we need to watch this very carefully over the coming weeks,\" he said.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon is due to give an update later on the Covid levels system, but so far the Scottish government has appeared reluctant to place local authorities back into level three or level four restrictions, despite cases soaring.\nOne of the reasons for this could be that the government believes the link between cases and hospitalisation is weakening.\nMinisters say this is happening because of the success of the vaccination programme, with more than half of all adults in Scotland now fully vaccinated with both doses.\nThis means that although large numbers are still being infected, a much lower percentage will end up in hospital, need an intensive care bed or die.\nIf this link has indeed weakened, then ministers may decide that higher case numbers do not need the stringent restrictions seen in spring 2020 or this winter.\nBut Prof Sheikh warned that some studies had shown that being infected by the Delta variant could increase the risk of hospitalisation.\n\"What's concerning is that there has been data published previously which shows that [the strain] is more infectious and our data is now showing that those who contract the Delta variant are at twice the risk of hospital admission, so I think there are some serious concerns here,\" he said.\nThe professor told BBC Scotland he welcomed Boris Johnson's decision to delay the final easing of lockdown restrictions in England because of concerns over the Delta variant.\nThe UK prime minister announced on Monday that the unlocking planned for 21 June would now be delayed by four weeks.\nHowever, Prof Sheikh said the vaccines were still proving \"very effective\", especially in those who had received both doses.\n\"Overall, the vaccine programme is working and we are already seeing reductions in hospitalisations,\" he said.\n\"The Delta variant has made things a bit more complicated, but I'm confident that if we can press on at pace then hopefully we should be able to ease the restrictions that we're all living under.\""

      "tags": "Musical Theatre,Lin-Manuel Miranda,United States,Representation",
      "text": "Lin-Manuel Miranda has apologised for a lack of Afro-Latino actors in the lead roles for his new film musical In The Heights.\nThe movie is adapted from Miranda's 2005 stage show of the same name, which refers to Washington Heights, a mainly Latino neighbourhood in New York.\nThe movie has been praised by film critics but also criticised for not using Afro-Latino actors. \nMiranda acknowledged in a tweet that his film \"fell short\".\nMiranda, who is of Puerto-Rican descent, served as a producer on the movie and had an on-screen role. He issued an apology on Twitter about not employing more actors of Afro-Latino backgrounds.\n\"I started writing In the Heights because I didn't feel seen. And over the past 20 years all I wanted was for us - ALL of us - to feel seen,\" he said.\n\"I'm seeing the discussion around Afro-Latino representation in our film this weekend and it is clear that many in our dark-skinned Afro-Latino community don't feel sufficiently represented within it, particularly among the leading roles.\"\nMiranda said he could \"hear the hurt and frustration over colourism\" and said the film \"fell short\".\n\"I hear that without sufficient dark-skinned Afro-Latino representation, the work feels extractive of the community we wanted so much to represent with pride and joy.\n\"In trying to paint a mosaic of this community, we fell short. I'm truly sorry. I'm learning from the feedback, I thank you for raising it, and I'm listening.\" Miranda added he is \"dedicated\" to \"learning and evolving\".\nThe apology follows an interview conducted by the journalist Felice Le\u00f3n, who describes herself as a \"blacktina\", with the film's director Jon M Chu and the actors Melissa Barrera, Leslia Grace and Gregory Diaz.\nThe interview on Le\u00f3n's online show The Root saw her address the fact that most of the actors in the film are \"light-skinned or white-passing\".\n\"What would you say to folks who say that In the Heights privileges white-passing and light-skinned Latinx people?\" she asked.\nChu responded: \"I think that was something we talked about and I needed to be educated about, of course. In the end, when we were looking at the cast, we tried to get the people who were best for those roles.\n\"I hear you on trying to fill those cast members with darker skin. I think that's a really good conversation to have and something we should all be talking about.\"\nSocial media users have also been criticising the film for a lack of dark-skinned Latino actors in its cast.\nOne Twitter user said \"Black-Latin\" people were a Washington Heights fixture and accused the film of \"erasing\" them from the neighbourhood.\nHowever another user urged others to \"cut the guy some slack\".\n\"There's justified pent up frustration in Latino community. For so long, we've felt under-represented and unseen in media,\" said TV host and commentator Ana Navarro-C\u00e1rdenas.\n\"But, can we recognize Lin-Manuel is a good, decent guy who's done much to open doors for all sorts of POC on Broadway & Hollywood. \n\"Cut the guy some slack.\"\nRita Moreno, Oscar-winning star of 1961 musical West Side Story, voiced similar sentiments on Tuesday while appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\n\"You can never do right it seems,\" said the Puerto Rican actress, who is the subject of a new documentary that Lin-Manuel Miranda executive produced.\n\"This is the man who literally has brought Latino-ness and Puerto Rican-ness to America,\" the 89-year-old went on to claim. \"Lin-Manuel has done that really singlehandedly.\n\"I'm simply saying, can't you just wait a while and leave it alone?\" she continued in response to Colbert's suggestion that the criticisms levelled against Miranda were misplaced.\n\"We are all colours in Puerto Rico,\" she went on. \"It would be so nice if they hadn't come up with that and left it alone, just for now. I mean, they're really attacking the wrong person.\"\nMoreno won an Academy Award for playing Anita in the original film version of West Side Story and also has a role in Steven Spielberg's upcoming big-screen remake.\nWhile In The Heights has been a hit with critics, it has initially disappointed at the box office.\nIt took what trade magazine Variety described as a \"lacklustre\" $11.4m (\u00a38m) over its four-day opening weekend in the US and Canada. It was simultaneously launched on the HBO Max streaming service.\nThe musical had been tipped to make as much as $20m (\u00a314m) from its first three days.\nVariety said the film's underwhelming reception was \"puzzling\" given the positive reviews it had received and the amount its distributor Warner Bros spent promoting the film.\nIt asked whether audiences were more inclined towards properties \"with higher brand recognition\" while suggesting the film might go on to become a so-called \"sleeper\" hit. \nThe film opens in UK cinemas this week. \nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Theatre,Coronavirus lockdown measures,West End theatre,Live music,Musical Theatre,Music festivals,Coronavirus pandemic,Music",
      "text": "Live music, theatre and other events have been dealt a \"hammer blow\" by a four-week delay to the final stage of easing lockdown restrictions in England, industry figures have said.\nThe move means the capacity of venues will remain limited by the requirements around social distancing.\nThe entertainment sector has appealed for urgent financial support.\nThe Society of London Theatre said the decision would \"have serious implications for many theatres\".\nAnd the Night Time Industries Association said the PM had \"switched the lights off for an entire sector\".\nBoris Johnson told a press conference on Monday the delay to lifting most remaining curbs on social contact was necessary to avoid \"a real possibility that the virus will outrun the vaccines and that thousands more deaths would ensue which could otherwise have been avoided\".\nThe government's planned date for lifting restrictions - 21 June - has now been pushed back until 19 July, amid rising Covid cases driven by the more transmissible Delta variant.\nBut the prime minister said there would be a review after two weeks and he was \"confident\" the delay would not need to be longer than four weeks.\nMany in the entertainment industry said they understood the need for the delay, but called for further government support.\nMark Davyd, chief executive of the Music Venues Trust, said the government should take \"swift and robust\" action to prevent hundreds of potential grassroots music venue closures.\nHe said this should include \"getting financial support to people who desperately need it, extending repayment options for loans, cancelling business rates and extending support schemes such as furlough and SEISS [the self-employment income support scheme]\".\nThe Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre said there were \"thousands of jobs hanging in the balance\" as producers make the \"difficult decision\" of whether to start rehearsals for shows that are due to open later this summer.\n\"Particularly at risk are large-scale commercial productions, which have received little or no Cultural Recovery Fund support and cannot survive under social distancing,\" a statement said.\nTrafalgar Entertainment's Sir Howard Panter and Dame Rosemary Squire, who have two major musicals due to open in London in late July, said the delay was \"yet another bungle\" from the government.\n\"The confusion and muddled messages are reminiscent of a West End farce,\" they said in a statement.\nMeanwhile, UK Cinema Association said it was \"mindful of the rationale behind today's decision\" and acknowledged many cinemas \"can still operate viably at below full occupancy\", but that they would \"continue to face significant challenges as they look to recover from the enormous financial impacts of Covid\".\nLucy Noble, chair of the National Arenas Association, said the delay was \"devastating\", while trade association Live said the industry had been left \"in limbo\".\nSir Ian McKellen, who is due to star in Hamlet from 21 June, said the fact theatres cannot play to full houses was \"very, very frustrating\".\n\"Thank goodness I'm not the producer, who must be wondering what to do, because you sold an awful lot of tickets and people may have to shift to other dates,\" he told the BBC's The One Show. \n\"I think they were warned in advance that might happen.\n\"It's a lot of trouble, but there's no doubt, a week today, we open up Hamlet at the Theatre Royal Windsor as planned, but it will be social distancing for a little bit longer than we'd hoped.\"\nHowever, there could be hope for some in the sector as fifteen coronavirus pilot events are to continue as planned before 19 July, including some arts and music performances.\nOn Monday, the PM suggested Andrew Lloyd Webber's new musical Cinderella may be able to join the scheme, after the composer said he was prepared to be arrested if he couldn't open as planned on 25 June.\n\"I think we're in talks to with him to try to make it work and we'll do whatever we can to be helpful,\" the prime minister said.\nBut that came as a surprise to Lord Lloyd-Webber. \"My goal is, and will always be, to fight for the full and safe reopening of theatre and live music venues up and down the country,\" he said.\n\"I was pleased and surprised to hear the prime minister mention Cinderella as part of his announcement today, but I can't comment further on the proposed pilot until I know more about the scheme.\"\nA string of music festivals planned for June and July were cancelled or postponed after Mr Johnson's announcement.\nThey included the Black Deer festival in Kent, which was due to be headlined by Van Morrison at the end of June.\nOrganisers of the Noisily Festival in Leicestershire wrote in a statement: \"After pouring our heart and soul into the event on a wing and a prayer - hoping against hope - to have all of that dashed again is beyond devastating.\"\nAlex Hutchinson, who runs the Kubix festival in Sunderland, said his event would no longer take place in early July. \n\"I think people forget there are millions of people behind these closed industries, either directly or in the supply chains, who at the minute can't even give a definite date to be able to resume making a living,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We understand a delay to full reopening is challenging for live events, and we will be helping our creative industries through it. We have made \u00a32bn available through the biggest arts funding package in history and the final funding round of \u00a3300m will be announced shortly.\n\"Clubs and venues have also benefited from restart grants worth \u00a318,000 each, and there's nearly \u00a31bn available in further discretionary grants local authorities still have to pay out.\n\"The furlough scheme and VAT cut is in place until September and eligible businesses will also continue to benefit from business rates relief of 75% over the year.\""

      "text": "A man groomed by child abuser Barry Bennell while on holiday at a former Butlin's camp in north Wales is to sue the company's previous owners.\nWhen he was 11, David Lean, now 53, met football coach Bennell, who is serving 34 years for child sex abuse, at his week-long soccer school in 1979.\nAfter a second holiday, Bennell invited him to train in Macclesfield and stay at his home, where he abused him.\nMr Lean's lawyer said Butlin's was vicariously liable for the abuse.\nThe Rank Group, which owned Butlin's at the time Bennell worked there, said it did not wish to comment.\nMr Lean had gone on holiday with his family to Butlin's in Pwllheli, Gwynedd, and attended Crewe Alexandra coach Bennell's soccer school every day.\nBennell persuaded Mr Lean to give him his home address so he could keep in touch with his football development, and coached him again when the family returned for a second holiday that year.\nBennell awarded the young player \"boy of the week\", invited him on a course in Macclesfield and offered to host him.\nIt was there the abuse happened.\nMr Lean said: \"I would never have come into contact with Bennell had he not been working at Butlin's - it's as simple as that.\n\"In those days the Redcoats and staff were really looked up to there - and Bennell was no different. He was seen to be trustworthy and he used that to start grooming me.\n\"I had never stayed away from home before that with anyone - bar the odd friend - that's how much my dad trusted Bennell.\n\"He sucked us in and made me believe that he had seen something in me and that I had professional football prospects. He got into mine and my dad's head.\n\"We would never have gone on two holidays a year - but, because of that first trip and the letters Bennell exchanged with me, we went back where he had his chance to further groom me.\"\nBennell was jailed for two years in 2015 after Mr Lean reported the abuse. More than 100 victims are believed to have come forward saying they were abused, and he was imprisoned for 30 years initially in 2018, rising to 34 years after further victims came forward.\nKim Harrison, head of abuse law at Slater and Gordon, said the civil case against Butlin's is on the basis the company was vicariously responsible for the abuse by employing Bennell during the time Mr Lean was groomed by him.\n\"The impact of this abuse on my client is hard to put into words, but his bravery in first coming forward to the police and continuing to fight for justice should be commended,\" she said.\nThe legal action is being taken against Hard Rock Cafe (Edinburgh) Ltd, which was known as Butlin's Limited until 2000.\nHard Rock Cafe has been approached for comment."

      "text": "Biologists have uncovered the genetic secrets of the world's smallest diving mammals - water shrews. \nUsing DNA samples to construct an evolutionary tree, scientists revealed that diving behaviour evolved five distinct times in this group of insect-eating mammals. \nThe ability of these tiny, warm-blooded animals to dive and hunt in freezing water seems to defy evolutionary logic.\nThe findings are published in the online journal eLife. \nTo track this surprising evolutionary journey, the scientists collected DNA samples from 71 different species all belonging to a large group of related, insect-eating mammals, collectively called Eulipotyphla. \nThat Greek term translates to \"the truly fat and blind\"; it is a group of mammals that includes hedgehogs, moles and shrews. \n\"We sample specimens from all over the world,\" said lead researcher Dr Michael Berenbrink, from the University of Liverpool. \nOnce he and his colleagues had created their Eulipotyphla family tree - building the genetic code into a detailed picture of the relationship between each species - they were able to use that information to track the evolution of diving behaviour. \n\"We mapped the evolution of a single protein, called myoglobin, that stores oxygen in the muscle,\" explained Dr Berenbrink. \n\"We can see a genetic signature [in the DNA] that shows us when this key protein increased in abundance in the animals' muscles.\" \nHe explained that this is the change needed for an animal to store more oxygen in its muscles, so it can hold its breath under water and hunt. That \"diving signature\" occurred five distinct times in this group of animals. \n\"It evolved three times in the shrews and twice in the moles,\" Dr Berenbrink added. \n\"The genetic sequence of just one protein tells us so much about the lifestyle of these animals that we couldn't figure out from fossils.\" \nHe added that the genetic study had provided fascinating insight into the evolution of mammals that appear to be \"the least equipped for diving\". \n\"They're so tiny, they lose heat so quickly, and they're burning energy at such a high rate, so they have these very high costs,\" he explained. \"But they can afford that because there are huge gains of having the access to all the insect larvae [in rivers and streams]. \n\"It just shows us what nature can really do.\""

      "text": "A French court has ordered Ikea to pay a fine of \u20ac1m (\u00a3860,000; $1.2m) after the Swedish furniture chain was found guilty of spying on staff in France.\nIkea France was accused of using private detectives and police officers to collect staff's private data.\nThis included illegally accessing their criminal records in order to vet applicants for jobs.\nThe Ingka group - which owns most of Ikea's stores around the world - has apologised and condemned the practices.\nIn a statement, reported by Reuters news agency, the company said it had \"implemented a major action plan to prevent this from happening again\".\nOn Tuesday former head of risk Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Paris was given an 18-month suspended sentence and a \u20ac10,000 fine. AFP news agency reports he once wanted to know how an employee could afford a new BMW convertible, and asked why a staff member in Bordeaux had \"suddenly become a protester\".\nFormer Ikea France CEO Jean-Louis Baillot was given a two-year suspended jail term and \u20ac50,000 fine. His lawyer told AFP Mr Baillot was \"shocked\" by the ruling and was considering an appeal.\nThe prosecution had called for a \u20ac2m fine for Ikea and for Baillot to spend a year in prison, along with a further two years suspended.\nThe 15 people in the dock at the Versailles court included top executives and former store managers. Four police officers were also on trial for handing over confidential information. \nThe case centred on Ikea France's surveillance of staff during 2009-2012. Store managers used the mass surveillance system to vet job applicants, as well as to check up on their staff. \nThey were accused of reviewing staff's bank account records and using fake employees to report on workers.\nStore manager Patrick Soavi told the court how he had got personal data from a cousin in the police. He asked police officer Alain Straboni to \"cast an eye\" over 49 candidates selected for Ikea jobs.\nAfter a search on the police computer the reply was that three of them had committed minor offences. Later Mr Soavi sent another 68 names to be checked, and he was advised to drop five of the candidates.\n\"I recognise that I was very na\u00efve and rather over-zealous, but we were being asked to carry out these checks, and once I'd put a foot inside this system it was too late,\" he said.\nIkea's annual bill for private investigators ran to as much as \u20ac600,000, AFP news agency reports, citing court documents.\nJournalists first exposed the practices in 2012. Stung by the affair, Ikea fired four managers and got a new code of conduct.\nThe illegal surveillance covered about 400 people, state prosecutor Pamela Tabardel said. \n\"What's at stake is the protection of our private lives against the threat of mass surveillance,\" she said when the trial opened in March.\nManagers were found to have used a private security firm, Eirpace, which in turn collected personal data from the police. It included information about lifestyles and any previous criminal convictions.\nThe Eirpace boss, Jean-Pierre Four\u00e8s, was given a two-year suspended sentence and a \u20ac20,000 fine.\nWhen the trial opened, Ikea France issued a statement saying it \"strongly condemned\" the privacy violations and it apologised for \"this situation which does serious harm to the company's values and ethical standards\".\nA lawyer for Ikea, Emmanuel Daoud, told AFP that the court had delivered \"many acquittals\", having \"taken account of the efforts made by Ikea France\". The firm had reformed its governance and set up an ethics committee, he noted. "

      "text": "A former BBC director general has said it was the \"wrong judgement\" in hindsight not to sack Martin Bashir over his behaviour in the run-up to his 1995 interview with Princess Diana.\nAt the time, Tony Hall investigated Bashir's faking of bank documents over questions about whether the reporter had used them to secure the scoop.\nHe told a committee of MPs: \"We trusted him and we clearly shouldn't have.\"\nCommittee chairman Julian Knight said there had been \"a failure of morality\".\nLord Hall was head of news at the time of the princess's explosive interview, and his subsequent investigation concluded that Bashir was an \"honest and an honourable man\".\nHe told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee on Tuesday that he knew he had been lied to on multiple occasions by Bashir when he conducted the internal investigation in 1996.\nHe said Bashir had ended up \"contrite and in tears\" when he \"quizzed him really, really hard\" about the matter at the time.\n\"He appeared to us that he was contrite, inexperienced and out of his depth and that is why in the end rather than sacking him, and I can see the reasons for that, he was given a second chance.\"\nBashir admitted to his bosses that the statements had been mocked up, but repeatedly denied showing them to Diana's brother Earl Spencer.\nHe had done, and Earl Spencer has said Bashir was trying to \"groom\" him in order to get to his sister. It was Bashir's first breach of the BBC's guidelines, Lord Hall explained.\n\"Do you say, that's it, farewell, you're sacked? Or do you say, all right, you're remorseful, you understand it, we'll give you a second chance? And that's what we did, and we did it having talked to him 25 years ago.\n\"Now, in the light of what I now know about Bashir, was that the wrong judgement? Well, yes it was. But we trusted him, and we clearly shouldn't have done.\"\nHe said he wasn't \"trying to conceal anything\", and added: \"We were lied to, and our trust was misplaced and, bluntly, Bashir took us all in, from the director general down to the programme editor.\"\nBut Mr Knight criticised the decision to blacklist Matt Wiessler, the graphic designer who mocked up the documents and tried to raise the alarm, but not sack Bashir.\n\"It wasn't just a failure of management, it was a failure of morality,\" the committee chairman said.\nLord Hall said: \"I regret the language that we used about Mr Wiessler and I think we could have managed it better.\"\nMr Knight also said it was \"utterly extraordinary\" that the BBC would re-hire a \"known liar\" as religious affairs correspondent in 2016, when Lord Hall was director general.\n\"We didn't know 25 years ago the scale of what Martin Bashir had done to gain access to the Princess of Wales, through Earl Spencer,\" Lord Hall said. \"If we knew then what we know now, of course he wouldn't have been re-hired.\"\nA recent report by former judge Lord Dyson criticised Bashir's \"deceitful\" actions and Lord Hall's \"woefully ineffective\" investigation.\nLord Hall also he was \"sorry for the hurt caused\" to the Royal Family by the scandal.\nAfter the Dyson Report was published, Prince William, Diana's son, said she was \"failed not just by a rogue reporter, but by leaders at the BBC who looked the other way rather than asking the tough questions\".\nCurrent director general Tim Davie described the prince's comments as \"a very low moment\" for the BBC, and revealed he had since held private meetings with the royal household.\nThe committee also quizzed John Birt, who was director general at the time of the interview.\nLord Birt called Bashir \"a serial liar on an industrial scale\" and \"a very skilled confidence trickster\". His actions were \"one of the biggest crimes in the history of broadcasting\", he added.\nSteve Brine MP suggested to him that the interview \"sparked a train of events\" that ended with Diana's death in a car crash two years later.\nLord Birt replied: \"It is a tragic occurrence, it is an absolute horror story, and it should never have happened.\n\"And it is a complete embarrassment that it did happen. My heart goes out to the sons of Princess Diana, but none of us can truly speculate and understand what the consequences were.\"\nBut Lord Birt refused to apologise to Mr Wiessler, saying he didn't \"understand enough of what happened\".\nLord Hall cut a very pained and anguished figure today. Coming under a sustained ad hominem attack from John Nicolson MP, he said he hoped this scandal wouldn't colour his 35 years of public service, at the BBC and beyond.\nThe sad truth for him is that endings have disproportionate weight in human psychology. The likelihood is that Lord Hall - an effective and popular Director-General - will indeed have his legacy not just coloured but stained by this episode.\nHis tactic - one Rupert Murdoch honed at a select committee a decade ago - of stating his regret and apologising at the outset set the tone for what followed. He repeatedly argued that his failure was an excess of trust. He trusted Bashir, a liar. He trusted those who re-hired him, his senior leaders in BBC News.\nHad the late Steve Hewlett, the Panorama editor at the time of the Diana interview, been alive today, the heat on Hall would have been shared round. Instead, he was solitary, apologising repeatedly even while saying - as Lord Dyson did - that Princess Diana was likely to have given an interview at the time, even if not to Bashir.\nBashir's interview - in which Diana discussed her unhappy marriage to Prince Charles, their affairs and her bulimia - was described as \"the scoop of the century\" by one MP and was watched by 22.8 million people.\nLast month's Dyson Report described Bashir as \"unreliable\", \"devious\" and \"dishonest\". The BBC admitted the report showed \"clear failings\" in its own processes.\nThe MPs' hearing came a day after the BBC published a separate report into how and why Bashir was rehired in 2016 before being promoted to religion editor two years later.\nLord Hall told the select committee he didn't know Bashir had been re-hired until the appointment had been made.\nMr Davie said an employee would be fired today for forging documents. \"If you're faking documents, that's not a matter for debate,\" he said.\nHe was challenged on why, in that case, Bashir was re-hired in 2016 despite it being known that he had faked documents in the past.\n\"With the glory of hindsight, and with what I know now based on having personally commissioned Lord Dyson to go at this - that hiring would never have been made, there's no doubt about that,\" said Mr Davie, who took over as director general in 2020.\nBashir had also been embroiled in controversies while working in the US, including one that led to him resigning from MSNBC in 2013.\nMr Davie said those who reappointed him to the BBC in 2016 \"were aware of some of the controversies of the time\", but that \"overall they did not see them as substantive enough to block a rehiring\".\nBashir has said mocking up the documents \"was a stupid thing to do\" and he regretted it, but that they had had no bearing on Diana's decision to be interviewed."

It also said it had made major changes to its terms based on discussions with regulators - such as the EU.\nApple has also been contacted for comment.\nThe announcement also specifically highlighted the question of whether either of the two tech giants has market power over other businesses - including the app developers which rely on their app stores.\nThat has been a hot-button issue for the mobile industry over the past year, particularly since Epic Games launched its high-profile legal action against both Apple and Google, alleging unfair business practices. \n\"Apple and Google control the major gateways through which people download apps or browse the web on their mobiles - whether they want to shop, play games, stream music or watch TV,\" said CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli.\n\"We're looking into whether this could be creating problems for consumers and the businesses that want to reach people through their phones.\"\nA Google spokeswoman said the company welcomed the CMA's \"efforts to understand\" before implementing new rules.\n\"Android provides people with more choice than any other mobile platform in deciding which apps they use, and enables thousands of developers and manufacturers to build successful businesses,\" she said.\nApple is already under investigation by the CMA over its App Store, and whether its demands on app developers are anti-competitive.\nGoogle, likewise, is being investigated for its proposed new privacy system, over concerns it could affect news publishers and the wider digital advertising market.\nThe CMA said that while both those topics were \"within the scope\" of the new investigation, it was also \"much broader\". \nThe watchdog said it was keen to hear directly from app developers about their experiences. A questionnaire it posted included questions about which app stores developers work with, and whether there are web-based alternatives that can offer the same experience.\nThe investigation will last no more than a year, officials said."

      "title": "Robin Swann unveils five-year plan to clear waiting lists",
      "tags": "NI Health,Robin Swann",
      "text": "Long hospital waiting lists in Northern Ireland are to be banished by March 2026, according to a roadmap set out by Health Minister Robin Swann. \nMore than 330,000 people are on some form of hospital waiting list in Northern Ireland. \nThe new elective care framework proposes a \u00a3700m investment over five years. \nIt sets out a twin-track approach of investment and reform to ensure that \"backlogs do not keep re-occurring\".\n\"The time for talk is over. What we need now is concerted action,\" Mr Swann said.  \nThe plan, ambitious in itself, also has to build in dealing with Covid-19. \nIn order to do that, it proposes to implement \"green pathways\" which will keep elected care services entirely separate from any exposure to Covid-19. \nIt will also see emergency departments kept separate as much as possible from planned surgical hubs. \nThat means operations for the likes of hips, knees, cataracts and varicose veins can be performed on sites at speed and uninterrupted in order to cut through the waiting lists. \nOther aspects of the plan include: \nThe framework sets a target of March 2026 for no patient waiting more than 52 weeks for a first outpatient appointment and inpatient day case treatment, or 26 weeks for a diagnostics appointment. \nMr Swann said that if the timeline could be brought forward it would, but he said he had to \"acknowledge the scale of the problem that has built up and the capacity restrictions that will limit room for manoeuvre\".      \n\"There are currently almost 190,000 patients waiting more than a year for their first outpatient appointment,\" Mr Swann said. \nThe proposals must be signed off by the executive and there needs to be confirmation of long-term funding from the executive and the Treasury.\n\"This is almost five times as many as when the abortive 2017 Elective Care Plan was published.\" \nIt is also proposed that cash incentives should be offered to staff in areas where waiting lists are more acute, although the plan does not specify whether this includes nurses, surgeons or both.   \nThis could, however, create problems for health unions and would require negotiation. \nIf a lot of this sounds familiar, it's because it is. \nIn 2017, then health minister Michelle O'Neill published a similar wish list - Stormont was on the political precipice once again and within three weeks of the plan being published the Northern Ireland Executive collapsed. \nNorthern Ireland is now in a similar position - the big differences, however, are that waiting list numbers are bigger and there's a different health minister at the helm. \nWhile Robin Swann seems to have been in the post a long time, this is his first real test of dealing with bread-and-butter health issues, as the Covid pandemic has been his priority until now.\nHowever, for this plan to see the light of day it is relying on a great deal, including recurrent investment, political backing and, most importantly, political stability. \nThere is also the added problem of not having enough staff in post to see it through. \nThe public have been waiting long enough.\nWhile Mr Swann is keen to spread the responsibility among his executive colleagues, ultimately he is the health minister and the buck stops with him. \nA new cross-border healthcare scheme is to be set up for a 12-month period from July 2021. \nThe new scheme is separate from the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive which allowed patients to arrange health treatment in most other European countries, but ended with Brexit.\nIt allows patients to seek and pay for routinely commissioned treatment in the private sector of the Republic of Ireland while having the cost of the treatment reimbursed. \n On 1 January 2021, the Irish government introduced a new \"unilateral\" arrangement for its own residents known as the Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme.\nThis allows patients from the Republic of Ireland to continue to access certain private healthcare treatments in Northern Ireland and apply for reimbursement from the Irish state.\nA similar plan, the Elective Care Plan, was published in 2017, however the Northern Ireland Executive collapsed just three weeks later.\nThe big differences in the 2021 plan are that waiting numbers have increased and the service is also dealing with the pandemic. \nThe waiting lists plan does not go as far as highlighting where surgical hubs will be based, or how services will be re-jigged on sites - that is when even tougher and more politically sensitive decisions will have to be taken.  \nThe plan distinguishes between immediate, medium and longer-term actions. \nFor instance, from next month the health service will introduce enhanced rates of pay for staff working in \"targeted shifts and delivering priority elective activity\".\nAlso by September \"mega clinics\" will be in place for orthopaedic outpatients, cataract assessments and for a range of pre-operative assessments. \nSome of these clinics will require patients having to travel slightly further than they otherwise would have, but the plan states this should reduce the time waiting to be seen. \nBy next March, it is hoped detailed proposals will be in place for how the service can provide a rapid diagnostic centre.\nLong-term goals include moving towards a seven-day working week for hospital theatres.\nAnd, to mirror how waiting times are measured across the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland will become more \"transparent\" in how it measures the length of time a person has to wait, for instance from when patients actually see their GP with a medical complaint.  \nThe health minister described the launch of the plan as a \"staging post\" in the \"long struggle\" to turn the health service around. \nHe also said it is fundamental \"to restore hope to all those languishing on waiting lists\".

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nBoris Johnson is \"determined\" the final coronavirus restrictions will be lifted in England on 19 July, Downing Street says. Some Conservative MPs have expressed concerns over the prospect of further postponements after the prime minister confirmed the date would be pushed back four weeks from 21 June to allow more people to be vaccinated.\nThe UK jobs market is \"showing signs of recovery\", official figures suggest. Unemployment fell from 4.8% to 4.7% in the three months to April, while the number of vacancies between March and May was just 27,000 below pre-pandemic levels at 758,000. However, unemployment remains high in hospitality and those in the industry tell us it will continue to suffer as a result the four-week delay to the lifting of England's restrictions. Live music, theatre and other event managers say they've been dealt a \"hammer blow\".\nIt wasn't all bad news in the prime minister's announcement. The 30-guest limit on the number of people allowed at a wedding in England is to be lifted, meaning Rick and Sophia (below) can celebrate with most of their loved ones. Watch how they reacted.\nWhile some travel insurers boast of offering \"Covid cover\", many policies exclude plausible scenarios, such as new lockdowns in the UK or a destination country, says consumer group Which? Having analysed 263 different policies, it found only two gave travellers all-round financial protection. The Association of British Insurers says people should take time to understand the scope of cover because \"policies bought after the pandemic was declared are unlikely to cover cancellation due to Covid as it is a known risk\".\nAnd here's something to cheer tennis and football fans. Wimbledon's men's and women's finals will be played in front of capacity Centre Court crowds of 15,000, with the tournament beginning with 50% ground capacity on 28 June, as part of the government's fan pilots. Wembley will also be able to host matches in the Euro 2020 knockout stages at 50% capacity - around 45,000.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nThe rules around weddings in England have changed.

      "text": "The Metropolitan Police was institutionally corrupt in the way it concealed or denied its failings over the unsolved murder of Daniel Morgan, a report has found.\nThe force's first objective was to protect itself, said Baroness O'Loan, the head of an independent panel.\nPrivate investigator Mr Morgan was attacked with an axe in the car park of a pub in south-east London in 1987.\nMet Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has apologised to his family.\nShe said it was a \"matter of great regret that no-one has been brought to justice and that our mistakes have compounded the pain suffered\".\nDespite five police inquiries and an inquest, no-one has been convicted over the father of two's death, with the Metropolitan Police previously admitting corruption had hampered the original murder investigation.\nMr Morgan, from Llanfrechfa near Cwmbran in south Wales, died outside the Golden Lion pub in Sydenham on 10 March 1987.\nThe panel found his family had \"suffered grievously\" as a consequence of the failure to achieve justice for them.\nIt criticised the \"unwarranted assurances\" they were given, the misinformation put into the public domain, and a failure \"to acknowledge professional incompetence, individuals' venal behaviour, and managerial and organisational failures\".\n\"The Metropolitan Police also repeatedly failed to take a fresh, thorough and critical look at past failings,\" the report said.\n\"Concealing or denying failings, for the sake of the organisation's public image, is dishonesty on the part of the organisation for reputational benefit and constitutes a form of institutional corruption.\"\nThe report said there were several theories as to why Mr Morgan was killed, among them:\nMr Morgan's brother Alastair said earlier that Dame Cressida should \"absolutely\" be considering her position in light of the report.\nMr Morgan's family - who believe he was on the brink of exposing police corruption when he was killed - said in a statement: \"We welcome the recognition that we - and the public at large - have been failed over the decades by a culture of corruption and cover-up in the Metropolitan Police, an institutionalised corruption that has permeated successive regimes in the Metropolitan Police and beyond to this day.\"\nThe family's statement added: \"At almost every step, we found ourselves lied to, fobbed off, bullied, degraded and let down, time and time again.\"\nIn a statement released early on Tuesday evening, Dame Cressida said she had been \"personally determined\" that the Met provided the panel with the fullest level of co-operation.\n\"I recognise this is a powerful and wide-ranging report,\" she said. \"We will take the necessary time to consider it and the associated recommendations in their entirety.\"\nMet Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said that since the murder the force had \"completely overhauled our ability to identify corruption\". He added: \"I am confident we have never been better at finding corruption and getting rid of it.\"\nSpeaking in the Commons shortly after the publication of the panel's report, Home Secretary Priti Patel said it was \"deeply alarming\" and revealed a \"litany of mistakes\" by the Met Police.\nShe said the behaviour of the force had \"irreparably damaged the chances of successful prosecution\".\nShadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the report was \"damning\", adding that the Morgan family had endured a \"three-decade nightmare\".\nTom Symonds, home affairs correspondent\nThe early years of the Daniel Morgan saga experienced policing that was \"poor or below accepted standards\", while there was a \"historical phenomenon\" of regular drinking sessions in which officers mixed with local figures \"operating on the fringes of legality\".\nMore serious was evidence that stories were sold by the police to the press; misuse of the police national computer; and the planting of false evidence.\nThe inquiry also found links between \"personnel at the highest levels of the Metropolitan Police and people working for a news organisation linked to criminality associated with the murder of Daniel Morgan\". The evidence relates to dealings with the News of the World.\nThe panel strongly criticises the Met for impeding its investigation by failing to co-operate with elements of its work.\nThe Met has at times accepted failings in the Morgan case, and suggested corruption was to blame, but when asked to explain what this meant, the panel said little detail was often provided.\nThe force also placed barriers in the way of the inquiry when the panel asked for a computer terminal so that it could access the police Holmes investigation database.\nA series of recommendations includes better vetting of police officers and a requirement for police officers to register their membership of any organisation, including the freemasons.\nContinuing his criticism of Dame Cressida, Mr Morgan said: \"I think certainly we need much better leadership than she has provided here.\n\"Anyone with any knowledge of the history of the police knows how much they hate scrutiny, and I think she has been true to form in that respect.\"\nThe Morgan family's solicitor Raju Bhatt said: \"You heard from the panel that the institutionalised corruption that they found is a current problem in the present tense.\n\"The current leadership in the Met has to take responsibility for that continuing.\"\nWhen asked if Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who had spoken to then-Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Yates about Mr Morgan's murder when London mayor in 2009 - had full confidence in Dame Cressida, Mr Johnson's spokesman replied: \"Yes\". \nFor an inquiry commissioned by the home secretary to accuse a police force of \"institutional corruption\" is about as serious a finding as it is possible to imagine.  \nLegitimacy is the vital ingredient in the British approach of policing by consent. \nToday's report, therefore, represents a major crisis for the Met in general and for its commissioner Dame Cressida Dick in particular. \nIn simple terms, the force is accused of putting its corporate reputation ahead of the search for truth. \nDame Cressida is personally accused of obstructing the panel's work, and causing delays which added further and unnecessary distress to the family of a murder victim.\nThe commissioner has made it clear she is not resigning. The prime minister has said she has his backing and Scotland Yard is denying it sought to hamper the inquiry.  \nBut unlike other institutional scandals affecting the Met, this is not just about historical or operational failings.\nThis is about a culture which the panel says exists to this day, and evidence of which can be traced to the desk of the woman who currently heads the force."

      "text": "Travel insurance policies that offer \"complete\" cover for Covid-related disruption are barely available, according to consumer group Which?.\nIt analysed 263 different policies and found only two gave travellers all-round financial protection.\nAs a result, it called into question various providers' claims that their policies provided Covid cover.\nAn industry body said holidaymakers needed to be clear about what their insurance products provided.\nInsurance brokers have stressed that they can search the market for specific needs if people still wish to travel despite the current restrictions.\nThe analysis by Which? found two policies - from HSBC and Barclays - offered widespread protection, but were only available to those banks' customers and could only be bought alongside other insurance products.\nThey protected policyholders against cancellation due to changes in advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) or government lockdowns prohibiting travel. They also covered testing positive for Covid-19 or being told to self-isolate, and medical costs and repatriation.\nWhile some travel insurers boasted of offering \"Covid cover\", many policies excluded plausible and potentially costly scenarios, such as new lockdowns in the UK or destination country, the consumer group said.\nEvery policy analysed offered cover for medical and repatriation costs for travellers catching Covid while travelling.\nHowever, no more than a third offered cover if travellers cancelled after being notified to isolate by the test and trace app, and only 3% protected against failing to travel owing to a need to quarantine on return - a scenario possible if their destination was re-graded on the traffic light system.\nGareth Shaw, head of Which?\u00a0Money, said: \"As the removal of Portugal from the green list shows, last-minute disruption to holiday plans can happen - and our research shows that many travel insurers don't offer much protection if it does.\n\"The government should work with regulators to ensure that travellers, should they choose to go abroad, are given clear information about what they will and won't be covered for.\"\nA spokesman for the Association of British Insurers said: \"We urge people to read their policy to understand the scope of cover, as policies bought after the pandemic was declared are unlikely to cover cancellation due to Covid as it is a known risk, and travel insurance is designed and priced to cover unforeseen events.\n\"Travellers should always be aware of and follow government advice, and the border requirements of the country they are visiting. And always follow FCDO advice, to avoid invalidating your travel insurance.\""

The group claimed the area only became known as Snowdonia due to Victorian day-trippers.\nThe park has confirmed\u00a0it was presented with an online petition with signatures from \"around the world\".\nWelsh language campaign group Cymdeithas yr Iaith said the change would provide a suitable response to the recent trend of anglicisation in parts of Wales.\n\"Attacks on the Welsh language is something consistent, this is seen when house names and names for different areas of Wales are changed from Welsh,\" said Elfed Wyn ap Elfyn, of Cymdeithas.\n\"I, and many others think that only using the names Eryri and Yr Wyddfa would be a positive step towards showing the importance of the Welsh language.\"\nDuring its meeting in April, a vote saw authority members decide not to consider the motion due to\u00a0a group already being appointed to look at the issue.\nIt is tasked with establishing and adopting guidelines on the use of place names by the park authority.\nThe Welsh name for Snowdon, Yr Wyddfa, means grave and is pronounced like \"er with-va\".\nThe story goes in a legend that the giant Rhita Gawr, the king of Wales, was buried under a cairn of stones on the summit of the mountain, following a battle with King Arthur.\nIt is said that the giant defeated 30 kings of Britain, taking their beards to create a cloak of the beards, reaching from his shoulder to the floor.\nEryri is believed to originate from the Latin 'oriri' (to rise) and was first documented in the 9th Century, despite it long being thought to refer to the Welsh name for Eagle - Eryr.\nThe English forms of Snowdon and Snowdonia are thought to derive from the Saxon snow dune, meaning snow hill.\nThere is a precedent for the ditching of English place names for popular tourist attractions, with Ayers Rock in Australia now formally known by its Aboriginal name of Uluru."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Weddings,Boris Johnson,Hospitality industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The final stage of easing lockdown restrictions in England is to be delayed until 19 July.\nIt means most remaining curbs on social contact will continue beyond 21 June, when they had been due to be lifted. \nThe limit on wedding guest numbers will be removed but venues will still have to adhere to other rules. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said there would be a review after two weeks and he was \"confident\" the delay would not need to be longer than four weeks.\nHowever, he told a Downing Street press conference he could not rule out the possibility the date could be pushed back further.\nScientists advising the government had warned of a \"significant resurgence\" in people needing hospital treatment for Covid-19 if stage four of easing the lockdown went ahead on 21 June.\nIt comes amid rising cases, driven by the more transmissible Delta variant, which was first identified in India.  \nMr Johnson said going ahead with stage four on 21 June would mean \"a real possibility\" of the virus outrunning the vaccines, leading to thousands more deaths which could otherwise have been avoided. \nThe delay would give the NHS \"a few more crucial weeks\" to get people vaccinated, he said, adding that while the link between infections and hospital admissions had been \"weakened\" it had not been \"severed\".\n\"We will monitor the position every day and if, after two weeks, we have concluded that the risk has diminished, then we reserve the possibility of proceeding to step four and a full opening sooner,\" he said.\n\"At a certain stage, we are going to have to learn to live with the virus and to manage it as best we can,\" he added.\nAddressing MPs in the Commons later, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the decision not to ease restrictions next week was being made with a \"heavy heart\" but the government's four tests for easing restrictions - one of which is that the risks are not fundamentally changed by new variants - had not been met.\nHe said extra testing facilities and access to vaccines would be rolled out in more areas of the country, while vaccinations would be opened up on Tuesday in England to people aged 23 and 24.\nThe delay means limits remain on how many people can meet, with groups of up to 30 allowed to meet outdoors and up to six people or two households allowed indoors. \nHowever, 15 coronavirus pilot events will continue as planned, including some upcoming Euro 2020 games, Wimbledon and arts and music performances. Attendees will have to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative test. \nCapacity limits will continue at other venues and nightclubs will stay closed. \nAdvice to work from home where possible will remain in place.\nThe extension of restrictions will be put to a Commons vote, which could trigger a sizeable Conservative backbench rebellion, with a debate expected on Wednesday. \nMr Johnson said two-thirds of adults would have been offered two coronavirus jabs by 19 July, including all vulnerable groups. \nThe gap between doses for over-40s in England will be reduced from 12 to eight weeks. \nAnd the target to offer all adults a first dose will be brought forward to 19 July. \nIt comes as new analysis by Public Health England shows two doses of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine are highly effective at preventing hospital admissions from the Delta variant.\nPHE said the effectiveness was comparable to against the Alpha variant which was previously dominant in the UK. \nThe size of a future surge in infections is uncertain because questions remain about the Delta variant, vaccines and people's behaviour once rules are relaxed. \nThe Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) said a third wave could range from \"considerably smaller than January 2021 to considerably higher\". \nIt said even a short delay to easing the restrictions would lead to a significant drop in the number of Covid patients in hospital as more people were vaccinated and the school holidays got closer, reducing transmission. \nScientists have advised the government delaying by four weeks would reduce the peak in hospital admissions by between a third and a half.\nThe government's chief scientific advisor Sir Patrick Vallance said there would still be an increase in numbers and an increase in hospitalisations \"because that's what happens when there's more mixing\".\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the public had been \"let down by ministerial incompetence and indecision\". \n\"The only reason this delay is being introduced is because the Conservatives failed to secure the country's borders and a new variant from overseas was allowed to take hold; and failed to put in measures like proper sick pay support and surge vaccinations when needed,\" he said. \nThere are plenty of benefits to delaying the full unlock. More vaccinations will be done and the impact of this wave in terms of hospitalisations will be reduced.\nWe could also see the rise in infections slow as the initial surge meets the wall of immunity already built up by the vaccination campaign.\nBut make no mistake the coming weeks will see a real resurgence of Covid.\nInfection levels are already climbing steeply and modelling suggests there could be 1,000 hospital admissions a day by the middle of summer.\nThat is the same number that the NHS would normally see for all types of respiratory illness in the depths of a bad winter.\nThe proportion of people dying should be much much lower than it was in previous waves though thanks to the protective effect of vaccines.\nBut the alternative would be a reintroduction of restrictions. It is a price worth paying, the government believes.\nThe Night Time Industries Association said the delay to the roadmap was a \"devastating blow\" that would \"drive down confidence in the sector to a new low\", forcing more workers to leave the industry. \nJulian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, said thousands of jobs were \"hanging in the balance\", with venues no longer able to increase their capacity as planned. \nMany pubs and restaurants are also trading at a loss because of social distancing measures. \nIndustry trade body UKHospitality called for additional financial support for affected businesses, saying the delay would cost the sector around \u00a33bn in sales.\nThe government has said it will not extend the furlough scheme or other financial support further, despite the delay to the unlocking roadmap. \nUnder the furlough scheme, the government covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they cannot work because of the pandemic. \nThe scheme is due to run until the end of September but employers will have to help cover the cost from July. \nSome Tory MPs were also critical of the delay, with senior backbencher Sir Robert Neill saying a few weeks made \"the difference between survival or closure for some businesses\". \nThe rise in cases in the UK is being driven by the Delta variant, first identified in India, which is believed to be around 60% more infectious than the previous dominant variant and twice as likely to result in hospital admissions.\nOn Monday, the UK has recorded 7,742 new cases of Covid-19 and three deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nThe seven-day average for cases in the UK is up 46% compared with the seven days before. \nPlans for easing coronavirus restrictions differ between the four UK nations.\nAll areas of Scotland are due to move to Level Zero Covid restrictions on 28 June - meaning bigger groups can gather in cafes, pubs and restaurants, although they will still have to observe social distancing. \nLimits on indoor gatherings in Northern Ireland are scheduled to be relaxed on 21 June and the rules in Wales will be reviewed on 25 June.\nAre you affected by the delay to restrictions easing in England?

      "text": "Billionaire MacKenzie Scott, ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has donated another $2.7bn (\u00a31.9bn) to a range of charities.\nMs Scott said in a blog post that she wanted to give the money to those \"that have been historically underfunded and overlooked\".\nShe wrote that she had chosen 286 organisations working on racial inequality, the arts and education.\nMs Scott is one of the world's richest women.\nMuch of her fortune comes from her 2019 divorce from Mr Bezos, who is currently the world's richest man. \nAs part of the deal, Ms Scott ended up with 4% of Amazon's shares, having helped Mr Bezos start the technology giant in 1994. \nThe author has since posted about her charitable donations, such as in December, when she revealed she had donated more than $4bn in just four months to women-led charities, food banks and Black colleges.\nDespite the size of these donations, she is still the world's 22nd-richest person, worth $59.5bn, according to Forbes. \nIn her most recent blog post on Tuesday, she said again that she was keen to redistribute her wealth, having worked with a team of researchers and her new husband, science teacher Dan Jewett, to pick who to donate to.\n\"In this effort, we are governed by a humbling belief that it would be better if disproportionate wealth were not concentrated in a small number of hands, and that the solutions are best designed and implemented by others.\"\nAmong the charities and organisations who received the \"relatively large gifts\" were also those working on \"bridging divides\" between different religions, as well as some colleges and universities.\nIn 2019, she signed the Giving Pledge, promising to give away most of her fortune. \nThe Giving Pledge is a commitment by the world's richest individuals and families to dedicate the majority of their wealth to giving back. It was started by Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett in 2010 and other signatories include the likes of Star Wars creator George Lucas.\nMr Bezos has not yet signed the pledge, although Mr Jewett joined in March.\nHe said in a letter: \"In a stroke of happy coincidence, I am married to one of the most generous and kind people I know - and joining her in a commitment to pass on an enormous financial wealth to serve others.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government in England is delaying the full lifting of restrictions in England by four weeks. It comes amid rising infection rates. \nBut what difference does waiting another month make?\nThe most obvious consequence will be that a greater number of people will have been vaccinated.\nThe government has now brought forward its target to offer all adults a first dose of a vaccine to 19 July.\nThis is nearly two weeks earlier than the original deadline and means all adults will have had the opportunity to have at least one dose by the time all restrictions are due to lift.\nNot everyone will come forward, but if the number of vaccinations being done at the moment remains consistent it would mean more than three-quarters of adults will have had two jabs and nearly nine in 10 one jab.\nChief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance says this will act as a \"double protection\".\nThat is because the over-40s, who are most at risk of serious illness, will have had the chance to be fully vaccinated.\nMeanwhile, younger age groups, who have the highest rates of infection, will have the benefit of one jab if they take up the offer. As well as providing some protection to them, this will help slow the spread of the virus.\nAll this though is dependent on supply. \nThe UK has plenty of AstraZeneca doses - there is thought to be a stockpile of about five million - but the under-30s, who are now being given their first dose, are being offered Pfizer or Moderna because of concern about blood clots. \nThat has to be imported, and is essentially being used as soon as it arrives.\nInfection rates are already rising rapidly - doubling every 10 days or so. On current trends, we could hit January levels of infections by the end of July.\nThe fear was that opening up further would have allowed the virus to spread even more quickly than it is now.\nBy delaying opening up by four weeks, government modellers say it could reduce the number of those cases ending up in hospital by between a third and a half to around 1,000 a day in the summer.\nThe rises we are seeing at the moment could also start to slow during this period.\nThat's because of the high levels of immunity in the population from the vaccination programme, which will make it harder for the virus to spread after an initial surge.\nProf Jonathan Ball, an expert in viruses at University of Nottingham, says his hope is the increases that are being seen now will start to flatten.\n\"I think in a few weeks we could see it slow. I certainly don't think the speed of the rises we are seeing now will continue for long, given how well the vaccines work.\"\nAnd if that has not happened by late July, the break-up of schools for the summer holidays could help tip the scales, as it will reduce contacts among young people where Covid is spreading more quickly.\nBut even if infections continue to rise, the delay will still be of benefit as it will give government scientists a better grasp of what the consequences are in terms of hospitalisations.\nOne of the crucial elements, that is not fully understood at the moment, is to what extent the vaccination programme has broken the link between infections and serious illness.\nHospitalisations have started to rise - albeit from a low base. Early data suggests about 4% of confirmed cases are currently ending up in hospital although there is a lot of uncertainty around this, as the impact of the rise in infections in recent weeks is only just translating into admissions.\nThat is less than half the proportion ending up in hospital during the winter wave.\nBut the data only tells you part of the story. It also seems that the patients ending up in hospital are less sick, and are being discharged more quickly.\nSo it is pretty clear - as we would expect given the vaccine rollout - that the link between infections and hospital cases is significantly weakened, but to what extent exactly remains to be seen.\nFully understanding this will enable scientists to give ministers a clearer idea of what the consequences of a full unlock will be if cases are still rising come 19 July, and therefore whether any measures at all may need to be retained.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "tags": "Princess Diana, Princess of Wales,BBC",
      "text": "There is no evidence journalist Martin Bashir was rehired by the BBC to cover up the circumstances around his Diana interview, a BBC inquiry has found.\nThe review was set up to look at why Bashir became a correspondent in 2016 when questions already surrounded him.\nHad those involved in his hiring known all they do now, he \"would have never been reappointed\", the report says.\nEarl Spencer, brother of the princess, responded on Twitter, saying: \"It won't end with this, I promise.\"\nThe report also says BBC bosses who rehired Bashir were told he had faked documents.\nBut because Princess Diana had provided a handwritten letter to say she had not been misled, Jonathan Munro - the then head of newsgathering, now deputy director of news - considered that the allegations were \"spent\".\nThe report said James Harding, the then head of news who also rehired Bashir, should have spoken to Tony Hall, who was director general at the time, about the matter.\nCurrent BBC director general Tim Davie said the corporation would reflect on the findings.\nJulian Knight, the MP who chairs the Commons culture committee, said it was concerned by the report, asking: \"Where was the due diligence?\"\nMr Knight said: \"Senior members of the BBC knew [at the time of rehire] that Bashir had lied about the use of faked bank statements to gain access to Princess Diana.\"\nBashir, 58, is one of the most well-known journalists in the UK and his interview with Princess Diana for Panorama was a huge scoop for the BBC.\nBut last month's damning Dyson Report found Bashir acted in a \"deceitful\" way and faked documents to obtain access to Diana - and described him as \"unreliable\", \"devious\" and \"dishonest\".\nBashir was at the BBC until 1998, when he left to join ITV. He also made headlines for his 2003 interview with pop star Michael Jackson, and went onto work for various US television networks.\nIn September 2016, he returned to the BBC as religious affairs correspondent and was made religion editor in 2018. He resigned from that job in May, citing health reasons.\nThe new review - by senior BBC manager Ken MacQuarrie and published on Monday - was set up to find out why Bashir was rehired, when questions had already been asked about his conduct.\nThe review found: \nThe report also found that previous controversies involving Bashir \"were not given sufficient regard by James Harding\".\nThese controversies include remarks Bashir made about former US vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, which led to him leaving his his job as a daytime chat host on US TV network MSNBC in 2013.\nFive years earlier, while working for another US network, he was suspended and apologised for making lewd comments about Asian women. \nKen MacQuarrie's report was never going to be as explosive as Lord Dyson's, but because his focus was on much more recent events, he had the capacity to do terrible damage to the reputation of current BBC News personnel. \nHis report doesn't do that. It finds failings and oversights, but none nearly so egregious as the deception and cover-up that Dyson chronicled in his much more exhaustive analysis. \nThe BBC is scarred by what was previously reputed to be one of its great journalistic triumphs. But the injury pertains mostly to events from the 1990s. \nNevertheless, there is now a consensus that the rehiring of Martin Bashir was a mistake.\nAnd, as MacQuarrie notes, those responsible for it cannot plead ignorance of the controversies attached to him at the time - which went far beyond the Princess Diana interview.\nMr Harding said that, being the person in charge of news when Bashir was rehired, \"the responsibility sits with me\".\n\"Today's report shows we chose the person we thought was the best candidate for the job,\" he said in a statement.\n\"He was appointed after a formal interview process and once references were taken and considered.\n\"As the report concludes, we didn't know then what we know now.  Of course, if I had known, he wouldn't have got the job.\" \nIn a statement, BBC director general Mr Davie pointed out that the report found the recruitment process \"was targeted to find the right person for the role and it was conducted in good faith\".\n\"While the report finds processes were largely followed at the time, it is clear we need to reflect on the findings to ensure consistent best practice is applied in our recruitment,\" he said.\n\"Finally, it is without doubt that had the organisation been aware of what is now publicly known because of the Dyson report Martin Bashir would have never been reappointed.\" \nMr Knight, said: \"That the BBC considered rehiring Martin Bashir when there were high level doubts over his integrity stretches incredulity to breaking point. \n\"By this point, as the Dyson report concluded, senior members of the BBC knew that Bashir had lied about the use of faked bank statements to gain access to Princess Diana.\n\"If the BBC considered him 'unanimously' the best candidate, where was the due diligence that should have prevented the corporation from rehiring a former member of staff who had not told a very important truth? Where were senior level discussions?\"\nThe committee will hear evidence from Mr Davie, Lord Hall, and Lord Birt - another ex-BBC director general - on Tuesday.\nIn a statement last month, Bashir apologised for mocking up the documents, which he said was a \"stupid thing to do\" and that he regretted it.\nBut he said he remained \"immensely proud\" of the interview and that the documents \"had no bearing whatsoever\" on Princess Diana's decision to do the interview."

      "text": "Chrissy Teigen has broken a month-long social media silence to apologise for bullying several people on Twitter.\nIn a blog post, the US model reflected on \"the crushing weight of regret for the things I've said in the past\".\nTeigen published a series of tweets in May apologising to TV personality Courtney Stodden, who accused her of online bullying. \nStodden accepted the apology but said it could just be an attempt to limit damage to Teigen's reputation.\nIn her latest blog post, Teigen said she was privately reaching out to people she'd insulted in the past, though she did not say who.\n\"There is simply no excuse for my past horrible tweets,\" wrote Teigen, who is married to singer John Legend. \"I was a troll, full stop. And I am so sorry.\"\n\"I took to Twitter to try to gain attention and show off what I at the time believed was a crude, clever, harmless quip. I thought it made me cool and relatable if I poked fun at celebrities,\" she continued.\n\"In reality, I was insecure, immature and in a world where I thought I needed to impress strangers to be accepted,\" Teigen added.\nTeigen currently has 13.5 million Twitter followers and 35 million on Instagram - where she also shared a link to her blog post.\nShe said she was not seeking sympathy, and that she was \"no longer the person who wrote those horrible things\" after getting married, having kids and attending therapy.\n\"We are all more than our worst moments,\" Teigen wrote. \"I won't ask for your forgiveness, only your patience and tolerance.\"\nIn 2011 Teigen, who was aged 25 at the time, sent Twitter messages to then-16-year-old Stodden, urging them to take their own life.\nDuring that period Stodden rose to fame as the teenage bride of actor Doug Hutchison, who was aged 50 when they married.\nHutchison, who featured alongside Tom Hanks in the 1999 film The Green Mile, was divorced from Stodden last year.\nStodden, who has come out as non-binary, recently told The Daily Beast that other celebrities had commented on the relationship.\n\"People came out of the woodwork to beat up on a kid because she was in a situation that she shouldn't have been in,\" Stodden told the publication.\n\"There were a lot of celebrities acting like playground bullies.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "title": "Australia trade deal will not hit UK farmers, says Liz Truss",
      "tags": "UK trade tariffs,Agriculture,Trade,Australia",
      "text": "A new trade deal between the UK and Australia will not harm British farmers' livelihoods, the trade secretary has told the BBC.  \nLiz Truss denied that imports of Australian beef would flood the UK and said British export markets would grow. \nThe pact - the first to be built from scratch since the UK left the EU - will cover British goods such as cars, Scotch whisky, biscuits and ceramics.\nBut some UK farmers fear they may be undercut on price and standards.\nSpeaking to the BBC's World at One programme, Ms Truss said: \"At the moment there are extremely small quantities of Australian beef coming into the UK.\n\"So what we'd be looking at here is over time some of the EU imports [lost due to Brexit] being replaced by Australian imports.\"\nShe added that the deal - which is seen as an important step towards the UK joining a wider Asia Pacific free-trade agreement - would also create opportunities. \n\"We can see the evidence, that sales of British beef international are growing to places like Asia-Pacific and the United States because people want to buy high quality British products produced in a high animal welfare way,\" Ms Truss said.\nShe said by 2030, 66% of the world's middle classes will be in Asia and they want to buy products such as whisky, cars, beef, and lamb from the UK. \"We need to be positive about what we've got to sell rather than being defensive,\" she said.\nHowever, Dominic Goudie, head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation, expressed concern about the lack of detail in the deal.\n\"It is now vital that we know the detail of what has been agreed to help businesses understand and begin to prepare for the new terms of trade,\" he said.\n\"The terms must also ensure that consumers have continued confidence that any agreement maintains the highest food safety and animal welfare standards.\"\nNational Farmers' Union president President Minette Batters said: \"While the government has previously been keen to highlight how our free trade agreements will uphold our high standards of food production, there has always been a question mark over how this can be achieved while opening up our markets to food produced to different standards. \n\"We will need to know more about any provisions on animal welfare and the environment to ensure our high standards of production are not undermined by the terms of this deal.\"\nUnder the deal with Australia, the government says farmers will be protected by a cap on tariff-free imports for 15 years, using tariff rate quotas and other safeguards. \nBut some UK farmers have concerns there will be no meaningful safeguards in place to stop them being undercut by cheap imports.\nFarmers in Australia are allowed to use some hormone growth promoters, pesticides, and feed additives that are banned in the UK.\nThe UK Trade and Business Commission is worried that Australian farming operates on a scale that UK counterparts cannot compete with, saying Australia contains eight of the 10 largest farms in the world, including one which is larger than Israel.\nAccording to the UK's National Farmers Union, Australian farmers are able to produce beef at a lower cost of production, and could undercut farmers in the UK.\nBut Ms Truss said the deal would be fully scrutinised by the Trade and Agriculture Commission and MPs could block it if they were not happy. \nShe added that it would create better access for UK digital and financial services and better arrangements for UK citizens who want to work in Australia.\nWelsh lamb and Australian wine are said to have been on the menu as Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison settled the deal over dinner - but ultimately this deal is more significant in symbolic than economic terms. \nFor the government's own estimates say the new arrangements may add just 0.02% to our GDP, and the impact on prices is negligible. \nBut this, the first bespoke deal of the post-Brexit era, signifies global Britain's ambitions. The hope is that this paves the way for more alliances beyond the EU - starting with a group of trans-Pacific nations, the CPTPP. They only buy 8% of our exports - and we have deals already with the majority of members. But the ultimate hope is that key partners - such as the US - might also join. \nIt also symbolises though, the sacrifices that may be needed to get deals. British farmers fear they will face more competition from Australian counterparts on their home soil. Australian farmers say they won't be flooding the market. The UK is so far away that even the 80% increase in Australian imports the government predicts equates to 0.1% of total UK imports. \nIt'll be a while before the detail of this deal can be publicly scrutinised - even by those who'll be affected. But the concern is that this sets a marker, that  agriculture may be up for grabs when it comes to compromise in future and far bigger trade deals.\nThe UK government has signed a long list of trade deals over the past year, but they have been rollovers of those the UK already had as part of the EU.\nIn 2019-20, trade in goods and services between Australia and the UK was valued at \u00a320.1bn. The government says the deal will boost UK industries that employ 3.5 million people across the country. \nMetals, wine and machines have formed the biggest goods exports from Australia to the UK, while Australia's main UK imports are cars, medicines and alcoholic drinks.\nTrade in meat between the two countries is small at present, with 14% of sheep meat imports to the UK coming from Australia and just 0.15% of all Australian beef exports going to the UK.\n\"A deal would be good for my exports if there's a drop in the tariffs but if we start importing more I might be faced with more competition here,\" says Mary Quicke, owner of Devon-based artisan cheesemaker Quicke's.\nShe exports about 10% of her produce to Australia, but is more concerned about Europe. \"I would rather they had another look at the Brexit deal and ironed out a lot of the problems there.\n\"There's a dreadful amount of paperwork for exporting to the EU right now, it's a complete nightmare.\n\"I want to preserve our beautiful patchwork of British farms, so I'm cautious. Our milk is produced with half the carbon footprint of milk worldwide so it's really important that we don't just create a worse environmental footprint.\"\nThe deal marks the end of what has essentially been a 50-year lock-out for Australian farmers, who have struggled to navigate Brussels' restrictions, tariffs and quotas.\nThe president of the Australian National Farmers' Federation said it had been very difficult to break into the UK because it was \"way too expensive and way too far\".\nAustralian farmers have also been looking to diversify due to the increased tensions between Australia and China. In the past year, China has imposed tariffs and restrictions on everything from Australian beef, barley and wine, to rock lobster and coal."

      "tags": "Policing,Stalking,Women",
      "text": "A woman whose stalker tried to convince her family and friends that she had given him HIV says police officers left her feeling unprotected.\nAmy, 26, was bombarded with messages about her sexual health by a man she met on a dating app.\nIt comes as a BBC investigation reveals new powers to protect victims are not being used by some police forces, despite a surge in stalking offences.\nStalking protection orders (SPOs) were introduced in January last year.\nThe Home Office is set to meet with the police to find ways to bolster the figures as forces look to improve training for officers.\nVictims of stalking have called for better education and training so officers can recognise when action is needed to apply for an order.\nAmy said: \"[My stalker] accused me of giving him HIV, even after I showed him my negative test results.\n\"I was petrified.  It triggered my mental health and I did feel quite suicidal at that point. Nothing I said to him was stopping him from messaging me.\"\n\"I didn't feel that I was protected by the police at all, and I had to go back to my family home. He knew where I lived and where I worked. He had called my work and had spoken to my manager to find me.\"\nAmy was granted a Stalking Protection Order in February and said it had made a difference.\nShe said: \"It makes me feel safe, I was always looking over my shoulder. But now I have my protection order I don't feel the need too. Police officers didn't know what it is or how it works\"\nJessica - not her real name - experienced stalking behaviour from someone she employed at the restaurant where she works.\nShe experienced abuse online, personal threats and vandalism to her workplace, but struggled for it be taken seriously.\nShe said: \"It was impossible. They wouldn't put it together as one case. Every single time I phoned up to report an incident they would log it as a separate incident.\" \nIt took Jessica three years to obtain a Stalking Protection Order, after she raised the new powers available to her with the police.\nShe said: \"Nobody knows what it is or how it works. I had to explain it to so many young police officers. They had heard of it in theory but didn't understand what it was.\"\nHer stalker has since breached the protection order.\n\"Every time I call [the police] I have to go through the whole thing again with another officer who doesn't understand about SPOs.\n\"I think it's great legislation, but I just wish the police would think about how they are actually going to use it\" \nStalking protection orders were introduced in January 2020 to police forces in Wales and England.\nThey are civil orders which aim to protect victims, and it is a criminal offence to breach the terms of an order.\nPolice apply to the magistrates for a stalking protection order, which usually remains in place for two years. The idea is that an order can be used quickly, so an interim order can be granted to provide immediate protection for the victim while a decision is being made.\nWhen issued, they can include bans like stopping an offender contacting a person through social media, through a third party, or being within a certain distance of their home or workplace.\nUse of the new orders is varied across the country:\nDuring that time the number of reported cases of stalking has surged.\nThe latest figures show 59,950 incidents were recorded across England and Wales in the nine months between April and December 2020 - almost double the annual number of incidents for the year ending March 2020.\nMore than half of all police forces have seen stalking incidents double over the same time period.\nAnd the national charge rate for stalking offences is at its lowest point for five years, falling from 23% in 2015-16 to just 6% for the nine months to December 2020. The lowest charge rate for stalking recorded by any force was 2% - seen in Kent.\nPolice forces said officers were being given more training on how to use stalking protection orders to encourage more applications in appropriate cases.\nThey added changes to how stalking crimes were recorded, as well as last year's lockdowns and the growth of online stalking, had been a factor in the surge in stalking incidents.\nClive Ruggles, whose 24-year-old daughter Alice Ruggles was murdered by her stalker in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, in 2017, said he was \"disappointed\" at the lack of use in some forces.\n\"We have to train front line police to recognise stalking and to not pass it off as a series of unrelated events or as harassment,\" he said.\n\"Stalking is about obsession and all that that implies. We have to teach the front line officers to join the dots up enough to recognise what stalking is, to crime it as stalking and then to pass it on to the right specialists.\"\nSuky Bhaker, the chief executive of the personal safety charity The Suzy Lamplugh Trust, said the inconsistent application of the law was concerning.\nShe said: \"We're seeing a real postcode lottery in terms of the support that victims get.\n\"Often what we're finding is criminal justice professionals are not identifying stalking, not putting their appropriate risk management strategies in place and not offering protection, like the stalking protection orders for victims.\"\nLisa King, the director of communications with the charity Refuge, said the findings were disappointing.\n\"This really should be a wakeup call for police forces across the country to get the training in place, and then start to message also that these orders are there, that women and men can use, so that they are taken up and protection is given,\" she said.\nKaty Bourne, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Sussex, is the lead for stalking in Wales and England. She is also a victim of stalking.\n\"We've issued about 30 stalking protection orders and we've got several others in the pipeline,\" she said.\nShe urged other forces to use the orders to protect victims.\n\"It says to the victim 'we take you seriously' - and that in itself is such a relief that the police are listening to you and believe you.\"\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"Stalking Protection Orders stop perpetrators in their tracks and prevent them contacting victims. We expect police forces to make full use of them.\n\"The Home Office and College of Policing have worked closely with forces to produce guidance on issuing them.\n\"Next week, Home Office officials will meet with the police and other stakeholders who work to tackle stalking to set out our findings on how effectively police forces have been using SPOs and discuss how to improve this.\"\nNational Police Chiefs' Council lead for stalking and harassment, Deputy Chief Constable Paul Mills, said: \"We continue to work with victim groups and others to improve our response to this issue. We have updated the training and guidance to officers and there are specialists in each force who are responsible for improving standards. \n\"This new training and changes to the way we record crime, where we will still take a detailed report even if there is no information which can identify a suspect, go some way to explaining the increase in offences.\n\"We know how important charging an offender and securing justice is and we are working closely with the Crown Prosecution Service to ensure more are brought before a court.\""

      "tags": "Art,Auctions,Tim Berners-Lee,NFTs,Internet",
      "text": "The creator of the world wide web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, is selling off the original code used to create the modern internet as an NFT. \nNFTs are a form of unique ownership for digital-only items and do not necessarily include copyright control. \nThey have also been widely criticised as a money-making scheme and bad for the environment. \nSome have expressed surprise at the news given that Sir Tim famously refused to patent his invention.\nThe sale is being handled by Sotheby's auction house, and the money made will be put towards causes chosen by Sir Tim and his wife, Sotheby's said. \nSir Tim invented the world wide web - the main modern way we use the internet - in 1989. \nHe proposed a way of linking together different pieces of information stored on the early internet through hyperlinks, and built the first web browser and web server.  \nThe first web page described the idea: \"Aiming to give universal access to a large universe of documents.\" \nSotheby's is auctioning off a collection of four different items as a single digital NFT. \nThey include \"the original time-stamped files\" of the source code written for the project, \"an animated visualisation\" of that code, a letter from Sir Tim about the process, and a \"digital poster\" of the code created by him. \nIn all, the files represent nearly 10,000 lines of written code.\nSir Tim has never sought to make money directly from his creation, and the web remains an open standard. Cern, the research organisation Sir Tim worked for at the time, relinquished all its rights to the technology and put it in the open domain in 1993. \nThe value of the code is arguably in its historical significance, and the fact that this digital auction is endorsed by its creator and \"digitally signed\" as authentic. \nSotheby's is advertising the collection as \"the only signed copy of the code for the first web browser in existence\", in a manner similar to the way handwritten journals of a famous figure might be sold. \nIt's likely that this unusual auction will raise a hefty sum for the good causes Sir Tim and Lady Berners-Lee support. Some of the air has gone out of the NFT bubble but the web's source code is just the kind of thing likely to catch the eye of some wealthy fan of all things crypto.\nStill, for the man who tweeted \"this is for everyone\" about the web at the London Olympics Opening Ceremony and has won huge respect for never having wanted to profit from his creation, this is a somewhat unlikely move.\nThere is plenty of controversy around NFTs - to some they are a brilliant innovation which means digital art and other collectibles can be monetised, to others they're little more than a giant scam which gives gullible - or publicity seeking  - buyers the illusion of ownership.\nBut the biggest question mark is over the environmental impact of NFTs created on the Ethereum blockchain. One analyst puts the carbon footprint of a single Ethereum transaction at more than 14 times that of putting an art print in the post.\nConcerns about this have seen some digital artists reject NFTs - one described them as \"an ecological nightmare pyramid scheme\".\nWe wanted to raise some of these issues with  Sir Tim Berners-Lee but his office referred all questions to Sotheby's.\n\"Why an NFT? Well, it's a natural thing to do as when you're a computer scientist and when you write code and have been for many years,\" said Sir Tim in press material issued by Sotheby's. \n\"It feels right to digitally sign my autograph on a completely digital artefact.\" \nAnd he also drew comparisons between the abstract nature of the web itself and this new idea. \n\"NFTs, be they artworks or a digital artefact like this, are the latest playful creations in this realm, and the most appropriate means of ownership that exists,\" he continued. \n\"They are the ideal way to package the origins behind the web.\"\nAnd the auction house maintains that \"the carbon footprint of this NFT is negligible\" because it will pay for a carbon offset for the minting and transaction costs of the sale - though the blockchain on which the transaction lives has immense day-to-day running costs.\nSotheby's said the auction would run from 23-30 June, with an opening bid of $1,000.

Once I understood this element was vital, I produced some of my best work.\"\nTyrone Williams' photos for the show included a large-format black-and-white landscape image taken in Glencoe and a shot of a man in white trainers walking through a puddle in Soho.\nHis own image of The Ninth Wave captured the band in an eerie green light, while he snapped a young woman in a hoodie for his fashion assignment.\n\"Tyrone is an art photographer, with a really clear voice,\" said Rankin of the 28-year-old graphic designer. \"His work grabbed my attention from the very beginning.\"\nWilliams said it was \"such a great feeling and an amazing validation\" to be named winner but insisted that all of the contestants deserved that title equally.\nWhen the show was announced in March, Rankin said it was \"an incredible opportunity to nurture the next generation of photographers\".\nAll episodes of Great British Photography Challenge are now available on BBC iPlayer alongside an online exhibition of the winners' work. \nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Sometimes I have to just stay in bed.\"\nSome days, she said she did not \"have the strength to even get to the bathroom, or even to have a shower\".\nHelen called for a \"joined up\" consultant-led approach for long Covid patients, and has told the minister personally in a meeting.\n\"I'm fighting this to the end. I'm not giving up,\" she added.\nHundreds of thousands of people in Wales have had Covid-19 and research suggests as many as 10% might experience longer-term effects.\nIn May, the Office for National Statistics estimated that one million people across the UK living in private households had self-reported long Covid, with symptoms that have lasted more than four weeks after the initial infection.\nThis included 50,000 people in Wales.\nThe new recovery programme has been welcomed by the Royal College of GPs in Wales.\nJoint chairman Prof Peter Saul said: \"The condition has required us all to learn and adapt quickly to support our patients.\n\"Primary care is at the forefront of long Covid care and this announcement will provide confidence that we will have the infrastructure, shared knowledge and data for GPs and their teams across Wales to respond to patients' needs.\""

      "text": "Israel says it carried out air strikes in Gaza overnight after Palestinians launched incendiary balloons from the territory, in the first major flare-up since an 11-day conflict last month.\nThe Israeli military said it targeted compounds belonging to Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza.\nThe incendiary balloons sparked 20 fires in southern Israel on Tuesday.\nHamas said they were a response to a march by Israeli nationalists in occupied East Jerusalem.\nThere were no casualties on either side and calm had been restored by Wednesday morning.\nIn a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its fighter jets had hit military compounds operated by Hamas in Khan Younis and Gaza City.\nIt said \"terrorist activity\" took place in the compounds, and that the IDF was \"prepared for all scenarios, including the resumption of hostilities, in the face of continued terror acts from the Gaza Strip\".\nThe Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that aircraft bombed a site in the Maen area, south of Khan Younis, and another south of Gaza City, causing material damage.\nA Hamas spokesman said on Twitter that Palestinians would continue to pursue their \"brave resistance and defend their rights and sacred sites\" in Jerusalem.\nThe IDF said the strikes were carried out in response to the \"arson balloons launched from Gaza into Israel\" on Tuesday.\nIn recent years, militants have frequently sent helium balloons and kites carrying containers of burning fuel and explosive devices over the Gaza border. \nThe devices have caused hundreds of fires in Israel, burning thousands of hectares of forest and farmland.\nThe air strikes were the first carried out under Israel's new government, which took office on Sunday, ending Benjamin Netanyahu's 12 years in power. \nNaftali Bennett, the new prime minister, is a right-wing nationalist who heads a coalition of eight parties spanning the entire spectrum of Israeli politics.\nIn a separate development on Wednesday, the IDF said soldiers shot a Palestinian woman who it alleged had attempted a car ramming and stabbing attack at a checkpoint in the occupied West Bank. She is reported to have died of her wounds. \nby Rushdi Abu Alouf, BBC News, Gaza City\nThe recent air raids lasted for only 10 minutes, but they were enough to remind the city's residents, who are trying to recover from the aftermath of the recent fighting, that the ceasefire is fragile. \nIt is not only the sounds of explosions that remind people of the war here. You only have to drive your car or walk the streets to witness the scale of destruction that has befallen the city. Tons of rubble still block the main roads in the heart of Gaza. \nA local street vendor, Abu Muhammad, sells nuts on a small cart in the Rimal neighbourhood, which was subjected to the largest strikes in the previous round of violence. He told me: \"We can no longer tolerate more wars, the coronavirus pandemic stopped our work for many months, and the last war caused a great loss, I could no longer feed my six children.\" \nA neighbour, who lives near a Hamas military site that was hit in the latest strikes, told me by phone it was scary watching new plumes of smoke rising.\nThe Jerusalem Day flag march is an annual event that marks Israel's capture of East Jerusalem - home to the Old City and its holy sites - in the 1967 Middle East War. Palestinians see it as a provocation.\nAt Tuesday's event, hundreds of mostly young, nationalist Israelis danced, sang and waved Israeli flags in front of the Old City's Damascus Gate, the main entrance to the Muslim Quarter. \nThey later entered through another gate to reach the Western Wall, one of Judaism's holiest sites.\nIsrael's centrist Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, praised the management of the event but condemned a group of marchers who were filmed chanting racist slogans.\n\"The fact that there are extremists for whom the Israeli flag represents hate and racism is abominable and intolerable,\" said Mr Lapid. \"It is incomprehensible how one can hold an Israeli flag in one's hand and shout 'Death to Arabs' at the same time.\"\nPalestinians accused Israeli security forces of violent and discriminatory policing as the area was cleared for the march.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said at least 33 Palestinian protesters were injured in clashes with Israeli police officers, who fired stun grenades and rubber bullets.\nThe police force said two officers were lightly injured and that 17 people were arrested.\nOriginally, the flag march was supposed to take place on 10 May. But it was interrupted by Hamas militants in Gaza firing rockets towards the holy city, which led to the 11-day conflict.\nAs soon as a ceasefire took hold, the organisers asked for the march to be rescheduled. \nIt was due to take place last Thursday, but it was cancelled by the organisers after Israeli police rejected the proposed route, citing security concerns.\nAn amended route that avoided passing through the Damascus Gate was later approved by the new Israeli government, though the leader of the Arab Islamist Raam party in the coalition said it should have been called off.\nThe Palestinian Authority's prime minister warned that there could be \"dangerous repercussions\".\nThe conflict began after weeks of spiralling Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews.\nHamas began firing rockets into Israel after warning it to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes from Israel on Gaza targets.\nAt least 256 people were killed in Gaza, according to the UN, and 13 people were killed in Israel before an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire took effect on 21 May.\nThe UN said at least 128 of those killed in Gaza were civilians. Israel's military said 200 were militants; Hamas's leader in Gaza put the number of fighters killed at 80.\nMore than 16,000 homes in Gaza were destroyed or damaged in the conflict, along with 58 schools and training centres, nine hospitals, 19 clinics and vital infrastructure, according to the UN."

It was drafted based on the 45 second video of the incident which was shared very widely on social media this morning. \n\"We were subsequently made aware of a longer piece of footage lasting 3 minutes and 28 seconds which shows the incident in full. \n\"It is clear that the incident began on Whitehall where officers were present.\" \nIt added that \"the behaviour shown in the video is unacceptable - members of the public, of any profession, have the right to go about their day without being subjected to verbal harassment or actions that put them in fear for their safety\".\nResponding to concerns about police actions during the incident, the Met said it would \"be reviewing our actions with a view to improving the policing of events for all Londoners\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The easing of Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland is likely to be pushed back by three weeks, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.\nThe whole country had been due to move to the lowest level zero of its five-tier system from 28 June.\nHowever Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that this was likely to be be delayed by three weeks so that more people can be vaccinated against the virus.\nThe Covid case rate in Scotland is five times higher than it was in early May.\nMs Sturgeon said that \"we need to buy sufficient time for vaccination to get ahead and stay ahead of the virus, and that is the reason for caution at this juncture\".\nShe added: \"Doing that will give us the best chance, later in July, of getting back on track and restoring the much greater normality that we all crave\".\nBusiness organisations said the delay would be \"frustrating and painful\" for firms who were gearing up to make the most of a boom in summer trade over the coming weeks, and called for greater support to be given. \nAnd opposition parties accused the Scottish government of sending out mixed messages over Covid restrictions in recent weeks. \nIt comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that plans to lift restrictions in England would be pushed back by four weeks until 19 July.\nA formal decision on what level each area of Scotland will be in will not be taken until next week, but Ms Sturgeon said it was \"reasonable to indicate now that I think it unlikely that any part of the country will move down a level\" as planned.\nIt means the country's mainland council areas will remain in either level one or level two, although many island communities including Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero.\nMs Sturgeon said the vaccination programme was weakening the link between the rising number of cases - largely driven by the so-called Delta variant that was first detected in India - and serious illness and deaths.\nBut she said there were still too many people who have not yet had both doses of the vaccine. \nShe also said she did not want to \"commit to firm dates\" for easing restrictions, saying she was \"not going to give false guarantees\" in the face of an \"unpredictable virus\".\nThe Scottish government says the entire adult population will have been offered an appointment for a first dose of the vaccine by the end of next week, with everyone due to have had their first dose by 18 July - two weeks ahead of schedule.\nIt is also planning for the possibility of booster vaccines against Covid-19 in the autumn.\nThe first minister added: \"The vaccination programme is going exceptionally well and it is being rolled out just as quickly as supplies allow. But there is still a significant proportion of the population that isn't yet fully vaccinated.\n\"To be blunt, that remains our biggest vulnerability at this stage - and it is a significant one.\"\nWhile the wider easing of restrictions is likely to be delayed, ministers will consider whether some rules could be changed to correct \"perceived anomalies\".\nMany soft play owners, for example, have questioned why their facilities remain closed in level two areas while trampoline centres are allowed to open.\nQuestions have also been asked about why thousands of fans are allowed to gather in a Euro 2020 fan zone in Glasgow, but parents are not allowed to attend outdoor nursery graduations. \nThe government is also to publish the outcome of a review of physical distancing rules, along with a report on what life could look like once Scotland moves beyond level zero - which Ms Sturgeon said she hoped could still happen \"later in the summer\".\nShe said breaking the link between cases and hospital admissions would allow for a move to a \"fundamentally different way of dealing with this virus\" with \"far, far less restrictions and hopefully no meaningful restrictions at all\".\nMeanwhile, the finance ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer calling for an urgent meeting with him to discuss the financial recovery from the pandemic, including the furlough scheme.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said people would be \"frustrated\" that restrictions looked set to continue for \"weeks or even months\", pressing for more detail on when the vaccination programme would be complete.\nHe said: \"We had all hoped for a summer of freedom but instead this stubborn virus is determined to keep us scunnered instead.\n\"It's disappointing that there was no further hope or information for people planning weddings, businesses waiting to know when they can reopen or parents desperately hoping to see their children graduate from nursery.\"\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called for called for action to speed up vaccinations and the publishing of hot-spot protocols.\nHe added: \"In order to maintain public trust and confidence we need consistent communications, consistent decision-making, adequate support for businesses and employees alongside a robust vaccination programme, and hot-spot protocols.\n\"I accept what the first minister has said around the delay, but there has been mixed messages that I think do not help maintain public trust.\n\"We have also seen inconsistent decision making: why is it okay to have 3,000 fans at a fan zone, but parents cannot attend a nursery graduation outdoors?\"\nMs Sturgeon said she understood why some people would be \"nervous\" about the fan zone, but said she was a \"highly regulated environment\" and was \"confident it is low risk based on public health advice\"."

      "text": "Broadcaster Piers Morgan has attacked Ikea after it became one of a number of companies to withdraw advertising from newly launched news channel GB News.\nThe former Good Morning Britain anchor said the Swedish furniture makers were \"pathetic virtue-signalling twerps\" and that he would now be boycotting them.\nIkea said it had not knowingly booked slots on GB News, saying it was not in line with its \"humanistic values\".\nAndrew Neil, GB News' chairman, issued his own response to the decision.\n\"Ikea has decided to boycott GB News because of our alleged values,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\"Here are Ikea's values - a French CEO who is a criminal with a two year suspended jail sentence for spying on staff.\"\nThe company's French arm was fined \u20ac1m (\u00a3860,000) this week after it was found guilty of using private detectives and police officers to collect staff's private data.\nJean-Louis Baillot, Ikea France's former CEO, was given a two-year suspended jail term and a \u20ac50,000 (\u00a343,000) fine. His lawyer said he was considering an appeal.\nOctopus Energy and cider firm Kopparberg are among the other brands that have withdrawn advertising since GB News' launch on Sunday.\nKopparberg said its advert ran \"without our knowledge\" and that it was undertaking a review of the channel's content.\nA post on the its Twitter account said: \"Kopparberg is a drink for everyone and we have immediately suspended our ads from this channel pending further review of its content.\"\nOctopus said it would only run ads in future if the news channel proved \"genuinely balanced\".\nGreg Jackson, the company's founder, said it did not advertise on platforms \"whose primary purpose is the distribution of hate\" and said it would only run adverts on new channels after watching their output for a period of time.\nThe Open University and Ovo Energy also said they were pausing advertising, which they said had been placed by a media partnership without their knowledge.\nGB News has vowed to fight cancel culture and reflect voices not heard in the media.\nBut it has faced criticism from campaigners such as the group Stop Funding Hate, who say its launch brings highly partisan Fox News-style programming to the UK.\nNeil, the BBC's former political presenter, has dismissed the Fox News comparisons as \"nonsense\".\nAs chairman and a presenter, he has promised to challenge the \"echo chamber\" of the \"metropolitan\" news.\nIn an opening monologue to viewers on Sunday night, Neil said GB News would aim to \"puncture the pomposity of our elites in politics, business, media and academia and expose their growing promotion of cancel culture for the threat to free speech and democracy that it is\".\nCancel culture is an idea generally promoted by right-leaning commentators that activists, mostly on the left, are seeking to suppress free expression by permanently shaming and ostracising individuals deemed to have transgressed.\nIt is often associated with woke culture - a call for an increased alertness to social injustice that some on the right of politics feel has strayed into stifling political correctness.\nFraser Nelson, editor of the Spectator which Neil is also chairman of, told BBC News that Kopparberg's boycott could lead to a consumer backlash. \n\"Cancel culture is not popular. If Kopparberg is clever enough to sell cider to the English (who have the best apples on earth) then it should be clever enough to realise its mistake. We should expect a clarification soon. \n\"Being 'for everyone' should mean being for everyone.\"  \nPress Gazette reported that other companies and organisations including Nivea and drinks brand Grolsch had also distanced themselves from the news channel within 48 hours of its launch. \nPromoting a personality-led approach, the GB News presenting line-up includes ex-BBC host Simon McCoy, ITV veteran Alastair Stewart and ex-Sun journalist Dan Wootton.\nMorgan is not a member of the station's line-up, despite speculation he would join the channel following his leaving ITV's Good Morning Britain show in March.\nTopics discussed on Wootton's Dan's Digest segment have included the UK's lockdown extension, taking the knee and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.\nSpeaking to BBC News on Tuesday, Richard Wilson, director of media group Stop Funding Hate, said that the immediate controversial tone meant \"it's no surprise\" that a reputable brand such as Kopparberg are \"stepping away, and refusing to align with this\".\nThe group has begun compiling a list of brands advertising on the fledgling channel - urging its 120,000 followers on Twitter to exert pressure on them on social media.\nGB News is available on Freeview channel 236 as well as other platforms including Sky, Virgin Media and Freesat.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

struck in January 2020 - was the \"only model for success\".\nAfter meeting Mr Lewis on Monday night, Ms McDonald said government intervention was the \"only way forward to finally resolve\" the dispute over Irish language legislation.\nShe said Sinn F\u00e9in had declined an earlier offer from the UK government to legislate at Westminster because its preference was for the matter to be dealt with at Stormont.\n\"We have engaged intensively with the DUP and with party leader Edwin Poots,\" said Ms McDonald.\n\"He has told us that they will not be delivering [an Irish language act] in this mandate.\n\"This legislation was negotiated a year-and-a-half ago and it is now incumbent on the British and Irish governments to act.\"\nThe 2020 deal as part of the New Decade, New Approach (NDNA) agreement, included an Office of Identity and Cultural Expression, an Irish language commissioner and a commissioner to enhance and develop the language and culture of the Ulster-Scots/Ulster-British tradition.\nAlliance Party leader Naomi Long accused the DUP of refusing to show \"any sort of compromise or ability to work with others\".\n\"It's apparent that some parties now see this change of leadership in the DUP as an opportunity to renegotiate, reposition themselves and create a crisis where none is necessary,\" Mrs Long told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"We all signed up to NDNA knowing that there were parts of that agreement that would be more difficult, would be more challenging, but we knew that it had to be done.\n\"All we need to do is move on, get the Irish language act underway, stop messing around and breaking promises and get on with the real business of government.\"\nHowever, Mr Wilson, DUP chief whip at Westminster, said: \"To force through the latest Sinn F\u00e9in wish list will cause further damage to the credibility of the Northern Ireland Assembly.\n\"Rather than running to Her Majesty's Government when they can't get their way, republicans should respect our mandate. \n\"Sinn F\u00e9in is playing the politics of ransom and are placing culture above health, education and economic recovery.\"\n In July 2019, when Stormont was suspended, MPs at Westminster backed amendments to liberalise abortion and extend same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland.\nMr Wilson said this \"only served to undermine devolution\".\nDUP Education Minister Michelle McIlveen said she would not be \"particularly happy\" about the secretary of state intervening to pass Irish language legislation at Westminster.\nSpeaking during a visit to a school in Belfast - her first engagement since taking over the role -  she accused Sinn F\u00e9in of prioritising Irish language commitments \"above all else\".\n\"This is a devolved matter - the secretary of state has gotten himself involved in previous issues but this is about the devolution package and how that's being respected,\" she added. \nExplaining the latest developments in Northern Irish politics to people who live here is sometimes hard enough - never mind to people who don't\nSinn F\u00e9in's appeal to the British government to bypass Stormont and legislate for the Irish language directly is such a moment. \nThis from the party who warned against the introduction of direct rule for the three years Stormont was suspended is quite a move.\nPragmatism or hypocrisy? You decide and many will.\nEven more astonishing is the claim that Westminster offered to do it weeks ago and Sinn F\u00e9in turned them down, believing it could be sorted at home.\nThe fact they've changed their minds shows that things between the party and the new DUP leadership could, shall we say, be better.\nIt's also a sure sign that Sinn F\u00e9in, no more than the DUP, want a collapse they would ship their fair share of blame for from an increasingly unforgiving public.\nAnother one for the pages of that still unwritten book \"Stormont, you couldn't make it up\".\nAlso speaking to Good Morning Ulster, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said all of the NDNA commitments needed to be delivered \"urgently\", adding: \"That includes the Irish language legislation, it includes other cultural legislation in the agreement.\"\nHowever, Mr Eastwood said it would be \"absolutely wrong\" to bring the executive down over the issue.\nInstead he said he and his fellow SDLP MP Claire Hanna would seek to legislate on the Irish language at Westminster.\nHe said if the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in could not reach a solution he would attempt to amend a bill related to Northern Ireland that is currently making its way through the House of Commons\nOn Monday Mr Poots said \"time will tell\" whether the implementation of the deal would happen in the existing Northern Ireland Assembly term, which is due to expire in April 2022.\nHe added that it was not appropriate for Sinn F\u00e9in to set preconditions on nominating a first and deputy first minister.\n\"It's not respecting someone's mandate... I'm not setting preconditions to the selection of Sinn Fein's deputy first minister,\" he said.\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly has the power to make laws in any area that isn't \"reserved\" to Westminster.\nReserved matters include things such as defence, income tax and making foreign treaties.\nAny matter that is not a reserved matter is devolved.\nThe Northern Ireland Act - which established the assembly - allows the NI secretary to make any devolved matter a reserved matter, or vice versa, using a legislative instrument known as an Order in Council.\nHowever in the case of the language and cultural package agreed as part of the New Decade, New Approach deal in January 2020, it was specifically stated that the legislation would be established as new dedicated parts of the Northern Ireland Act.\nThis meant it was always going to require passage at Westminster at some stage of the process.\nHowever it will still be up to Stormont to implement the legislation in practice."

Attendees will have to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative test. \nThe announcement that the vaccine rollout would be accelerated came as Prof Graham Medley, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the numbers of people dying from coronavirus would rise.\n\"The question is really as to what level they will rise,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"It is possible we could end up with a situation whereby the numbers of people going to hospital really mean that the government have to take some kind of action that they don't want to.\"\nBut he added that the government has had to do this throughout the pandemic.\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said the delay was \"extremely welcome\" and he hoped it would be \"enough\".\nHe told BBC Breakfast there was \"very promising evidence\" that the vaccination rollout meant there were fewer serious cases of coronavirus, and that getting more people vaccinated would allow England  to \"get ahead of this current wave\".\nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said he shared the prime minister's confidence about the 19 July end date.\n\"One can never predict the future with perfect confidence,\" he told BBC Breakfast. \n\"But insofar as we can be confident about anything in this complex world, we can be confident that the increased level of vaccination that we will have by 19 July should allow us to further relax restrictions.\"\nHowever, Mark Harper, chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of Tory MPs, said \"we could have moved ahead perfectly safely\" without the delay.\nHe told LBC radio that the prime minister's comments about 19 July were \"exactly the same words as he was using about 21 June\".\n\"So some of us, I'm afraid, are a bit worried that we're not going to actually move forward on 19 July,\" he said.\nLabour, meanwhile, has accused the government of incompetence over its handling of Covid variants, saying lax border policies led to the Delta variant entering the country.\n\"Rather than red-listing this variant, we essentially gave it the red carpet treatment as 20,000 people were allowed to arrive from India over a number of weeks in April, even though the warning signs were there,\" shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said. \n\"That essentially seeded this Delta variant across the country.\"\nThe confidence among ministers that all remaining restrictions will lift on 19 July is understandable given the extent of the vaccine rollout.\nBut behind the scenes, the one fear is what to do if cases are still rising at that point.\nInfections are currently climbing sharply and modellers believe this could lead to more than 1,000 hospital admissions a day later in the summer.\nThat is equivalent to what the NHS would face for all types of respiratory illness in the middle of a bad winter.\nThe hope is that in a couple of weeks infection levels will have started to flatten, and maybe even fall, as the virus hits the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme.\nBut there are no guarantees of that.\nKnowing the peak of this wave is still to come will make the final decision harder if hospitalisations climb as expected.\nBut the fact remains Covid is always going to present a risk. Exactly how much is hard to quantify at this stage, although it will of course be much much lower than it was before.\nIn the end it will come down to balancing that extra risk against the need to get back our old way of life and reducing the harms caused by our response to Covid.\nThe extension of restrictions will be put to a Commons vote, which could trigger a sizeable Conservative backbench rebellion, with a debate expected on Wednesday. \nNew analysis by Public Health England showed two doses of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine were highly effective at preventing hospital admissions from the Delta variant.\nPHE said the effectiveness was comparable to against the Alpha variant which was previously dominant in the UK. \nMr Johnson said the gap between doses for over-40s in England would be reduced from 12 to eight weeks. \nAnd the target to offer all adults a first dose will be brought forward to 19 July. \nHospitality, wedding and night-time entertainment businesses are among those to have criticised the delay.\nThe government has said it will not extend the furlough scheme or other financial support further, despite the delay to the unlocking roadmap. \nDowning Street said local authorities have \u00a31bn of unspent money to support businesses, which could be used to pay business rates or contribute to furlough payments.\nUnder the furlough scheme, the government covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they cannot work because of the pandemic. \nThe scheme is due to run until the end of September but employers will have to help cover the cost from July. \nPlans for easing coronavirus restrictions differ in all four UK nations. Limits on indoor gatherings in Northern Ireland are scheduled to be relaxed on 21 June and the rules in Wales will be reviewed on 25 June.\nHave you or your business been affected by the delay to restrictions easing in England?

      "title": "Ban on new asylum seekers to Scotland 'could last for years'",
      "tags": "Home Office,Refugees and asylum seekers,Glasgow",
      "text": "The temporary ban on accepting new asylum seekers into Scotland could last for years, the BBC has learned. \nGlasgow City Council is the only local authority in the country to take in asylum seekers through the UK government's dispersal scheme. \nThere are more than 200 asylum seekers living in hotel accommodation across the city due to insufficient housing.  \nCouncil leader Susan Aitken told the BBC the ban would continue while the scheme was run \"on the cheap\". \nThe Home Office said the use of temporary accommodation was necessary to manage increased demand and it encouraged other local authorities to take part in the programme. \nGlasgow City Council announced the temporary ban in July last year to \"ease pressures\" after a mass stabbing at a city centre hotel which was being used as asylum accommodation.\nSuspect Badreddin Abadlla Adam was shot dead by police after six people, including an officer, were wounded during the incident at the Park Inn on West George Street. \nConcerns had been repeatedly raised over living conditions in the hotels, which charities said did not meet the needs of vulnerable people - some of whom were pregnant women, children and trafficking survivors.\nA press conference held by Positive Action in Housing heard that many asylum seekers claimed to have no windows and no fresh air in their rooms.\nThey also said they had been in a dire mental health situation.\nCllr Aitken told the BBC's Disclosure programme this was the point when the council realised the situation was \"not manageable\" and was \"getting to the point of not safe\".\nAn agreement was then reached between the council, the Home Office and housing provider Mears Group to stop sending asylum seekers to Glasgow.\nQuestioned on when the ban will end, Cllr Aitken said: \"I don't think it's this year and it's possibly not next year - certainly while we still have asylum seekers accommodated in hotels in the city, which is something that we have always been very opposed to in Glasgow.\"\nThe decision to place people in hotels during the pandemic was approved by the Home Office, but the idea came from Mears Group - the housing firm contracted by the government to supply accommodation to asylum seekers.\nThe contract, worth over \u00a31bn, states that Mears must provide \"safe, habitable, fit for purpose\" shelter.\nSteve Robbins, regional head of operations in Scotland for Mears, said the number of people seeking asylum support in Glasgow \"grew exponentially overnight\" when the lockdown began - and the firm simply \"did not have enough accommodation\".\nAs third sector support organisations \"locked down\", his staff also had to provide a food bank, medical provisions and additional welfare support in hotels. \nMr Robbins said they put people's safety ahead of profit. \"To be judged on anything over the last year, is did you keep people safe? And I can categorically say we did,\" he added. \nHe said people would be moved out of temporary accommodation in hotels by the end of July, acknowledging the firm has missed previous deadlines over the course of the pandemic.\nThe Home Office said it recognised that hotel accommodation could only ever be a short-term solution and it had reduced the number of hotels in use in Glasgow from six to three. \nHowever Cllr Aitken said the council believes Mears is running the operation \"on the cheap\" and there was more property available - just at a higher cost.\nShe said it was a \"political decision\" by the UK government to continue running asylum accommodation as a privatised service.\nShe said: \"We believe that Mears should be looking for accommodation in parts of the city where they won't go just now, I believe, because they think that the rents are too high.\n\"They tend to go to the parts of the city that have the lowest rents.\n\"We do not think [hotels] is appropriate accommodation, and we do not think it should be long-term. \n\"It is, and must always be thought of, as a temporary emergency response - that emergency response has now gone on far too long, for far too many asylum seekers.\"\nFearing for his life, Ali fled to the UK from war-torn Yemen and is currently claiming asylum in Glasgow.\nThe 4,000-mile journey took him nine months to make, during which he slept in forests, on roadsides and even in prison.\nHe has been filming a video diary to show the inside of the UK asylum system and on good days, can be seen enjoying the city's parks.\nBut at night in his small room he is often plagued by thoughts of his loved ones drowning, having watched eight of his friends die after a boat they were travelling on capsized on the Danube River in Romania.\nReturning back to Yemen would be like giving his family a \"death sentence\", he says.\nThe BBC has spoken to a number of asylum seekers who knew Badreddin Abadlla Adam, who they say was terrified of catching Covid. People said he was withdrawn, agitated and paranoid, and self isolated in his hotel room - where he had been for three months.\nHis story is not the only tragedy to emerge from the UK's asylum system since the start of the pandemic.\nIn May last year, 30-year-old Adnan Walid Elbi - who had fled his home in Syria after being tortured - was found dead from a drugs overdose in his room at McLays Guest House. \nThe cause of death was marked as \"unascertained\".\nGlasgow MPs have called for an inquiry into the deaths while campaigners want the temporary accommodation issue to be investigated independently.\nGiven the circumstances surrounding the stabbing at the Park Inn, Cllr Aitken believes it was \"probably predictable\".\nShe said: \"I'm deeply concerned. I think a lot of people drew conclusions very quickly, without knowing all of the facts involved. \n\"Nonetheless, that kind of pressured and stressful situation was created for people who are already traumatised and living with stress. I think we probably do have to assume that it's as at least a factor, and it's a problem.\"\nMr Robbins said Mears takes no responsibility for the death of Mr Elbi and that both men were given support when it was asked for.\nHe said: \"There's a lot I can't say because there are still legal matters in place. Supporting Adnan in the hotel provided an opportunity to give him more intense support. \n\"There was an ask for help, I can't talk about what conversations happened between the NHS and Adnan but I'm satisfied that when that ask for support was made, my staff made that happen.\n\"We were very aware of Badreddin and his challenges. At every turn when support was required, we made sure that happened.\"\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"Throughout the pandemic we have taken decisive action to provide accommodation for everyone claiming asylum in the UK who needs support, including those whose claims have been refused.\n\"Our new plan for immigration will reform the broken asylum system; allowing us to welcome people through safe and legal routes, while preventing abuse and pressure of the system and the criminality associated with it. \n\"Temporary accommodation, which is paid for by the taxpayer, is necessary to manage the increased demand while we work with local authorities to secure more accommodation. We are grateful to Glasgow City Council for their contribution to this effort and would encourage other local authorities in Scotland to participate.\"\nYou can watch more in Disclosure's Desperately Seeking Asylum on BBC One Scotland on Tuesday at 21:00."

      "tags": "United States,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of Americans who have died from Covid-19 has reached 600,012 - the most of any nation - according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\nThe US also ranks highest in total number of recorded cases, with nearly 33.5 million infections since 2020.\nThis latest milestone comes as President Joe Biden's goal of getting 70% of US adults vaccinated by 4 July appears increasingly likely to fail.\nOver 173 million people, around 52% of the US, have had at least one dose.\nBrazil and India have reported the next highest death tolls, with Brazil at more than 488,000 deaths and India at more than 377,000.\nIt took around four months for the US to go from 500,000 to 600,000 deaths - about as long as it took to go from none to 100,000. It marks a significant change from the height of the pandemic when the death toll jumped from 300,000 to 400,000 in one month last winter.\nBut the country's vaccination rate has begun to fall to around 1m doses administered per day - down from a high this April of nearly 3.4m.\nRoughly 43% of the US population, or about 144 million Americans, are fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC says people are fully vaccinated at least two weeks after their final vaccine dose.\nIt comes as the CDC officially labels the Delta mutation, first discovered in India, a \"variant of concern\". Delta variant cases amount to 10% of all new infections, the CDC said, and is growing in comparison to the dominant Alpha variant, first identified in Kent, UK.\nThough a majority of adult Americans have received at least one dose, the percentages vary wildly from state to state. Vermont has fully vaccinated 71% of its residents, but only 36% of Mississippians have received both jabs, according to a New York Times database.\nA recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll found around a third of US adults were not planning on getting vaccinated yet - leading states and companies to offer countless vaccine incentives.\nOhio has been selecting one vaccinated resident each week to win $1m (\u00a3708,000). On Tuesday, California will give $1.5m each to 10 residents. Other winnable items include alcohol, cannabis, guns, food vouchers and gift cards.\nThe White House is also working to boost vaccinations, with Vice-President Kamala Harris beginning a national tour to promote jabs on Monday.\nThe same day, US drug maker Novavax announced that its vaccine was found to be 90.4% effective after testing was conducted on 30,000 participants.\nIf this vaccine is eventually approved, it would be the fourth coronavirus vaccine to hit the US market.\nThe Biden administration has already ordered enough doses of the existing vaccines for the entire US population, US media report, so Novavax may become part of the global vaccine-sharing deal to donate doses.\nOn Monday night, the governor of California - the most populous US state - announced a \"grand re-opening\".\nThe state which ordered the first coronavirus lockdown will now allow vaccinated people to not wear masks or socially distance in most settings. Public health measures remain for events with over 5,000 people.\nAcross the country, New York is also beginning a return to normalcy. \nOn Tuesday, the Governor Andrew Cuomo lifted nearly all restrictions after the state's vaccination rate passed 70%.\n\"We can now return to life as we know it,\" declared Mr Cuomo, adding that the new rules were effective immediately."

      "text": "Hospitality, wedding and night-time entertainment businesses have reacted with horror to the delay in England's full reopening until 19 July.\nOne nightclub owner told the BBC he had been closed since March last year and had a full diary of events planned over the next few weeks, which he'll now have to cancel, losing thousands of pounds in revenue. \nDavid Whittall, who runs the nightclub and live music venue Suki10c in Digbeth, Birmingham, now has no way to pay the bills in June, he said.\nAnd wedding planners said the continuation of some restrictions meant couples were likely to defer their weddings again.\n\"The sold-out events that we had booked in - that's what was going to get us through because we would have made revenue, we would have had profit, we would have been able to pay our bills. Now we don't have anything,\" Mr Whittall says.\nHe stresses that the government needs to announce financial support, but it cannot be along the same lines as the Culture Recovery Fund, \"because it takes too long to get the money\".\n\"If we don't get financial support, I don't want to think about what the alternative is,\" he says. \nChris Jowsey is the chief executive of community pub firm Admiral Taverns, which has more than 1,000 pubs across the UK. \n\"For many licensees, the situation is desperate because Covid restrictions are massively hindering pubs from trading profitably - if the regulations have to continue then we need the government to step in and offer extra support to the hospitality industry,\" he says.\n\"Licensees are losing money because they are having to hire extra staff members to cope with restrictions like table service and social distancing.\"\nThe British Beer and Pub Association has warned that four additional weeks of restrictions will cost pubs \u00a3400m. It says pubs must be allowed to \"open properly\" on 19 July. \nMr Whittall says he is surprised the prime minister didn't announce any additional financial support: \"We've got bills that need paying now... I'm not sure what we're supposed to do now.\"\nA spokesman for the Treasury said: \"We are committed to helping businesses and individuals through the pandemic and deliberately went long with our support to provide certainty over the coming months.\n\"The furlough scheme and support for the self-employed is in place until September and eligible businesses will continue to benefit from business rates relief of 75% over the year, VAT cuts and the Recovery Loan Scheme.\"\nWedding venues and planners have told the BBC that the government's announcement about unlimited guest numbers being permitted has provided some relief, but they are still deeply worried about the future of their industry. \nMatthew Shaw, founder and creative director at Sauveur, a creative events and luxury wedding planning studio in London, has already been on the phone to his clients, who are confused about what they are allowed to do at their weddings.\nMany are upset about the fact they cannot have a dance floor indoors and they want to cancel the bands they have booked, Matthew says, which puts pressure on the suppliers Sauveur works with.\n\"Dance floors and drinks receptions are the things people want,\" he tells the BBC. \n\"It's great to have a meal, to be with people, but when you take away the key elements of what make a wedding special...people don't want to spend the money on it anymore.\"\nEarlier this year, his marquee supplier went under. That means he will have to try to forge relationships with new suppliers, while hoping the existing ones are still coping and are resilient when clients pull the plug or decide to postpone their events. \nMr Shaw says that the last year has taken a toll on his mental health and that of his staff, clients and suppliers: \"I've spent sleepless nights wondering whether events will still be able to run, and whether we will still be able to get new clients, after watching new and existing clients drop away.\"\nSarah Callander Beckett, owner of wedding venue Combermere Abbey in Cheshire, agrees with Mr Shaw.\nThey say some clients might prefer to defer their weddings again. But this creates an additional headache as the calendar for the rest of this year and into next year is already pretty packed for many businesses in the industry.\n\"These are some difficult decisions we'll have to facilitate as a business in the next few days managing expectations and emotions,\" Ms Beckett says. \"Ideally what we want to see is also the return of dancing and mingling amongst guests.\"\nKeith Marsden is the landlord of the Prince of Wales pub in Moseley, Birmingham. \nHe says that social distancing has proved a significant challenge and a continuation of restrictions will deeply impact his bottom line.\nMr Marsden recently had his worst day of trading since he started the business, with takings of just \u00a396.\n\"With social distancing whether you're inside or outside, you just cannot get the capacity,\" he says. \"We're operating at about one-third of our capacity, so we just cannot do the numbers to make a profit.\"\nHe says that people have fallen out of the habit of going to the pub: \"We're hanging in there but we're in serious trouble.\n\"It really will be the final nail in the coffin for many.\"\nHe's also worried about the financial challenges ahead, and the debt that he and others in the industry have built up.\n\"If you come in here on a busy weekend you think, oh yeah they're doing quite nicely, but beneath the surface there's lots of problems lurking,\" says Mr Marsden.\n\"People haven't aggressively chased debt, landlords have let people off with rent, business rates holidays, things like that. They're now coming to the surface.\"\nThe Nationwide Caterers Association (NCASS), which represents caterers in the festival and events sectors, including mobile and street food businesses, is also calling on the government to provide immediate financial support. \n\"Festival caterers will still not be able to work after already losing the 2020 season - it is devastating for the sector as a whole,\" the industry body's director Mark Laurie says.\n\"There are ten of thousands of businesses involved in the festival industry who are going to suffer huge losses.\"\nLatest research from Live, the trade body for the UK live events sector, suggests the industry faces losses of more than \u00a3500m as at least 5,000 shows will be cancelled.\n\"Any delay to the 21 June reopening date will have significant and immediate repercussions, including 248 grassroots music venues that would face an immediate threat of eviction without a comprehensive response from the government that fully addresses their financial losses from delayed reopening,\" the trade body has warned. \nMr Laurie says that caterers have had \"little to no help\" from the government or local authorities: \"The Additional Restrictions Grants (ARG) for those without fixed premises won't work to support theses businesses and so that must be addressed.\n\"NCASS is calling on the government to publish the results of the Events Research Programme, to provide immediate financial support to affected businesses and provide a clear way forward.\"\nIt is a terrible three-way balancing act - a race not just between the vaccine and the variant, but also viability of thousands of businesses. A cost-benefit analysis without many benefits.\nThe signalling of 21 June as \"freedom day\" was meant to give businesses long-term confidence to plan staffing, stocking and reversing the mothballing of their hospitality venues. Indoor venues will incur substantial losses over the next month.\nThe message from the government is that the support package they put in place at the Budget already accounted for this eventuality. \nThe furlough scheme has begun a slow phase-out, whereas in many other similar countries, employer contributions are already required, or the schemes have ended. \nMinisters also point at the strength of the economic bounce-back and record hiring and vacancy statistics. But that will come as little comfort to industries now shut for 15 months, such as nightclubs. \nLocal authorities have yet to allocate \u00a31bn, about half of the discretionary fund.\nThe ideal picture, as the prime minister put it, is that they will not be rolling back any of the currently implemented roadmap. \nAs we know, the impact on the economy comes not just from mandatory lockdowns, but from voluntary social distancing as consumers stay away from crowded places if they feel the virus is out of control. \nOn two crucial occasions last March and last Autumn, the government chose to prioritise economic reopening, with consequences for the scale of the outbreak that followed, which in turn definitively failed to be of any benefit to the economy. \nThis time it appears they are learning a lesson from recent history, and proceeding cautiously. \nThe calculation is that the immediate extra economic pain will be outweighed by fewer deaths and a confident irreversible reopening in a month's time."

      "text": "A living wage for care staff and jobs and training for young people are among the Welsh government's plans for the next five years.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford has set out his government's plans for the term, following his Senedd election success. \nIt includes building 20,000 new low-carbon \"social homes\" for rent, and more 20mph zones in residential areas.\nBut opposition parties criticised the lack of detail in the document.\nThe Welsh Conservatives said it was alarming that the 17-page programme for government was the \"sum total\" of Labour's plan. Plaid Cymru said it lacked targets.\nMeanwhile Mark Drakeford has refused to say whether he would raise income tax, reiterating there is no plan to do so while the economy is recovering.\nWelsh ministers said they would put climate change at the \"heart of everything the Welsh government does\".\nMr Drakeford's programme incorporates pledges made by the Welsh Labour leader at the recent Welsh election.\nHe was returned to power in May after his party won 30 Senedd seats - one short of a majority, meaning he will need some opposition help to pass budgets and laws.\nThe first minister said: \"We will build a fairer, greener and stronger Wales in which everyone plays a part - we don't want anyone to be left behind or held back.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Wales the first minister said the 20,000 homes would be built to the \"highest\" environmental standards and provided through housing associations and councils.\n\"They will be homes that produce more energy than they consume,\" he said.\nThe plans include giving everyone under the age of 25 the offer of work, education, training or self-employment, and a new law on air pollution, called a Clean Air Act.\nMinisters pledged to extend the entitlement to free school meals \"as far as resources allow\" - Welsh Labour has come under pressure from within its own ranks to expand the scheme.\nMeanwhile the document says the 20mph limit would become the default speed limit in residential areas.\nThe programme - made up of a series of short bullet point policy plans - does not say when the ideas will be implemented within the next term, which ends at the 2026 Senedd election.\nHowever Mr Drakeford told PA news agency that he hoped social care changes would come in in the \"first half\" of this Senedd's five-year term.\nThe document says the the Welsh government will \"not take more in Welsh rates of income tax from Welsh families for at least as long as the economic impact of coronavirus lasts\".\nIn the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies asked Mr Drakeford if he wants to raise taxes during some point in the Senedd term.\n\"Well the member will have to wait to see,\" Mr Drakeford said. \"It will depend on the circumstances.\"\n\"What lies beyond the recovery can only sensibly be decided in the circumstances that we will face, when we get there.\"\nThe Welsh government programme said it would \"seek to reform council tax\", and change the way council elections work to reduce the \"democratic deficit\".\nUnder the plans mental health would be prioritised for investment, and more single-use plastics would be banned -  although plans were previously announced to do this last year.\nEngland has already banned the use of single-use plastic straws, cotton buds and stirrers - Wales has consulted on doing the same, with the original plans going further.\nThe document did not put a figure on extra cash for mental health services, although Mr Drakeford said there would be \"millions more\".\nHe said a scheme where child and adolescent mental health services go into schools would be rolled out in every council area.\nOther pledges include:\nThere had been calls for a pay rise for social care workers in the wake of the Covid pandemic - at the May Senedd election Labour pledged to pay the \"real living wage\" to social care workers.\nThe real living wage is higher than the national living wage, and is pegged to the cost of living. It is currently set at \u00a39.50 outside London.\nMinisters also plan an independent commission to consider Wales' constitutional future, with the Welsh government seeking control over further powers including policing.\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said people and businesses would be \"alarmed and concerned that this 17-page document is the sum total of Labour's plan to get Wales on the road to recovery after the pandemic\".\n\"We desperately need this Welsh government to succeed if we are to recover from the most difficult year our country has experienced, but unfortunately this programme - combined with Labour's poor track record over the past 22 years - does not inspire confidence.\"\nPlaid Cymru deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said there was \"nothing transformational or ambitious about Labour's program for government\". \n\"There's no economic strategy to support and help small and medium Welsh businesses grow or any detail on how they will deliver high-skilled, well-paid jobs in all parts of Wales. \n\"There's nothing here that comes close to tackling child poverty - nor any concrete commitment to extending free school meals. And there's nothing here that addresses the ever-growing housing crisis that is pricing young people out of their communities. \n\"This program, thin in detail and absent of targets, almost certainly does not provide the new start that Wales so desperately needs and is not the plan needed to take Wales forward to recovery and beyond.\" \nThe Welsh government will likely need at least one vote from non-Labour MSs to change laws and pass budgets.\nMr Drakeford said the election result was an \"invitation to opposition parties to work with us on those aspects of our programme where they themselves have an interest\".\n\"The programme is there for others to work with us on it,\" he said.\nWales is embarking on its sixth successive period of Labour-led government since devolution started.\nThe last two began in circumstances Welsh Labour would not have chosen. In 2011 it was austerity. In 2016 it was Brexit. \nBut the backdrop this time is more daunting.\nOpponents say the Welsh government's plans lack the ambition to meet the challenge of the pandemic and its legacy.\nBut, as in those previous terms in office, Labour's lack of an outright majority means it will need talk to other parties to get the job done."

      "text": "The easing of Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland is likely to be pushed back by three weeks, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.\nThe whole country had been due to move to the lowest level zero of its five-tier system from 28 June.\nHowever Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that this was likely to be be delayed by three weeks so that more people can be vaccinated against the virus.\nThe Covid case rate in Scotland is five times higher than it was in early May.\nMs Sturgeon said that \"we need to buy sufficient time for vaccination to get ahead and stay ahead of the virus, and that is the reason for caution at this juncture\".\nShe added: \"Doing that will give us the best chance, later in July, of getting back on track and restoring the much greater normality that we all crave\".\nBusiness organisations said the delay would be \"frustrating and painful\" for firms who were gearing up to make the most of a boom in summer trade over the coming weeks, and called for greater support to be given. \nAnd opposition parties accused the Scottish government of sending out mixed messages over Covid restrictions in recent weeks. \nIt comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that plans to lift restrictions in England would be pushed back by four weeks until 19 July.\nA formal decision on what level each area of Scotland will be in will not be taken until next week, but Ms Sturgeon said it was \"reasonable to indicate now that I think it unlikely that any part of the country will move down a level\" as planned.\nIt means the country's mainland council areas will remain in either level one or level two, although many island communities including Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero.\nMs Sturgeon said the vaccination programme was weakening the link between the rising number of cases - largely driven by the so-called Delta variant that was first detected in India - and serious illness and deaths.\nBut she said there were still too many people who have not yet had both doses of the vaccine. \nShe also said she did not want to \"commit to firm dates\" for easing restrictions, saying she was \"not going to give false guarantees\" in the face of an \"unpredictable virus\".\nThe Scottish government says the entire adult population will have been offered an appointment for a first dose of the vaccine by the end of next week, with everyone due to have had their first dose by 18 July - two weeks ahead of schedule.\nIt is also planning for the possibility of booster vaccines against Covid-19 in the autumn.\nThe first minister added: \"The vaccination programme is going exceptionally well and it is being rolled out just as quickly as supplies allow. But there is still a significant proportion of the population that isn't yet fully vaccinated.\n\"To be blunt, that remains our biggest vulnerability at this stage - and it is a significant one.\"\nWhile the wider easing of restrictions is likely to be delayed, ministers will consider whether some rules could be changed to correct \"perceived anomalies\".\nMany soft play owners, for example, have questioned why their facilities remain closed in level two areas while trampoline centres are allowed to open.\nQuestions have also been asked about why thousands of fans are allowed to gather in a Euro 2020 fan zone in Glasgow, but parents are not allowed to attend outdoor nursery graduations. \nThe government is also to publish the outcome of a review of physical distancing rules, along with a report on what life could look like once Scotland moves beyond level zero - which Ms Sturgeon said she hoped could still happen \"later in the summer\".\nShe said breaking the link between cases and hospital admissions would allow for a move to a \"fundamentally different way of dealing with this virus\" with \"far, far less restrictions and hopefully no meaningful restrictions at all\".\nMeanwhile, the finance ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer calling for an urgent meeting with him to discuss the financial recovery from the pandemic, including the furlough scheme.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said people would be \"frustrated\" that restrictions looked set to continue for \"weeks or even months\", pressing for more detail on when the vaccination programme would be complete.\nHe said: \"We had all hoped for a summer of freedom but instead this stubborn virus is determined to keep us scunnered instead.\n\"It's disappointing that there was no further hope or information for people planning weddings, businesses waiting to know when they can reopen or parents desperately hoping to see their children graduate from nursery.\"\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called for called for action to speed up vaccinations and the publishing of hot-spot protocols.\nHe added: \"In order to maintain public trust and confidence we need consistent communications, consistent decision-making, adequate support for businesses and employees alongside a robust vaccination programme, and hot-spot protocols.\n\"I accept what the first minister has said around the delay, but there has been mixed messages that I think do not help maintain public trust.\n\"We have also seen inconsistent decision making: why is it okay to have 3,000 fans at a fan zone, but parents cannot attend a nursery graduation outdoors?\"\nMs Sturgeon said she understood why some people would be \"nervous\" about the fan zone, but said she was a \"highly regulated environment\" and was \"confident it is low risk based on public health advice\"."
