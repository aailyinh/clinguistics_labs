      "tags": "Companies,Energy industry,Kwasi Kwarteng",
      "text": "Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has not committed to any additional government help for businesses struggling amid record gas prices.\nSome industries have warned firms could be forced to shut down operations.\nMr Kwarteng said he was working closely with the chancellor over possible support for energy intensive sectors - but a Treasury source denied this.\nThe business secretary said domestic customers would not see a change to the energy price cap this winter.\nAsked on BBC One's Andrew Marr programme whether there would be additional government help for energy-intensive companies, Mr Kwarteng described the situation as \"critical\" and said he was \"looking to find a solution\".\nWhen Andrew Marr suggested this sounded like a \"yes\" the business secretary said: \"No, it doesn't sound like yes at all. \n\"We already have existing support and we're looking to see whether that's sufficient to get us through this situation.\"\nSpeaking to Times Radio Mr Kwarteng, who met leaders from heavy industry on Friday, said he was not going to commit to \"any firm figure or subsidy\" for companies.\nAsked about whether the government would ensure factories would not have to close if they could not pay for gas he said it was a commercial decision and \"up to them\".\nHe added: \"We are not in the business of bail-outs. What we are in the business of is ensuring security of supply and that is what I am focused on.\"\nWholesale gas prices have risen 250% since January.\nCEO of British Glass Dave Dalton, who was at Friday's meeting with Mr Kwarteng, said some of the confederation's \"significant\" members were \"teetering on the edge\". \n\"I think some companies are staring down the ability to survive, absolutely - ultimately that obviously cascades on to jobs and impacts on the consumer,\" he told the BBC. \nGareth Stace, director general of UK Steel, said he was frustrated by the lack of action to support businesses.\nHe told the BBC that without help in the next week or so, there would be \"significant and permanent damage to the UK steel sector\".\nUnite leader Sharon Graham said the country was \"contemplating factory shutdowns across viable manufacturing and businesses\" and that workers were \"worried sick\".\nBusinesses have been shouting louder and louder for support through this period of soaring energy prices.\nThis morning, the business secretary told the BBC he was listening to their concerns - but would not commit to any extra support.\nThose industries that use a lot of energy for manufacturing say that the time for working out a way forward has long gone. \nThe director general of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, expressed his frustration, saying pauses in steel production will only increase. \nThe government says the current situation emphasises the need for a revolution in how we generate energy, moving towards home-grown renewables.\nBut that's little comfort for those businesses dependent on energy from fossil fuels now, competing with intense demand in a global market.\nOn the Andrew Marr show, Mr Kwarteng denied asking for \"billions\" from the Treasury to subsidise energy-intensive businesses and said supply itself was \"not an issue\".\nA Treasury source said the business secretary had been \"mistaken\" to say that he had been working on possible support measures with the Chancellor Rishi Sunak.\nBridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government \"needs to get a grip\" and called for \"urgent answers on who exactly is running the show\". \n\"The two key government departments responsible for the current cost of living crisis have spent this morning infighting about whether they were in talks with each other. What a farce,\" she said.\nShe also accused the government of having \"put its out of office on\", referring to reports that the prime minister is on holiday in Spain.\n A number of Conservative MPs have called for the government to take action to support heavy industry.\nThe SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford called on the UK government to \"nurse\" businesses through the crisis, describing it as a \"perfect storm\".\nThe domestic consumer energy price cap, which is reviewed every six months, sets the maximum level a supplier can charge a consumer on a standard tariff in England, Wales and Scotland. \nMr Kwarteng told Marr that protecting consumers was his \"first and foremost objective\" and as such the price cap would stay at its current level until its next update which is due to in April.\nSome suppliers say the cap is just delaying an inevitable increase in consumer prices and should be reviewed more regularly.\nEnergy regulator Ofgem has warned households will see further \"significant rises\" in the spring, when the cap is reviewed.\nAsked by Marr if he was sure the lights would stay on this winter, Mr Kwarteng said \"yes, I am\".\nDue to high gas prices household energy suppliers have been forced to sell gas for less than they can buy it due to the price cap, leading some to fail.\nLast month, nine domestic energy supply companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers and on to higher rates.\nPaul Richards, chief executive of Together Energy, which he said is currently making losses, said while he supported a price cap to protect customers, the current mechanism \"is not fit for industry, nor is it fit for customers\".\nHe said it protected customers in the short term but somewhere between \u00a31bn and \u00a33bn in costs would be spread back across business and households as a result of suppliers going bust.\nThe founder of OVO Energy Stephen Fitzpatrick told Marr that it has been \"too easy\" for companies to enter the energy market and that there will be more companies in difficulty.\nHe said the market was a complicated one, and he thought some people had not understood the risks."

      "text": "Lebanon has been left without electricity, plunging the country into darkness amid a severe economic crisis. \nA government official told Reuters news agency the country's two largest power stations, Deir Ammar and Zahrani, had shut down because of a fuel shortage.\nThe power grid \"completely stopped working at noon today\" and was unlikely to restart for several days, they said.\nFor the past 18 months Lebanon has endured an economic crisis and extreme fuel shortages.\nThat crisis has left half its population in poverty, crippled its currency and sparked major demonstrations against politicians.\nA lack of foreign currency meanwhile has made it hard to pay overseas energy suppliers.\nLebanon country profile \nMany Lebanese people already depend on private diesel-powered generators for power. These however have become increasingly expensive to run amid the lack of fuel, and cannot cover for the lack of a nationwide power grid. \nPeople were often receiving just two hours of electricity a day in the country before this latest shutdown.\nIn a statement, Lebanon's state electricity company also confirmed the shutdown of the two power plants, which together provide some 40% of the country's electricity. \nTheir closure led to the \"complete outage\" of the power network, the statement reportedly said, \"with no possibility of resuming operations in the meantime\".\nAl Jazeera reports protests in the northern town of Halba, outside the offices of the state power company, as well as residents blocking roads with burning tyres in the city of Tripoli.\nThe country is also grappling with the aftermath of the Beirut blast in August 2020, which killed 219 people and injured 7,000 others.\nAfter the explosion its government resigned, leaving political paralysis. Najib Mikati became prime minister in September, more than a year after the previous administration quit. \nLast month the militant group Hezbollah brought Iranian fuel into the country to ease shortages. Its opponents say the group is using the fuel delivery to expand its influence."

      "tags": "Pakistan,Nuclear weapons",
      "text": "The man regarded as the \"father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb\", Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, has died aged 85 after being hospitalised with Covid-19.\nDr Khan was hailed as a national hero for transforming his country into the world's first Islamic nuclear power.\nBut he was also notorious for having smuggled nuclear secrets to states including North Korea and Iran.\nPrime Minister Imran Khan said Pakistan had lost a \"national icon\".\n\"He was loved by our nation bec[ause] of his critical contribution in making us a nuclear weapon state,\" the prime minister tweeted.\nKnown as AQ Khan, the scientist was instrumental in setting up Pakistan's first nuclear enrichment plant at Kahuta near Islamabad. By 1998, the country had conducted its first nuclear tests.\nComing shortly after similar tests by India, Dr Khan's work helped seal Pakistan's place as the world's seventh nuclear power and sparked national jubilation.\nBut he was arrested in 2004 for illegally sharing nuclear technology with Iran, Libya and North Korea.\nThe revelations that he had passed on nuclear secrets to other countries shocked Pakistan.\nIn a televised address, Dr Khan offered his \"deepest regrets and unqualified apologies\".\nDr Khan was pardoned by Pakistan's then-president, Pervez Musharraf, but he was held under house arrest until 2009.\nThe leniency of his treatment angered many in the West, where he has been dubbed \"the greatest nuclear proliferator of all time\".\nBut in Pakistan he remained a symbol of pride for his role in boosting its national security.\n\"He helped us develop nation-saving nuclear deterrence and a grateful nation will never forget his services,\" President Arif Alvi said.\nThe fact AQ Khan could be described as one of the most dangerous men in the world by Western spies but also be lauded as a hero in his homeland tells you much about not just the complexity of the man himself but also how the world views nuclear weapons.\nAQ Khan was responsible, perhaps, more than any other individual for aiding the spread of nuclear weapons technology. He helped his own country's nuclear programme but then spread some of the know-how to others, including Iran, North Korea and Libya. The extent to which this was motivated by money, ideology or orders from Pakistan's leadership has always been murky.\nFor Western countries stopping the spread of nuclear weapons has been a top priority, and the CIA and MI6 helped take down Khan's network. \nBut within Pakistan he was a revered figure, seen as having helped build his country's defences against India. \nAnd more broadly, he and others would question why Western countries should be allowed to have nuclear weapons for their security while denying the same ability to others."

      "text": "The UK is one of the world's most nature-depleted countries - in the bottom 10% globally and last among the G7 group of nations, new data shows. \nIt has an average of about half its biodiversity left, far below the global average of 75%, a study has found.\nA figure of 90% is considered the \"safe limit\" to prevent the world from tipping into an \"ecological meltdown\", according to researchers.\nThe assessment was released ahead of a key UN biodiversity conference. \nBiodiversity is the variety of all living things on Earth and how they fit together in the web of life, bringing oxygen, water, food and countless other benefits. \nProf Andy Purvis, research leader at the Natural History Museum in London, said biodiversity is more than something beautiful to look at. \n\"It's also what provides us with so many of our basic needs,\" he told BBC News. \n\"It's the foundation of our society. We've seen recently how disruptive it can be when supply chains break down - nature is at the base of our supply chains.\"\nThe new tool uses the Biodiversity Intactness Index to estimate the percentage of natural biodiversity that remains across the world and in individual countries.\nThe UK's low position in the league table is linked to the industrial revolution, which transformed the landscape, the researchers said.\nThe UK has seen relatively stable biodiversity levels over recent years, albeit at a \"really low level,\" team researcher Dr Adriana De Palma explained in a news briefing.\nThe assessment was released on the eve of the UN Biodiversity Conference, COP 15, hosted by China, a mega-diverse country with nearly 10% of plant species and 14% of animals on Earth. \nWorld leaders are attending week-long virtual talks seen as pivotal in raising ambition for slowing the loss of nature ahead of face-to-face talks in Kunming, China, in April next year and the climate conference in Glasgow at the end of the month.\n Andrew Deutz, global policy lead of international conservation charity, the Nature Conservancy, said the gathering momentum behind nature had not come a moment too soon. \n\"As with the accelerating climate emergency, what happens over the next year will - to a large extent - set humanity's course for the rest of the decade; and what happens this decade is likely to define our prospects for the rest of this century,\" he said.\nAt the summit in Kunming - taking place in a two-part format due to pandemic disruption - world leaders will negotiate a framework for protecting nature and species for the next decade.\nThe draft agreement aims to conserve at least 30% of the world's lands and oceans, and increase funding for the conservation of nature. \nBut elements of the draft lack ambition, according to a report by MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee.\nThe global biodiversity framework replaces the plan for the last decade, which missed all 20 targets.\n \"To play our part, we need the UK to step up and turn our global promises into action at home, to show that we are not going to let another lost decade for nature slip past,\" said Beccy Speight, chief executive of the RSPB.\nBiodiversity is declining faster than at any time in human history. Since 1970, there has been on average almost a 70% decline in the populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians.\nIt is thought that one million animal and plant species - almost a quarter of the global total - are threatened with extinction.\nFollow Helen on Twitter."

      "text": "A 15-year-old girl and her mum say they were intimidated by anti-vax protesters outside a Covid vaccination centre.\nGrace Baker-Earle, who uses a wheelchair after contracting Covid, was confronted after receiving the jab at Cardiff's Bayside mass vaccination centre.\nHer mum Angela said protesters accused her of using Grace \"as a lab rat\".\nSouth Wales Police said officers attended a protest in the area at 10:50 BST and remained in attendance.\nThe force said no arrests had been made.\nThe vaccine has been offered to 12 to 15-year-olds in Wales since 4 October.\nMs Baker-Earle said the confrontation was \"just horrible\" and \"incredibly intimidating\", and happened while getting her daughter's wheelchair into her car - something she needs since developing Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME).\nThe 44-year-old said a protester claimed it was \"ridiculous\" to get the jab. \n\"I said my daughter is using a wheelchair because of Covid,\" Ms Baker-Earle said.\n\"[A protestor] said: 'She'll have immunity, you shouldn't be getting the vaccine since you have natural immunity. You shouldn't be using her as a lab rat'.\n\"It was incredibly unpleasant.\"\nMs Baker-Earle, from Cowbridge, in the Vale Glamorgan, said the 15 protesters walked in front of her car and she had to tell one man to \"step back\".\n\"He was within two feet of me, looked at me as if I was stupid. I told them: 'You have literally surrounded my car'.\"\nShe said a vaccination centre steward then came out and checked she and her daughter were safe.\nGrace said the confrontation \"hit a spot\" because of how much Covid has affected herself and family.\n\"I think I was sad more than anything because it's something I still live with, it takes up every second of my day,\" she said.\n\"I was excited to have it done - to have people tell you as you come out that what you're doing is wrong and to have people invading your personal space, it wasn't nice.\"\nMs Baker-Earle said she was in hospital with Covid and pneumonia last November, around the same time Grace also had the virus.\n\"Grace was very unwell for a couple of weeks, she lost half a stone and was really poorly - she weighed 6.5 stone (41kg) to begin with.\n\"A cardiologist has said although Grace had a virus earlier in March, having Covid pushed it over into having ME.\"\nME is a chronic neurological condition which means day-to-day tasks can be \"exhausting\" for Grace, she added.\n\"People were so dismissive of such a serious thing we are dealing with, which makes my blood boil,\" she added.\n\"There are 12-year-olds going down there to be faced with that - a whole line of people, it is disgusting.\"\n\"Now she has to use a wheelchair to go more than 50 yards, and has an extremely elevated heart rate,\" she said.\n\"It has been lifechanging for Grace, we are hoping she will get better. This is all off the back of Covid in November.\"\nThe UK's four chief medical officers (CMOs) have said healthy children aged 12 to 15 should be offered one dose of a Covid vaccine.\nThe advice, they say, reflects evidence on the mental health and long-term prospects for young people, the effect on education and the marginal benefit to health.\nThe Welsh government has emphasised that the vaccine is a choice for each individual to make.\nIt said all children aged 12 to 15 in Wales will be offered a Covid vaccine by the end of October.\nWales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan said studies showed children were at some risk of developing long Covid despite low hospital admission rates."

      "tags": "China,Taiwan",
      "text": "Taiwan will not bow to pressure from China and will defend its democratic way of life, President Tsai Ing-wen has said in a defiant speech amid heightened tensions over the island. \nHer remarks on Taiwan's National Day came after China's President Xi Jinping vowed to \"fulfil reunification\".\nChina denounced Ms Tsai's speech, saying it \"incited confrontation\".\nTaiwan considers itself a sovereign state, while China views it as a breakaway province.\nBeijing has not ruled out the possible use of force to achieve unification.\nChina has sent a record number of military jets into Taiwan's air defence zone in recent days. Three Chinese planes, including two fighter jets, crossed into the zone on Sunday, Taiwan's defence ministry said. \nMs Tsai was re-elected by a landslide last year on a promise to stand up to Beijing. In her speech on Sunday, she said Taiwan was \"standing on democracy's first line of defence\".\nShe said the island would not \"act rashly\" but would bolster its defences to \"ensure that nobody can force Taiwan to take the path China has laid out for us\". \nThat path, she said, offered \"neither a free and democratic way of life for Taiwan nor sovereignty\" for its 23 million people.\n\"The more we achieve, the greater the pressure we face from China,\" she said.\nShe added that China's military flights into Taiwan's air defence zone had seriously affected national security and aviation safety, and described the situation as being \"more complex and fluid than at any other point in the past 72 years\".\nMs Tsai also repeated an offer to talk with Chinese leaders on an equal footing, a suggestion Beijing - which brands her a \"separatist\" - has so far rejected. \nHer speech was followed by a flypast of Taiwanese fighter jets.\nOne man watching Ms Tsai's speech told AFP news agency Taiwanese people could not accept unification with China.\n\"China is presently rather authoritarian. Especially under Xi Jinping, its gotten worse. Reunification is not appropriate now,\" another said. \nOn Saturday, China's President Xi said unification should be achieved peacefully, but warned that the Chinese people had a \"glorious tradition\" of opposing separatism.\n\"The historical task of the complete reunification of the motherland... will definitely be fulfilled,\" he added.\nFollowing Ms Tsai's speech on Sunday, China's Taiwan Affairs Office said she had \"advocated Taiwan independence, incited confrontation, cut apart history and disputed facts\". \nDespite the recent heightened tensions, relations between China and Taiwan have not deteriorated to levels last seen in 1996 when China tried to disrupt presidential elections with missile tests and the US dispatched aircraft carriers to the region to dissuade them.\nThe US has a longstanding \"One China\" policy under which it recognises China rather than Taiwan.\nBut this agreement also allows Washington to maintain a \"robust unofficial\" relationship with Taiwan. The US sells arms to Taiwan as part of Washington's Taiwan Relations Act, which states that the US must help Taiwan defend itself.\nIn an interview with the BBC this week, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the US would \"stand up and speak out\" over any actions that might \"undermine peace and stability\" across the Taiwan Strait."

Onlookers attempted to revive Mr Kulesh, but were unsuccessful. \nInvestigators say they are probing the circumstances surrounding the death.\nIn a statement issued on Saturday evening, the Bolshoi said: \"The performance was immediately stopped, the audience was asked to leave the hall.\"\nShocked spectators said on social media that they had initially believed that the accident was a staged trick. \nHowever, the reality of the incident quickly became apparent when performers reacted in horror and some on stage shouted \"call an ambulance, there is blood\".  \nLocal media said Mr Kulesh had been a performer at the theatre since 2002. \nIt is not the first tragic incident to hit the world-renowned theatre.\nIn July 2013, a senior violinist died after falling into the orchestra pit. Viktor Sedov was a veteran of the opera house's orchestra, having played there for four decades,\nAnd in 2011 a Moscow court jailed Ballet soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko for six years after he was found to have organised an acid attack on the company's artistic director, Sergei Filin, outside his Moscow flat, badly damaging his eyesight."

      "text": "Householders in the UK will find out in the next few weeks how much their gas bills are likely to increase in the coming year.\nThe energy regulator is due to announce the new energy price cap - the maximum amount that suppliers can charge in Great Britain.\nIt's expected to rise steeply, because global wholesale prices have gone up so much.\nEvery six months, Ofgem, the energy regulator, reviews the maximum price that suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThis is called the energy price cap. \nAbout 15 million households saw their energy bills increase by 12% when it was last updated in October. \nThe next review is due at the beginning of February, and the new cap will come into effect in April. Industry predictions suggest gas prices could go up by as much as 50%.\nThere is a separate energy market in Northern Ireland, with two gas suppliers, and prices have risen sharply for consumers there too.\nThere's been a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies over the past year.\nAs a result, wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. At the end of December, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about \u00a32,000 next year.\nReasons for the increase include:\nThere are a number of technical and geopolitical issues at play as well, which mean many countries across Europe are grappling with the same problems.\nHowever, the UK is hit relatively hard-hit because it is one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas. Around 85% of homes have gas central heating, and it also generates a third of the country's electricity. \nStorage capacity in the UK is also lower than in some other European countries.\nSince wholesale gas prices started to spike, more than 20 retail energy suppliers have collapsed in the UK. \nThis is largely because the energy price cap prevented retailers from passing on higher wholesale prices to their customers.\nSeveral smaller companies, with fewer reserves, could not weather this.\nFailed firms include Bulb Energy, with 1.7 million customers. Because of its size, it was put into \"special administration\", and is now run by the government, through Ofgem.\nNearly four million customers have been affected. Many households saw their energy prices rise when their supplier went bust, and they were switched over to a more expensive deal with another supplier.\nThe government faces calls from energy companies, the opposition, and even some of its own MPs, to do more to prevent prices from rising too much.\nSuggestions include:\nIn the past, consumers have been encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise.\nBut at the moment better offers - including fixed deals - are simply not available.\nPeople already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, householders are being encouraged to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.\nThe Energy Saving Trust says that simple changes to our homes and habits could offset the current price rises.\nMany companies face a considerable rise in their bills. That could mean they have to: \nEnergy-intensive industries are particularly exposed, but the problem affects every company that has to pay energy bills - even if it is just to heat an office or shop."

      "tags": "Companies,Energy industry,Kwasi Kwarteng",
      "text": "Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has not committed to any additional government help for businesses struggling amid record gas prices.\nSome industries have warned firms could be forced to shut down operations.\nMr Kwarteng said he was working closely with the chancellor over possible support for energy intensive sectors - but a Treasury source denied this.\nThe business secretary said domestic customers would not see a change to the energy price cap this winter.\nAsked on BBC One's Andrew Marr programme whether there would be additional government help for energy-intensive companies, Mr Kwarteng described the situation as \"critical\" and said he was \"looking to find a solution\".\nWhen Andrew Marr suggested this sounded like a \"yes\" the business secretary said: \"No, it doesn't sound like yes at all. \n\"We already have existing support and we're looking to see whether that's sufficient to get us through this situation.\"\nSpeaking to Times Radio Mr Kwarteng, who met leaders from heavy industry on Friday, said he was not going to commit to \"any firm figure or subsidy\" for companies.\nAsked about whether the government would ensure factories would not have to close if they could not pay for gas he said it was a commercial decision and \"up to them\".\nHe added: \"We are not in the business of bail-outs. What we are in the business of is ensuring security of supply and that is what I am focused on.\"\nWholesale gas prices have risen 250% since January.\nCEO of British Glass Dave Dalton, who was at Friday's meeting with Mr Kwarteng, said some of the confederation's \"significant\" members were \"teetering on the edge\". \n\"I think some companies are staring down the ability to survive, absolutely - ultimately that obviously cascades on to jobs and impacts on the consumer,\" he told the BBC. \nGareth Stace, director general of UK Steel, said he was frustrated by the lack of action to support businesses.\nHe told the BBC that without help in the next week or so, there would be \"significant and permanent damage to the UK steel sector\".\nUnite leader Sharon Graham said the country was \"contemplating factory shutdowns across viable manufacturing and businesses\" and that workers were \"worried sick\".\nBusinesses have been shouting louder and louder for support through this period of soaring energy prices.\nThis morning, the business secretary told the BBC he was listening to their concerns - but would not commit to any extra support.\nThose industries that use a lot of energy for manufacturing say that the time for working out a way forward has long gone. \nThe director general of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, expressed his frustration, saying pauses in steel production will only increase. \nThe government says the current situation emphasises the need for a revolution in how we generate energy, moving towards home-grown renewables.\nBut that's little comfort for those businesses dependent on energy from fossil fuels now, competing with intense demand in a global market.\nOn the Andrew Marr show, Mr Kwarteng denied asking for \"billions\" from the Treasury to subsidise energy-intensive businesses and said supply itself was \"not an issue\".\nA Treasury source said the business secretary had been \"mistaken\" to say that he had been working on possible support measures with the Chancellor Rishi Sunak.\nBridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government \"needs to get a grip\" and called for \"urgent answers on who exactly is running the show\". \n\"The two key government departments responsible for the current cost of living crisis have spent this morning infighting about whether they were in talks with each other. What a farce,\" she said.\nShe also accused the government of having \"put its out of office on\", referring to reports that the prime minister is on holiday in Spain.\n A number of Conservative MPs have called for the government to take action to support heavy industry.\nThe SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford called on the UK government to \"nurse\" businesses through the crisis, describing it as a \"perfect storm\".\nThe domestic consumer energy price cap, which is reviewed every six months, sets the maximum level a supplier can charge a consumer on a standard tariff in England, Wales and Scotland. \nMr Kwarteng told Marr that protecting consumers was his \"first and foremost objective\" and as such the price cap would stay at its current level until its next update which is due to in April.\nSome suppliers say the cap is just delaying an inevitable increase in consumer prices and should be reviewed more regularly.\nEnergy regulator Ofgem has warned households will see further \"significant rises\" in the spring, when the cap is reviewed.\nAsked by Marr if he was sure the lights would stay on this winter, Mr Kwarteng said \"yes, I am\".\nDue to high gas prices household energy suppliers have been forced to sell gas for less than they can buy it due to the price cap, leading some to fail.\nLast month, nine domestic energy supply companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers and on to higher rates.\nPaul Richards, chief executive of Together Energy, which he said is currently making losses, said while he supported a price cap to protect customers, the current mechanism \"is not fit for industry, nor is it fit for customers\".\nHe said it protected customers in the short term but somewhere between \u00a31bn and \u00a33bn in costs would be spread back across business and households as a result of suppliers going bust.\nThe founder of OVO Energy Stephen Fitzpatrick told Marr that it has been \"too easy\" for companies to enter the energy market and that there will be more companies in difficulty.\nHe said the market was a complicated one, and he thought some people had not understood the risks."

      "text": "Pope Francis has launched what some describe as the most ambitious attempt at Catholic reform for 60 years.\nA two-year process to consult every Catholic parish around the world on the future direction of the Church began at the Vatican this weekend.\nSome Catholics hope it will lead to change on issues such as women's ordination, married priests and same-sex relationships. \nOthers fear it will undermine the principles of the Church.\nThey say a focus on reform could also distract from issues facing the Church, such as corruption and dwindling attendance levels.\nPope Francis urged Catholics not to \"remain barricaded in our certainties\" but to \"listen to one another\" as he launched the process at Mass in St Peter's Basilica.\n\"Are we prepared for the adventure of this journey? Or are we fearful of the unknown, preferring to take refuge in the usual excuses: 'It's useless' or 'We've always done it this way'?\" he asked.\nThe consultation process, called \"For a Synodal Church: Communion, Participation and Mission\", will work in three stages:\nThe Pope is expected then to write an apostolic exhortation, giving his views and decisions on the issues discussed.\nDiscussing his hopes for the Synod, Pope Francis warned against the process becoming an intellectual exercise that failed to address the real-world issues faced by Catholics and the \"temptation to complacency\" when it comes to considering change.\nThe initiative has been praised by the progressive US-based National Catholic Reporter newspaper, which said that while the process might not be perfect \"the Church is more likely to address the needs of the people of God with it than without it\".\nHowever, theologian George Weigel wrote, in the conservative US Catholic journal First Things, it was unclear how \"two years of self-referential Catholic chatter\" would address other problems the Church such as those who are \"drifting away from the faith in droves\".    \nAnalysis: Church to address modern challenges\nBy John McManus, Religion and Ethics reporter\nMuch of the reporting of this two-year consultation has focused on some of the issues that often appear to dominate reporting on the Catholic Church: the role of women for example, and whether they will ever be ordained as priests (the Pope says \"no\").\nWhile those topics are often of concern to some Catholics, other areas which traditionally dominate Catholic social teaching, such as alleviating poverty, and increasingly, climate change, will likely play a greater part, as will how the Church is run. In reality, any issue can be raised.\nDon't expect any sudden changes to Church rules though. It's true that some Catholics do want to see a different kind of institution, but for Pope Francis, allowing ordinary worshippers to have their concerns (eventually) raised at the Vatican - even if their bishops disagree with them - is a huge step change for this 2000 year-old religion.

I told them: 'You have literally surrounded my car'.\"\nShe said a vaccination centre steward then came out and checked she and her daughter were safe.\nMeanwhile, another parent, Melissa Ringham has called for more protection for people entering vaccination centres.\nShe said her 15-year-old daughter and herself felt \"shaken up\" after being targeted by protesters yesterday at the Bayside vaccination centre.\nThe 42-year-old mother, from Barry, said they were followed by a protester \"walking behind us\" and \"wouldn't leave us be\" as they walked up to the vaccination centre entrance.\n\"He got into my daughter's personal space and started shouting at her. I said: 'Stop, please don't speak to her like that.' I also raised my hand out to say stop,\" she said.\n\"It was very upsetting to see how upset my daughter was, she didn't have to witness that.\n\"I didn't feel safe walking in there yesterday.\n\"As we walked out, we had one woman screaming at us: 'Shame on you - you're killing your daughter'.\"\nMs Ringham also said a nurse inside the vaccination centre told her \"many were too scared to walk into the building\".\nCardiff and Vale health board has be asked to comment.\nOn Sunday, South Wales Police confirmed a 61-year-old man from Newport was arrested, and released on bail, for racially aggravated offences.\nThe vaccine has been offered to 12 to 15 year olds in Wales since 4 October."

To resolve the impasse I want to step aside to prevent chaos,\" Mr Kurz said as he announced his resignation.\nHe said he would remain leader of his party, and continue to sit in parliament.\n\"First and foremost, however, I will of course use the opportunity to disprove the allegations against me,\" he added.\nAlthough he is no longer chancellor, Mr Kurz will still be a major figure in Austrian politics. \nAs leader of his party, he will be present at cabinet meetings. The head of the opposition Social Democrats says he will be pulling the strings as a shadow chancellor. \nOther observers point to his close relationship with Alexander Schallenberg, a career diplomat who worked with Mr Kurz when he first entered government as foreign minister. \nSome members of Mr Kurz's party are hoping his resignation will be temporary and he will be able to stage a comeback. \nOther Austrians say the two corruption investigations, and the collapse of his last coalition government with the far-right Freedom Party in 2019, mean it is time for Mr Kurz to leave politics altogether.  \nMr Kurz became leader of the \u00d6VP in May 2017 and led his party to victory in elections later that year - becoming, at the age of 31, one the world's youngest ever democratically elected heads of government.\nThe corruption allegations relate to the period between 2016 and 2018, when finance ministry funds were suspected to have been used to manipulate opinion polls in favour of the \u00d6VP that were then published in a newspaper.\nWhile no newspaper was named by prosecutors, the tabloid daily \u00d6sterreich put out a statement on Wednesday denying media reports it had taken taxpayers' money for advertising in exchange for publishing the favourable polls.\nMr Kurz, nine other individuals and three organisations have been placed under investigation \"on suspicion of breach of trust ... corruption ... and bribery ... partly with different levels of involvement\", the Prosecutors' Office for Economic Affairs and Corruption said on Wednesday.\nEarlier in the day, prosecutors carried out raids at the chancellery, the finance ministry and homes and offices of senior aides to the chancellor.\nMr Kurz has called the allegations against him \"baseless\".\nHe also denies wrongdoing in a separate investigation he was placed under in May over allegations he had made false statements to a parliamentary commission."

The problem is that too few people seem to have listened.\"\nAs the protocol works by keeping Northern Ireland in the single market for goods, the EU has said removing the ECJ would simply unravel the whole arrangement.\nSpeaking last week, European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said: \"I find it hard to see how Northern Ireland would stay or would keep the access to the single market without oversight of the European Court of Justice.\"\nWhen the EU publishes its proposals next week that is expected to lead to a new round of negotiations.\nBoth sides have suggested there will be short, intense talks process beginning in late October or early November."

      "text": "Celebrated French fashion designer Olivier Rousteing has revealed he was injured following an accident at his home last year, sharing a picture of himself in heavy bandages. \nRousteing, the creative director of fashion house Balmain, shared the news in an Instagram post on Saturday. \n\"Exactly a year ago, the fireplace inside my house exploded,\" he wrote. \nHe woke the next day at the H\u00f4pital Saint Louis in Paris, and has since been recovering from his injuries.\nRousteing said his insecurities and fashion's \"obsession with perfection\" had stopped him from revealing all before now.\n\"To be honest I am not really sure why I was so ashamed,\" he wrote. As he recovered he had hidden his injuries with long sleeves and jewellery during interviews.\n\"Now, a year later - healed, happy and healthy,\" he wrote. He thanked the medical staff who had treated him despite \"dealing with an incredible number of Covid cases at that same time\", and spoke about how lucky he now felt.\n\"There is always the sun after the storm.\"\nFellow fashion designers, models and other celebrities were among those to offer their support in response to Rousteing's post. \nThe designer Donatella Versace wrote she was \"so glad\" he was safe. \"Let love rule,\" said musician Lenny Kravitz.\nKim Kardashian West wrote \"I love you\", while her mother Kris Jenner said she was \"beyond proud\" of Rousteing, adding that his \"message of hope and strength and focus and love will always inspire everyone who you come in contact with\". \nRousteing took up his post as Balmain's creative director in 2011 at the age of just 25. According to a profile in Out Magazine the brand grew between 15% and 20% between 2012 and 2015.\nHe has opened boutiques in London and New York, the company's first outside Paris.\nA 2019 Netflix documentary, Wonder Boy, looked at his career and followed him as he searched for his biological mother.

      "text": "US officials have met Afghanistan's ruling Taliban for their first face-to-face talks since Washington pulled its troops from the country in August.\nThe talks in Qatar are focusing on issues including containing extremist groups, the evacuation of US citizens and humanitarian aid, officials say.\nThe US insists the meeting does not amount to recognition of the Taliban.\nIt comes a day after Afghanistan suffered its deadliest attack since US forces withdrew. \nThe suicide bombing at a mosque in the northern city of Kunduz killed at least 50 people and wounded more than 100 others. \nThe Said Abad mosque was used by the minority Shia Muslim community in the Sunni Muslim-majority country. The Islamic State group said it was behind the attack.\nSpeaking after the talks with the US opened in Qatar, Afghanistan's Taliban-appointed Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said the two sides had agreed to uphold the terms of the Doha agreement signed in 2020. \nThe deal includes broad obligations on the Taliban to take steps to prevent groups such as al-Qaeda from threatening the security of the US and its allies.\nMr Muttaqi said US officials had also told the Taliban they would help in delivering Covid vaccines and humanitarian aid. \nThe US has not yet commented on the details of Saturday's talks, but a state department spokesperson previously said officials would use the meeting to press the Taliban to respect women's rights, form an inclusive government and allow humanitarian agencies to operate. \nThe meeting is set to continue on Sunday. \nMr Muttaqi told reporters that the Islamist group wanted to improve relations with the international community but also warned that nobody should interfere with any country's internal policies. \nAmerican officials have said the talks are a continuation of engagement with the Taliban on matters of national interest, not about giving legitimacy to the group's government.\nAs the talks were taking place in the Qatari capital Doha, in Afghanistan funeral ceremonies were being held for the victims of Friday's attack.\n\"[We] bury the bodies next to each other because we have no choice, and we have to prepare mass graves,\" one mourner said.\nThe United Nations said Friday's bombing was a \"third deadly attack this week apparently targeting a religious institution\" and was part of a \"disturbing pattern of violence\"."

      "text": "People in Wales now need an NHS Covid pass to be able to legally attend big events or nightclubs.\nThey are compulsory for over-18s, and show people have either tested negative on a lateral flow test or are fully vaccinated against Covid.\nWales' rugby game against New Zealand on 30 October will be one of the first mass events to require Covid passes.\nSome nightclub bosses said they felt \"singled out\" by the rules, but other people said they felt reassured.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said the new scheme was \"vulnerable to abuse\" but the \"huge bulk of people\" will follow the new rules.\nAsked if people could falsify their lateral flow tests, Mr Drakeford said: \"It is vulnerable to people who want to abuse the system but that's why the law is there.\"\n\"I am quite sure the huge bulk of people will use the lateral flow test in the correct way,\" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain programme.\nHe also rejected claims the new Covid pass was a financial burden for businesses, adding: \"Nightclubs already have to check people for their age. \n\"I don't think the cost issue is a very significant one here.\"\nIn its autumn and winter plan Mr Drakeford's government has not ruled out extending the scheme if further action is needed to tackle Covid rates.\nHe suggested that could include using passes when going to care homes or visiting hospitals.\n\"If numbers in the community continue to rise... being able to show a Covid pass if you were going into a care home might be an extra defence,\" he said.\nWelsh Education Minister Jeremy Miles told BBC Politics Wales that public services were expected to face \"significant pressure\" this winter, and the pass would cut transmission of the virus.\nThe Senedd voted on the passes last Tuesday - a vote the Welsh government said will not be repeated, despite it passing by just one vote.\nAnyone who is over 16 and has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England, or has had a negative lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours, can get a pass.\nThey are compulsory for anyone over 18 to enter:\nThe Welsh government says any venue that can serve alcohol, is open between midnight and 0500, and where music is provided for dancing will need to check for passes.\nThat means it could cover other venues not traditionally considered nightclubs which have a late licence.\nVenues can either apply the pass rules from when they open their doors, or when they open their dancefloor.\nNegative tests will be self-certified but the Welsh government plans to make it illegal to fake a negative test.\nLarge events could also be allowed to check passes at random, rather than check every person who attends.\nThe NHS Covid Pass is available digitally but you need to register for an NHS login via the website.\nYou need to upload a photo of your ID. That can be a passport, full UK driving licence or full European driving licence. \nThis allows you to produce a Covid pass using a smart phone, computer or laptop.\nYour NHS Covid Pass includes a barcode. The expiry date refers to the barcode and will update automatically. It does not apply to your vaccination status.\nIn Wales, you cannot get the pass via the NHS app, as this is only valid in England.\nWales is not the first nation to introduce such a pass.\nIn France, people have had to prove they are fully vaccinated, have recently tested negative or recently recovered from Covid with a \"health pass\". That must be produced on entering cafes, restaurants or public transport.\nScotland is the only other UK nation to use them after they were introduced on 1 October.\nOne nightclub and bar in Denbighshire has decided to close earlier in the evening rather than dealing with the \"complexity\" of implementing Covid passes.\nMike Murray, manager of Bar 236 in Prestatyn, said the club used to stay open past midnight with live music and DJs, but would need extra staffing to police the system, and it was not worth it financially.  \n\"We always weighed up the situation, following the government guidelines to make it a safe and comfortable environment to drink in.\n\"We've even been keeping masks on and doing table service after the government advice changed because what's wrong with doing it a little longer to keep people comfortable?\"\nHe added he received a lack of guidance from Welsh government as to \"what passes would look like or where we could get one from if people asked\". \n\"We want people to come in and let common sense prevail: If you're unwell, don't come to the bar.\"\nThe decision to introduce Covid passes has very much split opinion, which was evident in the Senedd vote.\nGuto Brychan, chief executive of Cardiff music venue Clwb Ifor Bach, said the timing made things difficult as students had just returned to university and it is \"the busiest time of year\".\nHe said this was made more difficult because many students are from outside Wales and may not understand the law.\nMr Brychan said: \"One of the main concerns as well is that the Covid pass isn't uniform across the whole of the hospitality industry.\n\"It seems to have been specifically designed to target places that supply dancing or culture, but I'd argue the high risk activity here is the consumption of alcohol, not dancing.\n\"There'll be plenty of venues open as late as ourselves that will have as many people in them but won't have the restrictions that we have in place.\"\nLidi Staffurth is one of thousands of people who have been shielding during the pandemic due to a condition which makes them extremely vulnerable to Covid-19.\nShe said Covid passes would help reassure people who might feel uncertain about attending large events, adding she felt she had her \"freedom back\".\nMs Staffurth labelled it a \"brilliant idea\", not least because there are three young people in her family.\n\"If they're in large groups then we'll know they're around people who are double vaccinated, or at least free from Covid,\" she said.\n\"I think it's a fantastic idea and for a society at large it means people are looking after each other. \n\"I think some young people just don't care - they've had it with Covid, and I think we've all had it with Covid - but they live in their own little bubble and they don't really see beyond that bubble a lot.\n\"And that's fair enough, but it means with a Covid pass they're made to consider that.\"\nDavid Chapman, executive director for UK Hospitality in Wales, called for \"tolerance\" from government, licencing authorities and the public as the passes were introduced. \nHe told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast there was some \"trepidation\" in the industry, particularly about alignment with England, as well as staff shortages. \n\"We've got staffing problems as people will know already and more labour intensive moves such as this actually makes it quite difficult for a business to juggle resources well at the moment,\" he said. \nHe also called for the \"easiest possible trading conditions\" over Christmas, saying businesses had been told passes would stop \"stop at a certain point when society and the health service can cope\". \nDr Mair Hopkin, chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners in Wales, said the risk of Covid will increase as the weather gets worse and people spend more time indoors.\nShe said: \"They've introduced them in France and it seems to have been very acceptable to the French population, and also it seems to have coincided with a more rapid drop in their incidence rates.\n\"If that happens here then that would be a good thing.\"\nEconomy Minister Vaughan Gething said he would not \"expect perfection on day one\" as the system is introduced.  \nHe said: \"We do accept there may be problems in venues getting used to what they need to do.\""

      "tags": "Energy customer switching,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry,Bulb",
      "text": "Together Energy is the latest UK supplier to collapse due to rising gas prices. \nTwenty-eight energy companies have stopped trading in the UK since August, including Bulb, which is being managed separately because of its size. \nMore than three million customers have seen their energy firm collapse since the summer, though most suppliers are tiny compared to Bulb. \nOfgem said a new supplier will be found for Together Energy's 176,000 domestic customers, whose supply will continue without interruption. \nThe other companies which have already gone out of business are: \nAmpoweruk Ltd, Avro, Bluegreen, CNG Energy Limited, Colorado Energy, Daligas, Enstroga, Entice, Goto, Green, Hub, Igloo Energy, MA Energy Limited, Money Plus, Neon Reef, Omni Energy Limited, Orbit Energy, People's Energy, PFP, Pure Planet, Social Energy Supply, Symbio Energy, Utility Point, Zebra Power Limited and Zog Energy.  \nFirms have struggled because they offered customers cheap fixed deals. That meant they couldn't pass on the cost of soaring gas prices.\nIf your energy provider goes bust, you still receive gas and electricity. \nBecause of its size, Bulb has been put into an arrangement called \"special administration\". \nThe company is being run as normal by administrators Teneo, until a buyer can be found or its customers can be moved elsewhere. In the short-term, it means Bulb customers haven't been been transferred to another provider, and don't have to do anything. \nThe accounts held by the other failed firms are automatically moved to a new supplier by energy regulator Ofgem.\nYou can't choose the provider and may end up on a more expensive tariff.\nOfgem has sent customers to the following suppliers: \nOfgem and Citizens Advice both recommend making a note or taking a photo of your meter reading and downloading any bills, while waiting for your new supplier to get in touch.\nThere's no need to cancel direct debits.\nIf you're in credit, the balance will be added to your account with your new supplier. However, this may take several weeks.\nIf you're in debt to a company which has stopped trading, you still have to pay the money you owe. You will be contacted by its administrators, or the supplier which takes over its business.   \nIt's unlikely. \nUsually, consumers are encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise. \nBut at the moment better offers simply aren't available. In particular, people already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nThose coming to the end of fixed deals will be moved on to higher standard tariffs.\nA tariff set at the price cap limit - the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard deal - will be the most competitive.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, the Energy Saving Trust says simple changes to our homes and energy habits could help offset the current price rises.\nThe price cap sets the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The level of the cap is reviewed every six months.\nIt's the reason energy suppliers haven't been able to pass on all of the recent wholesale gas price increases.\nAbout 15 million households in England, Wales and Scotland saw a 12% rise in their energy bills on 1 October, when a higher price cap took effect.\nOfgem has now said it will review how the price cap is calculated to make sure it accurately reflects the risks faced by companies. \nIt will publish its conclusions in February, and a new price cap will be announced before it is implemented in April 2022.\nIn Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market, a number of suppliers have also announced price increases in recent months.\nA worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies has meant gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia have risen dramatically. \nSupplies of renewable energy in Great Britain were also reduced by the least windy summer since 1961. \nA fire at a National Grid site in Kent closed a power cable supplying electricity from France. \nRising gas prices also led to a shortage of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is widely used in the food and drink industry."

      "text": "Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, has called on the UK government to \"nurse\" businesses through the energy crisis. \nHe described the situation facing the UK as a \"perfect storm\".\nWholesale gas prices have risen 250% since January and there are warnings some industrial sectors may have to shut down operations. \nUK Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has defended the government's handling of the crisis. \nSpeaking to Sky News' Trevor Phillips on Sunday, he would not rule out a price cap for businesses and said his department was talking to industry to see what solutions would work. \nBut he denied reports he asked for \"billions\" from the Treasury to subsidise energy intensive industries.\nIn an interview with BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show, Mr Blackford warned that energy prices could go up further. \nOfgem has already warned that householders face \"significant rises\" in energy prices next spring when the price cap, which limits how much energy providers can charge per unit, is due to be changed. \nTwelve domestic energy supply firms have failed in the last 13 months as they paid more for their gas then they were able to charge. Their customers have been moved to alternative providers.\n\"Now we know this is not going to go away quickly and actually if you end up in a situation that more energy providers have to hedge by buying additional supplies, all we are actually doing is forcing energy prices up even more and more,\" Mr Blackford said. \n\"There's a real issue about some larger providers being in quite a delicate situation and the impact that it's going to have. Government can't walk away from its responsibilities.\"\nHe said that if factories closed, it would have wider repercussions on the supply chain and unemployment levels. \nThe Energy Intensive Users Group - which represents firms which use a lot of energy - has said measures were needed \"right now\" to stop shut downs having a wider impact.\nAnd businesses in the ceramics industry have said they may be forced to scale back or stop production due to the rise in gas prices. \n\"Government has to recognise we have a responsibility to nurse businesses through this to provide short term support,\" Mr Blackford said. \n\"If we end up in a situation where steel production stops in the west coast of Scotland, that helps nobody. \n\"We have got to make sure that companies have got the assistance they need in the short term while we get through this. If not we are going to pay the price because we're going to end up with high unemployment, we are going to end up with supply constraints.\"\nEarlier, Mr Kwarteng, asked on the BBC's The Andrew Marr Show if he was going to give extra help to energy-intensive industries, like steel, said: \"We're looking to find a solution.\"\nTold that that sounds like a yes, the minister replied: \"No, that doesn't sound like yes at all. We already have existing support and we're looking to see if that's sufficient to get us through this situation.\"\nHe added: \"I've been very clear we're not going to bail out failing energy suppliers.\"\nOn being informed of the Business Secretary's position, Mr Blackford said: \"This is like Thatcher all over again, isn't it?\"\nAsked whether the Scottish government would support those affected by rising energy crisis, he said: \"The Scottish government is already doing what it can and in particular we are making sure that we are trying to react against fuel poverty, we are trying to make sure vulnerable families, children with disabilities and so on are being supported. \n\"We can't fix every problem that emerges from Westminster.\"\nHe added: \"I want to do as much as we can but our budget is constrained and let's remember that we don't have the borrowing powers that Westminster  has. We would fix this - give us the powers to do it and we would make sure we would give businesses the necessary support.\""

We opened the doors and found inside 126 undocumented people.\"\nOfficers gave the migrants first aid before escorting them to a shelter run by the Guatemalan Migration Institute. \nA spokeswoman for Guatemala's migration authority, Alejandra Mena, said that the migrants had arrived in Central America in Honduras and from there begun to make the treacherous journey north to the US. \nThey will now be transported back to the border with Honduras and handed over to authorities. \nThe discovery comes just a day after Mexican authorities detained 652 migrants, including some 350 children, travelling in three refrigerated double-trailer trucks near the US southern border. \nSoldiers at a military checkpoint in Tamaulipas searched the trucks after hearing voices inside. \nThe incident reflects growing concerns over the amount of migrants, among them large numbers of Haitians, taking significant risks in their attempts to reach the US. \nSince the start of 2021, more than 50 migrants have died while trying to cross a jungle corridor called the Darien Gap in Panama, on the border with Colombia, according to the Panamanian prosecutor's office.\nHaiti has suffered from years of instability, culminating in the assassination of President Jouvenal Mo\u00efse in July. The following month, the country was hit by a deadly earthquake.\nThousands of Haitians had already left the country, seeking work in countries across Latin America.\nMany have begun attempting to reach the US in the belief that they qualify for Temporary Protected Status, a temporary right to remain in the country which has been extended to Haitians already living in the US but not to new arrivals.\nLast month about 13,000 Haitians gathered under a bridge connecting Del Rio in Texas to Ciudad Acu\u00f1a in Mexico. Since then the US has  deported more than 7,500 people to Haiti, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).\nThe US special envoy for Haiti, Daniel Foote, resigned in protest over the deportations, saying that returning people fleeing an earthquake and political instability was \"inhumane\". \nBut the US Department of Homeland Security's Marsha Espinosa reiterated that \"our borders are not open, and people should not make the dangerous journey\"."

She said they would come to the UK in two to three weeks.\nLeeds United and Chelsea are among a number of British football clubs who have promised to support them in the UK.\nThe young squad members have all been through an extraordinary ordeal.\nMost of them are from Herat in western Afghanistan and had made their way to Kabul when the Western airlift started, staying in safe houses.\n\"Seventy percent of them had received death threats,\" said Ms Gill. \"They were terrified.\"\nAfghanistan's former women's team was airlifted to Australia and the girls' team were later given asylum in Portugal. But the fate of the development squad was uncertain - until now.\nThe girls, along with their coaches and family members, had been due to be evacuated to Qatar at the end of August. They were almost within sight of the airport when they were pulled off their buses because of security warnings. Two hours later, the airport was attacked by a suicide bomber.\nAfter 10 days in hiding, they were eventually driven to the Afghan border, and crossed into Pakistan after being given personal permission to enter by Prime Minister Imran Khan.\nBut with their Pakistani visas about to run out, Ms Gill said, the \"platform was burning\" because it would have been far too dangerous for them to return to Afghanistan.\nWomen have not been able to take part in any sports since the Taliban takeover. The former women's football team captain, Khalida Popal, had warned players to burn their kits and delete social media images of them playing for fear of retribution from the Taliban."

      "text": "The energy price cap protecting households from sharp rises in gas prices is \"not fit for purpose\", suppliers have said.\nNatural gas prices are at record highs, which has led to some domestic energy firms failing as they are paying more for gas than they are able to charge.\nSuppliers have warned that consumers could face a \"huge cost\" from these firms going out of business.\nThere are also calls for an energy price cap to help small businesses.\nGas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid pandemic.\nDomestic customers are partly protected from sharp rises by a price cap - which sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard tariff - although energy regulator Ofgem has warned that households will see further \"significant rises\" in the spring, when the cap is reviewed.\nLast month, nine energy companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers and on to higher rates.\nPaul Richards, chief executive of Together Energy, which he said is currently making losses, told the BBC that while he supported a price cap to protect customers, the current mechanism \"is not fit for industry, nor is it fit for customers\". \n\"Crazy, just crazy\" is how the nursery and soft play owner Gordon Foster describes the sharp rise in energy prices, shaking his head in dismay. \nBusinesses typically fix their energy bills a few years in advance, known as \"hedging\".\nMr Foster is one of the unlucky ones whose energy contract is up for renewal, and at the moment he's looking at paying eight times his current rate, taking up a contract that would tie him in for years. \nThe alternative is paying sky high prices now without a contract, and keeping his fingers crossed that prices will stabilise. \nFor him, as for others, this sudden jump in costs makes parts of the business unviable, and certainly means he has to put his prices up for his customers. \nWhile households might have an energy cap in place to protect them from such eye-watering spikes in global markets, we are all exposed to the impact of such costs for businesses. Ultimately they feed through to everyone. \nHe said while the cap protected customers in the short term, he thought there was somewhere between \u00a31bn and \u00a33bn in costs which would be spread back across business and households as a result of failed suppliers.\nDerek Lickorish, chairman of Utilita Energy, which has more than 800,000 customers, said there was no doubt there would be a cost paid by consumers for failed firms.\n\"The government has to look at the means by which they can support not only energy suppliers, but also big industry,\" he said. \nMr Lickorish said he would like to see the price cap reviewed four times a year, rather than the current two, and for a longer period of gas prices to be considered in setting it.\nStephen Murray, head of energy, commercial and partners at Moneysupermarket.com, said that while the usual advice for consumers was to shop around, for now it was to stay put, with those on a fixed deal likely to be better off.\nThe price cap provided \"some level of protection\", he said, but \"that comes at a cost and we've seen that through failed suppliers\".\nBusiness group the British Chambers of Commerce has called for a similar cap to be introduced for the energy bills of small and medium sized businesses - those with 250 employers or fewer.\nThese firms mostly buy their energy several years in advance, so those whose contracts are due for renewal now are facing a \"difficult time\", it said.\nThe group's co-executive director Claire Walker said the increasing pressure on these sized businesses was \"becoming dire\" and said that a price cap would give them the confidence to maintain normal business activities.\nDave Dalton, chief executive of British Glass, said he thought a cap would help but was probably \"too little, too late\" and that an \"immediate intervention\" was needed.\nThe government said it was in regular contact with business groups to explore ways to manage the impact of global prices.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng met leaders from heavy industry on Friday amid warnings that some sectors could have to shut down, but they failed to find any solutions.\nLabour has accused the government of being in denial about gas prices, with wholesale prices rising 250% since January.\nA number of Conservative MPs have called for the government to take action, and the Energy Intensive Users Group - which represents firms that use a lot of energy - said measures were needed \"right now\".\nThe group's chair Dr Richard Leese said that energy-heavy industries were \"intrinsically linked\" and if some sectors were forced to shut down, it would have a knock-on impact.\n\"We've seen the curtailment in production in the steel and fertiliser sector - that's had a knock-on impact into the supply chains in the industrial supply chains and domestic supply chains,\" he said.\nUK Steel boss Gareth Stace said he was \"baffled\" that the UK government had failed to find solutions because governments in the rest of Europe had stepped in to support industry - although they faced lower energy costs than in the UK."

      "text": "Liberty Steel has secured a \u00a350m cash injection which it says will safeguard 660 jobs at its plant in Rotherham.\nThe deal is part of a wider restructure of GFG Alliance, Liberty's owner, which was forced to seek funding when its key lender, Greensill Capital, collapsed.\nGFG Alliance said the cash would allow the Rotherham plant to reopen this month after being closed since spring.\nCommunity, the steelworkers' union, said it was \"overdue\" but was \"an important step in the right direction\".\nJeffrey Kabel, GFG's chief transformation officer, said: \"The injection of \u00a350m of shareholder funds into Liberty Steel UK is an important step in our restructuring and transformation. \n\"It will help to create sustainable value, ensure that Liberty has the ability to raise and deploy capital quickly in the UK and enable our businesses to demonstrate their potential and agree long-term debt restructuring.\"\nAt the beginning of the year, Liberty Steel employed 3,000 steelworkers in the UK.\nBut its future was thrown into doubt when Greensill collapsed in early March. GFG has been struggling to raise new financing since then, while the majority of its workers have been on furlough.\nIn April, GFG approached the government for help, but the request was rejected by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng.\nGFG, one of the UK's largest industrial groups, is owned by businessman Sanjeev Gupta.\nA further 2,000 people work at other GFG steel sites in the UK.\nGFG said the cash injection would allow Liberty Steel (LSUK) to restart its electric arc furnace at Rotherham.\n\"Production ramp-up will commence in October 2021 with a plan to reach 50,000 tonnes per month as soon as possible,\" it added.\n\"The restart of operations will enable colleagues to return to work, setting the platform for LSUK's longer-term refinancing and delivery of its plan to expand Rotherham's capacity, creating a two million tonnes per annum green steel plant.\"\nNews of the move was welcomed by industry body UK Steel.\nA spokesperson said it was \"really good news for not only the company, but those many thousands of workers and their families, the communities where those jobs a located and of course the whole of the UK steel sector\". \n\"Our friends at Liberty Steel can now fire up those furnaces, make the steel that this economy needs and most importantly give some certainty to the well-paid and highly-skilled workforce.\"\nBut the spokesperson added: \"The last thing the sector needs now is for government to merely sit on its hands and risk an energy crisis becoming a steel industry crisis.\"\nUK Steel called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to intervene on the industry's behalf \"before it is too late\".\nRoy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, said the deal \"demonstrates that GFG can raise funds for the UK\".\n\"Huge challenges remain,\" Mr Rickhuss said. \"But the workforce is ready to get back to making the best steels money can buy and the \u00a350m injection will enable us to restart steelmaking.\"\nMeanwhile, plans are proceeding to sell off GFG's Speciality Steel business, which employs about 750 staff at plants in South Yorkshire.\nGFG said the cash lifeline would help Speciality Steel to \"establish a stable operating environment and create an attractive asset\".\nFurther afield, GFG said it had also agreed a debt restructuring for Liberty's Australian division with Credit Suisse Asset Management.\nGreensill's heavy exposure to Mr Gupta's business had prompted Credit Suisse to freeze withdrawals from up to \u00a310bn worth of funds held as security."

The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute.\nThe experience of pressing charges was \"emotionally draining,\" she said, adding that constantly being asked to recount the abuse was \"traumatic\".\n\"It was absolutely horrific,\" Abby, from south-west Wales, said.\n\"I could feel myself shaking because I didn't know what was going to happen.\n\"Not once have I felt that I've been treated like a survivor, I've felt I've had to constantly prove that I'm innocent,\" she said.\n\"I don't feel safe. And I don't have the confidence in the courts to put my children's safety first.\n\"The issue was male violence, not female behaviour, and that needs to be recognised.\"\nSarah Thomas, of Merthyr Tydfil-based rape charity New Pathways, said delays in getting justice is one of the biggest challenges for survivors.\n\"They feel forgotten, they feel lost in the system, that they're not important, and that the system is set up for their perpetrator,\" she said.\nShe said some women wait three years for their case to get to court, leaving some feeling unable to continue with the case.\nGwendolyn Sterk, of Welsh Women's Aid, said she wanted a system that prioritised survivors and implemented restraining orders better.\nShe said many did not report abuse as it was easy for perpetrators to \"continue the harassment of the woman\" during court cases.\nVictim's Commissioner Dame Vera Baird QC said violent crimes against women and girls were prosecuted \"extraordinarily weakly\" in England and Wales.\nThe crime survey for England and Wales, considered an accurate assessment of crimes committed, estimated just 16% of raped or sexually assaulted women report it to police.\nHome Office figures show just 1.6% of such cases that get to court result in a conviction.\nDame Vera said she wanted abuse given the same priority as terrorism.\n\"There needs to be an urgent, a powerful and a relentless drive to change, not only police attitudes, but criminal justice attitudes and indeed public attitudes,\" she said.\nIn Wales, 22 magistrates' courts have closed and there are currently 17,726 cases outstanding as Covid puts extra pressure on the system.\nThe Magistrates' Association has prioritised cases such as domestic violence where people are in danger, and the courts have been holding remote hearings to clear the Covid-induced backlog.\nRape prosecutions have fallen 59% in the last five years.\nIn June the UK government published a plan to improve that.\nVictims and youth justice shadow minister Anna McMorrin, Labour MP for Cardiff North, said the criminal justice system was failing women and girls \"at every turn\", and labelled it a \"national scandal\".\nShe called for cross-party co-operation on the issue, and for the Victim's Bill, a proposed law currently being debated in Parliament, to be brought forward.\nLast week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said targets to return to 2016 levels of prosecutions would be \"incredibly tough\" to meet.\nThe MoJ said it planned to spend \u00a3151m on victims, including an extra \u00a350m to increase support for victims of rape and domestic abuse.\nA pilot scheme for rape and sexual violence survivors to have their cross-examinations recorded before trial has also recently been extended.\nAn MoJ spokesman said: \"The impact of the pandemic was vast and unprecedented but we are already cutting backlogs in magistrates' and crown courts across Wales.\n\"We are investing hundreds of millions to restore the swift access to justice that victims deserve, while building back faith in the system by introducing a new victims' law and boosting vital support services.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Energy customer switching,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry,Oil & Gas industry",
      "text": "High energy costs are forcing manufacturers to warn of higher prices for their goods as they pass on increases to consumers.\nIceland boss Richard Walker said higher energy bills and other costs meant price rises were now \"inevitable\".\nThe warning came as analysts predicted that household energy bills could rise by hundreds of pounds next year.\nThey said the energy price cap, which protects domestic consumers, could soar by \u00a3400 in the spring.\nCornwall Insight forecasts that the energy price cap will rise to about \u00a31,660 by next summer.\nThat is about 30% higher than the record \u00a31,277 level for the cap set for winter 2021-22, which began at the start of October.\n\"With wholesale gas and electricity prices continuing to reach new records, successive supplier exits during September 2021 and a new level for the default tariff cap, the Great British energy market remains on edge for fresh volatility and further consolidation,\" said Craig Lowrey, senior consultant at Cornwall Insight.\nEnergy regulator Ofgem said the price cap \"will ensure that consumers don't pay more than is absolutely necessary this winter\".\nBut if gas prices stay high, the price cap will rise, Ofgem said.\nThe regulator said its \"number one priority is to protect customers\", but acknowledged \"this is a worrying time for many people\". \nBut while the price cap helps households, there is no such safeguard for businesses, which have to absorb the full impact of rising global energy prices.\nMr Walker warned that Iceland's energy bill would go up by \u00a320m next year. Alongside higher salaries to address lorry driver shortages and other new costs, he said grocery prices would have to increase.\n\"It's inevitable that we will see price rises,\" he told the BBC. \"The UK supermarket industry is one of the most competitive in the world. \n\"Our margins are very very tight and we're not an endless sponge that can just absorb all of these different cost increases.\"\nAndrew Large, director general of the Confederation of Paper Industries, said: \"This is a highly inflationary situation for the British economy and members will clearly be in a position where they do try to pass those costs on to consumers where they can.\"\nOne paper manufacturer, the Northwood Group, said the industry had been \"left to fend for itself\" in the face of \"horrendous\" knock-on effects from the gas price rise.\n\"The spike [in gas prices] that we have seen since January is equivalent to a 550% price increase, which of course destroys any industrial planning,\" said chairman Paul Fecher.\nLaura Cohen, chief executive of the British Ceramic Confederation, said many of her member firms could even be forced to stop production \"due to uneconomic higher energy costs\".\nThis could cause \"severe damage\" to production facilities such as brick kilns, which could not easily be turned off at short notice, she said.\nMeanwhile, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said that by decarbonising the UK's power supply, the country will protect customers from volatile fossil fuel prices.\n\"The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices,\" he told a conference organised by trade body Energy UK.\nHe said that the government's recent pledge to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2035 - 15 years ahead of the previous target - would help.\n\"Our homes and businesses will be powered by affordable, clean and secure electricity generated here in the UK, for people in the UK,\" Mr Kwarteng said.\nThe Energy Shop - a price comparison site - warned people to prepare themselves for even greater increases in household bills.\nIt said that the next increase in the price cap, due to come in from 1 April 2022, could be \u00a3500 or even higher.\nFounder Joe Malinowski warned: \"If things don't settle down soon, increases of \u00a3600, \u00a3700 or even \u00a3800 cannot be ruled out.\"\nNine energy suppliers have already collapsed in recent weeks and more could be facing the same fate.\nThey were unable to keep their price promises as the wholesale price of gas soared. \nTheir customers have already seen annual bill increases of hundreds of pounds when they moved to a new provider and away from whichever low-rate fixed deal their supplier had offered.\nSome of the heat was drawn from the crisis on Wednesday when Russia said it would increase gas supplies to Europe.\nUK wholesale gas prices hit a record high during the day before falling after the Russian intervention.\nBut price volatility could continue as investors remain nervous about low stockpiles of gas across Europe.\nIf you feel powerless against international business and politics when watching your domestic energy bill go up, you are in good company.\nNormally, customers are urged to get active, search and switch to save money - but not now.\nUntil recently, the energy price cap was a backstop, protecting the vulnerable. Now it is the most competitive tariff available.\nThe cap is shielding households from the wild fluctuation in prices seen on the wholesale markets, but that is only a crumb of comfort when bills and prices across the board are still expected to see a sharp increase.\nSo for now, experts simply advise customers to find ways to save energy, brace themselves and budget for bigger bills. Wrap up for a financial chill that could last longer than the winter.\nThe energy price cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThat includes the fixed daily amount customers pay, plus the price per unit they pay for electricity and gas.\nThe cap was increased on 1 October, with about 15 million households facing a 12% rise in energy bills, the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019.\nThose on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of \u00a3139 - from \u00a31,138 to \u00a31,277 a year.\nPrepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a \u00a3153 increase.\nThat's a far cry from a year previously when on 1 October 2020, the energy price cap was cut by \u00a384, to \u00a31,042.\nWill you be affected by rising energy prices?

      "text": "Poles backing EU membership have taken part in protests across the country, amid fears it could leave the bloc.\nThe rallies on Sunday were held in response to a top court ruling that said key EU laws were \"incompatible\" with the Polish constitution.\nProtests were held in about 100 towns and cities, with some 100,000 people gathering in the capital, Warsaw.\nThe ruling has raised concerns Poland could exit the EU, but the government has denied having any such intention.\nThe court's decision last Thursday effectively rejected the core principle that EU law has primacy over national legislation. It was the most significant challenge to the supremacy of EU law to date.\nPoland's Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has defended the decision and said his ruling party had no plans for what some are calling Polexit.\n\"This is a harmful myth, which the opposition uses for its own lack of ideas about Poland's responsible place in Europe,\" Mr Morawiecki wrote on Facebook following the pro-EU rallies.\nOn Monday, the European Commission's industry chief, Thierry Breton, said he did not believe \"for one second\" there would be a Polexit after the court ruling.\nHe said the Commission - which draws up the proposals for new EU laws - would analyse the ruling before deciding what action to take. The Commission has previously warned it will use all its powers to bring Poland into line with EU law.\nOpinion polls consistently show strong backing for EU membership among Polish voters.\nThat support was on display on Sunday, when opposition politicians, activists and artists took part in the demonstrations.\nAt the rally in the capital, Donald Tusk, former president of the European Council and now leader of the opposition party Civic Platform, called on people to \"defend a European Poland\".\nWanda Traczyk-Stawska, a 94-year-old veteran of the Warsaw Uprising against the Nazi German occupation in 1944, spoke at one event.\n\"This is our Europe and nobody is going to take us out of it,\" she said.\nProtester Janusz Kuczynski said he was worried the country was going backwards. \"I am afraid that bad times may come back,\" he said. \"There was simply no freedom.\"\nPoland's Constitutional Tribunal effectively rejected the principle of the primacy of EU law over national legislation in certain judicial matters.\nThe legal challenge was brought by the Polish prime minister in March this year.\nIt was the first time in the history of the 27-strong EU bloc that a leader of a member state had questioned wholesale EU treaties in a constitutional court.\nMr Morawiecki wanted to prevent Polish judges from using EU law to question the legitimacy of judges appointed following recent changes to the judiciary.\nThose changes have been criticised by the European Commission for undermining judicial independence and increasing political control over courts.\nCommission President Ursula von der Leyen said she was \"deeply concerned by the ruling\" and vowed to \"uphold the founding principles of the EU's legal order\".\nThe court decision was the latest flashpoint in a deepening row between the EU and Poland.\nPoland's right-wing populist government has found itself increasingly at odds with the European Commission over issues ranging from LGBT rights to judicial independence.\nThe Commission has yet to approve Poland's \u20ac57bn (\u00a350bn; $66bn) Covid-19 recovery plan.\nNegotiations are ongoing and some analysts suggest the government is using the ruling as leverage to get the plan agreed.\nLast week Jacek Karnowski, editor-in-chief of the pro-government Sieci weekly, told the BBC that Polexit was \"unimaginable and unrealistic\", although he said the topic was now a matter of discussion."

Earlier this year, two Europeans who managed to escape captivity reported that she was well.\nIn March, her brother received a letter from her confirming she was still alive. He told AFP news agency earlier this year that the note had been written in block capitals \"because she always used capital letters\", and contained the names of their parents, ending with her signature. \nMali has been struggling to contain a growing Islamist insurgency that first emerged in the north of the country in 2012. Kidnappings in particular have become more common in the former French colony as the security crisis has deepened. \nAccording to a non-governmental organisation, Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, more than 935 people have been abducted in the country since 2017. \nHowever, Colonel Assimi Goita, who led a military coup that removed the country's civilian government last year, has sought to assure Malians and the international community that efforts are under way to secure the release of all those still being held.\nFrench troops have been leading operations against Islamist groups in the region since 2014, however President Emmanuel Macron announced in June that operations would be reduced over the coming year. \nThis has reportedly led to the Malian government turning to the Russian mercenary collective, the Wagner group, for assistance. The secretive group has been involved in conflicts across Africa, including fighting with a rebel general, Khalifa Haftar, in Libya."

The reality is the opposite.\n\"The role of the ECJ\u00a0 in Northern Ireland and the consequent inability of the UK government to implement the very sensitive arrangements in the protocol in a reasonable way has created a deep imbalance in the way the protocol operates.\"\nWhen the EU publishes its proposals next week that is expected to lead to a new round of negotiations.\nBoth sides have suggested there will be short, intense talks process beginning in late October or early November."

      "text": "Forty small boats with 1,115 migrants on board have crossed the Channel in two days, the Home Office has said. \nOn Saturday, Border Force picked up 491 migrants on 17 boats, while the French authorities prevented 114 people from making the crossing. \nOn Friday 624 people crossed on 23 boats, with 300 more being stopped by the French authorities. \nIn September, more migrants crossed than in any other previous month since the crisis began.\nSome 3,879 migrants made the crossing in September.\nMore than 18,000 people have made the crossing from France to England in small boats so far this year, compared to just over 8,460 in 2020, according to Home Office figures. \nOn Saturday the French interior minister, Gerald Darmanin, visited Calais to see what was being done to try and stop migrants crossing the English Channel by boat. \nIn July, a \u00a354m deal was announced between the UK and France which would see France doubling the number of police patrolling its beaches to stem the number of migrant crossings.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel recently threatened to withhold the funding unless more people were stopped from reaching the UK.\nA Home Office spokesman said 89 people on board five boats had also made the crossing on Thursday. \nHe said: \"This year record numbers of people have put their lives in the hands of ruthless people smugglers and risked perilous channel crossings from French beaches.\n\"Joint cooperation with the French has led to nearly 300 arrests, 65 convictions and prevented more than 13,500 crossings. But with hundreds still risking their lives and making the crossing, all sides must do more.\"\nThe English Channel is one of the most dangerous and busiest shipping lanes in the world. \nMany migrants come from some of the poorest and most chaotic parts of the world, and many ask to claim asylum once they are picked up by the UK authorities.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "title": "Czech election: Milos Zeman in intensive care after vote",
      "tags": "Prague,Czech Republic",
      "text": "Czech President Milos Zeman has been taken to hospital amid political upheaval after a surprise opposition win in parliamentary elections.\nThe 77-year-old is a heavy smoker and former heavy drinker who uses a wheelchair and suffers from diabetes. \nHe was due to lead talks on forming a new government after Saturday's vote.\nPrague's Central Military Hospital director said Mr Zeman was in intensive care for complications from a known condition.\n\"We know the diagnosis precisely, which allows us to target treatment,\" director Miroslav Zavoral said, but added that he would not give any further details per the president's request. \nMr Zeman's office has previously said he is suffering from exhaustion and dehydration, after spending eight days in hospital last month. \nThe president was taken to hospital from the presidential chateau outside the capital Prague on Sunday morning, shortly after a meeting with Prime Minister Andrej Babis.\nFootage broadcast by Czech media show staff holding up his head as he entered the hospital.\nWhen President Zeman spent eight days in hospital in September, journalists asked the president's mercurial spokesman Jiri Ovcacek for an official explanation. For two days there was no response. Finally, the silence was broken with the following cryptic tweet:\n\"I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord sustained me. I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about\": Psalm 3, 5-7.\nIt is fair to say that the Czech journalistic community - some of whom are blacklisted by the president's office - has developed a certain degree of scepticism at the official statements emanating from Prague Castle.\nFor weeks we have been told September's visit was a scheduled one, to treat exhaustion and dehydration.\nBut last week several media outlets - including the country's public broadcaster, Czech Radio - quoted seven independent sources familiar with his condition who said he was suffering from ascites, a build-up of abdominal fluid usually associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Mr Zeman has been a heavy drinker throughout his life.\nMr Ovcacek released a statement dismissing the claims as lies and disinformation, motivated by political activism and hatred of Mr Zeman.\nBut distressing footage of the president being wheeled into hospital - apparently unconscious, his head held up by a bodyguard and his wife and daughter with him - will do nothing to allay public concerns, at a time of political vacuum.\nPrime Minister Babis and his populist ANO party had sought re-election on Saturday after four years in power. But they were beaten in the poll by the centre-right coalition Spolu (meaning Together), which took 27.8% of the vote compared to ANO's 27.1%.\nSpolu has announced talks with the liberal Pirates/Mayors coalition known as PirStan to form a government. Together the two groups control 108 of the parliament's 200 seats. \nHowever President Zeman said before the election he would pick the winner of the largest individual party, not coalition, to form the next government. \nBecause ANO took the most votes of any one party, this would be Prime Minister Babis - an ally of President Zeman's.\nThe president announced his plan to vote for the billionaire prime minister ahead of the poll. Due to his ill health however, a ballot box had to be brought to him so he could take part in Saturday's election.\nAccording to Reuters news agency, the Czech constitution grants the lower house of the parliament the authority to appoint the prime minister if the presidential position is vacated.\nA controversial figure, Mr Zeman is known for making divisive remarks and using strong language. In June he was sharply criticised for calling transgender people \"disgusting\"."

      "text": "People will have to get used to higher food prices, the boss of Kraft Heinz has told the BBC.\nMiguel Patricio said the international food giant, which makes tomato sauce and baked beans, was putting up prices in several countries.\nUnlike in previous years, he said, inflation was \"across the board\".\nThe cost of ingredients such as cereals and oils has pushed global food prices to a 10-year high, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.\nKraft Heinz has increased prices on more than half its products in the US, its home market, and Mr Patricio admitted that is happening elsewhere too.\n\"We are raising prices, where necessary, around the world,\" he said.\nDuring the pandemic, many countries saw production of raw materials, ranging from crops to vegetable oils, fall. Measures to control the virus, as well as illness, limited output and delivery. \nAs economies have restarted, the supply of these products hasn't been able to keep up with returning demand, leading to higher prices. Higher wages and energy prices have also added to the burden for manufacturers.\nMr Patricio said this broad range of factors was contributing to the rising cost of food. \n\"Specifically in the UK, with the lack of truck drivers. In [the] US logistic costs also increased substantially, and there's a shortage of labour in certain areas of the economy.\"\nMr Patricio said that consumers would need to get used to higher food prices, given that the world's population was rising whilst the amount of land on which to grow food was not.\nIn the longer term \"there's a lot to come in technology to improve the effectiveness of farmers\" that will help, he said.\nNot all cost increases should be passed on to consumers, Mr Patricio said. Firms would have to absorb some of the rise in costs.\n\"I think it's up to us, and to the industry, and to the other companies, to try to minimise these price increases,\" he said.  \nBut big food producers like Kraft Heinz, Nestle and PepsiCo \"will most likely have to pass that cost on to consumers\" according to Kona Haque, head of research at the agricultural commodities firm ED&F Man.\n\"Whether it's corn, sugar, coffee, soybeans, palm oil, you name it, all of these basic food commodities have been rising,\" she said.\n\"Poor harvests in Brazil, which is one of the world's biggest agricultural exporters, drought in Russia, reduced planting in the US and stockpiling in China have combined with more expensive fertiliser, energy and shipping costs to push prices up.\" \nBut she said food producers would all be affected and would therefore all be raising prices in similar ways: \"because it's so widespread that everyone will do it, meaning they probably won't lose customers\".\nThis week PespsiCo warned it was also facing rising costs on everything from transport to raw ingredients, and said that further prices rises were likely at the start of next year.\nHowever, as well as pushing up costs, the pandemic did help boost sales for some Kraft Heinz brands, Mr Patricio said, because staying in meant \"people are cooking far more than they were before\".  \nCustomers in the UK bought more Heinz Baked Beans, while customers in the US bought more Kraft Mac & Cheese. Overall sales rose 1.6% to $13bn in the first half of this year, representing a slight slowdown. The results were described by Erin Lash, at the investment firm Morningstar, as \"still quite impressive relative to the comparable pre-pandemic period in 2019\".\nThe company is also undergoing an extensive restructuring under Mr Patricio, involving selling some old, and buying some new brands, which Ms Lash said was \"narrowing its focus and increasing its spending on innovation and marketing\" which would support future sales.\nMr Patricio said the firm was also spending significant sums on developing new packaging to meet its aims on reducing plastic waste.\nMost of the 650 million bottles of ketchup the firm sells every year are plastic, for example. But Mr Patricio said the firm was \"encouraging\" customers to buy glass bottles even though they are less convenient \"because you have to tap on the bottom\". \nHe added: \"We are working hard, not only on the plastic bottles, but everywhere in our footprint that has plastic.\"\nCampaigners against plastic waste would like to see a reduction in the use of single serving sachets.\nHowever following a shortage of sachets during the pandemic, as consumers bought more takeaways from restaurants, Kraft Heinz has invested in expanding production of them by 30%.\n\"Thanks God we did that, because now we don't have that [shortage] problem anymore\", said Mr Patricio. But he said the company was working on a solution \"to cutting the amount of plastic they use\". \nYou can watch Miguel Patricio's full interview on \"Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst\"  on BBC World News on  Sunday 10 October at 05:30 and 16:30 GMT, Monday 07:30 GMT and 16:30 GMT and Thursday at 07:30 GMT."
