      "tags": "Companies,Nando's,Restaurants",
      "text": "Nando's says it is hoping to reopen all its restaurants from Saturday after shutting about 50 outlets because of supply problems. \nThe chicken chain's restaurants were closed after it ran out of some food, including its popular peri-peri dish. \nThe group blamed the closures on staffing issues at its suppliers' factories.\nNando's said it seconded 70 staff to the suppliers to help \"get things moving again\". \nA Nando's spokesperson said on Wednesday: \"The UK food industry has been experiencing disruption across its supply chain in recent weeks due to staff shortages and Covid isolations, and a number of our restaurants have been impacted.\" \n\"However, since Monday, a team of our brilliant Nandocas have been supporting our key suppliers onsite - working in partnership to help get things moving again, and this has already had a positive impact on affected restaurants.\"  \nAs a result it said it intended that all of its restaurants should be open again from this Saturday.  \nThe South African-owned chain operates more than 400 Nando's restaurants across the UK. \nThe so-called pingdemic has hit food and other supply chains this summer, as staff have been forced to self-isolate if they have come into contact with someone with coronavirus.  \nDairy giant Arla reduced supermarket milk deliveries last month, blaming lorry driver shortages.  \nLast week, KFC said some items were missing from its menus due to \"disruption\".  \nThe shortages follow a stark warning last month from Ranjit Singh Boparan, founder of the country's largest supplier of supermarket chicken, the 2 Sisters Food Group.   \n\"Supply of chicken and turkey is under threat. Our retail partners and the wider supply chain have worked together closer than ever before to ensure we retain food supply and this is of huge credit to everyone. But we are at crisis point,\" he warned.  \nThe problem has also affected other industries, including carmakers, transport operators, restaurants and pubs.  \nFrom this week fully-vaccinated staff are no longer required to self-isolate which should help ease the pressure on businesses.

      "text": "People who have fled Afghanistan for the UK after the Taliban takeover have spoken of their relief to have escaped the country.\nUK troops are continuing to evacuate British nationals and eligible Afghans after insurgents seized control of the capital Kabul.\nNo 10 says 306 UK nationals and 2,052 Afghans have been evacuated so far.\nOne British aid worker said she felt \"lucky\" to escape, but that we \"must not forget Afghanistan\".\nKitty Chevallier, a 24-year-old charity worker from Basingstoke in Hampshire, left Kabul via a UK evacuation flight on Monday morning.\nShe said she was aware of how \"immensely lucky\" she was to have been helped out of Afghanistan, when others, including friends and colleagues, remained stranded.\n\"As we drove there at 04:00, the runways were crowded with hundreds of Afghan families hoping to get out somehow,\" she told the PA Media news agency.\n\"One of the strangest moments was getting on the plane, not knowing when we'd be able to come back or what the city would look and feel like when we did.\"\nMs Chevallier had worked in Kabul since last September with Afghanaid, a UK-registered charity that promotes women's rights and provides clean water and sanitation for Afghans.\nShe said it felt \"bizarre\" to be out of the country, but that \"the real tragedy\" was speaking to friends and colleagues \"for whom the chances of leaving the country are far, far smaller, and who have so much more to lose\".\n\"I've been doing what I can to help arrange their departure, where that has been possible, and I've been encouraged to see that most of them have now been given the opportunity to leave on a UN flight tomorrow,\" she added.\nThere have been fears that Afghans who worked with Western authorities or groups could be at higher risk of reprisals from the Taliban, though the group has denied this will happen.\nMs Chevallier said while the messages from the Taliban have made it sound as though there will be no \"danger\" from them, she had heard several examples of \"scared\" aid workers getting \"threatening messages, even death threats\".\nShe called on the UK to \"increase, not cut\" aid going to Afghanistan and said the criteria allowing people to return to the UK need to be urgently expanded \"to include aid workers and civil society activists, especially women\".\nIn addition to those who have already been evacuated to the UK, Downing Street said a further 2,000 Afghan applications had been completed - with \"many more being processed\".\nThe UK government has also committed to take in up to 20,000 Afghan refugees over the next few years under a new resettlement scheme - including 5,000 this year.\nThe Refugee Council - a UK-based charity helping refugees - welcomed the government's new scheme as a \"positive first step\".\nBut the charity wants the government to go further to resettle at least 10,000 people a year, and also to expand the eligibility for families so that Afghans living in the UK can be reunited with their loved ones.\nThe latest plans are in addition to an existing scheme for Afghan interpreters and others who worked for the UK government - the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP).\nThe Home Office says 2,000 Afghan former staff and their families have already come to the UK via this scheme this year - with a target of 5,000 by the end of 2021.\nThe speed of the Taliban's takeover of major Afghan cities and the capital Kabul appeared to catch Western governments off guard.\n\"Everyone, I think, has been surprised by the scale and the pace at which the Taliban have taken over in Afghanistan, and that's a lesson that we've all got to learn from,\" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Monday.\nThe PM's official spokesman said on Wednesday that UK humanitarian aid to Afghanistan had \"effectively... doubled to \u00a3286m\" as ministers sought to ensure it does not fund the Taliban.\nChallenged on the impact of recent cuts to overseas aid, the PM's spokesman said: \"I think people will accept that when the situation changes on the ground, we need to react accordingly, that's what we've done.\"\nHassina Syed, an Afghan businesswoman and activist, said she felt great \"relief\" as the evacuation flight she was on took off from Afghanistan.\nShe said she fled the country \"quickly\" because the situation was \"very unpredictable\".\nAsked about the atmosphere on the flight, she told BBC Two's Newsnight: \"Everybody got very emotional, most of us began to cry a lot.\"\nMs Syed said UK troops gave passengers bottled water and food, and that it was \"really touching\" to see them help soothe crying children.\nWomen back in Afghanistan are \"worrying\" and \"want to get out\" she says, because they fear that the Taliban will \"capture them\".\nShe said that during the Taliban's news conference on Tuesday - their first since seizing control of Kabul - there appeared to be a \"bit of changes [sic] that make us a little bit hopeful\".\nJack, from Birmingham, whose name has been changed to protect his family still in Afghanistan, left the country on a UK evacuation flight this week.\nSpeaking to PA Media, the 27-year-old said it was \"strange and frightening\".\n\"(Most) of those fleeing had to sit on the plane's rough floor but overall it was worth it - I am extremely thankful,\" he said.\n\"Family and friends are (still) there. It was tough not being able to say goodbye.\"\nAn RAF plane carrying UK nationals and Afghans landed at Brize Norton in Oxfordshire on Tuesday night.\nHalf a dozen more flights are due to arrive in the UK in the next 24 hours, according to the Ministry of Defence.\nAmid continued chaos at Kabul's airport, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer on Wednesday accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of \"staggering complacency\" and \"betraying\" the Afghan people. \nHe also cited reports from NGOs that an evacuation plane left \"almost empty\" because people couldn't get through the airport.\nDowning Street did not deny the reports, and acknowledged there was a \"difficult situation\" on the ground.\nDozens of planes from around 15 countries have reportedly been sent to Kabul to help with evacuations of foreign citizens and Afghan colleagues - including those from the US, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and the UK.\nTaliban fighters controlling access to the airport are reportedly not permitting Afghans without documents or passports to enter and have fired shots into the air to disperse approaching crowds."

      "title": "Covid: Price rises slow down and AZ jab makers trial plague vaccine",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\nThe UK inflation rate fell to 2% in the year to July as the final coronavirus restrictions were lifted, latest figures show. The Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation was down from 2.5% the previous month, according to the Office for National Statistics, and was driven by falls in clothing and footwear prices. The main contributors were \"good sales\" in the clothing shops over the summer, computer games and food prices, which are down year-on-year, says Liz Martins, UK economist at HSBC. The dip \"puts the brakes on those who argue that inflation is about to go out of control,\" she adds. \nThe plague has featured in many school lessons and history books, but it still infects people to this day. Cases are still found in some rural areas of Africa, Asia and America, with an outbreak in Madagascar in 2017 killing 171 people.  So now UK scientists behind the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine are trialling a new jab to protect people from the bacterial disease. Antibiotics can be used to treat it, if given early, but many cases are found in remote areas. The trial, involving at least 40 healthy 18 to 55-year-olds, will run for at least a year.\nMonthly mental health referrals across the UK hit their highest point in two years, it has emerged. One woman, Katie Yelland, has told the BBC she tried to take her own life after suffering post-natal depression - she had been receiving help and community-based support from the NHS, but services stopped during the first lockdown. Her case is one example, with charities warning the surge is set to continue. The government says it plans to expand and transform mental health services.\nBBC London reporter Victoria Cook is pregnant and has reservations about having the Covid vaccine. She spoke to other expectant mums and experts to find out what they think. Take a look at what she's discovered.\nWhen Thomas Yates was made redundant at the start of pandemic he decided to put his extra time to good use by picking up litter. He has has collected more than 2,800 abandoned face masks while out running and cycling and decided to turn them into pieces of art. Check out his creations.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nUnder-18s have been offered Pfizer vaccine and now Moderna's jab has been approved for use in 12 to 17 year olds, with this in mind which teenagers can now get vaccinated?\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

The latest price is the highest recorded since September 2013.\nSimply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a \u00a31 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%.\nIt applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted.\nYou may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money.\nRead more about inflation here.\nLiz Martins, UK economist at HSBC, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that experts were expecting the annual inflation to decrease a little, but added the size of the fall was a \"a bit of a surprise\".\n\"Today's figure puts the brakes on those who argue that inflation is about to go out of control, but there are reasons to think it does go up further later in the year,\" she said.\nMs Martins said the reasons for the dip in inflation were \"quite broad based\", but added the main contributors were \"good sales\" in the clothing shops over the summer, as well as a year-on-year fall in the prices of computer games and food. \nHowever, she said there were still expectations that inflation would rise later this year. The temporary VAT cut is going to be removed for hospitality, we've got some inflationary big energy bill hikes coming.  \n\"So we do think inflation could go up towards the end of the year and then come back down again around the turn of the year and into next year.\"\nRegulator Ofgem has said the price cap for default domestic energy deals would be raised to cover suppliers' extra costs, with typical gas and electricity bills likely to rise by \u00a3139 to \u00a31,277 a year.\nJuly's CPI figure was below most economists' forecasts of an increase of about 2.3%.\nThough falls in the price of clothes drove down the inflation, it was partially offset by recent rises in second-hand car prices, the ONS said.\nSecond-hand car sales in the UK have more than doubled in the last few months as a result of a delays in the supply of new cars, caused by the shortage of semiconductor chips used in their production. \nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said usually, a seasonal jump in transport prices was countered by a big drop in clothing prices.\n\"Stepping back from the detail, the big picture is that July's drop in CPI inflation will be short-lived,\" he said.\"The  headline rate will rise to nearly 4% by the end of this year.\"\nHowever, Mr Tombs said with energy prices \"unlikely to soar indefinitely\", and wage growth to be dampened when the furlough scheme ends, inflation would return to 2% by the end of 2022.\nYael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said the rate dip \"masks the strength of inflationary pressures currently within the UK economy\".\n\"We expect inflation to accelerate further during the rest of this year, rising significantly above the Bank of England's 2% target, as supply chains remain under strain faced with a strong rebound in demand,\" she added.\nThe Retail Prices Index (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, increased to 3.8%. The number in July is typically used to calculate rises in regulated rail fares.\nHowever, the government said no decision had been made on national fares, with a spokesman stating it is \"considering a variety of options\".\nAs the economy reopens, economic figures are disco-dancing in seemingly random directions. \nInflation came in lower than expected, bang on the Bank of England's target of 2%, thanks to a fall in the price of clothing.  \nBut some of the comparisons reflect last year's reopening trends, for example in July 2020 clothes prices did not fall, as is usual during the sales.  \nSome prices are difficult to calculate, such as package holidays. \nOther prices are still surging, such as the used car market, when in July the 12-month inflation rate was 14%, reflecting shortages of new cars due to difficulties in semiconductor production. Petrol prices are well up on a year ago too.\nSo the broad story is that this is a pause for breath as inflation marches towards 4% this year. \nBut the fact it has dipped provides more support for the majority of Bank of England decision makers on the Monetary Policy Committee who believe that the anticipated rise will be temporary and does not need an immediate response, in order to contain it."

      "text": "Two days after the Taliban took control of the Afghan capital, Kabul, female presenters have returned to at least some TV channels, after briefly going off air as the militants took over the country.\nTolo TV, the private channel which previously broadcast a mix of Western-style game shows, soap operas and talent contests, said there was a little bit of uncertainty at the time about what would unfold next and temporarily removed their female presenters.\nTolo News' Siyar Sirat said on Tuesday things looked like they were returning to normal, with \"normal resources at the office, we have women on screen and we are reporting from around the city\".\nOne of the big questions now is what will happen to Afghan women - they are still visible on TV screens so far, and the Taliban have given assurances that their rights will be respected.\nNot many women could be seen at Kabul airport on Monday where crowds thronged the tarmac of the runway in a desperate bid to get out of the country.\nOn Monday, Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai - who was shot aged 15 by the Taliban for campaigning for girls' education in Pakistan - expressed concern about the situation for and the safety of women and girls in the country.\n\"I had the opportunity to talk to a few activists in Afghanistan, including women's rights activists and they are sharing their concern that they are not sure what their life is going to be like,\" she told the BBC. \n\"A lot of them remember what was happening in 1996-2001 time and they are deeply worried about their safety, their rights their protection, they are worried about their access to school. \n\"And we have already seen news reports that many girls have been sent back from university. A lot of them have been asked to get married at age 15, 12.\"\nTaliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen says the group will respect the rights of women and minorities \"as per Afghan norms and Islamic values\".\nOn Tuesday, the group declared an amnesty across Afghanistan and said it wanted women to join its government.\nIndeed, some women have chosen to stay.\nPayvand Seyed Ali currently works as an education consultant in Kabul, where she has lived and worked for 10 years. She was senior adviser to the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan, and also led the UK government's largest education fund in Afghanistan, the GEC.\n\"I don't think it's useful to wonder or have expectations of what the Taliban will do when it comes to women's rights and education.  We have to work with what we have, and what we have include high-level Taliban promises that women will have access to education, and work. \n\"What makes sense is to treat these promises not as 'conciliatory noises', but as commitments, and work actively with Taliban leadership to craft solutions that keep girls in school and women working,\" she told the BBC News website. \nShe says accountability will be key: \"The ministry of education budget, including all staff salaries, is almost entirely donor-funded,  including a large portion facilitated and monitored by the World Bank. The objectives remain, the indicators remain, the accountability measures remain, and we should work with any new government towards compromises to meet development goals, and to keep our kids - all our kids - in school.\n\"So far, it seems that most, though not all, girls' schools  have remained open or are reopening, albeit with personnel changes and high absenteeism. District and provincial staff for the most part continue to work. \n\"In more rural areas, I have reliable reports that the largest NGO in the country, the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan, has reopened or kept open almost all of its girls' schools. So have most other leading NGOs supporting education in government and community schools. Many of these community schools have had some Taliban engagement since inception. Most have insisted on female or mullah teachers for years.\"\nShe will stay in Kabul and says women around her are still mostly at home, but cautiously planning visits and outings in the coming days.\nActivist Pashtana Durrani says that people must be wary.\n\"For starters, you have to understand that what they say and what they are putting in practice, they are two different things,\" she told the BBC on Monday.\n\"Girls in Herat, they were not able to go to their universities; girls in Kandahar, they were asked to go to their home and their male relatives were asked to fill in... their positions in the bank.\n\"So... they [the Taliban] are looking for legitimacy from all these different countries, to be accepted as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, but then at the same time, what are they doing in practice?\n\"Either a) they don't have control on their foot soldiers, or b) they really want the legitimacy but they're not willing to do the work. Those are two different things.\"\nMs Durrani also points out that when the Taliban talk about women's rights, they talk about them in vague terms: do they mean mobility rights, socialising rights, political rights, their representative rights and/or voting rights? It is not clear whether they mean all or only some of those rights, she says.\nAfghanistan's women and girls must now wait to see how life pans out under Taliban rule, as fears and uncertainties remain while there is no government in charge."

      "title": "Afghan chaos undercuts Biden's promise of competence",
      "tags": "Taliban,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "There's a quote in To Kill A Mockingbird where Jem is told by Miss Maudie that \"things are never as bad as they seem.\" For Joe Biden, right now, things do look pretty dark. \nBut if I'm digging into my quotations book, who can better Kipling's If - and that line about treating triumph and failure as the impostors that they are? Politicians have been told down the ages that there is no coming back from this or that catastrophe, and - yet - back they come. \nThe shambolic unravelling of America's withdrawal from Afghanistan comes from a yet to be written textbook of \"how to lose at everything\". Warnings hadn't been heeded, intelligence was clearly totally inadequate, planning was lamentable, execution woeful. \nLet's just focus in on one thing - although there are any number that are worthy of examination. \nThe withdrawal came during the \"fighting season\" - a phrase I have to say I have always found rather odd. But in Afghanistan there is a fighting season which starts in spring - and then in winter, when the country freezes over, there is a time when the Taliban go home to their tribal homelands. Did no-one think that it might have been better to have ordered the withdrawal for the dead of winter when Taliban forces weren't there, poised to fill the vacuum? \nThe end result might have been the same - a Taliban takeover - but it would have almost certainly led to a more orderly drawdown. Yet the Biden administration wanted an eye-catching date. They wanted the withdrawal completed by 11 September. Twenty years on from 9/11 - an artificial, self-imposed deadline. \nOne more quote. After the catastrophic Bay of Pigs invasion, when Cuban emigres backed by the CIA tried to overthrow Fidel Castro, John F Kennedy - the president at the time of that debacle - noted sorrowfully that victory has a hundred fathers, but failure is an orphan.\nJoe Biden is an orphan right now. And that could have consequences for his presidency; and far more importantly how the rest of the world sees America. \nBiden's election campaign could be boiled down to three messages to distinguish himself from Donald Trump. First, he would be more empathetic. He would be more competent. And instead of \"America First\", it would be replaced by the mantra \"America is back\". \nBut in his address yesterday, there wasn't a whole lot of empathy towards the thousands of Afghans who've helped Americans these past 20 years. On competence, even his biggest cheerleaders would struggle to say the withdrawal of American troops has been anything other than shambolic. \nAnd after the bewildering events of the past few days, how exactly is America back? Many see what has unfolded on President Biden's watch in Afghanistan as a linear continuation of Donald Trump's America First policies - and, as some have joked cruelly, not as well organised. \nThat is potentially deeply damaging.\nBut on the policy itself, Joe Biden is utterly defiant. He summoned up his inner Harry Truman and made clear in his speech that the buck stops with him. He was, however, happy to distribute blame in much the same way that a muck spreader disperses manure in all directions. The Afghan leadership weren't up to it, the Afghan armed forces had no fight in them; Donald Trump had negotiated a bad deal. \nThere can be an endearing chirpiness to Joe Biden, but there's also a chippiness. He doesn't like being questioned, and on many foreign policy questions he is convinced of his own rightness. \nJoe Biden has never been a \"liberal interventionist\", thinking that liberal democracy is something that can be shipped out of Baltimore Harbour in 40ft containers and exported around the world. He thinks the US military should only be overseas to defend vital US interests. And with al-Qaeda largely beaten, Osama Bin Laden dead, it was job done. Time to come home.\nThat is a view, I should add, shared by millions of Americans. But approving of the policy is very different from the dysfunctional implementation. And what if terror groups, feeling emboldened by the Taliban victory, decide to launch their own attacks on Americans abroad - or Americans at home? Then it could be politically catastrophic. \nWhich brings us to how Western leaders see America now. A fascinating nugget from a briefing that's just been given by Joe Biden's National Security Adviser. Since the fall of Kabul, Jake Sullivan revealed, Biden hadn't spoken to another world leader. Wasn't that just a bit surprising, given that there were a lot of other nations - including Britain - who'd committed vast resources to Afghanistan? Following Sullivan's briefing, the White House announced that Biden had spoken with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\nWhen the G7 gathered in Cornwall and the Nato nations met in Brussels the sense of relief was palpable among the prime ministers and presidents that a more outward looking American president was in charge. But given what has unfolded - how America has been humiliated, how Joe Biden embarked on a policy he was cautioned against by these leaders - there is now a good deal more wariness.\nAnd who will feel they have gained most from America's departure - apart from the Taliban, of course? Why, three countries near Afghanistan - Russia, Iran and China. I'm not sure that is what Joe Biden had in mind when he said after his inauguration that \"America is back\". "

      "text": "A summer surge in house price growth outside London has been revealed in official figures, but some analysts expect the market to start to cool.\nUK property prices rose by 13.2% in the year to the end of June, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said - the fastest rise for 17 years\nPrices were typically \u00a331,000 higher than at the same time last year. \nThis increase was driven by the North West and North East of England, as well as Wales, Yorkshire and the Humber.\nThe price of the average UK home was \u00a3266,000, the ONS said.\nMark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: \"Once again the North West leads the charge, while London property prices lag.\n\"This reinforces what we have been seeing for some time - the race for space means buyers' money is going further outside the capital, inevitably pushing up prices.\"\nThe latest ONS and Land Registry figures show that house prices rose fastest over the last year in the North West of England, up by 18.6%.\nThis was followed by big increases in Wales (16.7%), in Yorkshire and the Humber (15.8%) and the North East of England (15.3%).\nThe slowest price rises were seen in London, which recorded a 6.3% rise compared with a year earlier.\nThe figures cover the period to the end of June. This is the point at which stamp duty holidays became less generous in England and Wales, and many thousands of deals were rushed through to beat the deadline.\nThe tax break led to significant movement at the top end of the market. More recent data suggest some of the heat has come out of the market for more expensive detached homes since the end of June.\nHowever, Land Registry data show that there was also demand, and rapidly rising prices, among semi-detached and terraced homes.\nIn some cases, buyers would have benefited from lower stamp duty levies, but there was also a lifestyle choice involved for some amid the pandemic.\nIn areas where relatively few properties were on the market, failing to match demand, prices continued to grow. These included some coastal and rural locations.\nMortgage rates are also at historically low levels. That means buyers in a position to put down a significant deposit have to pay very little interest on home loans.\nKate Allen, owner at lettings firm Salcombe Finest, in Devon, said: \"This overheated market continues to cook and it looks like we've got a property heatwave forecast for the rest of the year.\"\nOthers suggest that any slower than expected return to normality for the economy, a resulting pressure on jobs, and the end of tax breaks could cool the market in many areas.\n\"As for later this year and early next, the expectation is that while we won't necessarily see prices fall, a period of zero or negligible house price growth is most likely,\" said Scott Taylor-Barr, of Shropshire-based mortgage broker, Carl Summers Financial Services."

      "tags": "R. Kelly,Music",
      "text": "The trial of the US R&B singer R. Kelly has begun at a court in Brooklyn, New York.\nThe star is accused of racketeering, sexual abuse and bribery; charges which he has repeatedly denied.\nSome of the allegations made against the singer - whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly - date back more than 20 years.\nIf he is convicted on all counts he could be sentenced to several decades in prison.\nThe first witness, Jerhonda Johnson Pace, told the jury R. Kelly knew she was underage in 2009 when they had intercourse in Chicago, where the age of consent is 17.\nNow 28, she testified that she had initially told Mr Kelly she was 19, but had revealed her real age on the day they had sex for the first time.\n\"I felt uncomfortable. I felt like it wasn't right, that I should tell him my age.\n\"He asked me, 'What is that supposed to mean?' and told me to tell everyone I was 19 - and to act 21,\" said Ms Pace, who admits she had once been a fan of the singer.\nMr Kelly faces charges that he was the ringleader of a two-decade-long scheme where he recruited women and underage girls for sex.\nIn her opening argument, Mr Kelly's lawyer Nicole Blank Becker claimed the alleged victims are aggrieved groupies, who originally consented to sex before later becoming \"spiteful\".\n\"He didn't recruit them. They were fans. They came to Mr Kelly,\" she told the court, adding that some of the relationships were \"beautiful\" and \"long-term\".\nMs Becker portrayed her client as a victim of women, saying some enjoyed the \"notoriety of being able to tell their friends that they were with a superstar\".\nProsecutors meanwhile described Mr Kelly as \"a man who used lies, manipulation, threats and physical abuse to dominate his victims and to avoid accountability for years\".\n\"This case is about a predator,\" Assistant US Attorney Maria Melendez said in her opening statement. \n\"This case is not about a celebrity who likes to party a lot.\"\nThe Grammy-winning artist - wearing a grey suit, purple tie, and glasses - sat silently, his head down at times as the prosecution opened its case.\nMs Melendez said Mr Kelly's celebrity status meant he \"had his pick of young fans\" and that he hoarded his victims \"like objects\" and used \"every trick in the predator handbook\".\nMs Melendez alleged the singer used bodyguards, drivers, lawyers and accountants to cover up his alleged crimes.\nShe also said he bribed victims by photographing and filming them having sex and then threatening to release the tapes.\nMr Kelly is accused of requiring victims to demonstrate \"absolute commitment\" and obey strict rules, including that they eat or go to the bathroom only with his permission, not look at other men, and call him \"Daddy\".\nThe trial, delayed several times by the pandemic and predicted to last about one month, is expected to include testimony from some female accusers and at least one male accuser.\nEven if he is acquitted, Mr Kelly still faces sex-related charges in Illinois and Minnesota, where he has also pleaded not guilty.\nMr Kelly has been in jail for the last two years. He was moved in June to Brooklyn from Chicago for the trial.\nThe singer is best known for hits including Ignition (Remix), I Believe I Can Fly, Bump n' Grind and If I Could Turn Back the Hands of Time.\nOn her way into the court, BBC producer Monica Miller reported seeing supporters of the singer shouting \"Free R. Kelly\"."

      "text": "Colleges and sixth forms in England need an extra \u00a3570m to keep pace with the rising number of students, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).\nThe rise in numbers of older teenagers, and higher GCSE grades, is set to push up college numbers.\nThe IFS says funding for 16-to-18 learning fell in real terms by 11% in colleges and 25% in schools since 2010.\nThe government says it has announced an extra \u00a3291m for 2021-22 in addition to a \u00a3400m increase in the previous year.  \nThe IFS research says further education colleges and sixth forms in England have seen the largest falls in funding in the education sector over the past decade.\nImran Tahir, research economist and co-author, said: \"These institutions now also face a plethora of additional challenges created by fast rises in student numbers and the need to help pupils catch up on lost learning.\"\nThe government gave the sector an extra \u00a3400m in 2020-21, a sum it described as \"the single biggest annual uplift since 2010\".\nBut the IFS says with student numbers growing by 5% in 2020 alone, this restores funding back to 2018-19 levels, at best.\nThe IFS calculates that an extra \u00a3570m will be needed in the 2022-23 academic year, just to keep funding per student at the level it was the previous year.  \nColleges and sixth forms will need even more money if they are to respond to the major long-term challenges they face, it says.\nThese include helping students catch up on months of learning lost during the pandemic, and a projected rise in the number of 16 and 17-year-olds of 17% or 200,000 in England between 2019 and 2024. \nThe researchers point out that the rate of 16 and 17-year-olds in full-time education had already risen to an historical high of 85% in 2020. \nThis includes especially large rises in 2020 due to \"abnormally\" high GCSE results and reduced opportunities outside education during the pandemic, they say. \nGiven that GCSE results were higher again in 2021, the researchers suggest there is likely to be a further jump in students.\nAt the same time, the number of 16 and 17-year-olds doing apprenticeships fell to an all-time low of 3% in 2020 - with a 30% fall in numbers in 2020 alone. This reflects both the effects of the pandemic and a gradual reduction in take-up over the long term, according to the research.\nThe chief executive of the Association of Colleges, David Hughes, said: \"There is an urgent need for the Department for Education to guarantee full funding for every student recruited by schools and colleges this autumn, much the same way they do for universities as well as seek a commitment in the Spending Review to a longer-term revenue and capital budget that anticipates demographic trends.\"\nA Department for Education spokesman said:\"Further education is playing a vital role in delivering the skills young people need to get ahead. So we can meet the needs of all 16-19-year-olds we've announced an extra \u00a3291m for 2021-22, in addition to the \u00a3400m increase in 2020-21. \n\"Funding for future years beyond 2021-22, including anticipated increases in the 16-19 population will be considered as part of the upcoming Spending Review.\""

Their tests will be funded by the government as they are ineligible for vaccination, unless they are five or older and are considered are at significant risk from Covid-19.\nThe approximately one million residents - about 11% of the population - who have not been vaccinated despite being eligible must pay for their own tests.\nIsrael has also begun giving third doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to people over 50, medical workers and those with underlying health conditions. \nSo far, some 1.1 million eligible people have received their booster shots.\nIsraeli healthcare provider Maccabi, which covers about a quarter of the population, reported on Wednesday that a third Pfizer dose was 86% effective at preventing Covid-19 infection in people over 60.\nMr Zarka also noted that no-one who was currently in a critical condition in hospital had received a booster shot."

      "text": "Women and girls and persecuted minorities will make up the bulk of the Afghan refugees resettled in the UK, the home secretary has said.\nWhile the Taliban said women's rights will be respected, Priti Patel told the BBC it was hard to believe \"the PR operation that we're currently seeing\".\nThe UK government will work with other nations and pledged to resettle 5,000 Afghans in the UK in the first year.\nHowever, some MPs have criticised the scheme for not going far enough.\nThousands of Afghans have been trying to flee the country after the Taliban seized control of the capital Kabul.\nThe government has committed to resettling up to 20,000 Afghan refugees in the UK in the long term - and Ms Patel said she wanted the majority of those to be women and girls and persecuted minorities. \nThe Taliban have promised the rights of women in Afghanistan will be respected \"within the framework of Islamic law\".\nBut the home secretary said the group had a history of oppressing women and \"that's not going to change overnight\".\n\"I genuinely do not think that we should be at all believing the spokespeople or the PR operation that we're currently seeing,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. \nAppearing on BBC Breakfast, Ms Patel refused to give a timescale for how long it would take for the 20,000 Afghans to be brought to the UK. \nHowever, she compared the new scheme to one introduced for Syrian refugees, which saw a similar number of people resettled over a period of seven years. \n\"We could end up bringing many more [than 20,000] but first of all we have to have the underpinning and the infrastructure and the support to do that,\" she said. \nShe said a target of 5,000 in the first year was \"deliverable\", adding: \"It would be terrible quite frankly to bring people and not be able to give them the support that they would need in terms of accommodation, resettlement and giving them the opportunity to build a new life in the UK.\"\nDowning Street also said the 5,000 figure was \"not a hard cap\" but based on expectations of how many people would be able to leave over that time period. \nAsked how the UK would get vulnerable people, who may not feel safe leaving their homes, out of Afghanistan, Ms Patel said ministers would work with third party agencies, humanitarian organisations and other governments, including the US and Canada. \nShe added that people could also be resettled from neighbouring countries, as well as Afghanistan itself. \nMeanwhile, Parliament has been recalled and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been updating MPs about the situation in Afghanistan.\nHe said the government would be doing everything it can to support those who have helped the UK mission in Afghanistan and to \"avert a humanitarian crisis\". \nMinisters have been rushing to put this scheme together in response to the situation in Afghanistan, with the final details signed off on Tuesday.\nInformation on how to apply is expected soon. \nThe scheme is loosely based on the one introduced during the Syrian war, which also saw 20,000 move to the UK from 2014 to 2021.\nBut ministers acknowledge the practicalities of getting people out of Afghanistan will be considerably more complicated because of the extent of Taliban control. \nGovernment insiders don't know the extent to which the new regime will allow people to flee if they so choose. \nThere will be funding for the resettlement programme - and the government will work with local councils and devolved governments on where to house Afghans who come to the UK.\nThe scheme has faced criticism from opposition parties and some Conservative MPs. \nTory MP Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Defence Select Committee, told the Daily Mirror it was a \"woefully inadequate response\", citing the government only aiming to help 5,000 refugees in the first year when \"the threat is at its greatest\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the target of resettling 20,000 Afghans was \"too small\" and had been \"plucked out of the air\". \nLib Dems foreign affairs spokeswoman Layla Moran agreed that \"20,000 should be the starting point of this scheme, not the target\".\nRefugee charities welcomed the announcement as a positive first step but said the timeframe was too slow and eligibility for asylum should be expanded. \nAmong those hoping they might get help to leave Afghanistan through the scheme is a former teacher in Kandahar. \nThe 21-year-old woman - who the BBC is not naming to protect her safety - fled for Kabul after the Taliban captured Kandahar but said she was now too afraid to leave the house. \n\"I was working with an educational organisation - the Taliban, they do not accept these things,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \n\"Now I do not feel safe at all... I'm just like a prisoner in the house now.\"\nShe said Afghans needed help to escape now - and if she had to wait years for help it may be too late. \n\"We are in the situation that we cannot guarantee our lives for tomorrow,\" she said. \n\"Will I be alive tomorrow? We cannot guarantee that.\"\nThe new plan is on top of an existing scheme for interpreters and other Afghans who have worked for the UK government - the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP). \nSome 5,000 Afghans and their family members will come to the UK via that scheme this year. Nearly 2,000 have arrived since 22 June.\nThe UK has already sent about 900 troops to Afghanistan to help evacuate British nationals and Afghans who are eligible to resettle in the UK.\nChief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nick Carter said seven more planes were being sent to Kabul and the UK hoped to fly out 1,000 more people on Wednesday. \nHe told the BBC that British forces were collaborating with the Taliban, who were providing security around Kabul's airport. \nSir Nick said the Taliban seemed prepared to allow people to leave the country at the moment but \"we need to be clear that this is only possible if they behave in a reasonable fashion\".

Restaurants, cafes, museums, libraries, gyms and pools are among the venues that will be covered by the Green Pass, which previously only applied to children aged 12 and over.\nThe UK recorded 33,904 new positive cases on Wednesday and a further 111 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test.

The pandemic has causes significant disruption to childrens' education - with formal exams cancelled for the past two years running. But if public health conditions do not allow for exams, pupils will get grades from teachers' judgements based on normal in-year assessment.\nThe House of Commons has been full for the first time since the start of the pandemic last March as MPs returned on Wednesday.

And some have waited more than a month for a visa appointment. \nSpanish authorities said time was needed for universities and students to adapt to the new system.\nThey said student visa are a priority for all Spanish Consulates.\nBut, Universities UK International has written to the Spanish embassy and the Foreign Office, asking if students can apply in Spain. \nA UK government spokesperson said visa applications were a matter for Spanish immigration authorities, but added it had raised the issue with the Spanish government.\nElla Perret is due to travel to Madrid next week to spend a year there as part of her law degree. \nBut she says: \"I haven't booked a flight or accommodation because I don't know if I'm going.\"\nLike most students, Ms Perret began the process in June, as the visa documents have to be issued within 90 days of departure. \nNow the UK is no longer in the European Union, students wanting to study in Spain have to compile a dossier of documents, including:\nDocuments have to be translated and go through a legal process called a Hague apostille to verify them for international use. \nMs Perret says it has cost hundreds of pounds but she feels no nearer to her dream of studying in Spain. \n\"So many times I've been tempted to just say I'm not going,\" she says.\nSam Downes, an economics student with a place to study in Granada, southern Spain, has heard nothing since he asked for an appointment in June. \n\"I paid September's rent for my accommodation and my deposit - but it's looking unlikely that I'll be going in time,\" he says. \nThe university in Granada has said it cannot offer Mr Downes online learning if he does not arrive in time. \n\"So in the next week or two I might have to decide whether to cancel the whole year abroad,\" he says.\nAfter weeks of sending emails, with no replies, some students have been turning up at the consulate in London and queuing for hours in the hope of securing a firm appointment. \nAmong them this week was Laurie, who did not want to give his surname because he was worried it might affect his visa application. \nHe has a flight and accommodation in Spain booked from 6 September but does not yet know if he will have a visa in time to travel. \nLaurie took last year out so he could work and save up for his year studying abroad.\nBut the process has been exhausting and frustrating. \n\"Jumping through all these hoops is difficult and annoying enough but to not get a response from the consulate is dreadful,\" Laurie says.\nAfter speaking to staff at the Spanish consulate, he is hoping to receive email confirmation of a visa appointment soon. \nVivienne Stern, of Universities UK, said: \"Delays in visa processing this year are causing real anxiety among students who are due to travel to Spain soon.\"\nShe has written to the Spanish embassy and the Foreign Office asking them to work together to resolve the issue. \nOne temporary solution her letter proposed would allow students to travel on a tourist visa for the start of term and submit their paperwork in Spain. \nA spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Spain said: \"This is the first academic year that student visas are needed after Brexit; therefore, British students and universities need to get used to the new regulation and the necessity of applying for a visa, and some adaptation time is still needed. \n\"All Spanish Consulates are offering all the facilities in order to speed up the visa procedures.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Employment,UK economy,Pay",
      "text": "The bosses of Britain's biggest companies earned 86 times the average full-time wage last year.\nThe median pay of a chief executive of a FTSE-100 firm - the UK's blue chip company index - was \u00a32.69m in 2020, according to the High Pay Centre.\nThat was down 17% from \u00a33.25m in 2019, before the pandemic hit.\n\"These are still very generous rewards,\" said High Pay Centre director Luke Hildyard.\nThe think tank's research revealed average bonus size fell from \u00a31.1m in 2019 to \u00a3828,000 last year. \nMeanwhile the average long term incentive plan payment fell from \u00a32.4m to \u00a31.38m.\n\"CEO pay packages are designed to reflect the experience of shareholders, employees and other stakeholders so in one sense the lower pay levels this year show the system working as intended,\" Mr Hildyard said.\nBut he pointed out that most chief executives have already made millions of pounds over the course of their careers and the still high rewards come \"at a time when, in general, government support for the economy has probably been more important to the survival and success of the UK's biggest companies than the decisions of their executives.\"\nThe research also showed that average chief executive earnings at the nine FTSE-100 companies that used the furlough scheme to pay their employees, was \u00a32.39m.\nMr Hildyard said the UK's high chief executive pay reflected a wider gap between rich and poor in Britain than in most other European countries.\nPascal Soriot of drugs giant AstraZeneca was the highest-earning chief executive, making \u00a315.45m last year.\nHe was considerably ahead of Brian Cassin of credit reference agency Experian who made \u00a310.3m, according to the think tank's figures.\nIn third spot was Albert Manifold of building materials company CRH who received \u00a39.92m.\nLaxman Narasimhan of consumer goods firm Reckitt Benckiser was fourth with \u00a39.24m, while the fifth highest-paid FTSE boss in 2020 was Rob Perrins of housebuilder Berkeley, who made \u00a38.03m.\nChief executive pay has fallen when their roles have never been more valuable, reckons Matthew Lesh, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute.\n\"Amid a historic global crisis the captains of industry have played a key role in keeping us fed, entertained and connected,\" he said.\nGenerous compensation is necessary to attract top talent that delivers innovative products, creates jobs and boosts company value, Mr Lesh added. \n\"Investors are known to react viciously to changing CEOs because leadership is key to business success.\"\nHe said that rather than obsessing about chief executive pay, \"we should embrace policies that will boost pay for all workers as the economy recovers from Covid-19. \n\"This means cutting taxes and red tape that holds down incomes.\"\nQuite apart from the reminder of the huge gap that has, over the years, opened up between the best-paid employees and the average - with chief executives on 86 times as much as the average worker - the High Pay Centre think tank's analysis is also a reminder of the weakness of the premise on which exorbitant bonuses and long-term incentive plans are based. \nThis is namely that the key determinant of a company's success is the shareholder value it generates. In addition, it is the notion that the key determinant of that is a talented top boss who must be attracted, retained and incentivised to do their best by the offer of big money. \nIt wasn't Pascal Soriot, the highest paid chief executive of a FTSE-listed company (pay: \u00a315.45m), who led the team that came up with AstraZeneca's vaccine. That was Sarah Gilbert and Andrew Pollard of Oxford University. But the reason shareholders won't begrudge him it isn't because of what it did to AstraZeneca's profits. \nIn fact, by offering to distribute it at no profit (unlike Pfizer), AstraZeneca's losses due to the vaccine in the first half of 2021 were more than $50m. \nBut what it's done for the firm's reputation - and the benefit to public health - are incalculable. It's not just the bottom line that counts."

      "text": "A group which represents 200,000 Army veterans who served in Northern Ireland says it fully supports the government's controversial Troubles legacy plan.\nRepresentatives of the Northern Ireland Veterans Movement (NIVM) held hour-long talks in London with Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis.\nThe government plans to end all investigations and prosecutions related to the Troubles. \nThe plan is opposed by NI political parties and victims organisations. \nSome other military veterans have also criticised it.\nIf implemented, the law would apply to former members of the security forces and to ex-paramilitaries.\nThe plans also include an end to all legacy inquests and civil actions related to the conflict.\nThe NIVM said after the meeting it would bring its \"full strength to bear\" in support of the proposals.\nFollowing the meeting, Robin Horsfall NIVM said the group believed the proposals \"offer a way forward for those who served in Northern Ireland\".\nHe said the group was \"sensitive to the feelings of the innocent victims of terrorism and the hurt that a statute of limitations will cause them\", but believed \"the simple and painful truth is that no terrorists will ever be convicted\".\n\"That battle was lost with the Good Friday Agreement,\" he added.\nThe proposals are seen as a way in which the government is honouring a 2019 Conservative election manifesto pledge to protect veterans from Troubles investigations.\nMr Horsfall said: \"We hope to get to a situation where veterans are left alone to live the last years of their lives in relative peace without being pursued for political reasons.\"\nHe said NIVM would scrutinise every detail of the proposed bill and consult and lobby MPs from all parties to support the proposed legislation.\nAnother NIVM spokesman, Paul Young, said: \"This fulfils promises made by the government \u2026this is the way forward.\"\nIt is the latest meeting in a series of discussions the government is having about the controversial proposals.\nAnother military veterans group has criticised the government proposals.\nSpeaking to BBC News NI, Ian Simpson from the Northern Ireland Veterans Association, said he did not support an equivalence between the paramilitary groups and military veterans. \n\"You can't do away with prosecutions and if you haven't broken the law, you have nothing the fear from the law, but this brings an amnesty to terrorists,\" he said. \n\"You cannot equate veterans and terrorists in the same sentence.\"\nSpeaking after the proposals were announced in July, Mr Lewis said it was \"the best way to help Northern Ireland move further along the road to reconciliation\".\n\"We know that the prospect of the end of criminal prosecutions will be difficult for some to accept, and this is not a position that we take lightly,\" he said. \nMr Lewis said the proposals also included a body to help families recover information on Troubles incidents and an oral history initiative.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the legacy proposals would allow Northern Ireland to \"draw a line under the Troubles.\""

      "text": "Afghans are going back to work and there are more cars on the streets, but people's behaviour is starting to change in Kabul two days after the Taliban takeover. \nLast night, a group of 28 Taliban men came into my hotel, armed with guns, and asked for food. The staff were nervous.\n\"Look. We need to secure this place,\" the hotel's security manager said. \"Anybody could come with a gun and claim to be a Taliban, it could be a looter or a thief. So, why don't you just let us know who's with you, so we know who's Taliban and who is not. You know better than us.\" \nOf course, all the men got fed. Later on I tried to order something from room service, but the staff said the Taliban had finished it all.\nA couple of days ago, they were the enemy. There were uniformed guards in and around the hotel who were supposed to protect us from the Taliban. \nNow the Taliban are here: standing outside with guns, opening the doors of cars.\nFrom what I can see, the male staff at the hotel haven't shaved in the last three days. And all the female staff have gone. At the reception, room service, the cleaners - women are no longer here.\nThe background music at the hotel has also stopped. I asked one of the staff, who replied: \"Friends are here, so no more music.\"\nIt's much busier in the city than yesterday. There is much more traffic, a few more shops are open, and people are doing their usual jobs. \nThere have been no reports of violence in the city - no sound of gunfire or helicopters. I can hear a few military jets flying high over the city.\nI can see the Taliban presence has increased. Fighters have come from different areas of Afghanistan, the majority of them from Logar province south of the capital. They say they are here to keep order.\nThe ones I have seen are behaving nicely with people. Sometimes they even ask if you are alright, or if you need help with anything. \nI spoke with two street vendors in the centre on Tuesday. As poor Afghans, they said it didn't make any difference to them whether it was the Taliban or Americans in charge.\nAn unverified Facebook video went viral on Tuesday, showing women with heads covered protesting on a street in the city. They have placards in their hands, demanding a share in politics, education, human rights, and to be treated like equal citizens. I haven't heard any reports that they were arrested."

      "text": "Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry says his country is \"on its knees\" after more than 2,000 people were killed in Saturday's powerful earthquake.\nMr Henry said Haiti was \"physically and mentally devastated\".\nMore than 12,000 people have been left injured and 332 are still missing after the 7.2-magnitude quake.\nThere were further tremors late on Wednesday causing many to rush from their places of shelter into the streets.\nHaitian officials estimate there are 600,000 people in need of emergency assistance. The delivery of aid has been further hampered by heavy rains brought this week by Tropical Storm Grace.\nThe UN Children's Fund (Unicef) says about 500,000 children have limited or no access to shelter, safe water and food.\nUnicef also warned that many schools had been destroyed three weeks before they were due to reopen. Children have been out of school for months at a time because of the Covid pandemic combined with security challenges.\n\"It is so crucial for children who have just gone through this traumatic earthquake-plus-extreme weather experience, to have the normalcy and stability of being in a classroom with their friends and teachers,\" Unicef Haiti representative Bruno Maes said.\nAnger is growing in many remote areas, where aid has yet to arrive.\n\"There were a lot of mudslides in the mountains that injured and killed a lot of people. Some are missing and we don't have the means to go find them,\" a resident of the Maniche area told Agence France Press news agency. \nUS aid agency USAID said many roads remained impassable. \nAid agencies and rescue workers are also having to contend with armed gangs who have attacked convoys travelling to the worst-hit areas. \nBut the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Tuesday that following negotiations, the gangs had agreed to let aid through. \nIn the city of Les Cayes, one of the areas worst affected by the quake, many survivors are sleeping in make-shift tents on the city's football field. \nThe earthquake compounds problems facing the impoverished nation, which is already reeling from a political crisis following the assassination of its president last month. \nHaiti has been hit by a series of natural disasters in the past, including Hurricane Matthew in 2016.\nThe deadliest was the 2010 earthquake which killed more than 200,000 people and caused extensive damage to the country's infrastructure and economy."

      "text": "Trials of shared banking hubs in two communities where all the branches have closed down are to be extended.\nThe premises, managed by the Post Office, include counter services, ATMs and, crucially, the opportunity for local businesses to deposit cash.\nThe trials, in Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, and Rochford, Essex, were due to finish in October, but have been extended to April 2023.\nThe government is consulting on plans to protect community banking services.\nThe trials allow a member of staff from a different bank to come into the hub once a week to help with trickier transactions.\nThroughout the week, the counter service and machines allow individuals and small business owners to access accounts, and to withdraw and deposit notes and coins.\nShortly after the service opened in Rochford, the BBC was told it had been \"a lifeline\" for people living in the area.\n\"One lady came in to say 'thank you, you have changed my life', and that's not an understatement,\" said Richard Fleetwood, postmaster at the Rochford Bank Hub - a converted carpet shop.\nAn estimated 12,000 people have used the hubs for basic banking needs.\n\"It is really clear that the hubs have been hugely popular and it would be a bad decision to close them. The banks have therefore taken the view that they want to keep them open, and keep innovating in them so we can refine the model further,\" said Natalie Ceeney, who oversees the trials.\nThe trials are part of a wider project aiming to test ways to ensure people and businesses have access to cash. It also addresses the issue of bank branch closures, which are showing signs of accelerating as the UK emerges from the Covid crisis.\nAnother element of the project to be extended is the prevalence of cashback without having to make a purchase in local stores. So far, an average of \u00a328 has been withdrawn from tills, with shoppers often taking out non-round amounts unavailable from ATMs.\nHundreds more shops should be offering the service by early next year.\nBanks are in discussion over many of these projects, including shared hubs, as the government plans to legislate on access to community banking as bank branches close.\nIn their proposals, ministers said that people should not have to travel beyond a reasonable distance to withdraw or deposit money, even if they are in low population areas.\nInitially, the Treasury suggests that people should not have to travel more than 1km, but that distance could be extended over time if cash becomes less popular. The distance proposal is open to views during consultation.\nOther considerations include whether the facilities are appropriate for vulnerable people, are accessible for people with disabilities, have adequate opening hours, and are suitably secure for high-value cash deposits."

      "tags": "Companies,Competition and Markets Authority,Coronavirus testing,Travel & leisure industry",
      "text": "The Competition and Markets Authority has told the BBC it warned government officials that consumers could face risks from the fast-growing Covid PCR testing industry in April and May. \nThe business and competition regulator said it provided advice and market analysis to officials from the Department of Health and Social Care. \nIt said the advice detailed potential market and consumer risks. \nIt comes after the CMA was criticised by its former chairman this week. \nLord Tyrie told the BBC that the situation with PCR testing for travel was a 'predictable Covid rip-off', and that the competitions watchdog hadn't done enough. \nThe government has said it was provided with some general market analysis from the CMA on the potential implications for the PCR testing market and that its advice informed the government's approach on the private provider list. \nThe CMA said it cannot disclose this information. \nThe revelation comes after a summer of complaints from travellers and holidaymakers who have taken a holiday or visited family who they've been cut off from because of the pandemic. \nThe UK government has made it a condition of any international travel that tests before travel, and on your arrival in the UK are mandatory.\nThe number of tests that are needed is dependent on your arrival from either a green or amber country or your vaccination status. Arrivals from red countries must still use quarantine hotel facilities. \nSome of the most common complaints from travellers mention tests listed on the government's list of providers that don't exist at the price advertised whilst others allege poor service.\nAt the start of August, the Health Secretary asked the competition watchdog to investigate \"excessive\" pricing and \"exploitative practices\" among PCR Covid test firms.\nIn a letter to the CMA, Sajid Javid said it was time for a \"rapid high-level\" review to protect consumers.\nThe BBC understands that a full CMA market study or investigation would require a formal consultation before an investigation could be launched and these investigations typically last between 6 and 18 months. Therefore, a wholesale reform of the market could be difficult because of time constraints. \nIt is understood that due to the time and process needed for a full review of the market, the Government was advised it is better placed to tackle immediate issues in this market.\nThe travel industry has been demanding action, after complaining about the 'onerous' level of testing in place, which they believe is a barrier to passenger revival. \nBut, given the lateness of any government intervention, and the impact on the travel sector, people in industry believe the damage has already been done. \nJulie Lo Bue Said, chief executive of Advantage Travel Partnership, the UK's largest group of independent leisure & business travel agent experts, said \"it feels like a PR exercise for the government to come out and say 'we're looking at this now'. \n\"It is far too late, when the public has had to pay for all these tests,\" she added. \nOn Friday, Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary announced that the price of PCR Covid tests provided by NHS Test & Trace for travel would fall, by \u00a320 for one test to \u00a368, and by \u00a335 for two tests to \u00a3138. \nThe Government has consistently maintained that testing for travellers is in place to protect public health.

      "text": "Twitter is introducing a way to report posts as \"misleading\" for the first time. \nMany of the large social media networks have been accused of not doing enough to fight the spread of disinformation during the Covid pandemic and US election campaigns.\nTwitter's reporting function has never offered a clear option for such posts. \nIt said the new feature was only a test, and will only be available in a few countries to begin with. \n\"Some people\" in Australia, South Korea, and the United States will now see an option for \"it's misleading\" when trying to report a tweet, the tech giant said.\nIt also warned users that the system may not have a significant effect.\n\"We're assessing if this is an effective approach so we're starting small,\" the company said on its safety account.\n\"We may not take action on and cannot respond to each report in the experiment, but your input will help us identify trends so that we can improve the speed and scale of our broader misinformation work.\" \nTwitter plans to eventually launch the feature in other countries around the world. \nCurrently, someone reporting misinformation must choose from options such as \"it's suspicious or spam\" or \"it's abusive or harmful\" - and then narrow that down to more specific sub-categories to make a report.  \nBecause the options are so specific, it can often be unclear which one to use.\nIf I had a penny for how many times people message me asking why there's no option to report misinformation on Twitter, I'd be a very rich woman. \nSince the start of the pandemic, pressure has mounted on social media sites to do more to combat a wave of harmful falsehoods that have spread online.  \nThat includes unfounded conspiracies about Covid-19 and vaccines, as well as surrounding last year's US election, which went on to inspire the riots at Capitol Hill and saw US President Donald Trump's account suspended.  \nI've spent the past year-and-a-half covering the real-world impact of misleading posts online - scaring people off Covid jabs, destroying relationships, and provoking violence.  \nSome critics argue that the option to report misinformation should have been introduced months ago to help prevent this offline harm. But the question remains - what impact will this really have? \nThere are fears that the social media site will struggle to moderate the avalanche of content reported - including from those promoting falsehoods, who then flag accurate information as misleading.  \nTwitter has focused on issuing suspensions and bans to accounts which consistently spread harmful Covid-19 misinformation when they come to the company's attention.\nIt also began putting warning labels on such tweets in early 2020, announced a collaboration with news organisations as part of an attempt to debunk false information, and started a pilot scheme in January to allow a small number of people to submit \"notes\" about misleading content. \nHowever, Twitter and other tech giants continue to be criticised for the spread of false information. \nChief executives have repeatedly appeared before US politicians to answer questions about their policies, while  groups such as the Center for Countering Digital Hate have accused them of not doing enough to combat vaccine misinformation - among other forms of harm."

      "text": "A woman who tried to take her own life after suffering post-natal depression says she was abandoned by NHS mental health services during the pandemic.\nKatie Yelland, 30, relied on family support to get her through the first lockdown after services were paused.\nIt comes as monthly mental health referrals across the UK hit their highest point in two years.\nCharities warned the surge was set to continue and called for action from the UK and devolved governments.\nThe UK government says it plans to expand and transform mental health services, backed by \u00a32.3bn a year by 2023-24.\nMs Yelland suffered from severe post-natal depression after her son was born in August 2019. \nJust weeks before the first national lockdown, she tried to take her own life. \nDescribing how her treatment stopped after lockdown was imposed, Ms Yelland said: \"Everything just kind of built up and caved in on me. Access to the services just wasn't there. \n\"I was just abandoned for a good number of weeks, while the new NHS system got into place.\n\"Once that system was finally in place, it was then an absolute minefield trying to use it and professionals didn't know how to use it.\n\"I was really isolated and I felt really concerned. I was really confused and became very reliant on my family.\n\"It opened their eyes to how much I was struggling. \n\"They've just seen me happy and bubbly. They hadn't seen the internal struggle that that was going on.\"\nPrior to the pandemic, Ms Yelland was seen weekly by a community psychiatric nurse and the perinatal mental health team.\nShe said: \"The care from the perinatal team just completely stopped. There was nothing, just here one day, gone the next, and with the community team there was nothing. I was left for a good number of weeks, with no help, just getting worse and worse.\"\nThe BBC Shared Data Unit analysed figures from 117 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG) in England, and health boards across Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. \nAround 300,000 people were referred to NHS mental health services in Great Britain in March this year, a rise of 18% from the total in February 2020, the month before the pandemic struck.  \nThe rise is driven by an increase in referrals across England.  Some CCGs, like Leeds, Redbridge and Greater Preston, have seen referrals more than double compared to pre-Covid levels.\nBut while referrals are rising, the number of people receiving mental health treatment remains lower than pre-pandemic levels.\nOver the same time period, our analysis found the number of people in contact with the service had dropped by around 67,000 - a fall of 9%.\nCharities have suggested a combination of social distancing restrictions and a move to online treatments has reduced capacity.\nTaylor Simmonds, 20, is autistic and suffers from severe OCD. \nLate last year he  referred himself to NHS community mental health services after his symptoms got out of control, but found 14 weeks of remote treatment didn't help.\n\"I think for some people, remote treatment really doesn't work, and it can make things worse. So having some kind of flexibility is important.\"\nSome parts of the country are treating many more people than pre-pandemic levels.\nThe biggest increase in England was in Blackpool, one of the UK's most deprived areas, where 4,095 adults were in contact with mental health services in March this year - 87% more than pre-pandemic levels.\nConcerns are also growing that a spike in urgent crisis referrals suggests people are entering the system more unwell than they would have been.\nMIND's head of health policy Geoff Heyes said: \"Had those people been able to get support earlier, be that through community mental health services, through talking therapies in their community, they may well have not got that unwell.\"\nCharities Rethink Mental Illness and SANE joined in calls for action.\nSANE chief executive Marjorie Wallace warned the leap in referral numbers could be the beginning of a mental health surge as people who were discouraged from seeking help come forward.\nRethink Mental Illness deputy chief executive Brian Dow said: \"If this increase in referrals is sustained, it has the potential to place the system under real pressure. \n\"We're already seeing signs of stretched services across the country, with people being sent miles away for care because there aren't beds locally.\"\nMr Dow said the charity had seen a \"huge surge\" in the number of people seeking support.\n\"We also saw a worrying increase in the number of people doing searches for things such as PTSD,\" he said.\n\"We know that, for example, lots of people in frontline healthcare delivery did experience very serious problems, and there seems to be an acute rise in the number of people experiencing PTSD.\"\nMeanwhile in the rest of the UK, referrals have yet to go beyond pre-pandemic levels.\nBut charities there have called for plans to be put in place before an expected surge emerges.\nScottish Association of Mental Health (SAMH) chief executive said:  \"We know in Scotland, the suicide rates at deaths by suicide had increased in the two years previous to the pandemic, and we're bracing ourselves for the figures that will be announced in August which will cover some of the pandemic period.\"\nKevin Stewart, the Minister for Mental Wellbeing and Social Care, said the government had already allocated \u00a329.2million to improve children and adolescent mental health services.\nA similar picture in Wales has prompted MIND Cymru to call on the Welsh Government to act.\nThere, the Cardiff and Vale University board has seen mental health referrals increase by 47% compared to pre-Covid levels, while the Powys Teaching board has seen increases of 23%.\n\"What's clear is that we're dealing with a significant amount of unmet need,\" said MIND Cymru senior policy and campaigns officer Glenn Page.\nA Welsh Government spokesperson said it had provided an additional \u00a342m this year for mental health support. \nIn Northern Ireland, all health boards have seen referral numbers tumble since the pandemic hit, with referrals still 29% less than pre-Covid levels by January this year.\nA spokeswoman for the UK government's Department for Health and Social Care said: \"As we look beyond the pandemic, we remain committed to expanding and transforming mental health services in England, backed by \u00a32.3bn a year by 2023-24.\"\nIf you need support with mental health or feelings of despair, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line.\nAdditional reporting: Vanessa Fillis\nThe Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.\nFor more information on methodology, click here.

      "text": "A movie buff has rescued more than 20,000 VHS tapes from landfill after travelling 300 miles to collect them.\nAndy Johnson, who runs what is said to be the UK's last video shop, drove from Liverpool to Dundee to pick up the mammoth haul.\nThe vast collection, which filled three lock-up garages, was amassed by George McInnes over decades from car boot sales.\nMr Johnson, who owns VideOdyssey, said: \"I've never seen anything this big.\"\nThe 42-year-old fulfilled his dream of opening a video shop in the Toxteth TV venue in 2018 and described the response since then as \"phenomenal\".\nHe even had to expand the store after being inundated with tapes from well-wishers across the country.\nEarlier this year, the shop featured on a movie lovers' bucket list, compiled by Time Out Magazine, alongside Hobbiton in New Zealand and the Ghostbusters firehouse in New York.\nBut the Dundee donation will more than double his existing 15,000-strong collection and he is applying for funding to create a national archive.\nMr Johnson told BBC Scotland: \"I was just absolutely amazed when I got the phone call.\n\"The guy who got these lock-ups told me it could be more than 20,000 so we are quite excited.\"  \nIf he had been unable to take the tapes, they would have been destined for landfill as VHS tapes cannot be recycled.\nMr Johnson believes young people brought up in the age of live streaming are keen to experience movies on tape.\nHe said: \"VHS is starting to have a similar comeback seen with vinyl. People want that physical connection to their favourite films, rather than the cold experience of playing something from the cloud.\"\nHaving worked as a clerk in a video shop as a teenager, Mr Johnson now finds himself travelling across the country on his days off to gather people's collections of old gems and save films, which never came out on a digital format, from oblivion.\nDuring the Covid lockdowns, he even offered customers a special nostalgia pack with a player and 10 tapes.\nMr Johnson added: \"It's taken over my life in a short space of time. Thankfully, I have a very understanding wife.\n\"As we have a three-year-old boy, and they've both travelled with me to pick up VHS hauls. But nothing like the size of this collection in Dundee.\n\"A lot of amazing movies were never brought out digitally and they're in danger of being lost forever.\""

      "title": "Afghanistan: UK's Kabul evacuation operating at full pace - commander",
      "tags": "British Armed Forces,Afghanistan",
      "text": "The UK's evacuation programme in Afghanistan is \"operating at full pace\" but the changing political situation means it \"can't afford to pause and wait\", a military commander has said. \nVice Adm Sir Ben Key, who is running the evacuation, said around 300 people had been flown out so far. \nBut Sir Ben said the operation was dependent on the security situation. \nBoris Johnson said any recognition of a Taliban government would \"be subject to them upholding\" human rights standards.\nIn total, the UK hopes to help 6,000 to 7,000 British nationals and eligible Afghan staff to leave, he said. \nHome Secretary Priti Patel said around 2,000 former Afghan staff and their families had been resettled in the UK since 22 June under an existing resettlement scheme.\nAnd more than 3,300 people have been resettled since 2013, she said. \nThe prime minister spoke to US President Joe Biden on Tuesday evening, Downing Street said - and the pair agreed to work \"closely together\" to evacuate people from Afghanistan.\n\"The prime minister and President Biden agreed on the need for the global community to come together to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan,\" a spokeswoman said.\nShe added that Mr Johnson outlined the UK's plans to increase humanitarian aid to the region and resettle refugees, and that the pair would discuss the situation at a virtual meeting of G7 leaders \"in the coming days\". \nThere were chaotic scenes at Kabul airport on Monday, as thousands tried to flee the country after the Taliban seized control of the capital. \nA number of people died and large crowds on the runway led to all flights being halted for several hours. \nHowever, Chief Joint Operations Vice Admiral Sir Ben said the situation was now \"much calmer\". \n\"I'm very confident that we now have a stable airfield in which we can get on with the business, alongside all of our allies and partners, that we need to do,\" he said. \nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I expect that we will increase our aid budget for development and humanitarian purposes - probably by 10%, is what I have in mind - on last year. We want to try and make sure it doesn't go through the Taliban.\"\nOne would assume by \"last year\" that Mr Raab was referring to aid spending in the 2020-21 financial year, when the UK gave \u00a3167.5m of aid to Afghanistan. \nThat was before the government cut the foreign aid budget earlier this year. Prior to today, aid to Afghanistan was set to fall to \u00a337.5m - an annual reduction of \u00a3130m. \nHowever, if, as Raab has implied, a further 10% were added to the aid given in 2020-21, it would bring the UK's spending in Afghanistan up to \u00a3184.25m. \nIf a 10% increase was applied to the post-cuts budget then it would represent a massive decrease on the 2020-21 budget. We have asked the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office to clarify the position but they have yet to comment. \nHe said three flights had landed in Kabul so far on Tuesday and more were planned. \nMilitary aircraft are also flying from Afghanistan to airports across the region, where people can then be put on civilian charter flights, he added. \nThe UK has sent about 900 troops to Afghanistan to help evacuate British nationals and Afghans who are eligible to resettle in the UK. \nThis group includes Afghans who worked for the British government, as well as interpreters, cultural advisers and embassy staff. Others eligible are those deemed to be at high and imminent risk, according to the Ministry of Defence.\nSir Ben said the UK wanted to bring as many people back as quickly as possible. \n\"We will go for as long as it takes us to either meet the demand, or when the security situation means that we're no longer operating with consent,\" he added. \nHowever, he said it was up to eligible individuals to make their own way to the airport when they were called to do so and the Taliban were now controlling access points. \nSo far, he said the Taliban had \"seemed acquiescent and understanding of what we're trying to achieve\" - but \"we don't take it for granted\". \n\"We will try our utmost to bring back everybody we can but we do not own the finish point of this,\" he added. \n\"We can merely work day by day as hard as we possibly can.\" \nSir Ben's comments came as a spokesman for the Taliban said the UK and western allies had a \"moral obligation\" to \"help reconstruct Afghanistan\".\nSuhail Shaheen told Sky News that the prime minister and other world leaders should respect the \"aspiration and will of the people of Afghanistan, and help the people of Afghanistan in rebuilding the country and providing a prosperous life for the people and economic development\".\n\"This is their obligation because they were behind the destruction of Afghanistan during the 20 years,\" he added.\nIn a separate news conference, the Taliban claimed that interpreters and others who had helped allied forces would be pardoned.\nA Downing Street spokeswoman said Mr Johnson had spoken to Pakistan PM Imran Khan on Tuesday afternoon.\nPakistan and Afghanistan share a border, and Mr Johnson had stressed the importance of working with other countries \"to avoid a humanitarian disaster\" the spokeswoman said.\n\"The prime minister underlined that any recognition of the new government in Afghanistan is to happen on an international, not unilateral, basis,\" she added.\n\"He said that the legitimacy of any future Taliban government will be subject to them upholding internationally-agreed standards on human rights and inclusivity.\"\nThe UK government is planning to launch a new resettlement scheme for Afghan refugees, aimed at helping those most in need, including women and girls, to come to the UK. \nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab has said the UK is looking at a \"bespoke arrangement\", with full details to be set out in due course. \nHe did not confirm how many refugees would be allowed to come, but said the UK was \"a big-hearted nation\".\nLabour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer said he would ask the prime minister on Wednesday how the UK planned to get refugees out of Afghanistan. \n\"I don't think a question of numbers at this stage is a helpful discussion,\" he said. \n\"The first discussion has to be: is there a plan; is there a strategy of safe and legal routes for refugees to come out of Afghanistan; and how quickly can that be put in place?\"\nThe former immigration minister Caroline Nokes MP told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the government needed to implement an \"unprecedented\" new resettlement scheme at \"alarming speed\".\n\"I think we have to be particularly scared for women and we know this is a regime that will oppress and suppress women as much as they possibly can,\" she said.\nThe BBC has been told the new resettlement scheme will be similar to that used to help Syrian refugees.\nAround 20,000 refugees who fled the conflict in Syria have been resettled in the UK under the scheme since it was launched in 2014.\n Have you or a loved one been evacuated from Afghanistan?

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban,Military",
      "text": "Over 800,000 US military members served in Afghanistan during America's longest war.  Over 2,000 were killed and more than 20,000 were injured.\nThe United States spent $822bn (\u00a3598bn) fighting the war and training Afghan forces, only to witness the Taliban's rapid conquest of the country.\nFour veterans who served in Afghanistan reflect on the war and the fall of the country they tried to help rebuild.\nJason served in the US Army and was deployed to Kandahar, Afghanistan in 2010.\nI feel like I'm watching the end of the movie Titanic. You knew the ship was going to sink, you just didn't know when or how quickly.\nI think what Biden said about the Afghan forces being unwilling to fight was harsh, but true. It's not surprising the Afghan army fell quickly. They couldn't hold rural areas once we ended the surge a decade ago. The cities were next, with the smaller ones falling first. Afghan soldiers were not going to keep dying for what looked inevitable. I don't blame them. The only partially surprising part is the Taliban didn't wait until we were completely out of the country to take the capital.\nThe US should not have stayed - this was always going to happen. When Biden said staying in Afghanistan for one or five more years wouldn't have changed things, he's absolutely correct.\nServing in the war made me re-evaluate how I feel about war in general - you realise how much of it is out of your control. So much of what the US wanted to accomplish there was contingent on what others needed to do, like Pakistan, Afghan soldiers, local citizens. Nobody was on the same page in Afghanistan.\nIt's unfathomable that people let it go on for so long.\nMichelle is a member of the US Air Force and was deployed in 2016. \nI'm disappointed in our behaviour as a country. It's very sad. I feel so badly for all the Afghans. Especially the females who will now be put back in the dark ages under the Taliban.\nLook at Vietnam. Look at Korea. War is never worth the cost. Was this one done correctly? Apparently not. The Taliban went into hiding and waited everyone out. \nDid we do a full assessment of the capabilities of the Afghan army? I don't think so. We trained helicopter pilots. We allegedly trained their soldiers. But apparently we didn't do a very good job. \nI think the exit should have been different. After 20 years, that's a whole generation of people. There are young Afghans I met there who looked up to the American military. They wanted to work with Americans. There was a good living and a standard of life.  Now it's gone. \nCan we change it? No. Is this a Democrat versus Republican issue? No\u2026 nobody had a plan. I am just truly disappointed. \nMike Jason is a retired US Army colonel who served for 24 years. \nIt's frustrating. It's maddening. The speed at which this started collapsing makes it very hard. It's faster than our ability to process our experiences over the last 20 years. \nI've been texting with an Afghan senior officer in hiding right now. His family is in hiding. There's a real life crisis going on. For veterans, this isn't about us right now. Our friends are in real danger today. It's not over yet. This is not the time to feel sorry for ourselves. \nI am an idealist who joined the Army because I wanted to do good. When 9/11 happened, I wanted to do something. When we got to Afghanistan, it was a lesson in empathy, working in foreign cultures, seeing a beautiful country with a rich history.\nWas it worth it? Was my role worth it? At the time I thought I'd done some good - but now I need time to reflect. \nWe created a military for a country that did not yet exist, a colleague of mine once said. The Afghan army felt no loyalty to a government that they saw as corrupt and illegitimate. I don't know if more US troops would have stopped the inevitable. \nI don't know that anybody who worked on the ground there is particularly shocked at the outcome.\nThe tragedy is that there are people in Afghanistan that just want their kids to grow up and be safe. For some, they had a taste of what that's like when we were there, and now darkness has returned. \nKyle Hanson served in the US Army from 2006 to 2012.\nI'm feeling a lot of different emotions. I feel sadness for so much of my fellow comrades' youth spent and lost for this cause. However, I certainly do not feel shock - it has long been known the ineffectiveness of the Afghan state and military.  \nThis was known to be what would happen when we left. American politicians passed it back and forth for 20 years, but the war stopped being worth it shortly after it began.\nI'm not surprised by how quickly the Afghan army fell - the Taliban had been given plenty of time to prepare, and given nearly exact dates to work with.\nShould we have stayed? I don't think staying was an option, but the way the pull out was handled by the Trump and Biden administrations was callously dictated by US domestic politics. There was also a lack of honesty of the situation on the ground in Afghanistan to the American people.\nWar is an extension of politics.  Our military tried its best, and our politicians let us and the Afghans down."

Road haulage firms have been a particular pinch point because the industry was already short of qualified drivers.\nFrom this week, fully vaccinated staff no longer have to self-isolate, a rule-change the government hopes will ease the pressure on businesses running short of staff.\nAt the same time Nando's says it is exploring an alternative solution by offering its staff to help suppliers, although it didn't say whether any had accepted the offer, or what work they would be doing.\nThe South African chain, famous for its peri peri sauce, operates more than 400 restaurants across the UK.\nNando's said the shortages were not affecting any of their outlets in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nNote September 6 2021: This story was updated to include a broader context around staff shortages after Brexit and the pandemic.

      "text": "The Taliban swept across Afghanistan in just 10 days, taking control of towns and cities across the country.\nTaliban fighters took their first provincial capital on 6 August - and by 15 August, they were at the gates of Kabul.\nTheir lightning advance prompted tens of thousands of people to flee their homes, many arriving in the Afghan capital, others heading for neighbouring countries.\nAnd there was chaos in Kabul, as President Ashraf Ghani fled the country and thousands of his countrymen and women tried to do likewise.\nEmboldened by the withdrawal of US and other international forces, in June, the Taliban already controlled large parts of the country.\nBut after 6 August, their advance accelerated with a new momentum. \nProvincial capitals toppled in quick succession.\nBy 8 August, the Taliban had taken control in Kunduz. \nHerat, Lashkar Gah and Kandahar followed within a few days.\nDespite 20 years of outside support, billions of dollars of funding, an extensive programme of training and US air support, the Afghan security forces largely collapsed.\nIn some areas, they did stand and fight.\nIn Lashkar Gah, Afghan troops were pinned back in key positions, as the Taliban attacked repeatedly.\nHundreds of commandos were sent in to restore order - but when the Taliban detonated a massive car bomb outside the police headquarters, on 11 August, the battle was largely over.\nIn many areas, Afghan units that found themselves running out of ammunition and other supplies simply fled. \nTroops armed and trained by the US to safeguard ordinary Afghans left them to largely fend for themselves.\nAnd in some places, the authorities agreed to allow the Taliban to take over, to avoid further bloodshed.\nIn Ghazni, reports suggest the police chief and governor were both allowed to leave the city in return for agreeing to a Taliban takeover. \nOn 14 August, Mazar-i-Sharif fell to the Taliban, with little resistance from Afghan troops, some of whom left the city and headed for the border with Uzbekistan at Haraitan.\nBy the 15 August, 17,600 people fleeing the Taliban had arrived in Kabul, with thousands more arriving all the time, according to the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\nWith very little support from the Afghan authorities, many were sleeping rough in parks and other public areas.\nSome said they had come from captured towns where the Taliban were killing male family members who had worked for the security forces, and reimposing restrictions on women.\nThe World Food Programme said the conflict had \"all the hallmarks of a humanitarian catastrophe\".\nAs President Ghani fled the country, US embassy staff were helicoptered out of their heavily fortified compound.\nAnd thousands of people were heading to Kabul airport.\nTaliban fighters initially paused outside the city, while emergency talks were held at the presidential palace.\nBut they then moved in to take full control.\nExactly how the Taliban intend to rule remains unclear - and may vary across the country.\nReports from inside Taliban-held territory so far give a mixed picture.\nIn Balkh, 20km (12 miles) from Mazar-i-Sharif, BBC News found women and girls allowed in public areas unaccompanied - but there were reports of a woman being murdered because of the way she had dressed.\nIn other places, including a rural northern district near the Tajik border, women have said they are now forced to cover themselves with a burka and cannot go out unaccompanied.\nThere are also reports of young women being offered to Taliban fighters for forced marriage.\nAlthough, Taliban representatives in Qatar insist this is \"a lie\".\nAdditional reporting by Matt Murphy"

      "tags": "Silverdale",
      "text": "A community blighted by noxious smells from a landfill site has come together for a High Court legal challenge against the Environment Agency (EA).\nThe action about Walleys Quarry, in Staffordshire, is being brought by the family of a boy, five, with breathing problems who live near the site.\nMathew Richards' doctors say hydrogen sulphide gas from the site has worsened his underlying health issues.\nThe EA and operator Walleys Quarry Ltd say work continues to address issues.\nThousands of residents have complained of sleeplessness and breathing difficulties and claim it has got worse since the beginning of this year. \nEA figures have previously shown how hydrogen sulphide levels recorded at the Silverdale site have, at points, exceeded World Health Organization guidelines. \nHydrogen sulphide (H2S) is a poisonous, corrosive gas with an eggy smell.\nMathew, who had chronic lung disease as a baby, lives half a mile from Walleys Quarry and his family believe it has made his condition worse.\n\"The first three years of his life, we were just [in] hospital, continuously, with chest problems, bronchiolitis, consistent cough,\" his mother Rebecca Currie said.\n\"If we lose I am going to be forced out of my home because there is no way I can keep Mathew around here.\"\nThe mother-of-five added: \"He has nights when he's coughing, vomiting, choking. \n\"He's got a consistent wet cough, sleepless nights.\"\nThe family's case is part of a judicial review set to take place at the court into the EA's enforcement of the operator Walleys Quarry Ltd. \nCampaigners want an immediate stop to landfill activities at the site and for the site to be made safe.\n\"The community is in crisis, with widespread physical and mental health conditions due to the emissions,\" barrister Ian Wise QC, for Mathew, told the High Court on Wednesday.\nLawyers are accusing the regulator of \"failing\" to take measures and being in breach of Mathew's rights to life and to private and family life under the European Convention on Human Rights as well as seeking a declaration that the EA \"failed to properly inform itself about the safe levels of H2S emissions... for children such as Mathew\".\nDr Ian Sinha, from Alder Hey Children's Hospital, in Liverpool, prepared a report for the judicial review.\nHe said environmental exposure to H2S was significantly impairing Mathew's current health and quality of life and said continued exposure would \"subsequently reduce his life expectancy\".\nDr Sinha said Mathew had a three to five-year \"window of opportunity\" to recover or risk developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nHis report said the levels of hydrogen sulphide from the landfill were high enough to cause airway and lung problems, which poses a particular risk to the elderly and the 1,773 children under the age of five living in the area.\n\"There is an unexpectedly excessive burden of respiratory illness and death in Silverdale,\" he added.\nSpeaking at the hearing, Dr Sinha said exposure to H2S could impair a person's immune system, and that \"any low-dose exposure will be particularly harmful to children with problems like Mathew\".\n\"There's a way for him to recover and it's not by breathing air that's polluted,\" he said. \nLawyers acting for the EA, which is responsible for regulating major industry and waste in England, reject the claim that there is a \"public health emergency\" at Walleys Quarry and argue there is not a real and immediate risk to Mathew's life.\nThey say Public Health England's position is that \"currently any risk to long-term health is likely to be small, but a risk cannot completely be excluded if exposure were to continue at current levels\".\nThe lawyers added the agency had taken \"very substantial steps\" at the landfill site and is continuing to review the matter.\nWalleys Quarry Ltd said it remained committed to doing everything in its power to help remedy the situation as soon as possible.\nWe know Walleys Quarry smells. But is it actually making people nearby, particularly children, sick? That's what today's hearing in the High Court is all about.\nFive-year-old Mathew Richards' doctors say hydrogen sulphide gas from the site has had an impact on his underlying health issues and if the problem continues it \"will subsequently reduce his life expectancy\". \nThe company that runs the quarry says it is sympathetic but will present its own medical evidence at the hearing. \nOver the next two days we could discover if the quarry is causing more than just a bad smell. Or if it's posing a health risk to children living nearby.\nProf Sir Colin Berry, a histopathologist and toxicologist, called to give evidence on behalf of Walleys Quarry Ltd, said the studies cited by Dr Sinha pointed to \"association\" but not evidence of \"causation\" of problems.\nHe said Mathew's case was \"all explicable by what happened at birth\".\nProf Berry accepted that people with COPD had a reduction in their life expectancy, but said he believed Mathew's \"pre-term events are a significant part of the explanation of his subsequent illnesses\".\nThe hearing is due to continue on Thursday and Mr Justice Fordham is expected to give his ruling at a later date. \nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "The Taliban were removed from power in Afghanistan by US-led forces in 2001, but the group has seized control of the country once again following a rapid offensive.\nThe capital, Kabul, was the last major city to fall to the offensive that began months ago but accelerated as the hardline Islamists gained control of territories.\nThe group entered direct talks with the US back in 2018, and in February 2020 the two sides struck a peace deal that committed the US to withdrawal and the Taliban to preventing attacks on US forces. Other promises included not allowing al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas it controlled and proceeding with national peace talks.\nBut in the year that followed, the Taliban continued to target Afghan security forces and civilians, advancing rapidly across the country.\nThe Taliban, or \"students\" in the Pashto language, emerged in the early 1990s in northern Pakistan following the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. It is believed that the predominantly Pashtun movement first appeared in religious seminaries - mostly paid for by money from Saudi Arabia - which preached a hardline form of Sunni Islam.\nThe promise made by the Taliban - in Pashtun areas straddling Pakistan and Afghanistan - was to restore peace and security and enforce their own austere version of Sharia, or Islamic law, once in power.\nFrom south-western Afghanistan, the Taliban quickly extended their influence. In September 1995 they captured the province of Herat, bordering Iran, and exactly one year later they captured the Afghan capital, Kabul, overthrowing the regime of President Burhanuddin Rabbani - one of the founding fathers of the Afghan mujahideen that resisted the Soviet occupation. By 1998, the Taliban were in control of almost 90% of Afghanistan.\nAfghans, weary of the mujahideen's excesses and infighting after the Soviets were driven out, generally welcomed the Taliban when they first appeared on the scene. Their early popularity was largely due to their success in stamping out corruption, curbing lawlessness and making the roads and the areas under their control safe for commerce to flourish.\nBut the Taliban also introduced or supported punishments in line with their strict interpretation of Sharia law - such as public executions of convicted murderers and adulterers, and amputations for those found guilty of theft. Men were required to grow beards and women had to wear the all-covering burka.\nThe Taliban also banned television, music and cinema, and disapproved of girls aged 10 and over going to school. They were accused of various human rights and cultural abuses. One notorious example was in 2001, when the Taliban went ahead with the destruction of the famous Bamiyan Buddha statues in central Afghanistan, despite international outrage.\nPakistan has repeatedly denied that it was the architect of the Taliban enterprise, but there is little doubt that many Afghans who initially joined the movement were educated in madrassas (religious schools) in Pakistan.\nPakistan was also one of only three countries, along with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which recognised the Taliban when they were in power in Afghanistan. It was also the last country to break diplomatic ties with the group.\nAt one point, the Taliban threatened to destabilise Pakistan from areas they controlled in the north-west. One of the most high-profile and internationally condemned of all Pakistani Taliban attacks took place in October 2012, when schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai was shot on her way home in the town of Mingora.\nA major military offensive two years later following the Peshawar school massacre greatly reduced the group's influence in Pakistan though. At least three key figures of the Pakistani Taliban had been killed in US drone strikes in 2013, including the group's leader, Hakimullah Mehsud.\nThe attention of the world was drawn to the Taliban in Afghanistan in the wake of the 11 September 2001 World Trade Center attacks in New York. The Taliban were accused of providing a sanctuary for the prime suspects - Osama Bin Laden and his al-Qaeda movement.\nOn October 7, 2001, a US-led military coalition launched attacks in Afghanistan, and by the first week of December the Taliban regime had collapsed. The group's then-leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, and other senior figures, including Bin Laden, evaded capture despite one of the largest manhunts in the world. \nMany senior Taliban leaders reportedly took refuge in the Pakistani city of Quetta, from where they guided the Taliban. But the existence of what was dubbed the \"Quetta Shura\" was denied by Islamabad.\nDespite ever higher numbers of foreign troops, the Taliban gradually regained and then extended their influence in Afghanistan, rendering vast tracts of the country insecure, and violence in the country returned to levels not seen since 2001.\nThere were numerous Taliban attacks on Kabul and, in September 2012, the group carried out a high-profile raid on Nato's Camp Bastion base.\nHopes of a negotiated peace were raised in 2013, when the Taliban announced plans to open an office in Qatar. But mistrust on all sides remained high and the violence went on.\nIn August 2015, the Taliban admitted they had covered up Mullah Omar's death - reportedly of health problems at a hospital in Pakistan - for more than two years. The following month, the group said it had put aside weeks of infighting and rallied around a new leader in the form of Mullah Mansour, who had been the deputy of Mullah Omar.\nAt around the same time, the Taliban seized control of a provincial capital for the first time since their defeat in 2001, taking control of the strategically important city of Kunduz.\nMullah Mansour was killed in a US drone strike in May 2016 and replaced by his deputy Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada, who remains in control of the group.\nIn the year following the US-Taliban peace deal of February 2020 - which was the culmination of a long spell of direct talks - the Taliban appeared to shift their tactics from complex attacks in cities and on military outposts to a wave of targeted assassinations that terrorised Afghan civilians.\nThe targets - journalists, judges, peace activists, women in positions of power - suggested that the Taliban had not changed their extremist ideology, only their strategy. \nDespite grave concerns from Afghan officials over the government's vulnerability to the Taliban without international support, the new US president, Joe Biden, announced in April 2021 that all American forces would leave the country by 11 September - two decades to the day since the felling of the World Trade Center. \nHaving outlasted a superpower through two decades of war, the Taliban began seizing vast swathes of territory, before once again toppling a government in Kabul in the wake of a foreign power withdrawing.\nThey swept across Afghanistan in just 10 days, taking their first provincial capital on 6 August . By 15 August, they were at the gates of Kabul.\nTheir lightning advance prompted tens of thousands of people to flee their homes, many arriving in the Afghan capital, others heading for neighbouring countries.\nThe Taliban's return to rule brings an end to almost 20 years of a US-led coalition's presence in the country."

      "text": "The BBC has spoken to a woman in Kabul who worked for the Afghan government for almost two years, until last week. She spoke about her experience when the Taliban took the city and her fears for the future. \nSunday was the most horrible day in my entire life. \nI went to my office in the morning. The only woman I saw was a security guard at the gate. There were very few people there - it was not normal. The Taliban were at the gates of the city, people were scared, but I didn't believe the militants would be able to enter.\nAt around noon I left the office. I took my mobile phone charger and some personal documents. I went to the bank to withdraw some money as everyone was trying to take out as much money as they could. But the queue was very long. The situation was intense. \nWhen I entered the bank, I noticed missed calls from my mother, sister and brother. It scared me, as something might have happened. I called my mother and she asked, in a very anxious way, where I was and what I was doing. She told me to hurry and run home as the Taliban were in the west of the city. \nI was shocked, terrified, scared. \nEveryone was running. Shopkeepers were closing the doors and everybody was trying to get home. My brother called to say he'd pick me up. But the roads were blocked by traffic. \nI started to walk, and even tried to find a taxi. On the way, I saw a flood of people running. My fear was if the Taliban caught me on my way, they would kill me as I was in my office clothes. \nAfter almost two hours, I finally reached my home. I was so shaken I could not speak to my family. It was a day that I will never forget. I spent all night with fears running around my mind and I thought someone may knock on our door.\nSince then everyone has been looking for where they can hide. I want to escape to a relative's home, but I don't dare in case I'm caught on the way. \nI feel safe at home now. If they come to our home, no one would know that I worked for the government. The Taliban said their fighters will not enter people's homes. But we can't trust them. I'm afraid when I see them on TV - it makes me feel very sad.\nWe have seen their brutalities, how we can trust them? I can't sleep now during the night due to fear. \nI am waiting for a visa to leave the country but that is uncertain. If I stay in Afghanistan, will they allow me to work? I don't think so. I don't see my future in Afghanistan as being safe. I think for us, everything is finished. \nI've lost my hope for the future."

They are, however, allowing entry to people with American passports, according to US officials.\nThe hardline Islamist group's dramatic takeover of Kabul on Sunday took many Western governments by surprise.\nStaff at the Dutch embassy have faced criticism after saying they did not have time tell Afghan colleagues they were going.\nThe former president of the Dutch military union feared there was little time left to evacuate interpreters and local staff: \"If we don't succeed in the next 48 to 72 hours it'll be too late,\" Anne-Marie Snels told the BBC.\nDozens of planes from around 15 countries have reportedly been sent to Kabul to assist with the evacuations. American, French, Dutch, German, Spanish and British aircraft have all left in recent hours.\nThe US military, which is planning to evacuate more than 30,000 people by the end of the month, is guarding the runways and has taken over air traffic control. \nIts troops fired shots overnight as part of crowd-control efforts but no-one was injured, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said on Wednesday.\nHe said 4,500 US troops were currently at the airport, but hundreds more were set to arrive in the coming hours. \n\"We have an obligation to get as many people out of Afghanistan as we can,\" Mr Kirby said, adding that the US was aiming to increase its evacuation capacity to more than 5,000 people a day.\nAbout 11,000 US citizens remain in the country, AFP news agency reports. Two thousand people have been evacuated by the US in the past 24 hours, including 325 Americans.\nFrance, Germany, Spain, Poland and the Czech Republic all said they had successfully evacuated some of their citizens as well as Afghans.\nSome 700 British nationals and Afghans were airlifted out on Tuesday and the UK was \"trying to scale up the speed and pace over the next couple of days\", UK Ambassador Laurie Bristow said.\nOne British aid worker told the BBC that she felt lucky to escape. \"The runways were crowded with hundreds of Afghan families hoping to get out somehow,\" Kitty Chevallier told the PA news agency,\nShe added that she was aware of how \"immensely lucky\" she was to have been helped out, when others, including friends and colleagues, remained stranded.\nElsewhere, one woman who left Afghanistan on a German evacuation plane spoke of her fear before boarding.\n\"We had to force our way through and my little son fell over and we were scared but we made it,\" she told Reuters. \"An American guy showed goodwill and realised we were totally exhausted.\"\n\"He said 'all good, you may go in'. Others behind cried and lay on the ground. It was scary,\" she said.\nThe unfolding crisis has prompted wider calls for Western countries to resettle Afghan refugees. \n\"We cannot abandon [Afghan colleagues] and we are doing everything we can to offer them shelter,\" the European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Wednesday.\nGerman Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, however, was among a number of European leaders to warn of an influx of refugees from Afghanistan, suggesting between 300,000 and five million people could head to Europe.\nThe UK has said it will settle 20,000 Afghan refugees over the next few years, while Austrian Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said on Wednesday that \"the aim must be to keep the bulk of people in the region\".\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has come under fire from opponents for saying Europe should put together a \"robust initiative to thwart illegal migration\". He accused critics of twisting his comments and said \"France does and will continue to do its duty to protect those who are in the most danger\"."

He has said it became increasingly difficult to comment on graded exercise and CBT issues in public while holding both roles.   \nNICE said it wanted to thank everyone who had contributed to the guideline, particularly the committee and the patient groups who had worked so diligently. \n\"However, unless the recommendations in the guideline are supported and implemented by professionals and the NHS, people with ME/CFS may not get the care and help they need,\" it said. \nSian Leary, from #MEAction UK, accused NICE of \"capitulating to the vested interests of those who support graded exercise therapy, instead of standing up for the thousands of people being harmed.\"\nOther groups including Forward ME, Action for ME, ME Association, Doctors for ME and ME Research UK criticised the delay, saying the document had been approved by the committee and should be published.\nAndrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: \"We were extremely concerned that the final guidelines proposed by NICE may not have taken into consideration the extensive comments we made to the draft version, particularly in relation to treatments we know to have significantly benefited many patients.\n\"There is reasonable evidence, for example, that graded exercise therapy helps a group of patients with ME/CFS and, while not without risk, our experts strongly support its ongoing use as an option in this condition. \n\"Similarly, our experts would strongly recommend specialist individualised rehabilitation for patients with complex rehabilitation needs.\n\"We hope that in delaying the final publication of these guidelines, NICE will re-consider our evidence submitted and incorporate it into their final publication.\""

      "text": "Boris Johnson has faced a barrage of criticism from MPs over the UK's role in Afghanistan, in an emergency House of Commons debate on the crisis.   \nHis predecessor as PM Theresa May said it was \"incomprehensible\" the UK was not doing more to maintain a presence, while ex-minister Johnny Mercer demanded more help for veterans.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson of \"staggering complacency\".\nBut Mr Johnson argued Nato's \"core mission\" in Afghanistan had succeeded.\nAddressing a packed Commons, he said the country had been largely cleared of al-Qaeda terrorists, while the population had enjoyed better education, women's rights and free elections since the 2001 invasion.\nBut Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee and himself served in Afghanistan, said it had been \"shameful\" of US President Joe Biden to question the willingness of the Afghan army to fight the Taliban.\nAnd, in an emotional speech that was heard in silence, he told of grief and rage felt by veterans at the \"abandonment\" of Afghanistan.\nUK troops ceased combat operations in 2014 and most of those who remained, primarily to help train the Afghan army, left last month.\nThe government has agreed to resettle up to 20,000 Afghan refugees displaced by the return of the Taliban over the next few years.\nEfforts are also continuing to evacuate UK nationals from Kabul airport, but Downing Street did not deny a report that one plane had taken off \"almost empty\".\nParliament was recalled from its summer break for the seven-and-half-hour debate on the situation in Afghanistan.\nMrs May called Nato's withdrawal \"a major setback for British foreign policy\".\nShe said it was \"incomprehensible and worrying\" that the UK government had not been able to put together an \"alternative alliance of countries\" to continue to support the Afghan government in the absence of US forces.\nAnother Conservative MP and former soldier, defence committee chairman Tobias Ellwood, argued the UK \"should never have left\" Afghanistan.\n\"What we require is the backbone, the courage, the leadership to step forward, yet when our moment comes such as this we are found wanting,\" he said.\nMr Mercer, who served in Afghanistan and who quit as veterans' minister earlier this year, accused Mr Johnson of \"consistently failing\" to support ex-soldiers.\nThis was the first full in-person session in the House of Commons for over a year and Boris Johnson felt the full force of it.\nHe had to battle through parts of his opening statement on the crisis in Afghanistan, in a noisy chamber, as MPs from all sides vied to intervene.\nIt was a striking contrast to the often flat proceedings that have been a hallmark of the part-virtual Parliament over the past year.\nNow, lined up on the front bench, Mr Johnson and his ministers not only had to hear the searing criticisms from colleagues but look them in the eye as well, whether in the chamber or in backrooms, corridors and passages.\nRead more from Jessica\nSome 457 UK personnel have died and more than 2,000 have been wounded in Afghanistan since the invasion, prompted by the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US by al-Qaeda.\nMr Johnson said that \"in spite of all the difficulties and challenges we knew we would face... we succeeded in that core mission\" of removing the terror group's operatives from Afghanistan.\n\"It would be fair to say [recent] events in Afghanistan have unfolded and the collapse [of the Afghan government] has been faster than even the Taliban themselves predicated,\" he said.\n\"What is not true is to say the UK government was unprepared or did not foresee this.\"\nMr Johnson said the Taliban, who have promised to observe human rights, must be judged on \"actions rather than words\".\n\"At this bleak turning point we must help the people of Afghanistan determine the best of all possible futures,\" he added.\nBut opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the prime minister of \"staggering complacency\" and \"appalling\" judgement by failing to plan properly for the withdrawal of troops over the past 18 months.\nHe called the government's refugee repatriation target too small and claimed the 20,000 figure had been \"plucked out of the air\".\nTo jeers from Conservative MPs, he said: \"The prime minister's response to the Taliban arriving at the gates of Kabul was to go on holiday.\"\nMr Johnson received little backbench support during the debate, but Conservative Alicia Kearns said the government had \"called for Nato allies to help us build a new coalition in Afghanistan to prevent the Taliban recapturing it, and we were let down\".\nFellow Tory Caroline Nokes praised the prime minister for putting in place a scheme to \"ensure that we can prioritise women and girls\" in Afghanistan \"and bring them to safety\".\nBut SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford argued that the future of Afghanistan had \"never been so uncertain\" and that refugees needed more help.\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey branded the prime minister a \"national liability\" who could not \"escape culpability for this disaster\"."

      "text": "Trendy neighbours may have bought fire pits and pizza ovens during lockdown, or worked from home in a shoffice - but the risk of an expensive blaze grew.  \nInsurer Zurich has warned that outbuilding fires - in sheds, garages and conservatories - rose by 16% last year compared with 2019.\nIt said the popularity of conversions to home offices, gyms and domestic drinks bars increased the fire risk.\nThree-quarters of areas in the UK recorded more fires, the data shows.\nPhil Ost, from Zurich, said: \"Aside from storing gardening tools, our sheds and garages have become a haven to escape the stresses of family life and for others, a place to work.\"\n\"But as they take refuge in their garden sheds and garages, it appears to have sparked a rise in accidental blazes.\"\nIn April, a survey by another insurer, Aviva, suggested that one in 10 of those asked worked from a converted shed, garage or summerhouse - a proportion expected to rise to 13%.\nThe popularity of so-called shoffices - shed offices - has risen, with some people spending significant sums for a luxury cabin.\nThe word garage also become the most popular search item on property website Rightmove, and planning applications to convert them rose sharply.\nHowever, analysts said some people risked invalidating their insurance if they failed to inform their insurer about a new line of work, if it created extra risks.\nWhile some insurers have allowed people setting up in business at home to extend their cover at no extra cost, some people may need to buy new policies or pay larger premiums owing to the extra risk.\nThere is also the risk that expensive equipment might bust insurance limits in existing policies if stolen or damaged.\nElectrical equipment, as well as popular lockdown purchases such as pizza ovens and fire pits, added to the existing fire risks created in gardens by mowers, barbecues, and paint thinners. \nData collected by Zurich from UK fire authorities showed that there were 3,681 residential outbuilding fires recorded in 2020, compared with 3,170 the year before.\nWarnings have also been issued about property moved to self-storage units while people are working from home.\nSome warehouses have gone up in flames, with devastated customers speaking of how they have been unable to replace their lost belongings.\nStuart Bensusan, from insurance specialist Surewise, said: \"It highlights the importance of thoroughly vetting any storage facility you use and taking the necessary steps to protect your possessions while they are in it.\"\n\"Many consumers have complete faith in storage units, and unfortunately it simply never crosses their minds that something might happen to their unit, or the whole building. This leads to many customers being under-insured or worse having no insurance cover at all.\"\nMany storage unit operators offer insurance, but customers may shop around for cheaper deals, and some may have cover included through their home insurance policy."

      "tags": "House of Commons,UK Parliament,House of Lords,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Most Tory MPs did not wear face masks during a packed Commons debate, despite government guidance to do so in crowded areas.\nMore opposition MPs than Conservatives covered their faces, as MPs sat shoulder-to-shoulder to discuss developments in Afghanistan.\nIt is the first time the Commons, which has been recalled to debate the crisis, has been full since March 2020.\nNo 10 said it was a \"matter for the parliamentary authorities\".\nA Downing Street spokesman said the government was still advising people in England to wear face coverings in crowded places.\nA union representing parliamentary staff accused non-mask wearing MPs of showing \"contempt\" towards their colleagues and Commons personnel.\nCovid rules allowing MPs to speak in debates via video link have been allowed to lapse since Parliament went into recess on 22 July.\nIt means MPs wanting to take part in Wednesday's all-day emergency Commons debate had to do so in person.\nIn scenes not seen since the advent of the pandemic, the Commons chamber was packed as Prime Minister Boris Johnson updated MPs after the Taliban rapidly seized control of Afghanistan following the departure of US-led forces.\nHowever, the Commons authorities are continuing to \"strongly encourage\" MPs to wear face coverings in the chamber.\nDuring Wednesday's debate, noticeably more Labour and SNP MPs decided to wear masks than Conservative backbenchers. \nGovernment ministers, including cabinet ministers, were also pictured maskless during the proceedings. \nThe Prospect union, which represents staff in Parliament, said MPs had shown \"huge disrespect\" to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle by not wearing masks. \nGeneral secretary Mike Clancy said: \"It is abundantly clear that large numbers of MPs believe that rules simply don't apply to them, and are comfortable with recklessly undermining public health messaging.\"\n\"With the Commons set to resume full time in just a few weeks, it is time to rethink the light touch approach to mask wearing in the chamber.\n\"It has demonstrably failed, and more rigorous enforcement must be considered.\"\nDave Penman, head of the FDA union that represents clerks in Parliament, said the political parties should \"go further\" in enforcing mask-wearing. \n\"MPs refusing to wear masks in the chamber show scant regard for the well-being of their colleagues,\" he added. \nThe House of Lords has also been debating the Afghanistan crisis, after peers were recalled to hold an emergency debate of their own. \nHowever, the upper chamber - where peers are still being allowed to speak over video link - was noticeably less busy than the Commons. \nThere was also less of a partisan divide, with more peers on the government side, including ministers, donning face coverings.\nAt the start of the debate, Lords Speaker Lord McFall said social distancing measures had gone but peers were still \"strongly encouraged\" to wear masks, except when speaking. \nThe wearing of face masks is no longer mandatory under Covid laws in England, after rules were eased on 19 July. \nBut the government says it \"expects and recommends\" people to do so in \"crowded and enclosed spaces where you come into contact with people you don't normally meet\".\n\"You should use your judgement in deciding where you should wear one,\" the guidance adds. \nThe SNP-run Scottish government has kept the legal requirement to wear masks in shops and on public transport, as well as pubs and restaurants when not seated. \nThe Labour-run Welsh government has kept mandatory mask-wearing on public transport all public indoor areas, but not in pubs and restaurants."

      "tags": "Disability",
      "text": "A global campaign described as a \"game-changer\" has been launched to improve the lives of more than one billion disabled people by 2030. \nWeThe15 wants to improve inclusion, raise awareness and end discrimination of disabled people around the world.\nIt brings together a coalition of organisations from the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) to Unesco.\nThe launch comes ahead of the delayed Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games which begin on 24 August. \nUsing the event as a springboard, the IPC and International Disability Alliance has joined forces with arts, business and human rights organisations including UN Human Rights and The Valuable 500 to \"raise awareness, change attitudes and create more opportunities\" for disabled people.  \nThe campaign has been set-up to represent the 15% of the world's population that is disabled - about 1.2bn people, according to the World Health Organization.\nAs part of it, the IPC, Special Olympics, Invictus Games and International Committee of Sports for the Deaf will collaborate for the first time to ensure there will be a major sport event - and platform for the campaign - every year until 2030.\nOn Thursday, for the launch, 125 landmarks will turn purple - the internationally recognised colour of disability - from New York's Empire State Building to Moscow's Ostankino Tower and the London Eye.\nPresident of the IPC, Andrew Parsons, said: \"[The project] aims to put disability right at the heart of the inclusion agenda, alongside ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation. \n\"I strongly believe WeThe15 could be a real game-changer.\" \nHe said collaborating with big organisations would ensure a significant presence at local, grassroots, levels to help improve people's lives.\nSam Milne, from Leicester, has cerebral palsy and plays with a local basketball team.\nShe said society's general perception of disabled people could be problematic and she had faced discrimination. \nShe said people often presume she can't speak because she uses a wheelchair and that going back to basics, such as ensuring as many places as possible are accessible, would improve her life and enable her to get out into the community more easily.\nOne of her wishes is that more doors could be power-assisted rather than relying on strength to open them.\n\"I can walk a bit, but if I can't open the door how far am I going to get? This awareness needs to go down to the everyday - to the shopkeepers and the hair salons.\"\nBut she warned that awareness \"needs to grow\" and not disappear once the Paralympics is over.\nThe WeThe15 campaign plans go beyond sport and over the next 10 years it says it will focus on different \"pillars\" which need greater equality.\nThis year it will concentrate on access to vaccinations against Covid-19, while in the run-up to the LA Paralympics in 2028 - the home of Hollywood - it is expected to focus on disability representation in the entertainment industry, such as ensuring disabled actors play disabled characters.  \nAccording to the IPC, 85% of disabled people around the world live in poverty, about 50% are unemployed and 75% of countries have no laws protecting them.\nMr Parsons said: \"We want to tackle employment, we want to tackle mobility.\n\"Of course it will be different country-to-country. This is why we will need the local presence there to understand the challenges and that's why it's a 10-year campaign. We're trying to cover all basis and all nations.\"\nWhile WeThe15 focuses on the statistic that 15% of the global population is disabled, the US government puts it much higher at 26% for its citizens while the UK government says it's 22%, but the definitions of disability often vary.\nIn the UK a person is considered to have a disability if they report a long-standing illness or impairment which causes substantial difficulty with day-to-day activities. \nFor long jumper and Paralympic medallist, Stef McLeod Reid, Tokyo 2020 will be her fourth Games.\nThe track athlete, who had a foot amputated as a teenager following a boating accident, hopes WeThe15 will stop people viewing disabled people as \"other\".\n\"When you realise that one billion people in the world live with a disability you realise this should be at the front of every single inclusion agenda. \n\"There is so much potential and talent sitting there left untapped because the world is designed around this very specific idea of 'normal'.\"\nShe said \"disability is expensive\" - from purchasing the right equipment to making buildings accessible - and that needs to be addressed. \n\"What we are lacking, unfortunately, in different parts of the world, is money and investment and a commitment that everybody should be able to fulfil their potential.\" \nShe believes success will rely on \"shifting mindsets\" to make the \"world more accessible to everyone\".\nFor more disability news, follow BBC Ouch on Twitter, Facebook and listen to our podcasts which also have transcripts.

      "tags": "Afghanistan,Women's rights in Afghanistan,Women's rights",
      "text": "The rights of women in Afghanistan will be respected \"within the framework of Islamic law\", the Taliban say.\nIn the group's first news conference since taking control of the country on Sunday, a spokesman said women would be free to work but gave little detail about other rules and restrictions.\nZabihullah Mujahid repeated that all Afghans must live \"within the framework of Islam\".\nRights groups fear women's freedoms could be eroded under the Taliban.\nThe militant group introduced or supported punishments in line with their strict interpretation of Islam's legal system, Sharia law, when they controlled Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001.\nWomen had to wear the all-covering burka, and the Taliban also disapproved of girls aged 10 and over going to school. \nIn the news briefing on Tuesday, Mr Mujahid fielded several questions from the international media about what women's rights could look like under a Taliban government.\n\"We are going to allow women to work and study within our frameworks,\" he said. \"Women are going to be very active within our society.\"\nBut he did not expand when asked about dress codes and what roles women would be able to have within the country's workforce.\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Taliban declared a general amnesty across Afghanistan and said it wanted women to join its government.\nAnalysts say the group is running a sophisticated PR campaign in an effort to win the hearts and minds of both Afghans and the international community. \nThe message of the new rulers has been received with mixed feelings inside Afghanistan.\n\"I don't believe what they're saying,\" a woman in Kabul who watched Mujahid speak on television told the BBC. \n\"It's a ruse and we're being lured outside to be punished. I refuse to study or work under their laws,\" said another.\nYet some others saw some early promise. \n\"If we're able to work and get educated, that's the definition of freedom for me, that's my red line. That red line is not crossed by the Taliban yet,\" one Afghan woman said. \n\"As long as my right to study and work is protected, I don't mind wearing a hijab. I live in an Islamic country and I'm willing to accept the Islamic dress code - as long as it's not a burqa though because that's not an Islamic dress code.\" \nAlso Tuesday's news conference, Mr Mujahid also:\n\"All their rights within Islam\" - that's the phrase the Taliban have used countless times when it comes to the lives of Afghan women and girls. \nIn recent years, foreign envoys and Afghans have tried, without much success, to establish with Taliban leaders based in Doha exactly what that means. \nI've heard references to women's rights in conservative Arab societies including Saudi Arabia, or Qatar. A founding member of the Taliban once blurted out that university classes would have to be segregated, areas partitioned, with obligatory head coverings. \nMore telling are recent reports from rural and urban areas that women journalists have been told to go home, women in offices told their jobs would now go to men. Restrictions may vary by region. \nIt's always been said that the rules in Kabul and other more open cities may be a bit different; women will now be testing the limits as a new order emerges. \nThe Taliban's return to rule brings an end to almost 20 years of a US-led coalition's presence in the country.\nKabul was the last major city in Afghanistan to fall to a Taliban offensive that began months ago but accelerated in recent days as they gained control of territories, shocking many observers.\nOn Monday, thousands of civilians desperate to flee the country headed to the airport where chaotic scenes unfolded throughout the day.\nMany thronged the runway, running alongside a moving military transporter aircraft as it prepared for take-off.\nSome clung to the side of a plane, and at least two of them are reported to have perished when they fell from the aircraft after it had left the ground.\nAmerican troops also killed two armed Afghans who were part of the crowd that breached the airport perimeter. Seven people are reported to have died in total.\nMilitary flights evacuating diplomats and civilians were temporarily suspended due to the chaos, but they resumed on Tuesday."

      "text": "Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani has taken refuge in the United Arab Emirates, the Gulf nation says.\nMr Ghani left Afghanistan as the Taliban advanced on the capital city Kabul over the weekend. \nThe UAE's foreign ministry said the country had welcomed Mr Ghani and his family on humanitarian grounds. \nIn a video address later on Wednesday, Mr Ghani denied fleeing and said he had left to prevent what he described as a \"huge disaster\".\n\"For now, I am in the Emirates so that bloodshed and chaos is stopped,\" he said. \"I am currently in talks to return to Afghanistan.\"\nMr Ghani also said rumours that he had travelled to the UAE with a large amount of money were \"completely baseless\" and \"lies\".\nThe 72-year-old has faced intense criticism from other Afghan politicians for leaving the country. \n\"God will hold him accountable and the nation will also judge,\" said Abdullah Abdullah, chairman of Afghanistan's High Council for National Reconciliation.\nUS President Joe Biden also criticised Afghanistan's government for fleeing in a speech on Monday. \nAnd later on Wednesday, the US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman told reporters that Mr Ghani was \"no longer a figure in Afghanistan\". \nHowever, the US has continued to refer to \"President Ghani\", with the State Department saying that there has not been a formal handover of power. \nIn his video address, which was streamed live on Facebook, Mr Ghani said he was evacuated by his security team from the presidential palace \"in a condition where I couldn't even put on my shoes\".\n\"Events unfolded at a fast pace. I wanted to negotiate an inclusive government with the Taliban,\" he said, adding that he supported talks between the Taliban and former officials from his administration.\nThis is not the first time the UAE has provided a safe haven for deposed or fugitive leaders from other countries. Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto made Dubai her new home in the 1990s before later returning to power. \nBut the UAE, which hosts a large population of Afghan and Pakistani guest workers, will not want to see its territory used as a political platform, the BBC's Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says. \nMr Ghani came into office in 2014 and was re-elected in February 2020. \nSpeaking to the BBC earlier this year, he dismissed fears of a Taliban military victory. \"This is not Vietnam. The government is not collapsing,\" he said.  "

      "text": "The former Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, has been defending the UK's handling of the evacuation from Afghanistan after the Taliban took control of Kabul in August. \nIt follows claims from a whistleblower, Raphael Marshall - who worked at the Foreign Office at the time - that the government's response to the crisis was chaotic and dysfunctional. \nMr Raab said 15,000 people were evacuated by the UK from Afghanistan from 15 August to the end of that month.\nHe said it was a larger number than by any other nation except the US.\nAt the time, the government said the 15,000 people included 5,000 British nationals, 8,000 Afghans and 2,000 children.\nSome Afghan nationals had already arrived in the UK for resettlement before that date.\nThe Foreign Office told us that since the end of August, a further 3,000 people had been helped to leave Afghanistan. This included more than 1,100 UK nationals.\nIn written evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr Marshall said he estimated that between 75,000 and 150,000 people in Afghanistan had applied for evacuation to the UK in August. \nHe estimated that 5% of these received assistance. \nThe US evacuated the largest number of people from Afghanistan in August. \nFrom 14 August to 28 August, it got 113,500 people out of the country.\nOther countries evacuated much smaller numbers over that period, according to official statements and press releases\nSince the end of August, some countries have continued to carry out occasional evacuations. France evacuated 258 people just last week.\nIn August, Mr Raab said that the number of British nationals remaining in Afghanistan was \"in the low hundreds, \" although he would not give a more precise figure.\nMr Raab told a committee of MPs that nearly all the people in Afghanistan with single UK nationality and accompanying documentation had been brought back - but it had proved harder to estimate the number of dual-nationality Britons remaining in Afghanistan.  \nThe example he provided was that some large families may have one or more people that were documented, but it was unclear what the status of the rest of the family was.\nOn 7 December, the Prime Minister's special representative for Afghanistan, Nigel Casey, told MPs there were about 200 British nationals still in Afghanistan.\nThe UK government has a scheme to resettle Afghans - the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP), which was launched on 1 April. \nUnder the scheme, Afghans who worked for the British military and UK government (for example, as interpreters) are able to move to the UK permanently, rather than getting five years' residency as was previously offered.\nThe Home Office says there have been 7,000 people relocated under the ARAP scheme since its launch.\nBefore the ARAP scheme, the Home Office says 1,400 former staff and families were relocated since 2013 under a previous scheme called the Ex-Gratia Policy.\nIn addition to ARAP, the government has said the Afghan Citizens' Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) will allow a total of 20,000 to settle in the UK.\nIt will focus on women and children as well as religious and other minorities in danger from the Taliban.\nA fact-sheet released about it in September said it would welcome 5,000 Afghans in the first year, although the scheme is yet to open. \nImmigration lawyer Sarah Pinder said resettlement schemes are often too slow for crises such as the one in Afghanistan.\n\"The idea that people can queue up to make an application by staying put... in reality, it's difficult to put into practice,\" she said.\nAnd she said the schemes' criteria were often narrow, leaving people \"stuck in a loop\" between different ones. \nOutside a small number of official resettlement schemes, the main way to settle in the UK is to seek asylum once within the country's borders.\nIn 2020, 1,336 people from Afghanistan applied for asylum, out of 29,456 total applications from around the world, and 580 were granted it. But not all of those granted asylum had applied in the same year.\nThey were much larger numbers of Afghans applying for asylum last year in some EU countries, such as Greece, France and Germany.\nThis year up until September, there were 1,974 asylum applications in the UK from Afghan nationals - an increase of almost 40% over the previous year.\nWhat claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

      "text": "UK scientists behind the AstraZeneca Covid jab have given the first trial volunteers a new plague vaccine.  \nOne of them, Larissa, 26, hopes she can help save lives by volunteering for the research, at the University of Oxford, where she studies genetics.\nThe phase-one trial will see at least 40 healthy 18- to 55-year-olds test the vaccine, which uses the same technology as the coronavirus jab. \nIts target is a centuries-old bacterial threat, not the new pandemic virus. \nFor much of the world plague is a history lesson - the most infamous plague pandemic, the Black Death that swept through Europe in the 1300s, killed as much as half of the population. \nBut there are still cases in some rural areas of Africa, Asia and America. \nAnd in 2017, an outbreak killed 171 people in Madagascar.\nAntibiotics can now be used to treat plague, if given early, \nBut many of the regions at risk of outbreaks are very remote. \nAn effective vaccine could offer a new way to protect lives. \nAnd the trial will check how well the body recognises and learns to fight the plague after vaccination. \nLarissa said: \"I'm lucky enough to live in a time where vaccines are being developed.\n\"And so, when I saw that there was a study aiming at developing a vaccine against a disease that's been around for 2000 years and has killed millions and millions of people, I didn't hesitate, I just wanted to do my bit.\"\nAsked if she was worried about side-effects, Larissa said: \"I'm not too concerned.\n\"The vaccine that's being assessed today is using the same platform as the Covid vaccine, which has literally been administered to millions of people around the world.\"\nLike the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, the jab uses a weakened version of a common-cold virus - adenovirus - from chimpanzees that has been genetically altered so it cannot cause an infection in people. \nThis vaccine does not contain plague bacterium and so cannot cause plague. \nBut it does include added genes that make proteins from the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis. \nAnd this should teach the body's immune system how to fend off the real infection, should it ever need to. \nThe same approach could be used for other diseases too, the investigators say.\n\"We've already done clinical trials using similar technology against a bacterium, meningitis B, and a virus, Zika,\" Oxford Vaccine Group senior clinical researcher Dr Maheshi Ramasamy said.\n\"But we're also looking to develop vaccines against new and emerging diseases such as Lassa fever or the Marburg virus\nThe trial, which will run for at least a year, is funded by Innovate UK, part of UK Research and Innovation, the national funding agency investing in science and research in the UK."

      "text": "The former MP Austin Mitchell has died at the age of 86, the Labour Party has confirmed. \nMr Mitchell worked as a journalist for Yorkshire Television before being elected to the Great Grimsby constituency in 1977. He held the seat until 2015.\nHe is understood to have died at Leeds General Infirmary on Wednesday morning.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Mitchell had served the voters \"with remarkable commitment for 38 years\".\nMr Mitchell was a colourful figure in the North East Lincolnshire port, even temporarily changing his name by deed poll to Austin Haddock in 2002 in a bid to promote the fishing industry.\n\"There are few MPs whose dedication to their constituents would translate into changing their surname to 'Haddock' to promote local industry\", said Sir Keir. \nTony Blair's former director of communications, Alastair Campbell, said on Twitter: \"Sorry to hear of the death of Austin Mitchell.\n\"Great contact when I was a journo and great company when I was with Labour, even when we disagreed.\n\"Best known of course as an MP, but a place in history as TV Interviewer who did the 'real life' Brian Clough-Don Revie interview immortalised in Damned United. RIP.\"\n\"His big sense of humour was matched by his deep Labour values. My thoughts are with his wife Linda and his children.\" \nFew gave Austin Mitchell a chance of winning Great Grimsby in the by-election that followed the death of Tony Crosland in 1977.\nThe Yorkshire Television presenter was widely seen as an underdog in a contest that came at a difficult time for Labour under Jim Callaghan's leadership. \nBut he won with a majority of 520 votes and held the seat until he stepped down as an MP in 2015. \nWidely seen as on the left of the party, Austin Mitchell campaigned for Britain to leave the EU long before Brexit became part of the political vocabulary. \nHe was a passionate advocate for Grimsby's food and fish processing industry.\nOne of my abiding memories is Austin Mitchell stood on Westminster Bridge in a trawlerman's outfit and clutching a giant fish finger to support a well-known seafood firm. Not many MPs would have ditched their pinstripe suits to do that.\nIn recent times, Austin and his wife Linda produced a series of video diaries for BBC Look North talking about their life in lockdown. \nIt made for hilarious viewing, with the razor-sharp Mitchell wit still going strong in his mid-80s.\nMany political journalists will remember the self-deprecating humour that raised serious issues with a smile. \nGreat Grimsby MP Lia Nici, who won the seat for the Conservatives in 2019, said: \"I am very sad to hear about the loss of my friend and predecessor, Austin Mitchell.\n\"I learned an awful lot from him. He worked incredibly hard for Great Grimsby and will be sadly missed.\"\nMr Mitchell was born in Bradford in 1934 and moved to New Zealand in the late 1950s to lecture at the University of Otago. He returned to the UK in the late 1960s.\nHe was a TV journalist for the nightly Calendar news programme between 1969 and 1977, apart from a brief spell at the BBC in 1972.\nGreat Grimsby Labour Party said: \"His passion for Grimsby knew no bounds. His good humour, kind nature and booming laugh will never be forgotten in our town or our party.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "Aspirin may help fight aggressive breast cancer by making hard-to-treat tumours more responsive to anti-cancer drugs, doctors say.\nA team at the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, in Manchester, are beginning a trial with triple-negative breast-cancer patients. \nThey suspect it is aspirin's anti-inflammatory properties rather than its analgesic effect that gives the boost.\nAnimal studies have already shown encouraging results. \nThere is some evidence aspirin might help prevent certain other cancers and lower the risk of it spreading. \nBut it is too early to recommend people start taking it. More research is needed. \nAbout 8,000 women are diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer in the UK each year - a less common but often more aggressive type of breast cancer that disproportionately affects younger women and black women.\nThese tumours lack receptors some other breast cancers have, meaning certain treatments, such as herceptin, will not work. Although, other medicines and treatments can help. \nIn the trial, funded by a research programme run by the charity Breast Cancer Now, some patients will be given aspirin as well as immunotherapy drug avelumab before they receive surgery and chemotherapy treatment. \nIf it is successful, there could be further clinical trials of aspirin and avelumab for incurable secondary triple-negative breast cancer, when cancer cells that started in the breast spread to other parts of the body.\nBeth Bramall, 44, from Hampshire was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer in 2019.  \nShe said: \"There's no easy cancer but triple negative is particularly gruelling, with few treatment options and a long and debilitating treatment plan.\n\"It floored me, with side-effects of hair loss, nausea, joint and muscle pain, diarrhoea and constipation, burning palms and feet, migraines, night sweats and fatigue like I've never known before.\n\"I'm blessed that I've had a pathological complete response to treatment.\n\"But it's been the hardest 18 months for me and my family.\n\"And I have over two more years of treatments and scans ahead.\"\nTrial lead Dr Anne Armstrong said: \"Not all breast cancers respond well to immunotherapy. \n\"Trialling the use of a drug like aspirin is exciting because it is so widely available and inexpensive to produce. \n\"We hope our trial will show that, when combined with immunotherapy, aspirin can enhance its effects and may ultimately provide a safe new way to treat breast cancer.\"\nCo-researcher Dr Rebecca Lee said their lab findings suggested that aspirin can make certain types of immunotherapy more effective by preventing the cancer from making substances that weaken the immune response. \n\"We hope aspirin can dampen down bad inflammation so the immune system can get on with the job of killing cancer cells,\" she said.

      "text": "A Royal Marine veteran, who founded an animal sanctuary in Kabul, has made an impassioned plea to the UK government to help his staff leave Afghanistan.\nPaul \"Pen\" Farthing said he would not leave them behind to \"suffer a fate\" that the West has put upon them.\nHis charity, Nowzad, wants ministers to \"do the right thing\" by flying 71 people to the UK from Afghanistan after the Taliban seized the capital city.\nThe Foreign Office said it was in contact with Mr Farthing to offer help.\nMr Farthing set up the charity 15 years ago, helping to increase awareness of animal welfare in the country and to rescue stray dogs and abused donkeys.\nHis clinic trained Afghanistan's first fully-qualified female vets but now he fears for their futures. \n\"I don't think there are words to describe what they are feeling right now,\" he told the BBC News, from Kabul.\n\"What do you say to someone who is probably going to be told they will have to marry a Taliban fighter and end up living at home, never being allowed to leave and just raising children with someone they absolutely detest?\"\nMr Farthing, who served with the Royal Marines as a commando in the Afghan province of Helmand in the mid-2000s, said the West \"should hang our heads in shame for what we have just done to this country\".\n\"We gave people hope, aspirations, dreams for the future. In a matter of weeks, we have just ripped them from them.\"\nHe said he was not hopeful the Taliban regime had changed for the better.\nFor now, the eyes of the world were watching the Taliban, he said. \nBut in two months' time, the international community would be gone, the US would have left the airport and no-one would be watching - and if they did go back to their ways, no-one was coming to interfere in Afghanistan again, he added.\nThe British and US servicemen and women who died in Afghanistan - including two of his marines - had died \"in vain\", he said.\n\"We have achieved nothing now - we have just thrown everything away.\"\nIt was while on deployment in Afghanistan in 2006 that Pen Farthing and his troops broke up a fight between two dogs in the town of Nawzad - and one of them followed him back. \nThe pair spent the next six months together and he was given the name Nowzad after the town. At the end of his deployment he sought to bring him back to the UK.\nIt was a move that inspired him to reunite other servicemen and women with dogs and cats they had befriended while serving - and so the charity Nowzad was born.\nThe charity says it currently looks after more than 140 dogs and 40 cats, and has reunited 1,600 soldiers with the dogs and cats they rescued and bonded with while serving in Afghanistan.\nPen Farthing's book, One Dog at a Time, helps promote and fund the sanctuary's work.\nIn an emotional appeal, he pleaded for the government to make an exception for his Afghan staff, who will not fall under the two existing schemes for interpreters and British government workers.\nA campaign is under way on social media but, at the time of his interview with the BBC, Mr Farthing said he had not received any communication from the British government.\nThe Foreign Office said in a statement on Tuesday evening: \"We are in contact with Mr Farthing to offer assistance. \n\"The government's top priority is to do all we can to deliver on our obligations to British nationals, and those who have helped us, and get them out as fast as we can.\"\nVice Adm Sir Ben Key, who is running the UK's evacuation programme in Afghanistan, said the UK hoped to help 6,000 to 7,000 British nationals and eligible Afghan staff to leave - but that figure was dependant on the security situation.\nAfghans considered eligible to resettle in the UK include workers for the British government, interpreters, cultural advisers and embassy staff. Others eligible are those deemed to be at high and imminent risk.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab earlier said the UK was looking at a \"bespoke arrangement\" for Afghan refugees, with full details to be set out in due course.\nA new resettlement scheme will be aimed at helping those most in need - including women and girls - to come to the UK, No 10 has said."

An incredible comic brain and a truly unique voice.\"\nA statement from his agent Off The Kerb Productions said: \"It is with great sadness that we have to announce the death of Sean Lock. He died at home from cancer, surrounded by his family.\n\"Sean was one of Britain's finest comedians, his boundless creativity, lightning wit and the absurdist brilliance of his work, marked him out as a unique voice in British comedy.\n\"Sean was also a cherished husband and father to three children. Sean will be sorely missed by all that knew him. We kindly request that the privacy of his family and children is respected at this difficult time.\"\nFollowing the announcement author, TV producer and Pointless star Richard Osman tweeted: \"Over 15 years producing 8 Out Of 10 Cats, Sean Lock made me laugh so much and so often. A unique and brilliant comic voice. Love to his family and his many friends.\"\n\"Sad news about Sean Lock,\" added stand-up comedian and QI panellist Alan Davies. \"Funny on stage, hilarious off.\"\nComedian and actor Ricky Gervais added: \"Such sad news. RIP the great Sean Lock. One of the funniest, most influential comedians of a generation. A lovely man.\"\nLee Mack, fellow comedian and a close friend of Lock's, described the news of his death as \"heartbreaking\", adding in a statement: \"A true original both in comedy and life. I will miss him so much.\"\nComedy writer Laura Claxton said: \"No one did it like Sean. I got to work with him over the years and seeing his ad libs, improvisation and wit play out first hand like it was the most natural, fluid thing in the world never ceased to astound me. \n\"A truly hilarious, talented, humble and impressive man. What a loss.\"\nChannel 4 announced it will pay tribute to the comedian Sean Lock with special programming on Thursday night.\nThe network will air the comedian's stand-up special, Sean Lock: Keep It Light, followed by a classic episode of 8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown, in Lock's memory.\nBorn in Chertsey, Surrey, Lock left school in the early 1980s and began working on building sites but developed skin cancer, which he blamed on over-exposure to the sun. He recovered and decided to focus on a career in comedy.\nEarly in his TV career, Lock appeared on the 1993 series Newman and Baddiel in Pieces, alongside fellow comics Rob Newman and David Baddiel.\nOn Wednesday, Baddiel said: \"He made all these characters effortlessly funnier than we had written them. He went on to perform with us on our last tour in 1993, the one that ended in Wembley Arena, and I have great - and very funny - memories of sharing a stage, and a dressing room, with him from that time.\n\"He was a supremely talented comedian - and a friend I remember with great fondness.\" \nLock co-wrote the screenplay for the 2001 feature film This Filthy Earth alongside director Andrew K\u00f6tting, which was adapted from the 1887 novel La Terre by \u00c9mile Zola.\nLock was named best live comic at the British Comedy Award in 2000 and has also previously been nominated for the prestigious Perrier Comedy Award.\nIn 2006, he presented and produced  the Channel 4 series TV Heaven, Telly Hell, in which guests would discuss their likes and dislikes in television.\nGuests on the show included Alan Davies, Johnny Vaughan, David Mitchell, Bill Bailey, Johnny Vegas and Nick Hancock.\nLock also appeared at Channel 4's Comedy Gala and co-hosted the Big Fat Quiz of the Year with James Corden in 2008.\nHe wrote and starred in the popular BBC sitcom 15 Storeys High. The show was set in a tower block and centred on a pessimistic character called Vince (played by Lock) and his flatmate Errol, played by Benedict Wong.\nBut Lock was best known as a team captain on 8 Out of 10 Cats, the comedy panel show hosted by Jimmy Carr.\nThe show saw panellists answer questions based on statistics and opinion polls.\nThe show's title is a reference to famous misquoting of an old advertising strapline for Whiskas cat food, which claimed that \"8 out of 10 owners said their cats prefer it\".\nHe appeared on the first 18 series, opposite team captains including Jason Manford and Jon Richardson.\nLock exited the show in 2016 and was replaced by Rob Beckett at the beginning of series 19.\nHe and Richardson also appeared on the spin-off series 8 Out of 10 Cats does Countdown.\n\"I wish I had the words to describe the exceptional man that was Sean Lock. But today I don't, and I think he might have liked it that way,\" tweeted Susie Dent, who features in Countdown's dictionary corner.\nHarry Hill, former host of TV Burp and commentator of You've Been Framed, paid tribute to Lock in an article published in The Guardian.\n\"At his best, Sean reminded us all what we loved about a great gag and why we got into comedy in the first place. That's why he was so often called \"the comedian's comedian\", Hill said.\n\"He took his illness in typically dry style. I heard he was in a hospice for a bit of a rest. I called him up. 'Wow!' I said. 'A hospice, what's that like?' 'It's OK,' he said '\u2026 and the sex is amazing.'\"\nFollowing the news of his death, Comedian Katy Brand said: \"Sean Lock was a brilliant comedian and I always learned something watching him work. Thoughts with his friends and family. Very shocking and sad. RIP.\"\nPresenter Gabby Logan, who has appeared alongside Sean Lock on 8 Out Of 10 Cats, paid tribute to the comedian \"who could make your cheeks ache from laughing\".\nShe said on Twitter: \"Just awful to hear the news about Sean Lock, I was lucky enough to watch his genius comedy up close when appearing on 8/10 Cats a good few times. Love and light to all of his family and friends.\"\nFormer QI host Stephen Fry said: \"I think it safe to say that the best episodes of QI that I was involved with were always the ones where Sean Lock was a guest. Such complete brilliance in every comic direction. What a loss. My heart goes out to his family.\"\nJohn Bishop tweeted: \"I am shocked and saddened at the news of the loss of Sean Lock. He was a brilliant comedian but more importantly he was a great person on so many levels . He will be missed hugely.\"\nKevin Bridges described Lock as \"brilliant comedian, obviously, but just a genuinely hilarious guy too and one of the soundest guys in comedy,\" while Diane Morgan added: \"He was one of the funniest people I've ever met. 15 Stories High was was absolute genius. I'll miss him so much.\""

No one else was around.\nRecognising it instantly as a diamond python, Ms Alati knew it wasn't venomous as it protruded and flicked its tongue.\n\"He was looking straight at me the whole time, almost like he was saying: 'Can you take me outside please?'\" she said.\nAfter filming the snake, Ms Alati alerted staff and said she could help them get it out.\nShe retrieved a snake bag from her home, returned to the store, \"tapped him on the tail and he just slithered in\". \nShe then released it away from houses in bushland - a natural habitat for the species around Sydney.\nA trained snake handler, Ms Alati has conducted at least 20 snake rescues before.\nShe says her friends have previously joked about her being \"the snake girl\", referencing a zoo scene in a Harry Potter film where the boy wizard finds that he can talk to snakes. \nMs Alati says she can't speak Parseltongue like Harry, but \"that scene's been mentioned to me a few times\".\n\"They kind of just gravitate to me, like maybe they just sense that I'm the kind of person into caring and protecting animals,\" she said.\n\"To be honest, it's the most exciting thing that's happened in a little while given lockdown. The staff were all taking photos of it.\"\nAustralia's largest city has been in a lockdown since June to fight a Delta outbreak. Grocery shopping is one of the few reasons people are allowed to leave their homes.\nMs Alati said she suspected the snake had been in the shop overnight, probably initially in the ceiling where diamond pythons like to nestle.\nIt had probably lurked on the shelf all morning as \"dozens of people... passed it and grabbed spices\", she added."

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The Biden administration's rush for the exit in Afghanistan has been accompanied by a similar rush to judgement among pundits and commentators who, by and large, have castigated the US president for a decision that many see as unnecessary and a betrayal, both of those who served in Afghanistan and of the Afghan people themselves. \nThe heartbreaking images from the airport in Kabul only reinforce this message. And there is justifiably a good deal of emotion to go round. The West has invested a lot of blood, time and money in Afghanistan. The Afghan people, much, much, more. \nIt is hard to argue with the criticism of the Biden administration's precipitate departure. Afghanistan may indeed be un-salvageable, its governing structures too unrepresentative and corrupt. This though only underscores the argument that Afghanistan was not \"lost\" in the past two years but during the previous 20.\nNonetheless the decision to cut and run is being seen as a terrible blow to US credibility - to its reliability as a partner, and indeed to its moral standing in world affairs. How does this square with Mr Biden's clarion cry on taking office, that America was back?\nComparisons are being made with Vietnam - the similarities with helicopters shuttling US nationals away from a falling city being too much for the newspaper front-pages to resist. But in reality - despite the superficial similarities -there are some important differences, too. \nSouth Vietnam collapsed some two years after US troops left. Indeed it looks as though the Americans expected their Afghan allies to soldier on for a significant period without them. The US was humbled by Vietnam - its population deeply divided and its military morale damaged. But while Vietnam turned out to be a tragic side-show in the Cold War, the US still ultimately won that contest. Nato was not weakened. US allies around the globe did not shy away from expecting US support. The US remained the pre-eminent superpower. \nAfghanistan is altogether different. Internal divisions in the US over this conflict have in no way been comparable to Vietnam's. The Afghanistan mission was certainly unpopular at home but there were no mass rallies against it. \nCrucially though, today's international context is dramatically different from that of the 1970s. The US - indeed the West in general - is engaged in multiple contests, in few of which they are outright winners. The Afghan collapse is potentially a disaster in the so-called war on terror. But in the wider conflict between democracy and authoritarianism, Washington's failure can only be seen as a serious set-back. \nThere will be smiles in Moscow and Beijing, at least for now. The Western model of liberal interventionism - promoted as a means of spreading democracy and the rule of law - has perhaps been tested to destruction in Afghanistan. One cannot see much enthusiasm for similar undertakings in the future.\nThose of Washington's allies who joined in the Afghanistan project are smarting. They feel badly let down. Even British ministers, jealous of their oft touted \"special relationship\" with Washington, have been openly critical of President Biden's decision. \nAnd for America's European allies in general, it underscores how dependent they are upon the US and how little their views count once the White House decides to go in one particular direction.\nSo bad news for the West. But how long-lasting will be the smiles in Beijing, Moscow and even Islamabad? It was Pakistan that nurtured and gave safe haven to the Taliban for its own geo-strategic purposes. But if renewed Taliban rule produces a simple turning back of the clock - if international terrorism finds a renewed haven - then Pakistan may find that the growing turbulence in the region has decidedly negative consequences.\nChina is happy to see the US failure. Indeed, if Mr Biden's reason to pull out from Afghanistan was due to his desire to re-focus US national power to rival a rising China, then this step has simply given China an opportunity to expand its own influence in Afghanistan and beyond.\nChina, though, must have concern, too. Its shares a short border with Afghanistan. It is actively persecuting its own Muslim minority and must be concerned at the possibility that anti-Beijing Islamist terrorists might seek to use Afghanistan as a base. No wonder then that Chinese diplomacy over recent weeks has been so eager to court the Taliban. \nRussia, too, must have worries about the return of instability and terrorism. Maybe it feels a little better about itself now that the US has similarly been humbled by Afghan tribal fighters, just as the Soviet Union was in the late-1980s.\nBut its chief interest is the security of a large part of Central Asia, many of whose states are allies of Moscow. This summer Russia moved tanks to the Tajikistan-Afghan frontier for exercises intended to demonstrate its determination to prevent any spill-over from an Afghan collapse. \nSo in the short-term, the Afghan debacle certainly benefits the West's opponents. But their attitudes were not going to change anyway. \nWhat really matters are the ramifications among Washington's allies. What will they take away from the Afghan experience? Beyond the immediate crisis, will the NATO countries, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea or Japan see the US as a less reliable partner? If they do, then Mr Biden's decision to quit Afghanistan will prove fateful, indeed."

      "tags": "Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "When the Taliban delivered their first news conference since seizing control of Afghanistan on Tuesday, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid was doing most of the talking. \nMr Mujahid fielded a wide-range of questions from reporters in the historic press conference, in which he claimed that the rights of women would be respected \"within the framework of Islamic law\".\nFor most journalists watching, something else was also significant: it was the first time they had seen his face. For years he has operated in the shadows, only a voice on the end of the phone.\nThe BBC's Yalda Hakim says she was \"shocked\" to see the face of a man she had been speaking to for more than a decade, answering the first question from a female journalist.\nThe spokesman sought to strike a tone of conciliation, telling another reporter: \"We don't want any internal or external enemies.\" \nBut Ms Hakim says this is a far cry from some of the messages she used to receive from him.\n\"Some of these texts were hardcore Islamist texts. Some of those you think: 'This guy is bloodthirsty for the Americans, he's bloodthirsty for anyone in the Afghan government.' Then today he sits there and says there will be no reprisals,\" she says. \n\"For years he has sent out these bloodthirsty statements and now he's suddenly peace loving? It's hard to reconcile.\"\nIn fact Mr Mujahid was sitting in the seat which until recently belonged to Dawa Khan Menapal, the director of Afghanistan's media and information centre, who was assassinated by Taliban militants earlier this month. \nMr Mujahid claimed responsibility at the time and said Mr Menapal \"was killed in a special attack\".\nMany other reporters have been tweeting about witnessing Mr Mujahid, including veteran BBC journalist, John Simpson, who called him \"a relatively moderate, pleasant man\".\nBut for years there has been speculation as to whether the faceless spokesman might actually be more than one person.\nLyse Doucet, the BBC's chief international correspondent, said these discussions were going on long before the days of social media, when reporters had to call him on a landline. Some have suggested that the man sitting in front of the cameras on Tuesday looked too young to be the same person fielding questions for all those years. \n\"There has been speculation for years that it was a made up name, that there were many \"Zabihullahs\" who took turns. Now of course we are all accepting this is THE Zabihullah Mujahid. Maybe he isn't?\" Ms Doucet says.  \nMs Hakim says the mystery is all part of the Taliban playbook. \n\"That's what the Taliban are, they're organised and ideological - nothing is done by accident. To create mystery around a single person, suddenly he appears on screen - you couldn't write the script better,\" she says. \nRegardless whether Mr Mujahid is one person or not, Ms Hakim says she was wary of his words on Tuesday despite his efforts to appear measured. \n\"The caveat was really the sharia law - that sent chills down my spine,\" she says. \"They still haven't laid out what that looks like.\"\n\"That's the thing with the Taliban - they're deceptive, they're charming, they know how to use the right language, but you're never quite sure whether you should believe them or not,\" she says. \n\"There is a lot of mystery ... but do we really know who they are?\""

And it accused Home Depot of warning employees not to engage in \"activity regarding racial harassment\". \n\"Issues of racial harassment directly impact the working conditions of employees,\" said NRLB regional director Jennifer Hadsall.\n\"The National Labor Relations Act protects employees' rights to raise these issues with the goal of improving their working conditions. It is this important right we seek to protect in this case.\"   \nThe independent watchdog said it wanted Home Depot to post notice at all of its US stores advising employees of their rights. \nBut the retailer said the NRLB had mischaracterised the situation and that it looked forward to \"sharing the facts\" with the watchdog. \n\"Regardless of the outcome, we will continue to be fully committed to diversity and respect for all people,\" Ms Gorman added. \nLast year, workers at Whole Foods sued the US supermarket for punishing them for wearing Black Lives Matter masks.\nThe federal lawsuit said the firm discriminated against black staff by selectively enforcing its dress code. \nHowever, in February, a US District Judge threw out most of the lawsuit, saying Whole Foods and its parent, Amazon, had not engaged in racial discrimination or violated Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act - which specifically prohibits discrimination in the terms and conditions of employment.\nA number of the plaintiffs who were fired for not changing their dress code have appealed."

      "title": "IMF suspends Afghanistan's access to funds",
      "tags": "International Monetary Fund (IMF),Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said Afghanistan will no longer be able to access the lender's resources. \nThe move follows the Taliban's takeover of the country last weekend.\nAn IMF spokesperson said it was due to \"lack of clarity within the international community\" over recognising a government in Afghanistan. \nResources of over $370m (\u00a3268m) from the IMF had been set to arrive on 23 August.\nThese funds were part of a global IMF response to the economic crisis.\nAccess to the IMF's reserves in Special Drawing Rights (SDR) assets, which can be converted to government-backed money, have also been blocked. SDRs are the IMF's unit of exchange based on sterling, dollars, euros, yen and yuan. \n\"As is always the case, the IMF is guided by the views of the international community,\" the spokesperson added. \nIt comes after an official from the Biden administration told the BBC that any central bank assets the Afghan government has in the US will not be made available to the Taliban. \nIn a letter to the US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Congress members called for assurances that the Taliban would receive no US-backed aid. \n\"The potential of the SDR allocation to provide nearly half a billion dollars in unconditional liquidity to a regime with a history of supporting terrorist actions against the United States and her allies is extremely concerning,\" 17 signatories wrote. \nEarlier, the head of Afghanistan's central bank said the US had cut off access to its assets - around $7bn of which are held at the U.S. Federal Reserve. \nAjmal Ahmady, who fled the country at the weekend, tweeted that Da Afghanistan Bank's total reserves were approximately $9bn as of last week.\nBut he said as per international standards, most of this was held in safe, liquid assets such as US Treasury bonds and gold offshore.\n\"Given that the Taliban are still on international sanction lists, it is expected (confirmed?) that such assets will be frozen and not accessible to Taliban,\" Mr Ahmady tweeted.\n\"We can say the accessible funds to the Taliban are perhaps 0.1-0.2% of Afghanistan's total international reserves. Not much.\"\nMr Ahmady added that Washington's suspended shipments of physical dollars were causing Afghanistan's currency to depreciate. The Afghan currency, the Afghani, has fallen to record lows.\n\"I believe local banks have told customers that they cannot return their dollars \u2014 because [Da Afghanistan Bank] has not supplied banks with dollars,\" he tweeted. \n\"This is true. Not because funds have been stolen or being held in vault, but because all dollars are in international accounts that have been frozen.\"\nIn June, the IMF gave Afghanistan its latest loan instalment which was approved in November. In the same month, the UN published a report which stated that the \"primary sources of Taliban financing remain criminal activities,\" including \"drug trafficking and opium poppy production, extortion, kidnapping for ransom, mineral exploitation and revenues from tax collection in areas under Taliban control or influence.\"\nThe World Bank also funds many development projects in the country and has provided Afghanistan with $5.3bn since 2002. It has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment on the current status of this funding. \nIndependent money transfer giant Western Union has also suspended money transfer services to Afghanistan \"until further notice\".\nThe IMF has taken similar steps against other regimes not recognised by a majority of its members. This happened in April 2019 when SDR access was blocked after more than 50 member countries refused to recognise President Nicolas Maduro as the legitimate leader of Venezuela. The IMF also halted payments to Myanmar after the military junta seized control. \nOn Monday, the IMF will complete a $650bn allocation of SDRs to its 190 member countries.\nThe sudden advances made by the Taliban left the IMF with an urgent decision. It is about to hand out to almost all its members a reserve asset called special drawing rights. It's an exercise that is not about Afghanistan. It's about reinforcing the global economic recovery from the pandemic related crisis. And it's happening on Monday. \nSo if the new regime in Kabul were to be excluded at this stage the IMF had to move quickly. And it has done so, reflecting what a spokesperson called a lack of clarity about the recognition of the government. That is what lies behind the IMF decision at this stage. \nIt does also raise the possibility that financial assistance might come to be used as leverage to encourage the Taliban not to allow the abuses that many fear - and that some reports say are already taking place.

      "tags": "Social media,Disinformation,Fake News,Twitter",
      "text": "Twitter is introducing a way to report posts as \"misleading\" for the first time. \nMany of the large social media networks have been accused of not doing enough to fight the spread of disinformation during the Covid pandemic and US election campaigns.\nTwitter's reporting function has never offered a clear option for such posts. \nIt said the new feature was only a test, and will only be available in a few countries to begin with. \n\"Some people\" in Australia, South Korea, and the United States will now see an option for \"it's misleading\" when trying to report a tweet, the tech giant said.\nIt also warned users that the system may not have a significant effect.\n\"We're assessing if this is an effective approach so we're starting small,\" the company said on its safety account.\n\"We may not take action on and cannot respond to each report in the experiment, but your input will help us identify trends so that we can improve the speed and scale of our broader misinformation work.\" \nTwitter plans to eventually launch the feature in other countries around the world. \nCurrently, someone reporting misinformation must choose from options such as \"it's suspicious or spam\" or \"it's abusive or harmful\" - and then narrow that down to more specific sub-categories to make a report.  \nBecause the options are so specific, it can often be unclear which one to use.\nIf I had a penny for how many times people message me asking why there's no option to report misinformation on Twitter, I'd be a very rich woman. \nSince the start of the pandemic, pressure has mounted on social media sites to do more to combat a wave of harmful falsehoods that have spread online.  \nThat includes unfounded conspiracies about Covid-19 and vaccines, as well as surrounding last year's US election, which went on to inspire the riots at Capitol Hill and saw US President Donald Trump's account suspended.  \nI've spent the past year-and-a-half covering the real-world impact of misleading posts online - scaring people off Covid jabs, destroying relationships, and provoking violence.  \nSome critics argue that the option to report misinformation should have been introduced months ago to help prevent this offline harm. But the question remains - what impact will this really have? \nThere are fears that the social media site will struggle to moderate the avalanche of content reported - including from those promoting falsehoods, who then flag accurate information as misleading.  \nTwitter has focused on issuing suspensions and bans to accounts which consistently spread harmful Covid-19 misinformation when they come to the company's attention.\nIt also began putting warning labels on such tweets in early 2020, announced a collaboration with news organisations as part of an attempt to debunk false information, and started a pilot scheme in January to allow a small number of people to submit \"notes\" about misleading content. \nHowever, Twitter and other tech giants continue to be criticised for the spread of false information. \nChief executives have repeatedly appeared before US politicians to answer questions about their policies, while  groups such as the Center for Countering Digital Hate have accused them of not doing enough to combat vaccine misinformation - among other forms of harm."

      "tags": "Physics,Imperial College London,Nuclear fusion ,Climate change,California",
      "text": "A US science institute is on the verge of achieving a longstanding goal in nuclear fusion research.\nThe National Ignition Facility uses a powerful laser to heat and compress hydrogen fuel, initiating fusion.\nAn experiment suggests the goal of \"ignition\", where the energy released by fusion exceeds that delivered by the laser, is now within touching distance.\nHarnessing fusion, the process that powers the Sun, could provide a limitless, clean energy source.\nIn a process called inertial confinement fusion, 192 beams from NIF's laser - the highest-energy example in the world - are directed towards a peppercorn-sized capsule containing deuterium and tritium, which are different forms of the element hydrogen.\nThis compresses the fuel to 100 times the density of lead and heats it to 100 million degrees Celsius - hotter than the centre of the Sun. These conditions help kickstart thermonuclear fusion.\nAn experiment carried out on 8 August yielded 1.35 megajoules (MJ) of energy - around 70% of the laser energy delivered to the fuel capsule. Reaching ignition means getting a fusion yield that's greater than the 1.9 MJ put in by the laser.\n\"This is a huge advance for fusion and for the entire fusion community,\" Debbie Callahan, a physicist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which hosts NIF, told BBC News. \nAs a measure of progress, the yield from this month's experiment is eight times NIF's previous record, established in Spring 2021, and 25 times the yield from experiments carried out in 2018.\n\"The pace of improvement in energy output has been rapid, suggesting we may soon reach more energy milestones, such as exceeding the energy input from the lasers used to kick-start the process,\" said Prof Jeremy Chittenden, co-director of the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College London.\nNIF scientists also believe they have now achieved something called \"burning plasma\", where the fusion reactions themselves provide the heat for more fusion. This is vital for making the process self-sustaining.\n\"Self-sustaining burn is essential to getting high yield,\" Dr Callahan explained. \"The burn wave has to propagate into the high density fuel in order to get a lot of fusion energy out. \n\"We believe this experiment is in this regime, although we are still doing analysis and simulations to be sure that we understand the result.\"\nAs a next step, Dr Callahan said the experiments would be repeated. \"That's fundamental to experimental science. We need to understand how reproducible and how sensitive the results are to small changes,\" she said.  \n\"After that, we do have ideas for how to improve on this design and we will start working on those next year.\" \nProf Chittenden explained: \"The mega-joule of energy released in the experiment is indeed impressive in fusion terms, but in practice this is equivalent to the energy required to boil a kettle.\"\nHe added: \"Far higher fusion energies can be achieved through ignition if we can work out how to hold the fuel together for longer, to allow more of it to burn. This will be the next horizon for inertial confinement fusion.\"\nExisting nuclear energy relies on a process called fission, where a heavy chemical element is split to produce lighter ones. Fusion works by combining two light elements to make a heavier one.\nConstruction on the National Ignition Facility began in 1997 and was complete by 2009. The first experiments to test the laser's power began in October 2010.\nNIF's other function is to help ensure the safety and reliability of America's nuclear weapons stockpile. At times, scientists who want to use the huge laser for fusion have had their time squeezed by experiments geared towards national security.\nBut in 2013, the BBC reported that during experiments at NIF, the amount of energy released through fusion had exceeded the amount of energy absorbed by the fuel - a breakthrough and a first for any fusion facility in the world. Results from these tests were later published in the journal Nature.\nNIF is one of several projects around the world geared towards advancing fusion research. They include the multi-billion-euro Iter facility, currently under construction in Cadarache, France.\nIter will take a different approach to the laser-driven fusion at NIF; the facility in southern France will use magnetic fields to contain hot plasma - electrically-charged gas. This concept is known as magnetic confinement fusion (MCF).\nBut building commercially viable fusion facilities that can provide energy to the grid will require another giant leap.\n\"Turning this concept into a renewable source of electrical energy is likely to be a long process and will involve overcoming substantial technical challenges, such as being able to re-create this experiment several times a second to produce a steady source of power,\" said Prof Chittenden.\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "text": "Former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood says she and Adam Price \"have not been friends for years\" since he challenged her for the party leadership in 2018.\nMs Wood, Plaid leader for six years, said Mr Price's timing and the way it happened were \"a bad judgement call\".\nShe said the party had gone backwards since. In May's Senedd election, she lost her Rhondda seat.\nPlaid Cymru praised her \"invaluable contribution\" to the party but said it was proud of being \"member-led\".\nThis, it said, gave \"the leader a clear mandate through leadership elections\".\nMr Price has previously described how the decision to challenge one of his \"oldest friends in politics\" was \"the most difficult thing I've had to wrestle with in my political life\".\nBut he said deep friendships could survive \"this kind of thing\" and had felt the party was at an impasse.\nMs Wood was elected Plaid leader in 2012, before losing the position in the 2018 contest, where she came last behind Adam Price and fellow challenger Rhun ap Iorwerth. \nShe had won the seat of Rhondda from Labour in 2016 - a prized constituency for Plaid Cymru which has sought to expand its reach in the south Wales valleys.\nBut Plaid failed to make further inroads at May's Senedd election. It lost Rhondda and came third behind the Conservatives overall, though it gained an extra seat.\nMr Price was voted into the top job by Plaid Cymru members in the autumn of 2018.\nEarlier that year he threatened to challenge Ms Wood for the post if she did not agree to share the job, accusing the party of \"predictable, plodding politics\" at the time.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Walescast politics podcast, Ms Wood said the co-leadership proposal was \"unconstitutional\".\n\"I don't feel like it was done correctly really and probably that's part of why it's been quite difficult,\" she said.\n\"We're not friends now. We haven't been friends for years.\"\nAsked if that had been difficult to deal with, she replied: \"Losing a friendship is difficult isn't it?\n\"And losing a friendship under these political circumstances, when the project you believe in and is getting somewhere is stopped, that adds an extra layer of difficulty.\"\nIn the midst of the chaos that engulfed the political scene after the Brexit referendum of 2016, many supporters of the Remain campaign called for a second vote to be held.\nAs leader, Ms Wood initially accepted the leave result but she also told a special party conference that Plaid should \"stand up for all those who voted to remain\".\nIn October 2017 she said Plaid could support a second referendum if no exit deal was agreed by March 2019.\nMs Wood told Walescast the policy shift was not something she supported, and that she argued behind the scenes that the 2016 result - where Wales voted leave - should be respected.\n\"I always thought the idea of a second referendum was a really bad idea,\" she said. \nMs Wood said the \"pressure was immense\" from Mr Price and others within the party to back a new EU poll, support for which increased under him.\n\"I really felt very, very strongly that if you ask people a question in a democracy you have to accept the result, no matter how much you don't like it.\n\"I spent a lot of time internally within Plaid Cymru trying to persuade people that we needed to accept this result, trying to persuade people that the messages and the words we were using to describe what had happened were causing great anger amongst people in some places. \n\"But it was a debate that people couldn't face I think.\"\nAs party leader Mr Price made independence a cornerstone of his party's platform, setting up a commission to look at how the party should prepare for holding a referendum.\nAt the 2021 Senedd election, he promised an independence referendum within five years if Plaid won a majority of seats.\nIt was a significant contrast to Ms Wood's approach and she told Walescast not enough ground work had been done to give answers for \"some of the very real questions\" voters had.\n\"It's no good just saying 'let's do it, let's go' because the only people you're going to take with you there are the people who are already behind that idea.\"\nHaving lost her seat, Ms Wood said she had no plans to return to front-line politics. \n\"I've decided to take some time out now over the summer to relax and reflect,\" she said.\n\"I've not had time off for a long time where I've not had something to do or some case to be concerned about or somebody to watch out for behind you.\n\"So it's refreshing and good for my well-being to be able take this time out.\"\nA Plaid spokesman said: \"Leanne Wood has made an invaluable contribution to the work of Plaid Cymru and will undoubtedly continue to play an important role within wider Welsh public life in future.\n\"Plaid Cymru is proud of being a member-led party that empowers its membership to take key decisions, including granting the leader a clear mandate through leadership elections.\""

      "text": "The owner of a condemned alpaca has vowed to fight on despite losing a last-ditch attempt to save the animal. \nHelen Macdonald said she will \"obstruct\" anyone who comes to her farm to put eight-year-old Geronimo down.\nHe has twice tested positive for bovine tuberculosis, and the Department of Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) ordered him to be euthanised.\nAn application for an injunction to halt the destruction order was refused at London's High Court earlier.\nMs Macdonald said: \"It's not changed my mind. I haven't done this for four years to just roll over.\n\"There was always a principle at stake here about valid testing for all animals in the UK, proper science and we're just not getting it. I'm just disgusted really by the whole attitude.\"\nMs Macdonald, who owns a farm at Wickwar, South Gloucestershire, has received public support over the past few weeks, with more than 130,000 people signing a petition calling on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to halt the killing.\n\"It's not over. They seem to want to make it my decision, and make me put my animal to sleep, to get the blood off their hands. I'm not doing it,\" she said.\nAsked what she will do if officials arrive at her property, she added: \"Well, we'll just obstruct. I don't want to break the law. I'm not a criminal. They're trying to make me into one but I'm not a criminal. I will obstruct anyone who comes on to my farm.\"\nIn the High Court on Wednesday afternoon, Mrs Justice Stacey refused the urgent application for an injunction and concluded there was \"no prospect\" of Ms Macdonald succeeding in her bid to reopen a previous ruling.\nShe said the farmer's complaint about non-disclosure did not give rise to an arguable case, but was a \"disingenuous and backdoor way of seeking a further route to appeal\" when there was none left.\nNed Westaway, representing Defra and the Animal and Plant Health Agency, told the court it will not seek to execute the warrant on Wednesday evening, and would give Ms Macdonald the opportunity to make her own arrangements for Geronimo's destruction.\nRepresenting Ms Macdonald, Catrin McGahey QC, told the High Court it had come to light that other animals subjected to the same testing regime as Geronimo had shown no signs of the disease after being euthanised.\nHowever, Mrs Justice Stacey said that on the evidence before her, Ms Macdonald had not succeeded in showing there was any prospect of her reopening the litigation.\n\"There are no plans to execute the warrant today,\" said a Defra spokesperson after the hearing. \n\"We are sympathetic to Ms Macdonald's situation, just as we are with everyone with animals affected by this terrible disease.\n\"It is for this reason that the testing results and options for Geronimo have been very carefully considered by Defra, the Animal and Plant Health Agency and its veterinary experts, as well as passing several stages of thorough legal scrutiny.\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Scotland Education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Exams will go ahead as normal next year if it is safe for them to do so, the Scottish government has confirmed. \nIt said National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher exams would be held in spring 2022 providing public health advice allows them to take place.\nIt was previously confirmed that course content would be reduced to take account of the disruption due to Covid. \nFormal exams were cancelled for the past two years because of the pandemic. \nDue to continued uncertainty about Covid, two contingency plans will remain in place: \nScotland's education secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, said fairness for learners would be at the heart of the plans.  \nShe said: \"Contingencies offer stability for teachers and learners in the coming academic session and will allow their focus to be on normal practices in teaching, learning and assessment.\"\nMs Somerville added that detailed guidance would be issued by the Scottish Qualifications Authority \"at the earliest opportunity\". \nBut the Scottish Conservatives questioned why the government was only giving a \"belated update\" after schools had returned from the summer holiday, and said it had still failed to give an \"outright guarantee\" that exams will definitely go ahead. \nThe party's education spokesman, Oliver Mundell, said: \"That will only serve to create more uncertainty for pupils, teachers and parents who have gone above and beyond during the pandemic.\n\"The SNP have presided over a shambolic and chaotic exam system over the last couple of years. It has shamefully hit our poorest pupils the hardest.\"\nThere's a big debate about to kick off on a national scale around whether we should, in fact, have exams at all. \nThe Scottish Qualifications Authority is being scrapped and a government commission will look into how we test young people in the future. \nThat's a conversation to be had with the luxury of time and with a little distance from the past two years which have been extremely disruptive for pupils, parents and teachers. \nWhat they want to know right now is not the answers to big theoretical questions but the answers to the basics: what do I need to learn and what do I need to teach to make this year a much smoother ride for everyone. \nA plan for standard exams to take place means they now know what to aim for. Having not one, but two back-up plans shows the government is still nervous about what the next few months could bring. \nOne of the main reasons cited for the cancellation of formal exams earlier this year was the patchy nature of the disruption caused by pupils having to isolate.\nIt was thought unfair to have pupils who had been in class facing the same exam as those who had been forced to self-isolate at home multiple times.\nHowever, there was still criticism about the way grades were decided.\nSenior pupils sitting National 5s, Highers and Advanced Highers complained that assessments which replaced exams were just \"exams by another name\", after some pupils had to do the tests under similar conditions - but with much less preparation. \nGrades were then awarded on \"teacher judgement\", which had to be backed up by evidence gathered in tests.\nSince then, the government has announced it is replacing the SQA, and has announced a commission to look into the way pupils are assessed in future.\nThe Scottish government also said temporary Covid recovery funding which has been used to fund an extra 1,400 teachers and 250 support staff would be made permanent. It said Scotland's councils would receive an extra \u00a380m annually from next April. \nIt added that this was in addition to the \u00a365.5m permanent additional funding already announced for local authorities to recruit a further additional 1,000 teachers and 500 support staff. \nThe exam diet which had been due to take place in 2020 was scrapped entirely due to the pandemic. Instead, teachers were asked to estimate pupils' grades. \nHowever, a moderation system downgraded 125,000 results. Following an outcry, the Scottish government agreed that where a pupil had been downgraded  by the moderation system the original teachers' scores would be accepted after all.\nThe U-turn came after many pupils complained they had been given lower grades than they had achieved in prelim exams at the start of the year, while the moderation system was criticised over claims it unfairly penalised pupils at schools which had historically not performed as well. \nTeaching union the EIS said it would have preferred to see exams by-passed for S4 students in the interests of \"supporting education recovery and wellbeing\".\nIts general secretary, Larry Flanagan, said: \"It remains to be seen whether the reductions in course content for this year as recognition that young people have been adversely affected by the pandemic, through no fault of their own, will suffice. \n\"It is essential that appropriate and robust contingencies are in place should it be necessary to cancel the exam diet on public health grounds. \n\"We saw earlier this year the damage caused by decisions being made too late without adequate contingences in place and the huge workload and stress that was placed on students and staff as a result.\"\nFiona Robertson, SQA chief executive and Scotland's chief examining officer, said \"clear and timely information\" about next year's assessments was important, adding that the SQA would work to \"deliver credible qualifications\".

      "text": "All 16 and 17-year-olds in Wales will receive their offer of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of this week, Health Minister Eluned Morgan has said.\nIt follows guidance from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on vaccinating over 16s.\nThere are about 67,142 people in that age group in Wales.\nWalk-in clinics are open throughout Wales so people can receive a dose at their convenience.\nSo far, just under 22,000 people aged 16 and 17 have been given first doses - nearly a third of the age group.\nMeanwhile, about 76% of those aged 18 to 29 have now taken up first doses, but that still leaves nearly 117,350 people.\nHealth boards have been running mobile clinics, speaking to large employers and setting up transport to vaccination centres, as well as working with vulnerable people on a one-to-one basis.\nA mobile vaccination unit will be at the Pembrokeshire Show, despite the event only being open to participants this year.\n\"Our vaccination programme is world leading, but we know that there are still some people who have yet to take up the offer of a vaccine,\" Ms Morgan said.\nThe percentage of Covid infections being reported in younger people is much higher than in previous waves.\nMeanwhile, an appeal has been issued for all attendees of a year 11 pupils' graduation party held at the Cwrt Bleddyn hotel near Usk, Monmouthshire, last Wednesday, to get a PCR test. \nYear 11 pupils age between 15 and 16, so many will not yet have been offered a Covid vaccine.\nMultiple councils have joined Public Health Wales (PHW) in the appeal after a significant number of positive cases were linked to attendance at the private event held at the hotel.\nNewport band Goldie Lookin Chain (GLC) released a new song encouraging people to get the jab after all members had been vaccinated.\nThe music video was filmed at a walk-in vaccination centre in Newport, in the streets surrounding the Kingsway shopping centre and the band appears at the Welsh government's press room in Cathays Park.\nRhys Hutchings from GLC, said: \"We are all well excited to be getting back on stage and into the studio now that everyone is getting the vax. We should all be able to get back to work safely now.\n\"Get both jabs if you haven't already, the people down at the centres are well nice and it's free too.\"\nMs Morgan added: \"We are really grateful to Goldie Lookin Chain for helping promote and support vaccine uptake.\n\"If you haven't had a vaccine yet, it's never too late. All health boards have appointments available.\"\nIn England, 16 and 17-year-olds are expected to be offered a first dose by 23 August.\nMeanwhile, the inequality gap in Covid vaccine uptake among black, Asian and minority ethnic groups and the white population is narrowing, according to latest PHW figures.  \nThe largest inequality between ethnic groups involves those aged 30 to 39 years. In the month to 5 August, 62.6% of those in their 30s from BAME backgrounds had taken up a first dose, compared to 79.5% from the white population.\nThere are still 9,667 BAME people in their 30s who have not had a first dose in Wales - as well as 65,374 in the white population in that age group.\nWales' case rate has risen to 196.6 cases per 100,000 people. Although this is the highest since 22 January, when the second wave was easing, there is now a different landscape in the pandemic, set against restrictions easing and the vaccine programme having kicked in.\nPositive tests are averaging 885 a day, higher now than at the same point in the second wave. It remains close to the \"most likely scenario\" modelled by scientists earlier this summer, while we are seeing nothing like the same number of people in hospital and dying compared to the same point of the second wave.\nFour deaths were reported on Wednesday by PHW - three in Betsi Cadwaladr and one in Cardiff and Vale. Three happened on Sunday and one on Saturday.\nThere have been seven deaths in the past week - averaging one a day. The average was 27 deaths a day at the same point in the second wave.\nThere were 139 patients with confirmed Covid in hospital on Wednesday - a daily average of 132 - it was 131 the week before, but seven times higher at this point in the second wave.\nThere were 22 confirmed and suspected Covid admissions on Tuesday. The rolling average is 15 a day, compared to 13 a week before."

This is the point at which stamp duty holidays became less generous in England and Wales, and many thousands of deals were rushed through to beat the deadline.\nThe tax break led to significant movement at the top end of the market. More recent data suggest some of the heat has come out of the market for more expensive detached homes since the end of June.\nHowever, Land Registry data show that there was also demand, and rapidly rising prices, among semi-detached and terraced homes.\nIn some cases, buyers would have benefited from lower stamp duty levies, but there was also a lifestyle choice involved for some amid the pandemic.\nIn areas where relatively few properties were on the market, failing to match demand, prices continued to grow. These included some coastal and rural locations.\nMortgage rates are also at historically low levels. That means buyers in a position to put down a significant deposit have to pay very little interest on home loans.\nKate Allen, owner at lettings firm Salcombe Finest, in Devon, said: \"This overheated market continues to cook and it looks like we've got a property heatwave forecast for the rest of the year.\"\nOthers suggest that any slower than expected return to normality for the economy, a resulting pressure on jobs, and the end of tax breaks could cool the market in many areas.\n\"As for later this year and early next, the expectation is that while we won't necessarily see prices fall, a period of zero or negligible house price growth is most likely,\" said Scott Taylor-Barr, of Shropshire-based mortgage broker, Carl Summers Financial Services."

      "text": "The Taliban took many by surprise as they swept across Afghanistan in just 10 days in August, quickly taking control of towns and cities. \nThe militant group has announced an interim government, declaring the country an \"Islamic Emirate\". \nThe cabinet will be led by Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund, one of the movement's founders.\nSo, here's what is known about who is leading the Taliban today. \nHibatullah Akhundzada became the supreme commander of the Taliban in May 2016, and is now leader of the so-called Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.\nIn the 1980s, he participated in the Islamist resistance against the Soviet military campaign in Afghanistan, but his reputation is more that of a religious leader than a military commander.\nAkhundzada worked as head of the Sharia Courts in the 1990s.\nAfter first seizing power in the 1990s, the Taliban introduced and supported punishments according to their strict interpretation of Islamic law: they publicly executed murderers and adulterers and amputated thieves' limbs.\nUnder the leadership of the reclusive Mullah Mohammed Omar (who is thought to have died in 2013), the Taliban also banned television, music, movies, make-up, and stopped girls aged 10 and over from attending school.\nAkhundzada is believed to be in his 60s and has lived most of his life in Afghanistan. \nHowever, according to experts, he maintains close ties with the so-called \"Quetta Shura\" - the Afghan Taliban leaders said to be based in the Pakistani city of Quetta.\nAs the group's supreme commander, Akhundzada is in charge of political, military and religious affairs.\nMullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund is one of the four men who founded the Taliban in Afghanistan in 1994.\nHe is a longtime head the Taliban's powerful leadership council, or Rehbari Shura. \nHe served as foreign minister and deputy prime minister during the Taliban's rule in Afghanistan in 1996-2001. \nHe is under UN sanctions for his role in the government during that period.\nSirajuddin Haqqani is another of the group's top figures, who is on an FBI most wanted list.\nAfter the death of his father, Jalaluddin Haqqani, he became the new leader of the Haqqani network, which has been credited with some of the most violent attacks that have occurred in Afghanistan against Afghan forces and their Western allies in recent years.\nThe Haqqani network is currently one of the region's most powerful and feared militant groups. Some say it is even more influential than the Islamic State group in Afghanistan.\nThe group, designated by the US as a terrorist organisation, oversees the Taliban's financial and military assets along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.\nHaqqani is believed to be around 45.\nIn an opinion piece in the New York Times last year before the signing of the Doha agreement, Haqqani wrote: \"For more than four decades, precious Afghan lives have been lost every day. Everyone has lost somebody they loved. Everyone is tired of war. I am convinced that the killing and the maiming must stop.\"\nMullah Abdul Ghani Baradar is a Taliban co-founder.\nHe became a lynchpin of the insurgency after the militants were toppled by the US-led invasion in 2001.\nBut he was captured in a joint US-Pakistani operation in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi in February 2010.\nHe remained in prison for eight years, until he was released as part of a plan to facilitate the peace process. He has been the head of their political office in Qatar since January 2019.\nIn 2020, Baradar became the first Taliban leader to communicate directly with a US president after having a telephone conversation with Donald Trump. Before that, Baradar signed the Doha agreement on the withdrawal of US troops on behalf of the Taliban. \nMohammad Yaqoob is the son of the founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar.\nHe is believed to be little more than 30 years old and is currently the leader of the group's military operations.\nFollowing the death of former Taliban leader Akhtar Mansour in 2016, some militants wanted to appoint Yaqoob as the group's new supreme commander, but others felt that he was young and lacking in experience.\nAs the Taliban advanced through the country, Yaqoob urged Taliban fighters not to harm members of the Afghan military or government and to stay out of abandoned homes of government and security officials who had fled, according to the Associated Press news agency."

      "text": "Nando's says it will lend some of its staff to its suppliers to help \"get things moving\" in the supply chain after shortages hit some of its shops.\nThe restaurant group has had to shut around 50 outlets temporarily after apparently running short of its staple fare: peri peri chicken.\nCustomers were quick to react online, complaining about local closures.\n\"The UK supply chain is having a bit of a [night]'mare right now,\" Nando's tweeted in reply.\n\"This is having a knock-on effect with some of our restaurants across England, Scotland and Wales.\"\nThe chain said delivery schedules meant the situation was changing rapidly and suggested customers check the website before they visit.\nFood and other supply chains across the UK have struggled to operate normally this summer, due to what has been dubbed the \"pingdemic\" -  staff being required to self-isolate if they have come into contact with someone with coronavirus. \nStaff shortages have also have been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit as well as during the pandemic and the furlough scheme keeping some workers out of the jobs market.\nDairy giant Arla had to cut back on milk deliveries to supermarkets due to lorry driver shortages last month, leaving some supermarket shelves short of stock.\nLast week rival fast food chicken store KFC said some items were missing from its menus due to \"disruption\".\nThe problem has also affected carmakers, transport operators, restaurants and pubs. Road haulage firms have been a particular pinch point because the industry was already short of qualified drivers.\nFrom this week, fully vaccinated staff no longer have to self-isolate, a rule-change the government hopes will ease the pressure on businesses running short of staff.\nAt the same time Nando's says it is exploring an alternative solution by offering its staff to help suppliers, although it didn't say whether any had accepted the offer, or what work they would be doing.\nThe South African chain, famous for its peri peri sauce, operates more than 400 restaurants across the UK.\nNando's said the shortages were not affecting any of their outlets in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nNote September 6 2021: This story was updated to include a broader context around staff shortages after Brexit and the pandemic.
