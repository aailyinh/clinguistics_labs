      "text": "A Met Police officer has been convicted of being a member of a banned neo-Nazi terrorist organisation.\nBenjamin Hannam, of Enfield, north London, was found guilty of membership of the banned right-wing extremist group National Action (NA).\nHe was also convicted of lying on his Met Police application and having terror documents detailing knife combat and making explosive devices.\nHannam is the first British officer to be convicted of a terrorism offence.\nHe was released on conditional bail ahead of sentencing on 23 April.\nAt the Old Bailey, Judge Anthony Leonard QC lifted a ban on reporting the case after the 22-year-old admitted possessing an indecent image of a child, which was to have been the subject of a separate trial. \nThe PC had been working as a probationary officer for the Met for nearly two years before he was found on a leaked database of users of extreme right-wing forum Iron March.\nHe had signed up to the forum when he joined the London branch of neo-Nazi group NA in March 2016.\nFollowing his arrest in March last year, officers discovered a NA business card and badges, as well as writings about his involvement with the group.\nJurors were told that on the day the group was banned in December 2016, Hannam had transferred the knife-fighting manual from his computer to folder named \"NA\" on a memory stick along with other extremist texts.\nDetectives also found he was in possession of multiple prohibited images including \"pseudo images\" of young boys and girls.\nJurors convicted him of remaining in NA for several months after it was banned in December 2016, as well as two counts of fraud for lying about his far-right past in a Met application form.\nProsecutor Dan Pawson-Pounds said the fraud was \"intimately connected\" to Hannam's membership of the outlawed group.\nHannam had denied all the offences, telling the court he had never been a member of NA despite regularly attending group meetings.\nHe claimed that he was interested by the \"look and aesthetic of fascism\", but that he was not a racist and had actually challenged group members when they expressed such views.\nThe officer said he had been \"desperate to impress\" an older NA organiser and his association with the group ended before he began working for the Met.\nThe court heard that Hannam was part of a successor version of the extremist group called NS131 - which was itself outlawed in September 2017 - and that he appeared in its online videos spray-painting neo-Nazi logos.\nHe had joined the Met in 2018 and during his training was actually shown videos relating to NA.\nHe passed out early in 2019 but was identified on the neo-Nazi web forum by detectives.\nIt can now be reported that, soon after he joined the Met, Hannam was found to have committed gross misconduct after he was found using a young relative's travel card to use public transport for free.\nScotland Yard said it had reviewed Hannam's time in the Met and found no evidence his actions had been influenced by any extremist ideology.\nHe is currently suspended from duty.\nAfter the jury returned their verdict, the judge said Hannam had been \"convicted of serious offences\" and was being bailed as a \"courtesy\".\nJenny Hopkins, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said Hannam's \"lies have caught up with him and he's been exposed as an individual with deeply racist beliefs\".\n\"Benjamin Hannam would not have got a job as a probationary police constable if he'd told the truth about his membership of a banned, far-right group,\" she added.\nCdr Richard Smith, of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said \"the public expect police officers to carry out their duties with the very highest levels of honesty and integrity. \n\"Sadly, PC Hannam showed none of these qualities.\""

      "tags": "US economy,Infrastructure,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden has called for trillions in spending aimed at re-igniting America's economic growth by upgrading its crumbling infrastructure and tackling climate change.\nThe $2.3tn (\u00a31.7tn) proposal would direct billions to initiatives such as charging stations for electric vehicles and eliminating lead water pipes.\nThe spending would be partially offset by raising taxes on businesses.\nThose plans have already roused fierce opposition.\nRepublicans have called the rises \"a recipe for stagnation and decline\", while powerful business lobby groups including the Business Roundtable and Chamber of Commerce said they supported investments but would oppose tax increases.\nThe pushback is a sign of the tough fight ahead for the plan, which needs approval from Congress.\nJoe Biden could have gone in a number of different policy directions after narrowly getting his covid pandemic aid package through Congress. That he opted to push for an infrastructure bill, rather than upping the pressure for gun control, voting rights, immigration, the environment or healthcare reform, suggests he's looking for a popular, non-controversial legislative second act.\nOf course, like that coronavirus package, the Biden administration is likely to use a massive piece of legislation to quietly advance some of those other policy priorities. The proposal contains hundreds of millions of dollars in green energy spending, expanded care for the elderly and disabled and job training, for instance.\nAlso like the coronavirus aid bill, even non-controversial infrastructure provisions that have high public support will be swamped in partisan acrimony. In particular, Republicans are going to vehemently object to the tax increases for corporations and businesses contained in the proposed legislation.\nChances are, Democrats will again have to go it alone when it comes to passing Biden's legislative agenda.\nThe challenge, then, will be keeping the Democratic coalition together at a time when a wide number of constituencies, many of whom held their tongue during the Covid negotiations, line up to ensure their priorities are funded.\nThe White House has promoted its proposal as the most ambitious public spending in decades, saying the investments are necessary to keep the US economy growing and competitive with other countries, especially China.\n\"This is not a plan that tinkers around the edges,\" Mr Biden said in a speech in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Wednesday. \"It's a once in a generation investment in America.\"\nIt calls for investing more than $600bn in infrastructure, including modernising roads, replacing rail cars and buses and repairing crumbling bridges.\nBillions more would be devoted to initiatives like improving veterans hospitals, upgrading affordable housing, expanding high-speed broadband, and providing incentives for manufacturing and technology research.\nIt calls for money to be directed to rural communities and communities of colour, including establishing a national climate-focused laboratory affiliated with an historically black university. \nThe spending, which would have to be approved by Congress, would roll out over eight years. \nThe White House said tax increases would offset the cost over 15 years. \nMr Biden called for raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, a move that would partially undo cuts the US passed in 2017. He also proposed raising the minimum rate charged for overseas profits.\nIn his speech, in an acknowledgment such plans are likely to face, he said he was also \"open to other ideas\" when it came to paying for the spending.\n\"Failing to make these investments adds to our debt and effectively puts our children at a disadvantage relative to our competitors,\" he said. \"The divisions of the moment shouldn't stop us from doing the right thing for the future.\" \nMr Biden's proposal - which closely resembles promises he made during last year's election campaign - comes just weeks after Democrats muscled through $1.9tn more in aid to address the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic, approving that package without Republican support.\nIt's not clear yet how much of Mr Biden's latest plan will make it through Congress - or how much of another spending package focused on areas such as childcare and education that he plans to unveil in coming weeks.\nPaul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said the speedy advance of the pandemic package was unusual. \n\"Normally the negotiations drag on for months and what eventually gets passed, if anything gets passed at all, bears only a passing resemblance to what the administration originally asked for,\" he said. \"We suspect these negotiations will revert to the mean.\"\nEli Allen is director of the Center for Sustainable Careers at Civic Works, a non-profit organisation that offers programmes such as job training focused on careers in sustainable energy in Baltimore, Maryland, a majority black city near Washington, DC.\nHe said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" that something resembling Mr Biden's ambitions would eventually pass and  was particularly heartened by Mr Biden's emphasis on creating \"quality jobs\" in terms of pay and benefits - which he said could help set a standard across the industry.\n\"The focus on racial equity is not something we've seen in some of the past federal programmes that we've worked with,\" he added. \"I think that focus \u2026 is very important as we think about strategies to expand access to these jobs, especially for communities of colour.\"\nStefani Pashman is chief executive of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, a regional economic development group in Pittsburgh, the former steel town in Pennsylvania where Mr Biden delivered his speech on Wednesday.\nThe city, located in a state that was key to Mr Biden's election victory, has been working to reinvent itself as a centre for high-tech research in areas such as autonomous vehicles. \nMs Pashman said the president's promise of billions of government dollars has also injected new energy into ambitious local plans, like an effort by Carnegie Mellon University and rail technology company Wabtec to establish a new research lab focused on innovations in freight rail, like autonomous trains.\n\"The idea is to transform the rail industry \u2026 but we need $600m from the federal government to amplify what we're able to do at the local level,\" she said.\n\"The past few years \u2026 I don't think the government was positioned to take this on at the level that it needs to be addressed and invested in to propel our region's economy and all the economies of the nation,\" she added. \n\"It's clear that they're prioritizing infrastructure in a new way.\""

No date has yet been suggested for when large sporting events may be allowed to restart.\nThe Welsh government has said it was working towards \"safe reopening\", but no date has been given for reopening theatres or venues in the latest lockdown easing plan.\nA spokesperson said changes may be considered by the next administration at the next review of restrictions due on 14 May, after the Senedd election.\nSome of Wales' largest events, such as the Hay Festival, have already been called off this summer.\nNow the Welsh Government has announced it wants to hold a series of pilot events across Wales after 12 April, adding this could include a \"stadia event\".\nIn England, up to 10,000 fans could be back in stadiums by mid-May as part of the government's plans to move out of lockdown.\nAnnouncing a new timetable for easing restrictions, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the pilot events for sport and arts would build on pilots held in September, including outdoor performances at Theatr Clwyd, in Flintshire.\nThe Football Association of Wales and Glamorgan Cricket have both volunteered to stage pilot events.\nThe Welsh Rugby Union welcomed the plan for pilot events, adding the safe return of fans \"cannot come soon enough\"."

      "text": "Crime victims are to be told when an offender leaves prison as part of a new code that has come into force in England and Wales.\nThe Victims' Code ensures access to extra information and support, such as enabling victims of rape to choose the gender of their police interviewer. \nJustice Secretary Robert Buckland said it gave victims a \"simplified and stronger set of rights\". \nA consultation on a new victims' law will take place later this year. \nUnder the new code, which brings together 12 \"overarching rights\", victims will be told what to expect at every stage of the justice system - regardless of whether they choose to report the crime or not, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said. \nAmong the changes, it will ensure:\nAs part of the code, victims will also be given the right to be informed of the reasons why a suspect is not being prosecuted. If unhappy, they will be able to ask the police or Crown Prosecution Service to review this decision.\nThe MoJ said the code paved the way for a new victims' law, on which ministers will consult this summer. \nThis would seek to underpin victims' rights in legislation and ensure justice agencies are held to account for delivering them, the MoJ said.\nJustice Secretary Robert Buckland said: \"Having worked for over 25 years as a criminal barrister, I know how daunting the justice system can be for victims, which is why the information and support they receive is so vital.\n\"Our new code provides victims with a simplified and stronger set of rights, making clear their entitlements at every step of the way as they recover from crime.\n\"But we are not stopping here and will consult on strengthening these rights even further through a Victims' Law as we continue to build back confidence in the justice system.\"\nIt comes amid a record backlog of cases in the Crown Court, with some cases being timetabled for 2023.  \nThe Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales, Dame Vera Baird QC, has previously warned of mounting evidence of a loss of confidence in criminal justice.\nDame Vera said: \"This new, simplified Victims' Code represents a positive step forward for victims. These 12 rights are well set out and should provide some much-needed clarity for victims and victims' services.\"\nShe also welcomed the government's promise to consult on victims' legislation in the summer, having previously called for this. \nAndreana De Vecchis, a sexual violence adviser at the charity Victim Support, is to help ensure victims get access to the support outlined in the code.\nShe said: \"Working with victims of rape I know the prospect of reporting a crime to the police, and attending court can put a huge emotional strain on people.\n\"It is my job to take survivors through every step of the process, explaining the rights they have under the Victims' Code and making sure they receive them.\n\"At every step my priority is the victim and empowering them to get the support they need from the justice system - whether they choose to report crimes or not.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Some of the world's top tennis players have said they do not want to receive a coronavirus vaccine, triggering a major debate within the sport.\nBoth the ATP and WTA governing bodies have called for players to be immunised, but insist they will not force them to be vaccinated. \nLeading stars in both the men's and women's game - including Novak Djokovic and Elina Svitolina - have expressed scepticism over Covid-19 vaccines.\nLast year, Djokovic said he was \"opposed to vaccination\" before embarking on a controversial exhibition tour in Serbia and Croatia that was attended by fans. The tennis star and three other players later tested positive for the virus. \nHe later claimed his comments about vaccinations had been taken out of context in the media, saying \"my issue here with vaccines is if someone is forcing me to put something in my body. That I don't want\". \nIn recent weeks, the debate over the vaccine has intensified. \nHealth bodies, including the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency, have repeatedly said the benefits of the vaccine outweigh any risks.\nDuring press conferences at this week's Miami Open, journalist Ben Rothenberg quizzed a number of players about whether they planned to get a vaccine. \nWorld number eight, Aryna Sabalenka, told a press conference that she did not \"trust\" the jab. \n\"They just make it, like really quick and there wasn't enough time to test it and to see what can happen,\" she said.\" But she added that if she had to take it, she would. \n\"It's tough to say, but I don't really want it yet and I don't want my family to take it.\"\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian player Elina Svitolina said she had spoken with friends who told her to \"wait a little while longer to see how it goes\". \n\"For now it makes almost like no sense to do something that has been tested for such a short period of time. I will probably wait for now,\" she said. \nFollowing the comments, the WTA released a statement saying it would \"continue to educate our players on the various vaccines along with the benefits of getting vaccinated.\"\n\"The WTA believes in and will encourage everyone to get a vaccine,\" the statement said.\nIn the men's game, top 10 player Andrey Rublev said: \"For the moment [the vaccine] doesn't really give you any privilege\". \nHe said that players would still have to remain in a bubble while attending tournaments. \"If you ask me if I can choose and I can have an option, I will not do it\".  \nThe ATP issued a statement on Tuesday that said it \"recommends Covid-19 vaccination based on scientific evidence supporting the health benefits and protection provided\". \nPlayers Ashleigh Barty and Naomi Osaka said they would take the jab. Simona Halep has already had the vaccine in her home country of Romania and was one of the first tennis players to do so. \nLast November, Andy Murray said players should \"probably\" be required to take a vaccine to be able to continue to play. He added that he hoped they would \"do that for the good of the sport\".\nIn the US, both the Major Baseball League and National Basketball Association have encouraged players to be vaccinated and offered incentives such as no longer having to wear masks when gathering with others. \nTwo weeks after getting the second dose of the jab, they will be allowed to have vaccinated family members join them while travelling, the Wall Street Journal reports. \nFormula 1 declined an offer from Bahrain to vaccinate all personnel attending pre-season testing and the year's opening grand prix. The Gulf state said it offered the vaccine as part of its vaccination programme, which it was extending to events in the country. A number of teams and F1 personnel, including some drivers, took up the offer.\nFootballers in the UK have not been offered the vaccine but last month England manager Gareth Southgate called for them to be immunised. He said the sport had a \"responsibility\" to players who \"we are asking to keep playing\". "

      "text": "The return of giant bluefin tuna to waters off the Welsh coast presents a \"massive opportunity\" for science and tourism, fishing groups have said.\nThe fish disappeared from UK waters during the 1960s due to commercial overfishing and a changing climate.\nBut they are returning, including off the coast of Pembrokeshire, and fishing groups want to catch, tag and release a limited number.\nThe Welsh government said it was part of UK-level discussions on the issue.\nFishing groups have warned Wales risks \"missing the boat\" if action is not taken quickly, but the Wildlife Trusts have urged caution.\nFamed for their size and speed in the water, the Atlantic bluefin tuna, also known as the giant bluefin tuna, have been spotted in large numbers over the past decade between the months of July and December.\nThey can grow to an average 6.5 feet (1.98m) long and can weigh up to 550lbs (249kg).\nJulian Lewis Jones, known for his acting roles in films such as Invictus and Justice League, and patron of the Welsh Federation of Sea Anglers, said there was the potential for a \"world class\" recreational catch and release tuna fishery in Wales.\n\"Being a mad keen fisherman myself I know what lengths people will go to see their dream fish,\" Mr Jones said.\n\"And these are huge - some of the biggest tuna in the world - just 10 miles off the Welsh coast.\"\nMr Jones said a tuna fishery would attract anglers from around the world, adding: \"It's a massive opportunity - we've had a terrible year with Covid and tourism has really suffered in our coastal communities.\"\nThe first step, Mr Jones explained, would be to set up a catch and release tagging programme, known as a Chart, where anglers working as part of a scientific study would be able to catch, tag and release a small number of fish.\nBut he warned Wales was lagging behind the rest of the UK, with hopes of an announcement in England \"within weeks\" and Scotland having already earmarked funding.\nIreland has been running a Chart scheme for more than two years.\nThe UK government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has been leading a public consultation on the issue and could decide to allocate a share of the small quota the UK has for bluefin tuna to the UK nations.\nBut it would be down to the Welsh government after May's Senedd election to decide what to do next.\nIf Wales is to secure a Chart programme for this year's tuna season, it would have to happen soon so skippers can receive the necessary training and bring a university on board to manage the scientific study.\n\"If we aren't up to speed we will lose our chance,\" Mr Jones continued.\n\"If we're not in a position to be able to have those skippers ready in time for the season then it isn't going to happen for Wales, and that would be a travesty.\"\nAndrew Alsop, who runs White Water Charters from Neyland marina in Pembrokeshire, accidentally reeled in a \"monster\" tuna - weighing about 500lb (226kg) and 7ft 7in (2.3m) in length - while fishing in 2017.\nHe said he first started to spot shoals of the fish back in 2012, describing it as an \"amazing sight that you'd usually have to go abroad to Africa or America to see\".\nSince then he has been involved in the UK Thunnus Programme, which was tasked with understanding more about the recovery in tuna numbers here.\nHe said it would be a \"kick in the teeth\" if further research programmes were to take off across the UK but not in Wales.\n\"It needs to be done properly and anglers do need to know what they're doing - you can't just go out there like in the Jaws film,\" he said.\n\"We'd be working with scientists, monitoring these fish and the universities would benefit as they'd get a massive study.\"\nHe also pointed out that the tuna season runs into autumn and winter - the time of year when the west Wales economy could do with a tourism boost.\n\"My boat already brings in guys from Norway and America as it is. But tuna is king - people travel all over the world for it.\"\nJoan Edwards, policy director for the Wildlife Trusts, said it was right for governments to proceed with caution.\n\"I do have my concerns - in the last 50 to 60 years we've lost 80% of the bluefin tuna in the Atlantic and we're now just starting to see them reappear in our waters,\" she said.\n\"I'm sure it's very exciting to land such a fish but [we should consider] the trauma that fish is going to go through.\n\"I just feel that we've got some recovery happening in our marine environment and that's something to celebrate - I don't think we should be catching them.\"\nPlaid Cymru said it had already written to Welsh Labour ministers urging them to \"engage with the process fully\" and \"make sure we don't get left behind\".\nThe Welsh Conservatives said while they were \"broadly in favour of tagging for research, these decisions should always be led by the data and interested parties should be consulted on potential options\".\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats said fishing was \"vital to the Welsh economy and the next Welsh government must do everything in its power to ensure the industry is able to stay afloat\", adding Wales was in danger of being \"left behind\".\nA spokesman for the Labour-run Welsh Government said it \"was engaged with Phase 2 of the Defra-led UK Bluefin Tuna Catch and Release Tagging (Chart) project\"."

I waited, and waited, for something from the senior leadership team to even point to an expected standard, but it did not materialise.\"\nThe Cabinet Office has been considering whether Ms Badenoch had broken the rules, but it is thought officials did not consider her behaviour to be a breach, and no official investigation has been set up.  \nFor Labour, shadow equalities minister Marsha de Cordova said: \"It is disgraceful that the equalities minister has not been held to account for her behaviour last week. The prime minister must condemn her actions.\" \nIn his letter, Mr Kasumu said the Conservatives had built a coalition of voters to win a majority at the last general election, but added: \"I fear for what may become of the party in the future by choosing to pursue a politics steeped in division.\"\nHe claimed the government's culture was not \"conducive\" to \"empathy\" and \"the damage that is often caused by our actions is not much considered\".\n\"As someone that has spent his whole adult life serving others, that tension has been at times unbearable,\" he said.\nA Downing Street spokesman declined to comment on individual staff members, but said: \"This government is committed to inclusion and bringing communities together and is the most ethnically diverse in this country's history.\"\nThe government had set up a Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities to tackle inequality and discrimination and it is due to report shortly, they added."

      "text": "Rules to increase the minimum cost of single-use carrier bags in Scotland to 10p have come into force.\nMSPs backed a move to double the 5p price earlier this year but it was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe Scottish government has said it is important to increase the charge periodically to encourage the use of reusable options instead. \nThe 5p charge was introduced in 2014, with plastic bag usage dropping by 80% by the following year.\nThe price increase has been backed by environmental groups.\nFriends of the Earth Scotland's Sarah Moyes said: \"The huge success of the charge so far in cutting plastic waste shows the importance of targeted government action in protecting the environment.\n\"The plastic industry opposed these moves but time has once again shown them to have been in the wrong.\n\"In order to fully tackle Scotland's plastic crisis, we need the Scottish government to move quickly to bring forward further action including the forthcoming ban on environmentally harmful single-use items like plastic straws, plates and cutlery.\"\nEnvironment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham previously told MSPs that charging \"had already affected a massive change in the use of these carrier bags\".\nShe said: \"We know there are very significant benefits, we have seen them already, and I would imagine we will go on seeing them.\""

      "tags": "Shielding,Public health,China,Social distancing,Self-isolation,United States,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 350 million confirmed cases and more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. \nThe US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. \nVery few places have been left untouched. \nThe latest available data for the total number of cases in France since the start of the pandemic is from 16 January. \nIn the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands."

      "text": "University leaders are lobbying for a return to campuses this month for all students in England - from 12 April rather than suggestions of 17 May.\nMany students \"feel they have been forgotten by government\", said Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of universities.\nAbout a million students are still only studying online.\nThe Department for Education says return dates will be reviewed \"by the end of the Easter holidays\".\nThis timetable is understood to mean by the end of next week. \nBut students have been promised at least a week's notice, which would mean a decision for a return from 12 April would have to be announced over the Easter weekend.\nUniversities UK says \"concerns are growing that the next stage of student returns will be delayed until 17 May at the earliest\".\nThat would mean that many students, paying full fees and in some cases rent, would see their summer term on campus shrinking to a few weeks, before ending in June.\nIt would add pressure to calls for students to be given refunds after a second year of disruption.\nWhile schools and colleges had a big back-to-school return in March, much of university teaching has remained off-campus and online, with no date for a return.\nSome practical courses, requiring hands-on training, have returned, with Universities UK estimating that half of 2.1 million students do not have any indication of when they might go back.\nIn some universities, teaching is going to remain online for the rest of the academic year.\n\"There are university students across the country on courses such as business, maths and languages who are still waiting to find when - or even if - they will be able to return to in-person teaching this year,\" says Dr Bradshaw, head of the Russell Group of 24 leading research universities.\n\"We are particularly concerned about the impact on student mental health,\" he says.\nDr Bradshaw urged ministers to allow students to go back for in-person teaching from 12 April - arguing that there was little evidence that it would threaten a significant increase in infections.\nA survey from the Higher Education Policy Institute found that two-thirds of students have been staying in their term-time accommodation, even if studying online, suggesting there would be less of a mass migration than at the start of the academic year.\n\"We have shared comprehensive evidence with the government on the clear benefits of a 12 April return to in-person activities for students' mental health and wellbeing,\" said a Universities UK spokeswoman.\nDebra Humphris, chair of the University Alliance group of universities, said an earlier return would be particularly important for those students graduating this year - who want the \"face-to-face employability support\" before entering an \"uncertain job market\".\nBut the UCU lecturers' union has rejected calls for a campus return this month - saying it \"smacks of self-interest and risks the safety of staff, students and the wider public\". \nJo Grady, the union's general secretary, said \"vice-chancellors lured students to university with the promise of a relatively normal campus experience, only for them to be left facing long periods in lockdown. \n\"Universities should not now be asking hundreds of thousands of students to return for in-person teaching after Easter when most courses will only have revision classes and exams left,\" said Dr Grady.\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"We will be reviewing options for the timing of the return of all remaining students by the end of the Easter holidays. \n\"Decisions will take into account the need to protect progress across the wider roadmap out of the pandemic, including the spread of the virus in communities and pressures on the NHS.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Ofgem,Energy industry,Renewable energy in the UK,Renewable energy",
      "text": "Energy suppliers offering environment-friendly tariffs are not always as green as they sound, experts say.\nMany \"100% renewable\" electricity tariffs use energy generated by fossil fuels, which is then \"offset\" for a small price.\nSustainable energy think tank Regen complains of \"loose language and loose marketing\" around green energy tariffs.\nBut industry body Energy UK says all renewable tariffs help to transform the grid for a low-carbon future.\nThe vast majority of energy suppliers now offer green tariffs and many promise 100% renewable electricity as standard.\nHowever, some energy companies accuse others of \"greenwashing\" - using marketing spin to make \"dirty\" electricity seem clean.\n\"The sale of green tariffs increased remarkably in the period since 2015. In fact, it doubled between 2017 and 2018,\" says Rob Gross, the director of the UK Energy Research Centre.\nFor many consumers, electricity which is environmentally friendly plays a role in which supplier they choose. \nThat was the case for Su in Gainsborough, who told the Jeremy Vine Show on BBC Radio 2: \"The tariff we're on at the moment has 100% renewable electricity, so they source all their energy from renewables. So wind, solar, hydro.\"\nWe explained to Su that the supplier she was with sources the majority of its electricity from the wholesale market, which includes energy generated by gas and coal. \nThen it purchases cheap renewable energy certificates called REGOs to effectively \"offset\" this. That allows her supplier to legally call the electricity \"100% renewable\".\nIn response, Su said: \"I'm not very impressed with that at all. To claim that all your energy is sourced renewably and then to do that is very misleading. \n\"That's not giving consumers an informed choice about where they're getting their electric from.\"\nJohnny Gowdy is a director at Regen, a not-for-profit organisation supporting the transition to a net-zero energy future. \nHe says: \"The good news is, there's a lot of demand for green energy products and that's why the industry is responding to that. \n\"So there's a success story here which has been muddied somewhat by loose language and loose marketing around green energy tariffs.\"\nREGO stands for Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin. When an renewable unit of electricity is generated - for example, by a wind turbine - the regulator Ofgem issues a REGO to prove that this energy is green.\nThe person who owns that wind turbine is now allowed to sell the electricity and the REGO separately. \nIt means there is a marketplace where leftover REGOs are traded, and there are enough of them \"going spare\" that energy suppliers are able to purchase enough to cover the proportion of fossil fuels they sell to customers.\nSome industry experts are supportive of REGOs and many agree that they have a role to play in expanding and supporting the renewable energy market.\nThe problem is how much they cost. They are cheap. \nAn energy supplier can make electricity from the wholesale market, which includes fossil fuels, look entirely green for just \u00a31 or \u00a32 per customer per year. The majority of UK energy suppliers are doing this to some extent.\nThe Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy says: \"We will be reviewing the REGO scheme this year. This will include ensuring people can make informed decisions over their energy supplier's green credentials.\"\nFor environmentally-conscious consumers, finding a truly \"green\" tariff is confusing. \nMany suppliers have contracts to buy electricity directly from renewable electricity generators and some invest directly in renewable energy infrastructure. These are arguably \"greener\", but tend to cost more.\nThe regulator, Ofgem, acknowledged this when it exempted three suppliers from the UK-wide energy price cap. \nEcotricity, Good Energy and Green Energy UK are allowed to charge more than their competitors because their electricity costs more to supply.\nEnergy UK, the trade body representing all suppliers, says that the bigger picture is very promising. \nIts chief executive, Emma Pinchbeck, says: \"All renewable tariffs, including those with REGOs, are supporting renewables in some way. Over a third of our power now comes from renewables.\n\"The reason we're having this debate is everyone's so enthused about a low-carbon world and that's so exciting for us in the industry.\""

      "text": "Pubs, restaurants and hotels in Wales may reopen indoors in time for the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford has set out a series of dates for easing lockdown, stretching into the next month.\nUnder the plans two households could meet indoors from 10 May, if Covid cases remained low.\nTravel into and out of Wales from the rest of the UK and Common Travel Area may go ahead from 12 April.\nRestaurants and bars could reopen outdoors from 26 April and from 3 May, outdoor wedding receptions with up to 30 people may be permitted.\nBut the changes could depend on the results of the Senedd election on 6 May, and whether the Welsh Labour leader is returned to power.\nThe Welsh Conservatives' own plans would see most rules on social contact scrapped by 17 May. \nBoth the Tories and Plaid Cymru called for gyms to reopen now, while Plaid said the Senedd should be recalled to discuss more economic help for businesses.\nUnder the Welsh plans gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities will also be able to reopen from 10 May. This will include individual or one-to-one training, but not exercise classes.\nSpring Bank Holiday Monday is 31 May, but the Welsh government has not specified an actual date for reopening hospitality indoors.\nIt said after 17 May it would \"consider enabling indoor hospitality and remaining visitor accommodation to reopen in advance of the Spring Bank Holiday\".\nOnly six people from two households will be able to meet in reopened beer gardens and should still socially distance.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said the public emergency is not over. \nHe told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: \"You see in the pattern a continuation of the step-by-step approach we've taken in Wales, doing the outdoor activities first because it's safer to be outdoors.\n\"But for the first time in the timetable we are now able to set out the first re-openings of indoor activities as well.\"\nHe added: \"The presence of the virus in Wales is the lowest in the United Kingdom, the rate of vaccination in Wales is the highest in the United Kingdom.\n\"On Saturday, we will complete the vaccination offer to everybody in the top nine priority groups, again the first country in the UK to get to that milestone.\" \nProvided cases remain low, the following things will be permitted:\nMonday, 12 April\nMonday, 26 April\nMonday, 3 May\nMonday, 10 May\nMonday, 17 May\nBeyond that date, ministers would consider reopening indoor pubs and restaurants, and remaining visitor accommodation ahead of the Spring Bank Holiday.\nTracy Lawler, who owns The Dressing Room Boutique in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, said she cannot wait to reopen on 12 April. \nShe said because her shop is \"is small and intimate I can keep it really ultra clean after each person has entered\".\n\"I'm probably one of the safest public places for people to come in and the government is saying to me that I can't open up [yet]\u2026 very frustrating.\" \nLucy Hywel, who owns That's Lovely That giftshop in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, was also looking forward to reopening, but said: \"We're hurt and we're still hurting.\n\"I myself have thrown out loads of food, thousands of pounds worth of stock, even last week, stock I thought I may have sold in the lead up to Easter got chucked away and that pain is there every time you do something like that.\"\nVictoria Hallimi, who owns Victoria's Driving School in Swansea, gave her last lesson on 13 December but can now reopen on 12 April.\nShe said: \"My phone was going a bit crazy last night as soon as the announcement was made.\n\"I was up until about 11, 11:30 last night scheduling everybody in.\" \nShe said the past few months had been \"really tough\" and her husband had been doing a lot of overtime to make up for her not being able to work. \"He can relax now,\" she added. \nKelly John, owner of KMW Beauty in Maesteg, Bridgend county, said she has not paid herself a wage since January to ensure she had enough money in her business account to buy supplies when she was allowed to reopen.\n\"Luckily my husband is working, otherwise I wouldn't have a house,\" the mother-of-two said.\n\"But being an independent woman, it is really hard. I can't do anything - it's Easter this weekend and I haven't bought anything.\"\nMeanwhile, the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective, which represents more than 400 Welsh hospitality firms, said it welcomed the move but \"continues to press for certainty and support\" about funding to support them while they remain closed.\nThe plans will move Wales into the \"alert level three\" stage of the government's control plan by 17 May.\nWhile parts of Wales' lockdown have eased quicker than elsewhere in the UK, the Welsh government had been reluctant to set out a full schedule for when different sectors would reopen.\nFriday's announcement is the most detailed list of dates given by the government since the winter lockdown began to be eased.\nIt does not go as far as England's tentative plans to scrap social contact restrictions by 21 June, although Mark Drakeford has previously said that's \"very optimistic\".\nMr Drakeford told a press conference the new \"indicative dates\" were are there \"to help businesses plan and prepare\".\n\"We have to remember that the pandemic isn't over - it's more important than ever that we continue to work together to keep this terrible virus under control so that we can go on unlocking Wales.\"\nSome sectors like cinemas and theatres have not been given a date to reopen in Wales.\nFollowing criticism of his plans for gyms and leisure centres, Mr Drakeford said the sector will be the first able to reopen indoors.\nPubs will be able to open outdoors two weeks after England. The first minister said he had considered bringing that forward, but \"the advice was very clear that that was not advisable on public health grounds\".\nThe Welsh Conservatives' Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said Mr Drakeford's roadmap was \"very late in the day\".\nHe said it was \"unfortunate\" that further funding had not been made available to hospitality sector - and said outdoor hospitality should be opening in line with England on 12 April.\nMr Davies told Wales Today: \"What's really dumbfounding is that despite his mental health minister's assurances that gyms will be one of the first facilities to open, they are now not going to open until May.\"\nPlaid Cymru Leader Adam Price said he would go faster on reopening gyms and indoor hospitality.\n\"We've also been calling for a much more accelerated timetable in terms of reopening gyms, because of their importance in terms of mental and physical well being. So I think it's disappointing to see that being delayed.\n\"There are dangers of course in moving too fast but there's an equal danger of being over cautious\".\nLeader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Jane Dodds said: \"Now that more and more of Wales is opening up and life is slowly returning to normal, it's time to put our recovery first. \n\"I want to see support for those individuals who will lose their jobs when furlough ends, those who are likely to lose their homes when the ban on evictions is lifted and those whose mental health has suffered as a result of this pandemic.\"\nA UKIP spokesman said: \"With the success of the vaccine rollout, lockdowns no longer have any major impact on case numbers. \n\"The Welsh economy must be reopened now. Not in a month's time. This apathetic timeline will be the final nail in the coffin for many businesses that have been just about clinging on.\"\nThe announcement comes as latest figures show admissions to hospitals of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases hit a record low - it stands at a daily seven-day average of 19.\nCovid hospital admissions are the lowest since the pandemic began with 17 confirmed and suspected Covid patients on Wednesday, with none at all in Swansea Bay hospitals.\nWales' case rate stands at 34.9 per 100,000 people over seven days - the lowest since mid-September."

      "text": "When the death of George Floyd in the US inspired protests about racial injustice across the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson set up the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities to examine inequality in the UK.\nNow its 258-page report covering health, education, criminal justice and employment has been published. But what does it say?\nThe commission acknowledges that it was established as a response to the Black Lives Matter movement and the upsurge of concern about race issues it inspired. It says it owes the mainly young people behind the movement a \"debt of gratitude\".\nBut it sets out a generational divide between younger activists and the commissioners who grew up in the 1970s and 1980s, saying: \"Our experience has taught us that you do not pass on the baton of progress by cleaving to a fatalistic account that insists nothing has changed\".\nIt also criticises \"bleak new theories about race that insist on accentuating our differences\" and an \"increasingly strident form of anti-racism thinking that seeks to explain all minority disadvantage through the prism of white discrimination\". \nThat diverts attention from other reasons for the success or failure of minority groups, including those relating to the \"culture and attitudes\" of those communities, the report says. It rejects terms such as \"white privilege\".\nOld class divisions have lost traction and identity politics is on the rise, fuelling \"pessimistic narratives\" about race, the commissioners say. While single-issue identity groups can do good work in protecting the vulnerable, they also \"raise the volume\" on these pessimistic viewpoints.\n\"Put simply we no longer see a Britain where the system is deliberately rigged against ethnic minorities,\" the commission says. It says racism is too often used as a \"catch-all explanation\" for disparities and impediments for people from minority groups. \nExamples where ethnic minority communities \"rightly felt let down\", such as the Grenfell fire or the Windrush scandal, sparked \"genuine national grief\".\nThe commissioners suggest that inequalities such as the higher death rates from Covid-19 among some ethnic groups are explained by factors such as their occupation or housing rather than direct discrimination. \"Outcomes such as these do not come about by design, and are certainly not deliberately targeted,\" they say.\nIt urges a detailed examination of the cases of racial and ethnic disparities and criticises the use of the term BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) as \"no longer helpful\" because it \"disguises huge differences\" between minority groups.\nToo much data in the UK only breaks down ethnic groups according to the \"big five\" of white, black, Asian, mixed and other, making it harder to see differences within ethnic minorities such as black African and black Caribbean communities, the report says.\nMany of the poor outcomes were due to family breakdown, the report suggests. It also says huge geographical inequalities can be the underlying causes of racial disparities. \nThe commissioners say it was \"a revelation how stuck some groups from the white majority are\" and it decided its recommendations should be \"designed to remove obstacles for everyone\".\nAlthough the commissioners cite opinion polls showing there is wide acceptance among the population of the UK as a multi-ethnic society, they suggest social media \"enormously amplifies racist views\".\nIt says the \"dominant narrative\" tends to draw attention to issues such as this abuse rather than progress in society, such as that 40% of NHS consultants are from ethnic minorities.\nSocial media abuse, where people can find themselves targeted in their own homes, is a \"unique torment\", the report says. It says platforms such as Facebook and YouTube with a huge user base have provided racists with a new, more public way to inflict pain on their victims.\nIt suggests social media companies too often fail to even enforce their own terms and conditions, and they should face \"substantial penalties - and public naming and shaming\".\nContrary to public perception of rising hate crimes, the report says they may be declining, according to the Crime Survey of England and Wales. But it still equates to 142 racially-motivated hate crimes a day.\nThe report looks for explanations as to why some ethnic minority groups do better than others, and it finds one in some educational research which suggests an important factor is \"immigrant optimism\".\nIn the education system, black African, Indian and Bangladeshi pupils perform better than white British ones, taking into account socio-economic status. Ethnic minority pupils also have higher aspirations at 14 than white students - with the exception of boys from black Caribbean backgrounds .\nThe research suggests that recent immigrants devote themselves more to education because they see education as a way out of poverty.\nThe commissioners say it may explain why pupils from black African backgrounds have better attainment in education than students with black Caribbean heritage, despite similar levels of neighbourhood deprivation, prejudice, and poverty.\nMinorities who have been long-established in the UK, particularly if they have faced racial, social and economic disadvantage, may be the least optimistic about social mobility, the report says.\nNew arrivals to the UK have seized on educational opportunities and achieved \"remarkable social mobility\", making education the \"single most emphatic success story of the British\u00a0ethnic minority experience\".\nA bigger proportion of ethnic minority students attend university than white British ones, the report says. People from white British backgrounds have the best outcomes at top universities, but the commissioners suggest this is a \"selection effect\", due to a smaller, better qualified cross-section of the white British population going to university. \nIt says from early years onwards, family, geography and poverty are the main reasons for poorer outcomes in education.\nThe report says some groups need extra support, including black Caribbean, mixed white and black Caribbean, traveller of Irish heritage, gypsy and Roma groups, as well as Pakistani boys from low socio-economic backgrounds, and lower socio-economic status white British pupils.\nBut it compares racial attainment gaps to the US and finds they are about eight times smaller in the UK.\nIt acknowledges that teaching is \"overwhelmingly white\" but says the causes for differences in the rates of exclusions and suspensions \"cannot be reduced to structural racism and individual teacher bias\".\nTeachers from ethnic minorities have faced \"pushback\" from senior staff when they push for a broader curriculum, the commissioners say. It suggests opportunities for a more inclusive portrayal of British culture are being missed, even when colleagues from ethnic minority backgrounds are proposing them.\nBut it says British history is not just one of \"imperial imposition\", with a more \"complex picture\" of ideas travelling back and forth, cultures mixing and \"positive relations\". \"All this makes up the British story, our story, which has episodes of both shame and pride,\" the report says.\nIt says to develop a sense of citizenship and to support integration, pupils should be exposed to the \"rich variety of British culture\" and the influences on it, from classical civilisation to modern immigration. \nThe commissioners note there have been calls to include topics such as the Commonwealth contribution to the World Wars, major race relations events such as the Bristol Bus Boycott in 1968 and Commonwealth writers such as Derek Walcott and Andrea Levy.\nFamily breakdown is one of the main reasons for educational failure and crime, the report says. \"Family is also the foundation stone of success for many ethnic minorities,\" it adds.\nThe commission said it had \"great concern\" about high rates of family breakdown in some communities, with 63% of children from black Caribbean backgrounds growing up in lone parent families compared to a UK average of 14.7%. Lone parenthood is much lower than average in south Asian and Chinese families.\nThe report says it is not \"passing judgement\", \"allocating blame\" or saying \"two parents are always better than one\", but stressing they may need extra support from extended families or community groups. \nIt also says \"governments cannot remain neutral here\" and minsters should look at initiatives to prevent family breakdown.\nThe commissioners criticise widely-cited figures that black people are nine times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people, saying the nationwide figures do not take into account the different sizes and characteristics of local populations.\nThey produce figures for London alone, where the bulk of searches are carried out, which show black people are nearly four times more likely to be searched.\nStop-and-search is a \"critical tool for policing when used appropriately, and lawfully\", the report says. But it says there needs to be more transparency and accountability about why it is deployed.\nIt quotes a suggestion by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services that the fact that most searches are for drugs does not suggest it is targeted on the most high-priority crimes.\n\"Is stop and search tackling the war on drugs? Or is it removing knives from our streets?\" the commissioners ask, calling for greater clarity from police and government. \nThe report also suggests that more Class B drug possession offences where it is for personal use only should be dealt with outside of the criminal justice system.\nAmid concern about the disproportionate numbers of people from ethnic minorities dying in the pandemic, the report says this is mainly due to increased risk of exposure through their occupation, as well as living in urban areas and multi-generational households.\nIt says that overall ethnic minority groups have better outcomes than the white population in terms of life expectancy, overall mortality and for many of the leading causes of mortality. \n\"This evidence clearly suggests that ethnicity is not the major driver of health inequalities in the UK,\" the commissioners say, pointing to deprivation, geography and different levels of exposure to key risk factors as the main issues.\nThey also suggest that the lack of evidence of an impact on health outcomes casts doubt on whether black and South Asian communities are \"suffering from systemic racism throughout their lives\" that negatively affects their health, education, income, housing and employment.\nThere was \"no overwhelming evidence\" of racism in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health conditions.\nBut the report says there needs to be more research into disparities in maternal mortality.\nIt stresses that the number of deaths overall is low, but between 2016 and 2018, among every 100,000 giving birth, 34 black women died. Among Asian women the rate was 15, and for white women it was eight.\nResearch for the commission suggests that over the last 50 years, many first generation immigrants experienced downward social mobility, but the second generation have \"caught up, and in some cases, surpassed, white people\". \nBut it says this progress has mostly taken place in the last two or three decades and it has been \"imperfect and mixed\". \nPeople from ethnic minorities are more likely to have persistent low incomes and among young people unemployment rates are high even for Indian and Chinese people who \"comfortably outperform the white average in education and incomes overall and generally benefit from positive stereotypes\".\nIt says discrimination is \"likely to be a part of the story\", with experiments showing ethnic minority candidates have to apply for about 1.6 times the number of jobs to get the same number of responses as a white person.\nBut the report says: \"Diversity training and policies that treat people differently according to ethnicity does not work.\" And it recommends policies such as name-blind applications and mentoring rather than quotas."

      "tags": "Alba Party,Scottish Parliament election 2021,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish independence,Alex Salmond,SNP (Scottish National Party)",
      "text": "The leader of the SNP has insisted her party was \"not divided\".\nSpeaking on BBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Nicola Sturgeon said her aim at May's Holyrood election was winning a \"simple majority\".\nShe rejected Alex Salmond's idea of creating a \"super majority\" by encouraging voters to back his newly-formed Alba Party on the regional list.\nThe former first minister said he wanted to work with an SNP government to advance the cause of independence.\nHe told the BBC's Today programme that that cause was \"much, much bigger than personalities\".\nMs Sturgeon denied that the SNP was suffering from internal issues and said support had \"never been higher\".\nShe explained: \"I know I lead a party that has a growing membership just now and has a commanding position in the opinion polls.\n\"The breakdown of opinion polls that tests the views and attitudes of SNP voters show the SNP is actually the most united of all the parties in Scotland.\"\nSCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat elections are happening? On 6 May, people across Scotland will vote to elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the Scottish government. Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Scottish Parliament have? MSPs pass laws on most aspects of day-to-day life in Scotland, such as health, education and transport. They also have control over some taxes and welfare benefits. Defence, foreign policy and immigration are decided by the UK Parliament.\nHow do I vote?\u00a0Anyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election. You can\u00a0register to vote online. \nMs Sturgeon went to say that she was concentrating on winning a \"simple majority\" and if people wanted an SNP government, and her as first minister, then voting for the nationalists was the only way to bring that about.\nShe said: \"You only have to cast your mind back to the days when Alex Salmond was leader of the SNP and he didn't say what he is saying now.\n\"What he said then, and he was right then, is that the only way to make sure you get the government you want is to vote for the party that will be that government.\n\"Anything else is trying to gamble with the system, game the system, take a chance on the outcome of the election.\n\"If you want to see an SNP government elected that then has the ability to deliver an independence referendum, you don't get that by voting for somebody else.\"\nNicola Sturgeon insists that there is no split within the independence movement.\nBut it is inescapable that at the same moment she was being interviewed on Radio Scotland, her predecessor Alex Salmond was speaking on Radio 4 as the leader of a rival party.\nThe two were once an inseparable double act atop the SNP, which took Scotland to the brink of independence. But he has now formed his own breakaway group, populated with defectors from the SNP including two sitting MPs. \nThe fact that many of these defectors have left the SNP over various policy differences means there is sure to be friction between their manifesto pledges too.\nSo, Mr Salmond's very presence in the race raises questions for Ms Sturgeon - even over her core objective of independence, which her party can no longer own as home turf. She now has to spend precious time talking about his vision, instead of her own.\nBoth leaders may insist that their campaigns will be positive and do not pose a threat to the cause they share, but in many ways Holyrood is no longer big enough for the both of them.\nMs Sturgeon told listeners that two things were required to win independence - a majority in the Scottish Parliament to bring about a referendum and, \"crucially\", winning majority support among the Scottish population.\nShe said: \"Anybody who tries to suggest there's a shortcut to that, or that we can somehow game or trick our way to independence, frankly, is misleading people. It's got to be through a process that is not just legitimate but seen to be legitimate so that it can command respect and authority at home and internationally as well.\"\nOn SNP politicians leaving the party to stand at the Holyrood election for the Alba Party she said she was \"not sure it is as many as Mr Salmond might have been hoping for\".\nShe added: \"I also don't think this is a friendly gesture on Mr Salmond's part towards the SNP.\"\nLast week, former SNP leader Mr Salmond announced the creation of a new pro-independence party. \nHe said the Alba Party would not field candidates in any of the 73 constituency seats - but the party will field four candidates in each of the eight regional lists.\nSpeaking on Today, Mr Salmond said that securing a \"super majority\" of pro-independence parties at Holyrood would \"strengthen immeasurably Scotland's hand in negotiating with a Tory PM\".\nHe added: \"From 2007 to 2011 I was first minister and I was negotiated first with Gordon Brown.\n\"No Tory PM will want to be to trying to face down an entire parliament and an entire people.\"\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Ms Sturgeon's comments were \"the clearest sign yet that the SNP will put another referendum before Scotland's recovery.\"\nHe added: \"The Institute for Fiscal Studies demonstrated this week that higher levels of public spending in Scotland is possible because we're part of the United Kingdom. \n\"The UK furlough scheme is still protecting Scottish jobs and people are still getting Covid jags in their arms - but Nicola Sturgeon thinks risking all of that is what's best for Scotland?\"\nThe Scottish Liberal Democrats said Ms Sturgeon had \"once again made it very clear that her only priority this election is another independence referendum\".\nThe party's campaign chairman, Alistair Carmichael, said: \"This is not what Scotland needs.\n\"Scotland needs a needle-sharp focus on green and secure jobs, a plan to help education bounce back and supporting the NHS and mental health.\"\nScottish Labour has said the focus of the next parliament should be on recovering from the pandemic and rebuilding the country's economy and health service rather than arguing about the constitution.\nBut the Scottish Greens believe a referendum is needed within the next five years because \"decisions about Scotland should be made by the Scottish people.\""

      "tags": "Black Lives Matter,Racism",
      "text": "A government-commissioned report which found that the UK \"no longer\" had a system rigged against minorities has been accused of ignoring black and ethnic minority people's concerns.\nThe Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities said family structure and social class had a bigger impact than race on how people's lives turned out.\nCampaigners said it laid the blame for inequality on individuals and families.\nAnd Labour has accused the government of downplaying institutional racism.\nThe commission was set up after Black Lives Matter (BLM) anti-racism protests across the country last summer - triggered by the killing of George Floyd in the US. But its report has been was met with criticism from campaigners.\nJabeer Butt, chief executive of the Race Equality Foundation, said: \"The report seems to go out of its way to deny that there's anything that's been the result of policies we've put in place and instead puts the blame at individuals' decisions or at family's doors.\"\nThe GMB's national officer Rehana Azam said it \"feels like a deeply cynical report\", calling it \"completely irresponsible and immoral\" and accusing it of ignoring black and ethnic minority workers' concerns.\nBoris Johnson said the government would consider the implications of the report's recommendations for future policy and remained \"fully committed to building a fairer Britain\".\nThe commission's 258-page report concluded that the UK is not yet a \"post-racial country\" - but its success in removing race-based disparity in education and, to a lesser extent, the economy, \"should be regarded as a model for other white-majority countries\".\nIn his foreword to the report chairman Tony Sewell, an education consultant and ex-charity boss, said while the \"impediments and disparities do exist\", it continued, they were \"varied and ironically very few of them are directly to do with racism\".\nBlack Lives Matter UK tweeted that it was \"disappointed\" that the report overlooked disproportionality in the criminal justice system.\nBlack people in England and Wales are nine times more likely to be imprisoned than their white peers, it said.\nThe report thanked the \"mainly young people\" behind the BLM movement for putting the focus on race but said progress could not be achieved by \"cleaving to a fatalistic account that insists nothing has changed\".\nAmong the main findings of the report were:  \nLabour's shadow women and equalities secretary Marsha de Cordova labelled the report a \"divisive polemic\" that downplayed institutional racism.\nHer colleague David Lammy, who led a review on racial bias in the justice system, tweeted that Britain's black community was being \"gaslighted\" and said he was \"tired of the endless debate about whether structural racism exists with little desire to actually address it\".\nInstitutional racism was defined in the Macpherson report, commissioned after Stephen Lawrence's murder, as \"the collective failure of an organisation to provide the appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin\".\nCommission member Samir Shah, chief executive of a TV production company, said the commission did not believe there was no institutional racism in Britain but said the term had become \"divisive\".\nRacism was only one of the factors which caused disparities between ethnic groups, he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. \"People do have choices, they do have agency, it's not always that they're just victims of some miasmic racism that's in the air,\" he said.\nWhen setting up the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities during the Black Lives Matter protests last summer, Boris Johnson said he wanted to \"change the narrative, so we stop the sense of victimisation and discrimination\".  \nBut reaching a settled view on the question of racism in the UK was always going to be a struggle.\nCritics were concerned by the prime minister's assertion that he wanted \"to look very carefully at the real racism and discrimination that people face\". \nThere was further unease among anti-racism groups at the reported involvement of Number 10 policy advisor Munira Mirza, because she had previously written of how institutional racism was \"a perception more than a reality\". \nThe appointment of Tony Sewell to lead the inquiry once again disappointed anti-racism activists. \nOne London-based organisation, Monitoring Group, considered seeking a judicial review to prevent his selection on the grounds that he had \"a longstanding record of public statements rejecting or minimising\" the impact of institutional racism in Britain.\nThe accusation that this report is the result of a hand-picked committee, designed to say what ministers wanted to hear, will have some traction, whatever the commission and the government insist about its independence.\nRead more from Mark here.\nThe commission said unemployment differences between ethnic groups had declined and the pay gap between ethnic minority workers and white workers was also falling and at its lowest level for almost a decade.\nBut TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said \"institutional and structural racism exists in the UK, in both the labour market and wider society\", and said black and minority ethnic workers were far more likely \"to be in low-paid, insecure jobs\" compared to white workers.\nProf Kehinde Andrews, a professor of black studies at Birmingham City University told BBC news the report was \"not a genuine attempt to understand racism in Britain\" or \"make a substantive change\".\nHe said the fact there was a discussion over whether institutional racism existed was the problem, \"because it does exist, it clearly exists and the question should be 'how do we address this'\". \nLiberal Democrat equalities spokeswoman Wera Hobhouse said the report must not be used as an excuse to continue \"shameful inaction\" on issues of racial injustice.\nShe called for an end to \"hostile environment\" immigration policies and the \"disproportionate\" use of police stop and search tactics.\nThe commission found not enough information was given to the public about why police used stop and search, saying the focus was on drugs rather than knife offences.\nIn its recommendations, the commission also called for the term BAME, which stands for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic, to be dropped, calling it \"unhelpful\" and \"imprecise and often misleading\".\nDr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a member of the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, said the report was not denying institutional racism existed but said the commission had not discovered evidence of it in the areas it had looked.\nEqualities minister Kemi Badenoch said she \"warmly welcomed\" the report and was impressed by the analysis within the report, but added she was \"looking forward to understanding fully\" the issues that had been raised and \"what can be done\" to address them.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said progress had been made to tackle racism. \"That's not to say there aren't instances of racism that of course exist in this country,\" he told ITV.\n\"But if I think about the things that happened to me when I was a kid, I can't imagine those things happening to me now.\"\nThe report's 24 recommendations included: "

      "text": "Fewer than one in five people request a Covid-19 test if they have symptoms, while the number who follow full self-isolation rules is low, a large study of the test-and-trace system has found. \nThe report, published in the British Medical Journal, also found only half of people knew the main Covid symptoms. \nThese include a cough, high temperature and loss of taste or smell.\nExperts said the findings suggested the impact of the \u00a337bn NHS Test and Trace system was \"limited\".\nThe Department for Health and Social Care said test-and-trace had saved \"countless lives\", adding that the latest ONS data found the \"overwhelming majority\" self-isolated when asked to. \nThe findings are based on 74,697 responses to online surveys from 53,880 people aged 16 or older living in the UK.\nIn total, 37 survey waves were carried out from 2 March last year to 27 January this year, with about 2,000 participants in each wave.\nExperts involved in the study, including from Public Health England's behavioural science team, found that just 18% of those with coronavirus symptoms said they had requested a test, while 43% with symptoms in the previous seven days adhered to full self-isolation.\nMen, younger people and those with young children were less likely to self-isolate, as were those from more working-class backgrounds, people experiencing greater financial hardship, and those working in key sectors.\nCommon reasons for not fully self-isolating included needing to go to the shops or work, for a medical need other than Covid-19, to care for a vulnerable person, to exercise or meet others, or because symptoms were only mild or got better.\nTest-and-trace, or contact tracing, is a system for identifying people who have been in close contact with someone who has caught Covid. \nThose people are then asked to self-isolate for 10 days - even if they have no symptoms - to prevent the chance of passing the virus on, if they do have it.\nEach UK nation has its own contact tracing service: \nRead more - how does test-and-trace work?\nThe report's authors, who also included experts from King's College London, said: \"With such low rates for symptom recognition, testing, and full self-isolation, the effectiveness of the current form of the UK's test, trace, and isolate system is limited.\"\nHowever, the team did acknowledge that while adherence to test, trace and isolate rules had been low, \"some improvement has occurred over time\".\nAcross all waves, 43% of people adhered to rules around self-isolation, though this improved in January to 52%.\nAccording to the latest Office for National Statistics data, 90% of people told they must self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace after being in contact with a positive Covid case did so.\nThe authors said greater practical and financial support was likely to improve adherence to the rules, adding that targeted messaging and policies for men, younger age groups and key workers might also be necessary. \nLast month, the Commons Public Accounts Committee said the impact of NHS Test and Trace was still unclear, despite the government setting aside \u00a337bn for it over two years.\nMPs said the spending was \"unimaginable\" and warned the taxpayer could not be treated like an \"ATM machine\".\nAnd in December, the National Audit Office also criticised the scheme, saying it had not yet achieved its objectives. \nPaulette Hamilton, vice chairwoman of the Local Government Association's community wellbeing board, said the findings of the latest study were \"concerning\".\nShe said: \"Although the rollout of the vaccine is providing us with hope of a return to our normal way of life, the responsibility on us all to get ourselves tested when necessary and share our contacts on request will be needed for some time to come, in order to keep case rates as low as possible.\n\"It is also critical that everyone does the right thing and self-isolates when required. Key to this is making sure people understand what self-isolation means, feel able to comply and are supported to do so if necessary.\"\nMeanwhile, the head of the NHS has urged anyone who is eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine to book one immediately - and for people to turn up for second doses when called. \nNHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said: \"We're well on track to meet our 15 April goal of offering NHS Covid vaccination to everyone aged 50 and over, as well as other high risk groups.\n\"In just the past two weeks, we've now jabbed nearly 85% of people aged 50-54, and over three million of the highest risk people have also now had their top-up second dose.\"\nThe call comes as Wednesday's daily coronavirus figures showed continued falls in deaths, hospital admissions and infections.\nThere were 43 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, 268 patients admitted into hospital and 4,052 new cases recorded, with the seven-day averages down by 39.9%, 22.6% and 11.5% respectively. \nA Department for Health and Social Care spokesman said: \"Since last May, NHS Test and Trace has contacted 3.2 million people who tested positive, and another 6.4 million of their contacts.\n\"Behind these numbers are countless lives saved and the latest ONS figures show that when people are asked to self-isolate, the overwhelming majority do so.\n\"It is vital that people continue to do their bit by isolating when they are asked to.\n\"As the prevalence of coronavirus falls, our testing and tracing system becomes more important in identifying and suppressing local outbreaks while also responding rapidly to the threat of new variants.\""

      "tags": "Schools,Scotland Education,Exams,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Pupils and teachers have told BBC Scotland that assessments some senior pupils will be sitting in the coming weeks are \"exams by another name\". \nThis year's National 5s, Highers and Advanced Highers were cancelled because of disruption caused by the pandemic. \nGrades are to be given on \"teacher judgement\" but that needs to be backed up by evidence gathered in tests. \nSome schools are setting these tests in conditions which are very similar to exams but with much less preparation.\nThe approach across schools varies with some spreading the tests over several class lesson times but others doing them all in one go, with invigilators on hand to make sure strict exam conditions are met. \nThe system is being described as unfair by pupils and parents.\nSixteen-year-old Deni, who is doing her Highers, has started a petition asking for these final assessments to be scrapped. \nThe petition says that after being in school for just four months and then having to learn remotely since the New Year she is now being told there will be a \"final assessment\" after the Easter holidays on which her grade will be primarily based. \n\"Why not just call it an exam?\" she says.\nThis is the second year without senior students sitting final exams.\nLast year, the decision to scrap them was made in a rush and with no warning.\nThis year it was made with more foresight in a bid to tackle \"unfairness\" caused by repeated periods of Covid-related isolation for some students and not others. \nHowever, the perception of unfairness might be one which is hard to shake.\nTeachers have been given guidance on how to come up with pupils' estimated grades, but they have also been given some flexibility. \nIt means that the experiences of young people in schools across the country could be totally different, the very situation everyone was hoping to avoid.  \nThe authorities will say that \"quality assurance checks\" will make up for this.\nDeni, from Dundee, says students now need to try to revise a whole year's work for courses that most have not yet finished and which, for much of it, they have had to teach themselves. \nA Dundee City Council spokesman said Deni's school had not indicated to pupils that their grades would \"only\" be based around one assessment. \nHe said: \"We are working closely with young people and families during this hugely challenging time and will be re-assuring them directly over how assessments will be made.\"\nDylan is taking his Highers but when final end of year exams were cancelled he was told grades would be based on an overall teacher judgement of coursework and class tests.\nNow Dylan, who is at school in Bathgate, says he has been told his grades will mainly be based on assessments he will sit in the coming weeks.\n\"I'm really worried because normally we have at least nine months in advance knowing when our exams are going to be and I only got told this morning that I have got one in three weeks,\" Dylan says.\n\"It does not feel great. It's quite worrying, especially since we have to be in class the rest of the time as well.\"\nWhen this year's exams were cancelled, guidance was given to schools advising them the most robust way to gather evidence for grades was through class tests based on questions provided by the Scottish Qualifications Authority.\nIt has led to schools doing this in different ways - with some planning to do these tests spread over different class times while others are setting them up much closer to an exam style - but without study leave.\nBBC Scotland has also spoken to teachers who think the system is unfair.\nBrian Donlin, who teaches geography, says the way schools are carrying out these assessments is wildly different.\n\"How can we turn around and say that that we are ensuring consistency across a national level?,\" he says. \"We can't fundamentally, you just can't. \n\"Let's not kid ourselves on, there are some kids across Scotland who are sitting exams this year.\"\nSeamus Searson, general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association (SSTA), told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that there was a lot of confusion because exams were cancelled prior to Christmas and everyone assumed it would be coursework and continuous assessment.\nMr Searson said schools were now trying to gather evidence for awarding grades and were falling back on the question papers provided by the SQA (Scottish Qualifications Authority).\nHe said: \"Our view is if youngsters do any assessments, they should be broken up, and used between now and the end of term. \n\"At the moment, the government guidance is that when pupils go back to school after Easter, it should be for teaching and learning. Assessments should come towards the end of the session. \n\"That is the mistake schools are making.\"\nMr Searson said schools are probably concerned there may be another lockdown and are trying to put these assessments in early so they have some evidence just in case.\nHe said: \"There are a lot of children who won't have been engaging during lockdown who will be totally disadvantaged by the systems these schools are trying to bring in.\n\"The system put in place at the moment looks straightforward but it's actually micro-managing teachers' decisions. This is where the panic is starting to come in. Teachers are now looking for pieces of evidence to prove to the SQA their grades are correct.\"\nThe Scottish Qualifications Authority said it had \"made it clear that there is no requirement to replicate a full formal exam or prelim diet\".\nIt said it had provided detailed guidance to schools and there was flexibility on how assessment evidence was gathered.\n\"Schools and colleges know their learners best, so it is appropriate that they deliver assessments which suit their circumstances this year,\" the SQA said. \n\"Evidence requirements have been significantly reduced - it is about quality, not quantity.\""

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),France,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has criticised the rollout of coronavirus vaccines in Europe as being \"unacceptably slow\". \nIt also says the situation in the region is more worrying than it has been for several months. \nVaccination campaigns in much of Europe have been hit by delays and the number of infections is rising.\nFrance is the latest country to announce new lockdown measures, lasting four weeks.\n\"Vaccines present our best way out of this pandemic... However, the rollout of these vaccines is unacceptably slow\" and is prolonging the pandemic in the wider Europe region, WHO director for Europe Hans Kluge said in a statement.\n\"We must speed up the process by ramping up manufacturing, reducing barriers to administering vaccines, and using every single vial we have in stock, now,\" he added.\nIn the meantime, as long as vaccine coverage remained low, he said EU countries would have to impose lockdowns and other measures to compensate for the delays.\nMr Kluge also warned that the vaccine rollout, despite its slow speed, risked \"providing a false sense of security to authorities and the public alike\". \nLast week saw increasing transmission of Covid-19 in the majority of countries in the WHO European region - which includes more than 50 countries and extends from Greenland to the far east of Russia. There were 1.6 million new cases and close to 24,000 deaths, the WHO said. \nCases were rising in all but one age group, the organisation said.\nOnly 10% of the nearly 900 million people in the region have had a single dose of coronavirus vaccine.\nIt remains the second most affected by the virus of all the world's regions, with the total number of deaths fast approaching one million and the total number of cases about to surpass 45 million, it added.\nThe WHO also warned of the risks of greater spread associated with increased mobility and number of gatherings over the forthcoming religious holidays of Passover, Easter and Ramadan. \nSome 27 countries of the more than 50 included in the WHO Europe region have implemented partial or full coronavirus lockdowns. \nOnly 16% of the EU's population has so far received a dose of vaccine.\nThe EU was slow to negotiate a contract with vaccine manufacturer AstraZeneca which caused supply problems. It also sparked a political row with the UK, where AstraZeneca has plants and where 52% of the population has had at least one dose. \nThe EU's deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna also ran into early problems with production and distribution.\nEU regulators were then slow to authorise vaccines for use. Some EU countries subsequently paused their rollouts of the AstraZeneca jab over reports of blood clots among a small number of people who had received a dose. Others restricted its use among older people over concerns that the company had not provided enough testing data.\nAll this has led to low public confidence in the AstraZeneca vaccine. Polling company YouGov says only a third of Germans and less than a quarter of French respondents now consider it safe.\nThe WHO and the European Medicines Agency, however, say the benefits of the vaccine outweigh any risks.\nVaccine rollout in some non-EU countries in the WHO's Europe area has also been slow. In Russia some people are hesitant to be vaccinated with Russia's own Sputnik V vaccine, for which safety data has been made public and which has been shown to be effective.\nMeanwhile Ukraine received its first shipment of vaccines in late February - 500,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in India. But there is widespread scepticism towards vaccination - last month the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found 60% of Ukrainians did not want a jab.\nHowever, a bright spot in Europe is Serbia in the Balkans, which has vaccinated more than two million of its seven-million population thanks to early deals with vaccine providers including China's Sinopharm. It has also vaccinated migrants and citizens of neighbouring countries.\nWhat else is happening around Europe?"

      "tags": "Minneapolis,US race relations,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "Two paramedics have told a Minneapolis court that George Floyd had no pulse and did not appear to be breathing when they arrived at the scene.\nFormer police officer Derek Chauvin is accused of killing Mr Floyd by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes during an arrest in May 2020.\nParamedic Seth Bravindar said he had to ask Mr Chauvin to get off Mr Floyd so that they could access the patient.\nEarlier, the court heard emotional testimony from Mr Floyd's girlfriend.\nCourteney Ross described their first kiss, and their struggle with opioid addiction on the fourth day of Mr Chauvin's trial.\nMr Chauvin, 45, who was fired from the Minneapolis police force, denies charges of murder and manslaughter.\nMr Bravinder said the initial call-out was deemed non-life threatening although that soon changed.\nHe told the court he initially thought that a struggle was taking place when he and his partner arrived on the scene, but quickly realised that Mr Floyd, 46, was limp.\nAsked about video footage showing him gesturing to Mr Chauvin, Mr Bravinder said he wanted to \"have him move\" and this was \"so we could move the patient\".\nHis partner Derek Smith checked Mr Floyd's neck for a pulse but could not find one. \"In lay terms, I thought he was dead,\" Mr Smith said. \n\"When I arrived on scene there was no medical services being provided to the patient,\" he added.\nMr Bravinder cradled Mr Floyd's head to prevent it from hitting the road as they transferred him to a stretcher.\nThey put him in an ambulance and started chest compressions.  \nAt one point Mr Smith thought he saw electrical activity from Mr Floyd's heart and delivered an electrical shock to try to restart it. \"He was a human being and I was trying to give him a second chance at life,\" he said.\nMr Bravinder said he had to stop the ambulance en route to the hospital to help his colleague after the heart monitor showed Mr Floyd had flatlined - his heart had stopped. All further efforts to resuscitate Mr Floyd failed.\nCourteney Ross is the first person to testify who personally knew Mr Floyd.\nShe told the court that she met him in 2017 in the lobby of a Salvation Army homeless shelter, where he worked as a security guard and she was waiting to see the father of her son. She said Mr Floyd asked if she would pray with him.\n\"It was so sweet and at the time I had lost a lot of faith in God,\" she said, adding that they kissed that night.\nShe said their first meeting was \"one of my favourite stories to tell\".\nMs Ross said they both suffered from chronic pain, and were addicted to opioids. \n\"Addiction, in my opinion, is a lifelong struggle,\" she said. \"It's not something that comes and goes, it's something I'll deal with forever.\"\nShe did not specifically address whether Mr Floyd was using opioids on the day he died.\nA statement from Floyd family lawyers Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci denounced \"defence attempts to construct the narrative that George Floyd's cause of death was the Fentanyl in his system\".\n\"We want to remind the world who witnessed his death on video that George was walking, talking, laughing, and breathing just fine before Derek Chauvin held his knee to George's neck, blocking his ability to breathe and extinguishing his life,\" it said.\nJurors also heard from David Pleoger, the supervising police officer on duty that day, who said he only learned later in the evening that Mr Chauvin had restrained Mr Floyd by kneeling on his neck. \nHe told the court that an officer should stop using the knee as a restraint once \"you get control of the situation\" and the suspect is in handcuffs. \n\"Leave someone on their stomach for too long, their breathing will be compromised, so you'll want to get them up out of that position,\" he said.\nDefence lawyer Eric Nelson sought to play down the significance of his testimony by saying Mr Pleoger had \"not reviewed the entirety of the evidence in this particular case\".\nThe trial began on Monday with the Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell saying Mr Chauvin had \"betrayed his badge\" and used \"excessive and unreasonable force\".\nDefence lawyers have indicated they will argue that Mr Floyd died of an overdose and poor health, and the force used was reasonable.\nFootage from both witnesses' mobile phones and the police officers' bodycams have been shown at length. At one point, Mr Floyd can be heard pleading with officers: \"I'm not a bad guy\", while the police officer is heard telling a bystander: \"We had to control this guy because he's a sizeable guy. It looks like he's probably on something.\nSeveral witnesses have also taken the stand, including four children who were under the age of 18 at the time of the arrest, and spoke of their trauma at what they saw.\nShop employee Christopher Martin - who inadvertently set off the tragic events after alerting his manager to a fake $20 bill Mr Floyd had used to buy some cigarettes - has spoken of his \"disbelief and guilt\". \"If I'd have just not taken the bill, this could have been avoided,\" he told the court.\nThroughout the testimony, Mr Chauvin has been taking almost constant notes. Three other officers  charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder will go on trial later in the year.\nThe video footage of a white police officer kneeling for a prolonged period on the neck of an African-American caused outrage and led to global protests and a racial reckoning in the US.\nMr Floyd's death had followed on the heels of several other high-profile cases of African-Americans dying at the hands of police officers.\nFormer President Barack Obama said the protests represented a \"genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system\".\nAfrican-Americans are disproportionately more likely to be fatally shot by police and arrested for drug abuse and five times more likely than white Americans to be imprisoned.\nPolice officers have rarely been convicted - if they are charged at all - for deaths that occur in custody, and the verdict in this trial is being widely seen as an indication of how the US legal system will treat such cases in future."

      "text": "New rules to help pubs, cafes and restaurants reopen outdoors safely in England on 12 April have sparked anger from industry groups.\nAll customers will have to sign in on entry, not just one member of the group like before. It is also unclear whether payment at the bar will be permitted.\nUK Hospitality said it would burden struggling pubs and staff and risk customers deciding not to go out.\nThe government said it was providing as much flexibility as possible to venues.\nIt also said it had removed other unpopular requirements such as drinking curfews.\nUnder the new guidance, every customer aged 16 and over will have to check in to NHS test and trace before entering a venue, or give their contact details to staff.\nPubs and restaurants must take \"reasonable steps\" to stop people who won't comply from coming in, or they could face a \u00a31,000 fine.  \nCarl Ford, an accountant based in Tamworth, told the BBC he was frustrated and confused by the rules.\n\"I feel like it's almost like going back to school where I have to sign in and out,\" he said. \n\"I don't understand why I have to do this in a restaurant or pub, but I don't need to do this in a supermarket where you have a free for all. People don't have to sign in and they can pick up fruit with their hands.\"\nOthers were supportive of the idea, however, saying it could reduce transmission.\nIn a joint statement, UK Hospitality, the British Beer & Pub Association and the British Institute of Innkeeping said the rules would add \"more confusion and inconvenience for customers and staff\".\nThey also warned if indoors payments were not permitted from 12 April, then some pubs, particularly in rural areas with poor broadband, would be unable to take payments at all.\nWith the government also considering whether \"proof of immunity\" should be a requirement for entry, the groups warned that \"millions\" of people could be put off going to pubs and venues at a time when the hospitality industry is struggling.\n\"Pubs will already be trading at a loss when they reopen with all the existing restrictions and Covid-secure measures in place,\" they said. \n\"Adding further disproportionate and discriminatory measures threatens the very survival of thousands of businesses.\"\nHospitality businesses have been hit particularly hard by lockdown closures and restrictions. \nIn the year to February, 368,000 payroll jobs were lost in the accommodation and food service sectors. The next worst hit sector was retail where 123,000 jobs were lost.\nA government spokeswoman said: \"Public health rules are kept under constant review and we are providing as much flexibility for pubs and other hospitality businesses as possible. \n\"The roadmap [to reopening] set out that hospitality would open from step two, and removed any requirements for curfews or a substantial meal for customers.\"\nShe said no final decisions had been taken on whether Covid-status certification could play a role in reopening the economy.\nShe added that the government continued to support the hospitality sector through the pandemic with its new \u00a35bn Restart Grant scheme, the VAT cut, business rates relief, and by extending furlough."

      "tags": "France,Weddings,Women,Sex",
      "text": "A French reality TV series has been condemned by the government over its treatment of so-called \"handkerchief ceremonies\" in which young brides are supposed to prove their virginity.  \nThe Minister for Citizenship Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa has written to the country's broadcast watchdog the CSA, saying she was \"outraged\" by Incredible Gypsy Weddings uncritical handling of the rite, which sees the bride being examined by female relatives just before the marriage takes place. \nInspired by Channel 4's Big Fat Gypsy Weddings, the French series on the free-to-view TFX channel follows the courtship and marriage traditions of the Catalan gitan community living in the southern town of Perpignan.  \nIn an edition broadcast in February, viewers saw, amid the preparations for a lavish wedding, the bed on which the ceremony was due to take place. \nThe commentary then ran: \"On this bed a woman with special training tests the resistance of Naomi's hymen with a delicate tissue. The ceremony of the handkerchief is ancestral and inescapable. If Naomi has had sexual relations, the wedding will be cancelled.\"\nIn other scenes, women from the community explained why it was important. \"It is for the family of the boy,\" said one. \"So that they know he has a taken a beautiful woman who is a virgin.\" \n\"Since she was a baby she's been brought up to know that she has to have the ceremony, to get all her dresses, to get her wedding,\" said another. \nAsked if men should not have similar questions asked of them, another replied: \"That's not how it is done. We start from the principle that if a young man doesn't go out to party and see other girls before he gets married, then afterwards he'll miss it. It's an experience he has to have.\" \nMs Schiappa said in her letter she was incensed at the unquestioning tone of the programme. \n\"The whole institution of our Republican marriage was trampled underfoot, without any proper commentary,\" she said.\nShe said the sequences were \"all the more revolting\" because the National Assembly had only just voted for a law \"banning virginity tests and assuring the consent of both partners to a marriage\". \nA clause in France's Separatism Law - which is currently before the Senate - makes it illegal for doctors to issue virginity certificates. The article is aimed primarily at France's Muslim community, where some families insist on proof of virginity before marriage. The extent of the practice is disputed.  \nIn the text voted by the Assembly, doctors who issue certificates would risk a year in jail and a \u20ac15,000 fine (\u00a312,800; $17,600). Non-medical professionals who carry out virginity tests, even with the consent of the woman, would risk being charged with rape.    \nThe World Health Organization says the practice of inspecting the hymen visually or with fingers cannot prove whether a woman or girl has had vaginal intercourse or not. It is also a violation of their human rights, the organisation says.\nMs Schiappa has complained before of sexism on French television. Last year, as minister for sexual equality, she commissioned a report that criticised reality TV for perpetuating stereotypes. \n\"Reality TV programmes emphasise the hyper-femininity of women candidates and the ultra-masculinity of the men. From this dichotomy stems a vision of relations between men and women that is stereotyped and unequal,\" the report said. \nShe has also complained about popular French wedding TV shows such as Four Marriages for a Honeymoon, in which couples are judged against each other for the quality of their weddings, and Married at First Sight where a couple are married within hours of meeting each other and the cameras follow their marital progress.

      "tags": "China,COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change,India,John Kerry",
      "text": "Sharp divisions between the major global emitters have emerged at a series of meetings designed to make progress on climate change.\nIndia lambasted the richer world's carbon cutting plans, calling long term net zero targets, \"pie in the sky.\"\nTheir energy minister said poor nations want to continue using fossil fuels and the rich countries \"can't stop it\".\nChina meanwhile declined to attend a different climate event organised by the UK.\nTrying to lead 197 countries forward on the critical global issue of climate change is not a job for the faint hearted, as the UK is currently finding out. \nAs president of COP26, this year's crucial climate meeting due to take place in Glasgow in November, Britain is charged with ensuring a successful summit of world leaders and their negotiators.\nTo that end, the UK team have embarked on a series of meetings to find the building blocks of agreement, so that the world keeps the temperature targets agreed in Paris in 2015 within reach. \nTo have a decent chance of keeping the increase in global temperature under 1.5C - which is now considered as the gateway to dangerous warming - carbon emissions need to reach net zero by 2050. \nNet zero refers to balancing out any greenhouse gas emissions produced by industry, transport or other sources by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.\nA range of major carbon-producing countries, including the US, the UK, Japan and the EU, have signed up to the idea. Last September, China said it would get there by 2060. \nIndia, the world's fourth largest emitter, doesn't seem keen to join the club. \n\"2060 sounds good, but it is just that, it sounds good,\" Raj Kumar Singh, India's minister for power, told a meeting organised by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\"I would call it, and I'm sorry to say this, but it is just a pie in the sky.\"\nTo the discomfort of his fellow panellists, Mr Singh singled out developed countries where per capita emissions are much higher than in India. \n\"You have countries whose per capita emissions are four or five or 12 times the world average. The question is when are they going to come down?\"\n\"What we hear is that by 2050 or 2060 we will become carbon neutral, 2060 is far away and if the people emit at the rate they are emitting the world won't survive, so what are you going to do in the next five years that's what the world wants to know.\"\nMr Singh pointed out that while it was the richer countries who had burned most of the fossil fuels that have caused the problems, they now wanted developing countries to stop - that was unfair, he said. \n\"The developed world has occupied almost 80% of the carbon space already, you have 800 million people who don't have access to electricity. You can't say that they have to go to net zero, they have the right to develop, they want to build skyscrapers and have a higher standard of living, you can't stop it,\" he told the meeting. \nChina's minister Zhang Jianhua told the IEA virtual event that his country wanted \"increased mutual understanding and mutual trust to work as one\", on the issue of climate change.\nHowever, that desire to work as one didn't stretch as far as the UK, with China declining an invitation to take part in a key climate and development ministerial meeting for vulnerable countries. \nThere was a feeling among officials that diplomatic arguments with China over human rights were spilling over into the climate arena. \nUS special envoy on climate change, John Kerry, went out of his way to pour oil on troubled waters when speaking at the IEA event. \nBoth India and China see themselves as developing economies and want to retain some sense that richer Western nations have to take the lead on climate. \nThe former secretary of state was keen to say that there wouldn't be just the same carbon-cutting plan for every country, but everyone would have to do more.   \n\"We can't just willy-nilly ignore the next 10 years because the scientists tell us that if we don't do enough in the next 10 years we cannot keep the Earth's temperature at 1.5C, we cannot even get on a roadmap to net zero by 2050,\" he said.\n\"So my plea is to avoid the 'happy talk' and recognise that this challenge is global and never has there been a challenge that requires the unity of countries all across the planet than now.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "text": "France is one of the most vaccine-sceptical countries in the world - fertile ground for hard-line anti-vaccine activists spreading online misinformation, writes the BBC's specialist disinformation reporter Marianna Spring. \nIn his spare time, Gilles loves to watch sci-fi films and read bandes dessin\u00e9es - French comic books. \nHe also helps run a conspiracy-themed French-language Facebook group with 50,000 members, many of whom spread falsehoods about coronavirus. \nHe became a member just after the start of the pandemic, almost a year ago. \n\"I felt in my gut that this whole thing was overrated and wrong,\" Gilles says. He doesn't deny - like some others in the group - that Covid-19 is real. Instead he harbours vague suspicions about the disease, potential cures, and alleged cover-ups. \nAnd he doesn't want a Covid vaccine, because of posts he's seeing on the group.\nHe fears, despite the weight of scientific evidence, that jabs have been developed too quickly to be safe. And Gilles' story is part of a bigger picture. \nThe Facebook group that Gilles helps to run is just one example of a larger trend - an increase in French-language anti-vaccine content on social media over the past year. \nResearch from BBC Monitoring found that the number of followers of pages sharing extreme anti-vaccine content in French grew in 2020, from 3.2m to nearly 4.1m likes. \nThese pages aren't about asking legitimate medical questions - they're miles away from the scientific and political discussions currently under way in Europe and elsewhere.\nInstead, they're run by people who've firmly made up their minds against vaccinations, and who spread wild false rumours about vaccines killing millions, containing tracking devices, or altering our DNA. \nAnti-vaccine pages in French also tend to mix in anti-establishment posts. Many of the discussions centre around concerns that Covid jabs could be made compulsory, with anti-establishment and protest communities fearing that French democracy will be replaced with a so-called \"sanitary dictatorship\".\nCovid-19 vaccination is not currently mandatory in France, though children are legally required to be vaccinated against some diseases.\nFacebook says it is investigating the groups and pages flagged by the BBC's research, and that it has removed 12 million pieces of harmful misinformation about Covid-19 and approved vaccines. \n\"Last week we announced further measures to curb the spread of harmful misinformation in groups,\" a company spokesperson said, \"including by restricting the reach of those who break our rules.\"  \nThe Anti-Vax Files: A new series from BBC Trending, on the World Service from 05:30 GMT Saturday - or listen online \nIn the group run by Gilles, outlandish false conspiracy theories appear alongside posts expressing more moderate views, like opposition to making vaccines mandatory. \nHe doesn't agree with the extreme content, but Gilles says he struggles to delete all of the offending posts. \nBut there are others trying their best to fight the wave of anti-vaccine conspiracies. They create their own Facebook pages, infiltrating the spaces on social media where falsehoods thrive.\nMarie - not her real name - runs a group of volunteers pushing pro-vaccine messages online. She wants to remain anonymous because she fears for her safety.\n\"We had a lot of death threats,\" she explains, a little shaken as she speaks from her home in Paris, \"[from] people on social media who read our page and don't like what they see on it.\"\nI asked her why she continues in the face of abuse.\n\"I love science,\" she says, \"and I hate fake news.\" \nHer Facebook page arms followers with accurate information about vaccines, asks them to debate people and even to try to persuade them to get vaccinated.\nThis battle for the truth is raging all over the world, but it's particularly fierce in France. \nAccording to a survey by Ipsos late last year, just 40% of French people intended to receive a Covid-19 vaccine - although a more recent study indicated that number has increased to more than half. \nBut Tristan Mendes France, a university lecturer who helps run a site called Conspiracy Watch, is still worried about the figures. Fifteen years ago, he says, polls indicated that only about a tenth of France's population were sceptical about vaccines. \n\"It's important to differentiate between those who are sceptical about the vaccine and those who are absolutely anti-vaccine,\" he says. \nIn his view, the online anti-vaccine movement has thrived in France in particular because it plays on pre-existing scepticism of authority and pharmaceutical companies.\nIt's not just about online conspiracy theories. According to Mendes France and other experts, vaccine scepticism has deeper and more complicated roots - a combination of deep distrust in the state, a passion for personal liberty, and historical failings. \nThe country experienced a genuine vaccine scandal in 2009. The French government bought enough doses of the vaccine against the H1N1 \"swine flu\" virus to vaccinate its entire population. \nIt cost more than 600m euros (more than $700m or \u00a3500m), but with only a few hundred swine flu deaths in the country, many didn't want the jab. It was seen as huge waste of money. \nIn recent weeks, France was one of several European countries to suspend use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine over concerns about blood clots. \nThe UK and EU Medicine regulators have concluded that there is no evidence the vaccine causes clots, and that the jab safe and effective.\nBut it's another news story that has been used by French-speaking anti-vaccine activists to promote conspiracy narratives. \nThen there's the so-called \"Didier Raoult effect\".\nRaoult is a doctor who's a household name in France - famed for his intellect and his outspokeness. \n\"If you just start to be clever, it's a crime in our country. It's very hard for me not to be clever. I'm sorry,\" he chuckles, speaking from his research institute in Marseille. \nDespite a once-stellar reputation for scientific research, Dr Raoult caused controversy when he advocated the use of a drug called hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus. \nHis claims were repeated by Donald Trump, but lacked scientific evidence. The incident resulted in a formal complaint from his peers in the medical community.\nAside from the controversy over the drug, Dr Raoult has become - through no choice of his own - a hero for hard-core activists pushing anti-vaccine conspiracies. Fictitious quotes falsely attributed to the doctor have been circulated on social media. \nWhile these posts are false, he still has some controversial opinions about vaccines. He says he isn't sure people under age 65 should get a Covid-19 vaccine. That's despite the benefits that public health experts point out: younger people can be seriously affected by the virus, and mass vaccination can limit harmful virus mutations. \nDr Raoult's approach appears to be part of a more general outlook in French-speaking Europe. At the extreme end, it sometimes spills over to conspiratorial thinking. \nGilles, the sci-fi fan, is sure he doesn't want a Covid-19 vaccine. He's blas\u00e9 about catching the disease. \n\"I don't think that anything could happen,\" he says, \"Maybe [I would] get symptoms of flu, but that's very unlikely.\" \nCovid-19 has a higher mortality rate than flu in all age groups, except perhaps children under the age of 12. The long term effects of coronavirus can also be severe - and it's more infectious than flu. \nBut his lingering suspicion leaves Gilles - and others like him - vulnerable to all sorts of misinformation. \nHear The Anti-Vax Files from BBC Trending, on the World Service from 05:30 GMT Saturday - or listen online "

      "tags": "Neo-Nazism,Metropolitan Police Service,Anti-terror legislation,Counter-terrorism",
      "text": "Metropolitan Police officer Ben Hannam has been convicted of membership of the banned neo-Nazi group National Action. \nThe deception was as easy as ticking a box.\nIn 2017, on his application form to join the Metropolitan Police, Ben Hannam was asked if he had ever been in the far-right British National Party or any organisations whose aims \"may contradict the duty to promote race equality\". \nHe ticked \"no\".\nOnce accepted, he spent two years in the force, working among communities in north London, even interviewing suspects on his own.\nBut, just two days before he applied to join the force, he had appeared in a neo-Nazi propaganda video.\nDeceit had become normal.\nAt school he had a girlfriend of Mauritian and Muslim heritage, as well as friends from various ethnic backgrounds. \nSeveral gave evidence at his trial, saying he never showed any prejudice towards them.\nOne grandparent is gay. Another step-grandparent is Jewish.\nYet Hannam spent his weekends with neo-Nazis and collected a library of fascist literature. \nHis beliefs were noticed by some.\nA teacher told the trial she had been unable to mark one essay submitted by Hannam - the first time this had happened in 20 years of teaching - because of \"concerning content\" and his \"intolerance\" towards Islam.\nHe was also spoken to after students at his diverse school reacted to \"anti-immigration\" views he espoused during a debate.\nThe Met never took a reference from the school.\nAfter he was charged, three experts agreed Hannam was autistic and that this was relevant to his interest in fascism, an ideology historically associated with order and structure. \nOne said Hannam was well aware of what National Action stood for. The others said his autism meant it took him some time to realise the group was \"morally bad\".\nProsecutors said his diagnosis did not excuse his conduct or explain why he sought friends in a neo-Nazi group.\nHannam had joined National Action (NA) in early 2016 while studying for his A-levels.\nHe was active online, including on the image board 4Chan, and was attracted to NA after watching videos of co-founders Alex Davies and Ben Raymond.\nAfter writing to the group, Hannam was invited to meet older members in London and was soon travelling north to attend an annual conference in Liverpool, where he posed for a photo next to a man doing a Nazi salute which featured in a film of the event.\nUsing an alias, he joined a neo-Nazi web forum called Iron March, which spawned several extremist groups around the world.\nIn one forum thread started by Hannam, entitled \"Muslim shoots white man in London\", he asked for \"thoughts and advice\".\nWhen one user replied by discussing how to get a firearm, Hannam wrote: \"Care to help me out in this topic then? I don't know where to start with obtaining one besides a shotgun, and I don't think they'd be of much use\".\nHe also used the website to help another student apply to NA.\nHe suggested the teenager tone down his application, as otherwise \"you'll get the police knocking at your door\".\nDuring his trial, Hannam claimed \"there are no pictures of me doing a Nazi salute\".\nBut the BBC has identified him at a fight training event, filmed for an NA propaganda video, which he arranged to attend in August 2016 with the other teenager.\nThe film shows Hannam boxing with leading member Mark Jones, their faces blurred, with the whole group then saluting together for the camera.\nThat summer, NA - founded as a youth movement three years earlier - used social media to glorify the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox by a neo-Nazi. \nBy the end of the year it was outlawed in the UK as a terrorist organisation, making it illegal to remain a member.\nThe ban came as:\nIn 2017 the organisation re-emerged under new aliases, including NS131.\nHannam continued to meet other members, pose for propaganda images to promote the new brand, and attend fight training. Another event, not attended by Hannam, saw members practise knife combat in a forest.\nCounter-terror police seized clear, raw footage of these events in September that year, when they arrested Mark Jones and the NA co-founder Alex Davies.\nBut, despite the small numbers at each gathering, Hannam was not identified.\nDifferent counter-terror teams around the UK had responsibility for different group members, but some people - who may have appeared peripheral - were not a focus.\nInvestigations had already revealed several soldiers were members of an NA chat group. \nOne soldier, Mikko Vehvilainen, was stockpiling weapons and would later be convicted of membership\nDuring exchanges with other senior figures, Vehvilainen said members should focus on gaining \"military and key civil positions\".\nHannam was only caught after anti-fascists leaked data online from the Iron March forum.\nDetectives reviewed IP addresses for British forum users, tracing the account used by Hannam to his north London home.\nThe police investigation found no evidence he had been involved with NA after July 2017.\nHowever, there are hints that he did not break all contact with his past.\nEven before his arrest, people involved in the group knew that one of their former members had joined the police, the BBC has established.\nHannam also continued to access and save disturbing content, including an image glorifying the perpetrator of New Zealand's Christchurch massacre.\nIn November 2018, he saved a photo to his phone of NA associate Oskar Dunn-Koczorowski, who was arrested for terrorism offences the following month, but whose image was not yet public.\nIn court, Hannam claimed he simply chanced across it online, but how it actually came into his possession is unclear.\nCommander Richard Smith, head of the Met's counter terrorism command, said he was \"hugely concerned\" that a serving officer had been a member of a banned group, but that he was identified at the \"earliest\" opportunity and officers then moved quickly to make an arrest."

      "title": "Met officer investigated over rape allegations",
      "tags": "Metropolitan Police Service",
      "text": "The Metropolitan Police is investigating allegations that a serving officer raped two of his female colleagues.\nThe officer was not charged and has not been suspended but faces a misconduct hearing more than three years after the allegations were reported.\nThe women were awarded compensation but one of them says \"we were just cast aside and not cared for\".\nThe Met says it takes \"all allegations of domestic abuse extremely seriously\".\nA BBC investigation with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that the Met is also investigating whether details of the women's allegations were leaked to the accused officer. \nThe BBC has changed the women's names to protect their anonymity and is not naming the male suspect.  \n\"Holly\" was a junior police officer when she started a relationship with an older, more senior colleague. She says that after a few months he became controlling and violent.  \nAfter a night out with friends in 2013, she says he dragged her by the hair and \"threw me into the dining room table and was going crazy at me\". \n\"I was saying, 'please stop, you're hurting me'.\" \nShe says he then hurled her against the arm of a sofa, cracking her ribs. \"It was an unbelievable amount of pain. I couldn't get my breath,\" she says.\nNeighbours called the police but Holly was too afraid to report the assault. \nOn another occasion she says she was raped. \nThe male officer also had a relationship and moved in with another colleague, \"Kate\", who says that over three years she was also raped and assaulted. \nThis included being \"beaten up in my car\" while it was parked on police premises.\n\"He started abusing me after four months of being together,\" she says. \"It progressed and progressed... he tried to kill me. He threw me against a chest of drawers in the bedroom.\"\nShe says he then \"ran\" at her and \"pinned me to the bed and strangled me\".\nSoon after that Kate ended the relationship. She was put in touch with Holly by a mutual friend and quickly realised their experiences were a \"carbon copy\" of each other. \nIn 2017, they both reported allegations of physical and sexual assault. The male officer denied them and after an investigation by Essex Police, the Crown Prosecution Service decided in 2019 there was not enough evidence to prosecute. \n\"It was a really bad investigation,\" marred by a lack of evidence gathering, according to Holly. She claims Essex Police \"didn't even finish taking all my allegations\" and didn't arrest the suspect. \nEssex Police said it carried out lengthy investigations but accepts \"there were areas for improvement in the management of these investigations\".\nAsked why the male officer was not arrested, the force said: \"There was no immediate safeguarding concern due to the non-recent nature of the allegations and the lack of contact between suspect and victims.\"\nThe male officer has not responded to our request for comment. \nHolly says she still lives in fear of meeting him at work. \nIn 2020, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) awarded her \u00a317,100, saying \"police evidence indicates that you were a victim of sexual abuse\". \nCICA paid \u00a311,600 to Kate, saying she had been raped and subjected to \"serious physical abuse\".\nCICA is part of the Ministry of Justice and awards compensation to victims of violent crime, sexual assault and abuse - but it does not need the same standard of proof as a criminal court. \nThe Met decided last month, a year after CICA's findings, that the officer accused of rape would face a misconduct hearing. They have not set a date. \nIn a statement, the force said: \"We take all allegations of domestic abuse extremely seriously and it is right and proper that the full circumstances of this case should be considered at a hearing. We continue to offer welfare support and assistance to the victims in this case.\"\nThe Met confirmed the male officer had been taken off public-facing duties. Asked why he had never been suspended, it said a criminal investigation did not guarantee an officer would be suspended. \nBut the way the Met handled her experience at a local level was horrendous, Holly said. \n\"There was very little support, (it was) very poorly managed,\" she said. \"He massively controlled everything. He had his friends. He was looked after, whereas we were just cast aside and not cared for.\"\nAt an early stage, the male officer was leaked details of the investigation. Internal police documents seen by the BBC showed this allowed him to prepare his defence. \nSolicitor Siobhan Crawford, who works on abuse cases, said: \"The investigation and the steps taken thereafter by the Met have been completely inadequate, woeful, and let these women down.\"\n\"It has taken just so long for the Met to take any action whatsoever against this person,\" she added. \"And I think what that says to other victims of domestic violence is, 'we say we'll protect you but actually it will take years and it may all come to nothing'.\"\nHolly still loves being a police officer but said she was \"quite bitter about it\". \n\"But I want to try and change it because I don't want anyone else to go through what I've been through\u2026 It makes you feel like you're going crazy because you think, 'why are you treating me this badly?'\"\nKate said: \"I have no trust in the service I work for.\""

      "tags": "Long Covid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "About one in five people have symptoms of long Covid five weeks after an initial infection and one in seven after 12 weeks, an Office for National Statistics (ONS) survey suggests.\nIt estimates that 1.1 million people were affected in the UK in the four weeks from 6 February.\nAbout 20% of people said ongoing symptoms limited their day-to-day activities a lot. \nPeople were asked to report their own symptoms.\nThe ONS survey asked people if they faced issues such as fatigue lasting more than four weeks after a Covid infection that could not be explained by anything else. The most common ongoing problems included fatigue, coughs, headaches and muscle pain. \nA separate ONS study estimates coronavirus infections fell slightly in England and Scotland, rose in Northern Ireland and stayed roughly the same in Wales in the week to 27 March.\nDespite a slight uptick in infections in children of secondary school age in the week to 20 March, there was no indication of that trend continuing in the latest figures. \nAmong people aged 50-69, the study suggests a decrease in the percentage testing positive, which may be a result of this age group being offered vaccinations against Covid-19 in recent weeks.\nThere is no universally agreed definition of long Covid, but it covers a broad range of symptoms.\nMeanwhile, in the latest daily figures, the government said that a further 4,479 people had tested positive for coronavirus and another 51 people had died within 28 days of a positive test. Although that latter figure is slightly up on the previous day, it is lower than the 63 announced last Thursday. \nAnd after Tuesday saw more second vaccinations than first jabs, that accelerated dramatically in Wednesday figures that have just been released. While there were 241,906 making their first trip to the vaccine clinic, there were 404,922 getting their follow-up dose.\nThe survey of UK households found:\nLong Covid is an emerging phenomenon that is not yet fully understood, and the estimates from the ONS are preliminary. \nMost people who get coronavirus feel better in a few days or weeks, and the majority will make a full recovery within 12 weeks. But for some people, symptoms can last longer.\nPeople who had mild symptoms at first can still have long-term problems.\nNHS England has invested \u00a310m in specialist long Covid clinics.

      "text": "Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has announced a hunger strike at the penal colony where he is held, to demand proper medical treatment. \nHe has complained on Instagram of not receiving medical help for back pain and problems with his right leg, as well as being deprived of sleep.\nNavalny, 44, returned home from Germany in January after treatment for a nerve agent attack in Siberia in August.\nHe was taken into custody immediately and then given a jail sentence.\nHe is currently being detained at the IK-2 corrective penal colony 100 km (60 miles) east of Moscow and has accused the guards there of denying him proper treatment for his ailments. \nRussia's federal penitentiary service has rejected his complaint, insisting he had \"all the necessary medical assistance in accordance with his medical indications\".\nA fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin, Navalny was given a two-year and eight month sentence last month for violating the probation terms of an embezzlement case. \nThe conviction was widely seen as politically motivated and the European Court of Human Rights said he should be freed because of the risk to his life. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this week that Navalny was \"responsible for his deeds under the law\" and no different from any other Russian.\nNavalny's Instagram post on Wednesday, published by his lawyers, shows a handwritten note in which the Kremlin critic writes: \"I have declared a hunger strike demanding that the law be upheld and a doctor of my choice be allowed to visit me.\"\n\"I have the right to invite a doctor and receive medication. But they are simply not allowing me to do either. The back pain has spread to my leg. I've lost sensation in parts of my right leg and now the left leg too. Jokes aside, this is getting worrying,\" he wrote.\nHe said in an earlier post that he had only been given two tablets of the painkiller ibuprofen and was yet to be diagnosed. The penitentiary service (FSIN) said at the time that his health was stable and satisfactory.\nNavalny has also complained of being woken up every hour by a guard during the night which he argues amounts to torture. The FSIN said in its statement on Wednesday that staff carried out \"a visual inspection of the convicts' presence on their beds\" but that did not disturb their sleep.\nAs well as serious back pain, he spoke of numbness in his leg which was preventing him from standing on it. He thought he was suffering from a pinched nerve after standing \"crookedly\" in cages during court appearances and travelling in police wagons. \nNed Price, spokesperson for the US state department on Wednesday described Navalny as a \"political prisoner\" and said his detention was \"politically motivated\". \n\"We will continue to seek to hold accountable those in Russia who may be responsible for the attempt on his life, for the repression against his peaceful supporters who have taken to the streets, and we will continue to find ways to support Mr Navalny and to call for his release,\" he added."

      "tags": "France,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Emmanuel Macron,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "French schools will close for at least three weeks as part of new national restrictions to fight rising Covid cases, President Emmanuel Macron says.\nMr Macron said that schools would move to remote learning from next week. \nLockdown measures, introduced in some areas of France earlier this month, are also being extended to other districts.\nAll non-essential shops are to close from Saturday and there will be a ban on travelling more than 10km (six miles) from home without good reason. \nThe country is facing a peak of over 5,000 people in intensive care.\nOn Wednesday, the country's health ministry reported 59,038 new cases. France has so far reported more than 4.6 million cases of coronavirus and 95,495 Covid-related deaths.\nIn his live televised address on Wednesday, Mr Macron described the situation in the country as \"delicate\" and said that April would prove crucial. \"We will lose control if we do not move now,\" he said. \nThe 43-year-old president said it was a race between vaccinations on the one hand and attempting to control the spread of the virus on the other.\nHe said that while schools would be closing from next week, classes would remain open for the children of key workers. Primary schools and kindergartens will shut for three weeks and high schools for a week longer, although that includes two weeks of spring holiday from 12-26 April.\nMr Macron said that measures introduced in 19 districts earlier this month - including the closure of non-essential businesses, exercise restricted to within 10km of an individual's home and a ban on travel to other parts of the country without a valid reason - would be extended nationwide. \n\"Everyone should limit their contacts with other people,\" he said, adding that people would be given the Easter weekend to get themselves to where they want to spend the lockdown. \nFrance's nationwide 19:00 curfew will remain in place and people are again being asked to work from home.\nThe president said \"the end of the tunnel\" was in sight if people respected the new measures. \nParliament will debate the measures announced by Mr Macron before voting on them on Thursday, according to the prime minister's office.\nMore than at previous turning-points, the politics of Covid in France is becoming interesting.\nFor one thing, President Macron has opened up a much clearer target now for the opposition - they can argue that his decision back in January to overrule the scientists and not launch a third lockdown was a blunder.\nHe was warned then that the so-called British variant would sweep all before it by the end of March - and lo and behold that is what has happened. And now he is eating his hat.\nFor his enemies, it is the result of Macron's hubris - the insufferable self-belief that makes him think he knows better than the doctors.\nThe other reason it's getting sensitive is the UK. Everyone in France can see how much better the vaccination programme is going there. If the UK starts resuming ordinary life while France is still struggling, tough questions will be asked of the president.\nAnd elections are only a year away. \nWith serious cases of coronavirus increasing in France, the pressure on hospitals in the greater Paris region has resulted in a surge in demand for beds at intensive care units (ICUs). Hospitals in and around Paris have also been reducing non-Covid treatments.\nThe French hospital federation (FHF) last week warned that wards across the country were facing an \"unprecedented violent shock\" in the coming weeks if authorities were unable to curb the rise in cases. It urged the government to issue a \"strict lockdown\" or risk hospitals becoming overwhelmed. \nIn an interview with France Inter radio on Tuesday, head of infectious diseases at the Tenon hospital in Paris, Gilles Pialoux, said that lockdown restrictions should have been implemented sooner.\n\"We've lost so much time that the measures now will be harder and last for longer,\" he said, adding that hospital staff were \"tired of being tired\".\nPublic support for a new national lockdown has reportedly been increasing in recent days, with an Elabe Institute poll published on Wednesday suggesting that 54% of citizens questioned backed the move.\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo on Wednesday backed the closure of schools, saying the move - which had been seen by the government as a last resort - was necessary because of the \"very serious situation\".\nA group of French school teachers had earlier filed a legal complaint against Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer for \"endangering the lives of others\", accusing him of failing to protect staff in regular contact with children in classrooms.\nIn Germany, the leaders of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg, the country's worst hit states, have called for tougher restrictions, saying the situation was worse than initially thought. The city of Hamburg is to introduce a night curfew on Friday.\nSpain is to revisit a new law implemented on Wednesday that requires face masks to be worn in outdoor spaces - including beaches and swimming pools - amid mounting criticism over the move. \nAuthorities in Portugal say they aim to vaccinate all members of priority groups with at least one Covid-19 jab by 11 April. The head of the national coronavirus taskforce told parliament that the focus would be on care home residents, people aged 80 and over and those aged 50 and over with underlying conditions.\nA court in the Czech Republic has struck down the requirement for Czech citizens returning from blacklisted countries to test negative before leaving, arguing that tests can be carried out on arrival.\nPoland on Wednesday registered its highest daily Covid death toll this year, with 653 fatalities. The country has recorded a total of 53,045 coronavirus-related deaths since the start of the pandemic. \nMeanwhile, experts investigating possible links between the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots have so far found no specific risk factors, such as age, gender or medical history, European Union regulators have said. The European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, said that analysis was continuing."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you on Friday morning. \nAn Office for National Statistics survey suggests that about one in five people have symptoms of long Covid five weeks after an initial infection and one in seven after 12 weeks. It estimates that 1.1 million people were affected in the UK in the four weeks from 6 February. People were asked to report their own symptoms and the most common ongoing problems included fatigue, a cough, headaches and muscle pain.\nPfizer says its vaccine is preventing 91% of coronavirus cases in the six months after people are immunised, while a separate study shows even people in their 80s and 90s are producing impressive levels of antibodies after receiving two doses. But the crucial question of how long the protection from the vaccine lasts remains unanswered. Find out here when you can expect to get a vaccine if you live in the UK.\nThe head of the NHS in England, Sir Simon Stevens, says the coronavirus pandemic has been the biggest health challenge since World War Two. He says the demands of the pandemic has led the NHS to change rapidly and find new ways of working. The vaccination programme is a particular example of how different parts of the NHS came together with community organisations and successfully targeted the groups in the population to offer jabs, Sir Simon argues.\nA mural in memory of Captain Sir Tom Moore has been created in Manchester. Street artist Akse P19 painted the artwork in tribute to the 100-year-old, who died on 2 February after contracting coronavirus. The Army veteran won the nation's hearts by walking 100 laps of his garden during the first lockdown, raising almost \u00a333m for NHS charities. Akse P19 also created a mural to footballer Marcus Rashford in recognition of the Manchester United star's successful campaign to extend free school meals during the pandemic.\nRussia has announced it has registered what it says is the world's first coronavirus vaccine specifically for animals. But are they really necessary? While scientists say there is currently no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the disease to people, infections have been confirmed in various species worldwide. These include dogs, cats, apes and even mink. To address these infections, scientists are developing Covid-19 vaccines that are specially designed for animals.

      "text": "A helpline and immediate review into sexual abuse in schools have been set up by the government in response to thousands of allegations from students.\nOfsted will look at safeguarding in both state and independent schools.\nThe helpline will be run by the NSPCC to both support potential victims and provide advice to children and adults.\n\"Sexual abuse in any form is abhorrent and it is vital that these allegations are dealt with properly,\" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said.\n\"While the majority of schools take their safeguarding responsibilities extremely seriously, I am determined to make sure the right resources and processes are in place across the education system to support any victims of abuse to come forward.\" \nThe debate about a culture of sexual abuse at schools has escalated in recent weeks after a website set up for victims to anonymously post their experiences gained more than 11,000 posts, some from children as young as nine.\nMany of the allegations on the website refer to sexual harassment carried out against young women by young men at their school or university.\nWendy Mair, from the Everyone's Invited site, said they were \"proud to have started a crucial conversation\", but disappointed the education secretary had not contacted them before the announcement.\n\"We are encouraged to see that the government has responded and taken the first initial steps to review rape culture in all schools,\" she said, adding that she hoped the site's team will be included in carrying out the review.\n\"The testimonies being shared through Everyone's Invited are extremely upsetting, and underline the urgent need to tackle violence against girls,\" said NSPCC chief executive Sir Peter Wanless.\n\"This is a watershed moment thanks to those who have found the courage to speak out.\"\nThe helpline will be open from 09:00 GMT on Thursday to offer support and advice to children and adults who are victims of sexual abuse in schools. \nThis includes how to contact the police and report crimes, if they wish to, while parents and professionals can also get in touch. \nStudents have contacted the BBC criticising what they see as their school's failure to tackle incidents or acknowledge the wider issues.\nSarah, who is 18 and goes to a state school in London, said she had been \"sexually harassed on numerous occasions\" by students at a neighbouring private school.\nShe said she feels incredibly let down by what she saw as her school's \"lack of response\" to the recent discussions around women's safety.\n\"It's really been left to students to care for each other, often leading to major tensions within peer groups as people attempt to 'confront' certain students known for sexually inappropriate behaviour,\" she said.\nIn June 2020, Soma Sara, who is now 22, shared her experience on Instagram of what she calls \"rape culture\".\nWithin a week she had received and shared more than 300 anonymous responses of people with stories of \"misogyny, harassment, abuse and assault\".\nThe Everyone's Invited website now carries thousands of victims' testimonies, often from schools and universities.\nExperiences range from being drugged and raped at parties to explicit images being shared over messaging platforms.\nAnother sixth former, from Kent, suggested there had been \"lots of sexual assault allegations\" made at her school, but that these had been played down. \n\"Before lockdown two we tried talking to the school and that has totally been ignored, and because of their 'prestigious' image they've been telling girls to keep quiet and to think of the accused's mental health,\" she said. \nLast week, pupils at Highgate School in North London walked out of classes in protest at a perceived \"rape culture\", following the publication of accounts of alleged abuse.\nOne male ex-pupil told BBC Newsnight that girls were \"hounded\" for naked selfies at the school. The school's governing body said it was \"truly sorry\" and had commissioned an external review.\nOfsted will begin an immediate review of safeguarding policies in state and private schools, to determine whether guidance for schools around sexual harassment needs to be improved. It will conclude by the end of May\nMore than half of young women had been sexually harassed at their school, college or university, polling of 1,000 young women aged 14-21 last autumn suggested.\nOne in five said they had received unwanted sexual comments and 8% had been groped, according to the figures from girls' rights charity Plan International UK.\nConservative MP Maria Miller, former chairwoman of the Women and Equalities Select Committee, told BBC Breakfast there was \"far more to do\" on the issue.\n\"If we don't tackle it in our schools we leave young people leaving school thinking that is entirely right, that they're able to either sexually harass or be on the receiving end of sexual harassment,\" she said. \n\"And that's why we're seeing these behaviours going to our universities, our workplaces and beyond.\"\nMs Miller said new mandatory relationships education in England, and a forthcoming Online Harms Bill introducing age controls on online pornography, were \"steps in the right direction\".\n\"There is no doubt that schools can and should play a key role in this work, but this is a problem that reaches far beyond the school gates,\" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of head teachers' union NAHT, said.\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the union welcomed the review and the helpline, adding: \"Robust safeguarding is the number one priority of state and independent schools.\"\nThe Report Abuse in Education helpline can be reached on 0800 136 663, on Monday to Friday 8am - 10pm, or 9am - 6pm at weekends. It can also be contacted by email at help@nspcc.org.uk"

      "tags": "Contact tracing,Coronavirus testing,Mobile phones,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Fewer than one in five people request a Covid-19 test if they have symptoms, while the number who follow full self-isolation rules is low, a large study of the test-and-trace system has found. \nThe report, published in the British Medical Journal, also found only half of people knew the main Covid symptoms. \nThese include a cough, high temperature and loss of taste or smell.\nExperts said the findings suggested the impact of the \u00a337bn NHS Test and Trace system was \"limited\".\nThe Department for Health and Social Care said test-and-trace had saved \"countless lives\", adding that the latest ONS data found the \"overwhelming majority\" self-isolated when asked to. \nThe findings are based on 74,697 responses to online surveys from 53,880 people aged 16 or older living in the UK.\nIn total, 37 survey waves were carried out from 2 March last year to 27 January this year, with about 2,000 participants in each wave.\nExperts involved in the study, including from Public Health England's behavioural science team, found that just 18% of those with coronavirus symptoms said they had requested a test, while 43% with symptoms in the previous seven days adhered to full self-isolation.\nMen, younger people and those with young children were less likely to self-isolate, as were those from more working-class backgrounds, people experiencing greater financial hardship, and those working in key sectors.\nCommon reasons for not fully self-isolating included needing to go to the shops or work, for a medical need other than Covid-19, to care for a vulnerable person, to exercise or meet others, or because symptoms were only mild or got better.\nTest-and-trace, or contact tracing, is a system for identifying people who have been in close contact with someone who has caught Covid. \nThose people are then asked to self-isolate for 10 days - even if they have no symptoms - to prevent the chance of passing the virus on, if they do have it.\nEach UK nation has its own contact tracing service: \nRead more - how does test-and-trace work?\nThe report's authors, who also included experts from King's College London, said: \"With such low rates for symptom recognition, testing, and full self-isolation, the effectiveness of the current form of the UK's test, trace, and isolate system is limited.\"\nHowever, the team did acknowledge that while adherence to test, trace and isolate rules had been low, \"some improvement has occurred over time\".\nAcross all waves, 43% of people adhered to rules around self-isolation, though this improved in January to 52%.\nAccording to the latest Office for National Statistics data, 90% of people told they must self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace after being in contact with a positive Covid case did so.\nThe authors said greater practical and financial support was likely to improve adherence to the rules, adding that targeted messaging and policies for men, younger age groups and key workers might also be necessary. \nLast month, the Commons Public Accounts Committee said the impact of NHS Test and Trace was still unclear, despite the government setting aside \u00a337bn for it over two years.\nMPs said the spending was \"unimaginable\" and warned the taxpayer could not be treated like an \"ATM machine\".\nAnd in December, the National Audit Office also criticised the scheme, saying it had not yet achieved its objectives. \nPaulette Hamilton, vice chairwoman of the Local Government Association's community wellbeing board, said the findings of the latest study were \"concerning\".\nShe said: \"Although the rollout of the vaccine is providing us with hope of a return to our normal way of life, the responsibility on us all to get ourselves tested when necessary and share our contacts on request will be needed for some time to come, in order to keep case rates as low as possible.\n\"It is also critical that everyone does the right thing and self-isolates when required. Key to this is making sure people understand what self-isolation means, feel able to comply and are supported to do so if necessary.\"\nMeanwhile, the head of the NHS has urged anyone who is eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine to book one immediately - and for people to turn up for second doses when called. \nNHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said: \"We're well on track to meet our 15 April goal of offering NHS Covid vaccination to everyone aged 50 and over, as well as other high risk groups.\n\"In just the past two weeks, we've now jabbed nearly 85% of people aged 50-54, and over three million of the highest risk people have also now had their top-up second dose.\"\nThe call comes as Wednesday's daily coronavirus figures showed continued falls in deaths, hospital admissions and infections.\nThere were 43 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, 268 patients admitted into hospital and 4,052 new cases recorded, with the seven-day averages down by 39.9%, 22.6% and 11.5% respectively. \nA Department for Health and Social Care spokesman said: \"Since last May, NHS Test and Trace has contacted 3.2 million people who tested positive, and another 6.4 million of their contacts.\n\"Behind these numbers are countless lives saved and the latest ONS figures show that when people are asked to self-isolate, the overwhelming majority do so.\n\"It is vital that people continue to do their bit by isolating when they are asked to.\n\"As the prevalence of coronavirus falls, our testing and tracing system becomes more important in identifying and suppressing local outbreaks while also responding rapidly to the threat of new variants.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Euthanasia and assisted dying,Robert Buckland,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "One of the UK's leading brain surgeons, who has advanced prostate cancer, has said an inquiry into assisted dying is \"absolutely essential\".\nHenry Marsh, a retired neurosurgeon and bestselling author, received his diagnosis six months ago.\nHe has supported a call by politicians for the government to hold an inquiry.\nThe Care Not Killing alliance, which opposes assisted dying, said the law protected the vulnerable \"from being pressured into ending their lives\".\nMr Marsh is backing a group of more than 50 MPs and peers who have written a joint letter to Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, arguing the UK's laws on assisted dying have fallen behind the rest of the world. \nCurrently, assisting a suicide is a crime in England and Wales and is punishable by up to 14 years in jail.\nIntentionally helping another person to kill themselves is known as assisted suicide - this can include buying someone a ticket to Switzerland - where assisted suicide is legal - to end their life.\nSignatories of the letter include politicians who previously voted against changing the law.\nThe letter was organised by Humanists UK, which Mr Marsh is an advocate of, and campaign group My Death, My Decision, of which he is a patron.\nSpeaking publicly for the first time about his own cancer diagnosis, Mr Marsh said he felt \"deeply shocked and terribly frightened and upset\" as it \"gradually dawned on him how serious the situation was\".\nThe surgeon said in the past he had in \"theory\" been an advocate of assisted dying in \"one form or another\" but said he hadn't thought it might one day apply to him. \n\"It is extraordinarily difficult to think about your own death,\" he said.\nThe 71-year-old, who is due to start radiotherapy treatment in a few months' time, believes \"something should be done to change the law in this country\".\n\"My own suspicion as to why the opponents to assisted dying oppose a public inquiry is they fear that actually the evidence is so strong that their hypothetical arguments against it don't hold water, that they will lose the debate,\" he said. \nHumanists UK's chief executive Andrew Copson said he was \"deeply sorry\" to hear about Mr Marsh's diagnosis.\n\"The ability to choose how, where, and when we die is a fundamental freedom, which cuts across party political and ideological lines,\" he added. \n\"In coming together to demand an inquiry, Henry and the lawmakers who have signed this letter have put the voices of the terminally ill and incurably suffering at the centre of the debate.\"\nJean Farrer's sister-in-law, Anne Vickers, 75, travelled to Dignitas in Switzerland in 2015 after being diagnosed with mesothelioma, a cancer which couldn't be treated. \nMs Farrer said her sister-in-law was an \"active, independent, funny, joyful person\" who decided to end her life when she felt the quality wasn't good enough any more. \nSupporting calls for a public inquiry, Ms Farrer said she understood it was a \"complex area\" with many safeguarding issues, but said her family had been caused so much pain and distress because it was not legal. \n\"There were so many other things we could have been doing in the last 12 months with her to make her year the best it could have been,\" she said. \nDr Gordon Macdonald, chief executive of Care Not Killing, said he was disappointed there was another \"push\" to legalise assisted suicide and euthanasia in the midst of the Covid pandemic.\n\"Our current laws protect the most vulnerable in our society, the elderly, the sick and disabled from feeling pressured into ending their lives, exactly as we see in the handful of places around the world that allow assisted suicide or euthanasia.\nHe added: \"At a time when we have seen how fragile our NHS is, how underfunding puts pressure on services, and when up to one in four Brits who would benefit from palliative care, but does not currently receive it, to be pushing this ideological policy, seems out of touch, dangerous and desperate.\"\nA Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"Any change to the law in an area of such sensitivity and importance must be for individual MPs to consider rather than a decision for government.\""

      "text": "Liberty Steel owner Sanjeev Gupta has claimed that none of its plants will shut \"under my watch\" as he races to refinance his business after the collapse of financial backer Greensill.\nHe said taking on the UK plants had been a \"tough journey\" and a \"labour of love\", but he would not walk away.\nMr Gupta was rebuffed by the UK government after asking for \u00a3170m.\nSome investors have also begun legal action to have parts of his metals group wound up.\nBut Mr Gupta said he and GFG Alliance, Liberty Steel's parent company, were \"not waiting for anybody\" and were \"doing what we can to help our businesses\".\n\"Our overall global operations are profitable, we have refinancing offers, we will refinance, and we will support our UK business also,\" Mr Gupta told the BBC.\n\"None of my steel plants under my watch will be shut down,\" he said.\nLiberty Steel has about 3,000 workers at sites including Rotherham, Motherwell and Newport. A further 2,000 work for GFG Alliance in other UK metals and engineering businesses.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"very hopeful\" that the plants could be saved and that Britain needed a strong steel industry..\nHe said that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was in \"daily contact\" with GFG.\n\"I think British steel is a very important national asset. I think the fact that we make steel in this country is of strategic long-term importance,\" he said.\n\"We have learned during the pandemic that it is not a good idea to be excessively reliant in times of trouble on imports of critical things,\" he added.\n\"It would be crazy if we were not to use this post-Brexit moment not to use the flexibility we have to buy British steel. So that's want we want to do.\"\nThe GMB union said Mr Gupta's comments were \"very welcome\" but making guarantees without showing financial backing \"just raises further questions\".\n\"To be able to give these guarantees with such confidence you have to assume he's found the financing required to keep the company going,\" said Ross Murdoch, GMB national officer.\n\"If that's the case he needs to let people know and stop workers worrying about their jobs.\"\nTime is ticking for Sanjeev Gupta's business empire.\nThe collapse of his main source of finance, Greensill Capital, leaves him dangerously exposed and in a race to find new sources of cash.\nGFG Alliance, the group of companies he runs, owes Greensill about $5bn, according to GFG's own evidence to court when Greensill was put into administration in February.\nGFG also told the court that Greensill's collapse would put it at risk of insolvency. Since then, it has been something of a phoney war, with little sign of the Greensill debacle causing greater damage.\nNow, however, winding-up petitions have been lodged against some of Mr Gupta's UK companies.\nThe investors that gave money to Greensill want their money back and Mr Gupta's business empire is firmly in their sights.\nOn the Today programme on Thursday, Mr Gupta said his companies were ready to defend their position in court and they were confident their loan deal with Greensill was a long-term arrangement that could not suddenly be terminated.\nHe must now hold off the winding-off threats for long enough - or defeat them - while he finds sources of finance to replace Greensill.\nThis might mean the sale of assets, or new borrowing, although the process is complicated by much of the Gupta business empire already being pledged as collateral against the loans advanced by Greensill.\nIt will be a complicated and time-consuming business - and Mr Gupta may not be given much time.\nMr Gupta said steel prices were at a 13-year peak, while aluminium prices were also high.\nHe said GFG had been streamlining the business and had a \"huge amount of interest from new financiers who are willing to back us\" and refinance the group.\nHe said it would take time to sort things out, but a short-term solution was an initiative called \"Project Athena\" which required each plant to make daily reports on how they were conserving cash.\nOn Wednesday, Citigroup, acting on behalf of the investment bank Credit Suisse, began legal action in London's insolvency court to recoup unpaid debts from Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance.\nMr Gupta said it was \"natural to some degree that lenders want to protect their own position\", but that GFG's position was that it had agreed debts with Greensill for three years and they were not due.\nHe said GFG was having \"positive discussions\" with Grant Thornton, the administrators for Greensill.\n\"It makes no sense for them, or any of the creditors, to destroy jobs, but more importantly to destroy value, because that is the value which will give them their recovery,\" Mr Gupta said.\nMr Gupta's business model centred on buying up failing or mothballed steel and aluminium plants around the world and starting production again, with the help of his main backer Greensill.\nIn 2015, production restarted at the Liberty Steel plant in Newport, and in 2016 Liberty reopened and the Dalzell steel mill in Scotland. In 2017, Liberty acquired Tata's speciality steels business and expanded into Australia. In the following year it expanded into the US.\nMr Gupta said: \"The UK has been a tough journey. It's because the UK steel industry has been decimated for decades. So that journey definitely has been a labour of love.\"\n\"But I'm committed to my UK steel plants. I started them, I believe in them, they have a great future. We've saved thousands of jobs here. We've shown that economically those businesses can work,\" he said.\nMr Gupta added that former Prime Minister David Cameron, who acted as an advisor for Greensill, had not made representations on behalf of GFG Alliance.\n\"I've not spoken to him, I think, since he was Prime Minister,\" Mr Gupta said.\nMr Cameron was cleared by a watchdog last week which looked at whether he had followed lobbying rules."

      "text": "Within days of the second warmest March day on record, a swing in temperatures could see a cold Easter Bank Holiday weekend with gales and even snow.\nAccording to the Met Office, by Easter Monday temperatures will struggle to reach double digits and the colder weather will last throughout next week.\nAnd a \"white Easter Monday\" is likely, with snowfall in some higher areas in Scotland and northern England.\nForecaster Nicola Maxey said the UK was heading for \"an Arctic trough\".\nBut she said that, for this time of year, the recent warmer weather was more unusual than the upcoming cold temperatures.\nThis week's warm temperatures - including a high of 24.5C (76.1F) at Kew Gardens in London on Tuesday - will last longest in the south of England, said Ms Maxey.\nBut by early next week the whole of the UK will struggle to get above single figures.\nFor Easter Monday, the daily high forecast for London is 7C (44.6F) and 6C (42.8F) in Leeds and Manchester. Edinburgh's maximum is expected to be 5C (41F) while Cardiff's is 7C and Belfast 5C.\nOvernight temperatures are expected to fall to as low as 0C (32F) - and below freezing in some areas.\nThe shift in temperatures has already begun, with BBC Weather saying parts of the central England have seen temperatures fall by 15C in 24 hours.\nIn an average year, snow is actually more likely to fall at Easter than at Christmas. The coldest Easter Sunday morning on record was in 2013, with -12.5C at the village of Braemar in Aberdeenshire.\n\"It's not unusual to see these big swings in spring - it's a transition period between winter and summer,\" said Ms Maxey.\nShe said: \"There are some blustery winds around, particularly along the east coast, as we go through the weekend.\"\n\"It's a marked change from what we saw on Wednesday,\" she said - and on Sunday and into Monday an \"Arctic trough\" will arrive. \n\"It turns windy in the north from Sunday with gales possible in northern areas locally, and across northern isles, Scotland,\" Ms Maxey said.\n\"We're looking at possible gale force winds across the northern half and the west side of the UK.\" \nShe added: \"The cold will be with us for much of next week, and with any showers you could see the possibility of snow falling over high ground in northern areas - the Pennines, Cumbria, Scotland.\"\nThe RAC said it anticipated a \"sharp rise in breakdowns\" as a result of the colder weather returning, and urged people to check their vehicles ahead of travelling.\nTuesday was the hottest March day since 1968 as temperatures topped 24.5C, leading to many people gathering in parks and on beaches. Wednesday was also warm in some areas.\nThe warmer weather came just a few days after coronavirus rules were relaxed in England and Wales - and parks and beaches were busy.\nTwo parks in Nottingham were closed after large crowds failed to socially distance and left rubbish behind.\nPublic Health England medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle said: \"As restrictions lift and the weather improves, we cannot drop our guard. We're not out of the woods quite yet.\" \nHeath Secretary Matt Hancock also tweeted to say \"don't blow it\" - urging people to enjoy the warm weather safely."

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),France,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has criticised the rollout of coronavirus vaccines in Europe as being \"unacceptably slow\". \nIt also says the situation in the region is more worrying than it has been for several months. \nVaccination campaigns in much of Europe have been hit by delays and the number of infections is rising.\nFrance is the latest country to announce new lockdown measures, lasting four weeks.\n\"Vaccines present our best way out of this pandemic... However, the rollout of these vaccines is unacceptably slow\" and is prolonging the pandemic in the wider Europe region, WHO director for Europe Hans Kluge said in a statement.\n\"We must speed up the process by ramping up manufacturing, reducing barriers to administering vaccines, and using every single vial we have in stock, now,\" he added.\nIn the meantime, as long as vaccine coverage remained low, he said EU countries would have to impose lockdowns and other measures to compensate for the delays.\nMr Kluge also warned that the vaccine rollout, despite its slow speed, risked \"providing a false sense of security to authorities and the public alike\". \nLast week saw increasing transmission of Covid-19 in the majority of countries in the WHO European region - which includes more than 50 countries and extends from Greenland to the far east of Russia. There were 1.6 million new cases and close to 24,000 deaths, the WHO said. \nCases were rising in all but one age group, the organisation said.\nOnly 10% of the nearly 900 million people in the region have had a single dose of coronavirus vaccine.\nIt remains the second most affected by the virus of all the world's regions, with the total number of deaths fast approaching one million and the total number of cases about to surpass 45 million, it added.\nThe WHO also warned of the risks of greater spread associated with increased mobility and number of gatherings over the forthcoming religious holidays of Passover, Easter and Ramadan. \nSome 27 countries of the more than 50 included in the WHO Europe region have implemented partial or full coronavirus lockdowns. \nOnly 16% of the EU's population has so far received a dose of vaccine.\nThe EU was slow to negotiate a contract with vaccine manufacturer AstraZeneca which caused supply problems. It also sparked a political row with the UK, where AstraZeneca has plants and where 52% of the population has had at least one dose. \nThe EU's deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna also ran into early problems with production and distribution.\nEU regulators were then slow to authorise vaccines for use. Some EU countries subsequently paused their rollouts of the AstraZeneca jab over reports of blood clots among a small number of people who had received a dose. Others restricted its use among older people over concerns that the company had not provided enough testing data.\nAll this has led to low public confidence in the AstraZeneca vaccine. Polling company YouGov says only a third of Germans and less than a quarter of French respondents now consider it safe.\nThe WHO and the European Medicines Agency, however, say the benefits of the vaccine outweigh any risks.\nVaccine rollout in some non-EU countries in the WHO's Europe area has also been slow. In Russia some people are hesitant to be vaccinated with Russia's own Sputnik V vaccine, for which safety data has been made public and which has been shown to be effective.\nMeanwhile Ukraine received its first shipment of vaccines in late February - 500,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in India. But there is widespread scepticism towards vaccination - last month the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found 60% of Ukrainians did not want a jab.\nHowever, a bright spot in Europe is Serbia in the Balkans, which has vaccinated more than two million of its seven-million population thanks to early deals with vaccine providers including China's Sinopharm. It has also vaccinated migrants and citizens of neighbouring countries.\nWhat else is happening around Europe?"

      "tags": "Edinburgh,Renting,Landlords",
      "text": "Flats owned by a man who was refused entry to Scotland's landlord register have been let out for residential use under the guise of holiday lets. \nMark Fortune failed to get on the list of fit and proper landlords in 2013 after threatening his tenants. \nBut rooms in his Edinburgh flats are being let out under contracts which do not give tenants the same protection as residential agreements. \nThe millionaire property tycoon denied that he rents out flats. \nMr Fortune said the properties are operated by limited companies, not him personally. \nFormer tenants have told BBC Scotland that they were given monthly holiday let contracts to sign, despite making clear they were in Edinburgh to live and work. \nPeople who have lived in properties owned by Mr Fortune have shared evidence of poor maintenance standards, such as damp, broken windows and faulty wiring, and some claim to have not had their deposit returned when they moved out.  \nOne couple said they were asked to leave a flat owned by Mr Fortune during the Covid pandemic after requesting that some repairs be made to the property. \nHailey La Sarre and Gergely Farkas moved into a flatshare in Edinburgh in October last year.\nThe flat is owned by Mr Fortune and their contract was with Edinburgh Rent Limited. Companies House has Mr Fortune listed as its sole director and the person with significant control. \nHailey and Gergely said the flat had a number of issues, including a broken skylight and faulty electrics. \nWhen they raised the problems, they were told that they would have to leave the property.\n\"Your heart sinks,\" said Hailey.\n\"What are you supposed to do? You don't expect that. You ask for a simple fix and they say get out.\"\nEdinburgh Rent told the couple their holiday let contract was not being renewed, but Hailey said this was not their understanding of the deal when they found the room listed on the flatmate-finder website Spare Room.\nShe said: \"On their listing online it said that it was long-term lets, implying that we could stay as long as we want.\"\nA group called Mark Fortune Investigation (MFI) said it had been contacted by more than 40 former tenants in flats operated by the businessman's companies.\nMFI said these people had shared accounts of the flats being in a poor state of repair with issues such as faulty boilers and damp. \nThe group also claimed the majority of ex-tenants who contacted them did not get their deposit back when they moved out. \nAlessandro Carosi, a spokesman for MFI, said he failed to get his deposit back from a long-term stay in an Edinburgh flat owned by Mr Fortune. \nHe said people had been contacting the MFI group because they wanted their voices to be heard. \n\"The majority are foreigners like me,\" said Mr Carosi.\n\"A lot of them just move to Edinburgh and they cannot afford more expensive flats.\"\nHe said the people contacting MFI had been renting flats under holiday let contracts but living there for a long time.\n\"That is how Mark Fortune is making his fortune with people on minimum wages or foreigners who just arrive and don't know the rules or the laws,\" he said.\nMr Fortune is thought to own scores of flats across Edinburgh and is no stranger to controversy. \nIn 2013, he was refused entry to Scotland's landlord register after being convicted of offences directly relating to his letting business, including threatening tenants. \nEdinburgh City Council said Mr Fortune last applied to join the landlord register in 2018 and this was refused. \nMr Fortune told BBC Scotland this application was made in 2015 and that he withdrew it in 2018.\nMr Fortune is listed at Companies House as the only director of a company called Edinburgh Holiday and Party Lets (EHPL).\nLast year part of a housing tribunal ruling said that a person living in a flat operated by EHPL was doing so on a private residential tenancy and not a holiday let agreement.\nIt pointed out the person was living and working in Edinburgh and had lived in the property for seven months. \nThe ruling stated: \"The agreement signed by the parties states that it is a holiday let. However, the evidence clearly establishes that it was not.\"\nThe ruling goes on to say that EHPL \"appears to have called the tenancy agreement a holiday let in an attempt to avoid security of tenure and the requirement to serve proper notice and apply to the tribunal for an eviction order\".\nBBC Scotland showed one of the \"holiday let\" agreements used by one of Mr Fortune's firms to Catherine McQuarrie, a residential tenancy law specialist at TC Young Solicitors.\nShe pointed out a number of problems with the one-page contract, which quoted legislation that had been superseded. \nShe said: \"It's quite clear from the wording of the document that the person using this is attempting to get out of complying with the legislation that would otherwise apply to protect the tenant.\n\"Essentially you can't have a holiday let if you're not on holiday. It's as simple as that.\n\"That simply means that the agreement is null and void and instead the parties have a private residential tenancy agreement.\"\nHoliday lets are exempt from tenant protections such as the landlord registration scheme and putting deposits into third-party protection schemes. \nMr Fortune told BBC Scotland he was not banned from the landlord register but that a decision was taken to not place his name on the list of Scotland's approved landlords. \nHe added: \"I do not operate as a landlord, any properties both residential or commercial are operated by limited companies having been granted a licence by myself which allows commercial subletting.\n\"All deposits that were due for refund have, I'm advised, been refunded.\"\nMr Fortune said the complaints raised represent a \"very small percentage of overall residents\" of  the 160 properties he says he owns.\nThis issue was also covered by The Ferret investigative news website.

      "text": "Italian authorities have approved a ban on cruise ships entering the historic centre of Venice.\nThe country's culture minister said on Wednesday that the decision came in response to a request from UN cultural body Unesco.\nLarge ships will now have to dock at the city's industrial port until a permanent solution is found.\nCritics argue the ships cause pollution and erode the foundations of the city, which suffers from regular flooding.\nOn Wednesday, Italian ministers agreed that large cruise and container ships would no longer be able to enter the city's Giudecca canal, which leads to the historic St Mark's Square.\nCulture Minister Dario Franceschini hailed the move, which he described as \"a correct decision, awaited for years\".\nThe government will hold a \"call for ideas\" for an alternative cruise terminal in the city.\nCruise ships are currently unable to enter Venice due to coronavirus restrictions but their absence since has been credited with improving water quality in the lagoons.\nPressure to pass a ban on large vessels mounted in 2019 after a cruise ship crashed into a harbour in the city, injuring five people. However, no permanent solution was found.\nPrevious initiatives to stop cruise ship traffic have also failed. In 2013, the government banned ships weighing more than 96,000 tonnes from the Giudecca canal, but the legislation was later overturned.\nOther plans to divert cruise ships from the centre of Venice were announced in 2017 but were never fully implemented."

      "tags": "Black Lives Matter,Racism",
      "text": "A report by the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities has said the UK \"no longer\" has a system rigged against people from ethnic minorities.\nInstead it pointed to family structure and social class as having a bigger impact on how people's lives turned out.\nHere is what some people have made of the commission's conclusions.\nTyrek Morris, a 21-year-old student in Manchester who took part in the Black Lives Matter protests last summer, is not surprised by the reports' findings.\n\"They say we are a model country in terms of how we deal with race in this country which quite frankly it is not that at all,\" he says.\n\"We live in a racist country, you can't take that away from us, this is what black people have been saying for years upon years, upon years and we finally get the government to look into race and it says 'no it's not racist'. \n\"You can't tell people, you can't tell the oppressed, you can't tell the victims of racism what's racist and what's not because it is not you that is facing it,\" he says.   \nHe says it was \"highly condescending to say the least\" to suggest that young campaigners were idealists. \n\"This is how the country should work, asking for this country to start teaching about black history or black literature in schools isn't an idealist thing, it is something which we should do, especially considering black history is very deep rooted into this country's history,\" he says.\nHe says \"the proof is in the pudding\" when it comes to the recommendations from the report but said he personally did not trust it to produce anything \"useful\" for black people.\n\"A lot of these things are good ideas, there is a lot more to be done and a lot more which needs to be looked at,\" he says.\nNadine Drummond, a communications strategist for the UN, says she is not sure about the report's conclusions or optimism.\n\"I'm not quite sure how you can be optimistic when you consider the health outcomes of black people in this country,\" she says.\n\"When you have women that are four times more likely to die in child birth than their white mates, when you have black men 19 times more likely to be stopped and searched than their white mates, when you have black men three times more likely to die in police custody than their white mates. \n\"So when you talk about optimism you have to look at the statistics and the facts.\"\nShe says the report \"seeks to gaslight black and other minority ethnic people in the UK by telling us institutional racism in the UK is a myth and intersectionality is a dirty word\".\nBut she agrees with its recommendation to stop using the term BAME, which means Black Asian and Minority Ethnic. \"The term is actually dehumanising and it 'otherises' us and doesn't give any consideration to our uniqueness as people with views from different parts of the globe\".\n\"Yes, we have made some progress,\" says civil servant Shaun Pascal, \"but the progress has come at a very slow pace and what we are seeing is a generation of young people that are tired of being asked to be patient and to wait and we need to have some real conversations and acknowledge what people of colour are saying and move forward.\"\nHe says there needs to be more people from ethnic minority communities at the top of corporations and organisations. \n\"As black people we are not asking you to change for us, you need to do it for yourself because we have a contribution to bring if you allow us the opportunities,\" he says. \"Our contribution goes further than the low position we are given. \n\"We need to see more black people, more people of colour, in those CEO positions at the top of those organisations.\"\n\"Trust is key to progress and when you are constantly denying what people are experiencing and what we see and not acknowledging it you are never going to win people over,\" he adds.\nLondon-based artist Ajani Carrington, 22, says he found the conclusions of the report \"interesting\" and agrees that sometimes socio-economic factors could be bigger than ethnicity in people being denied life opportunities.\n\"But I feel like ethnicity is the reason that some people get dismissed in life from chances and opportunities, I think it all goes together,\" he says.\n\"I'll be optimistic when I can feel and see it coming to life in actual lifetime experiences and real life stories,\" he says.  \n\"The government, the politicians, the system, everyone knows what to say to make it sound nice but what we want to see is it put into action.\"\n\"We have had years and years of words and manipulations and deceptions and what we now want is actual actions which represent those words and these plans,\" he says.\n\"These are good plans, let's see them in action.\"\nMohammad Karim, the founder of a youth consultancy and a student, says while some ethnic minority pupils did well academically it \"doesn't mean the system is perfect it means that they have learnt to thrive in an imperfect system\".\n\"We have got to celebrate the fact that children from ethnic minorities are doing better than their counterparts but that's not to say that the issue doesn't exist,\" he says.\nHe says it is contradictory for the report to call the UK a model for other white-majority countries when it also states there is overt racism.\n\"The report is going to do very little for the individual people that this report was commissioned for. We can start to be optimistic when this report is acted on but today we can't be optimistic because a report in of itself will not make a difference,\" he says.\n\"I don't trust the people who carried out this report to make substantial change based on the tone they are giving, that it is 'not as big an issue as you are saying it is', saying that we are some sort of model country for dealing with it,\" he says."

      "text": "Online retailer Boohoo is investigating why the same items of clothing were sold for higher prices across a number of its fashion labels.\nThe BBC discovered that Dorothy Perkins and Coast, which are both owned by Boohoo, sold exactly the same coat but it cost \u00a334 more at Coast. \nThere are price disparities across a range of Boohoo brands, which also include Oasis and Warehouse.\nBoohoo said the \"miscommunication was not intentional\".\n\"All Boohoo group brands work independently, and so this miscommunication was not intentional as teams are not privy to what's being bought and sold across the other group brands,\" a spokeswoman for Boohoo said.\n\"Our internal investigation continues and we will be re-pricing all the crossover stock to be aligned.\"\nThe price disparity was revealed after reporter Jennifer Meierhans bought a coat from Coast - as a friend happened to buy the exact same coat from Dorothy Perkins. \nThe Dorothy Perkins branding appeared to have been cut from the care label in the coat sold by Coast.\nBoohoo said the coat was first sold by Coast and has now been re-priced at \u00a317 on both brands' websites.\nCatherine Erdly, founder of The Resilient Retail Club consultancy, and a former senior merchandiser at Coast, said: \"If all Boohoo are going to do is buy the same stuff and slap different prices on it then it's destroying that brand's identity.\"\nShe said that while each brand will have its own \"architecture\" for setting prices, it is likely Coast and Dorothy Perkins had benefited from some kind of trading \"opportunity\", where a supplier had stock and both companies needed coats.\n\"But if they're going to do things like that, they didn't do it in a clever way,\" Ms Erdly said. \"The customer will sense that it's just trying to get as much as possible out of them.\"\nShe added: \"There's no way a Coast garment could have sold at \u00a317 without losing money, a garment made for the Coast brand would cost more than that to make.\"\nThere are a number of instances where the same item of clothing is priced differently across Boohoo's brands.\nA long \"luxe\" padded coat in the colour mushroom was originally sold for \u00a389 at Oasis and \u00a365 at Dorothy Perkins.\nThe same coat in khaki was in the sale for \u00a330 in Warehouse and \u00a366.75 in Coast until the BBC brought the matter to Boohoo's attention. They are now both priced at \u00a318. \nNatalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at consumer watchdog Which?, said loyal customers of these brands will be \"shocked and disappointed to see these stark price differences between seemingly identical items of clothing\". \nShe said: \"People choose brands and stay loyal by expecting quality to match the prices they pay.\n\"Brands that offer a first-class customer experience and can be trusted are the ones that come out on top in our retailer surveys. This practice from Boohoo could risk undermining trust with customers.\"\nBoohoo operates a number of different brands after buying up businesses when their owners fell into administration.\nBoohoo bought Coast's online business in 2019 along with sister brand Karen Millen. While in February, it acquired Dorothy Perkins, together with Wallis and Burton, from failed retail group Arcadia for \u00a325.2m\nBoohoo said: \"Stock of the item in question was purchased and live on site by Coast prior to The Boohoo Group's acquisition of the Dorothy Perkins brand.\"\nHave you bought clothes from a Boohoo brand, only to see it priced cheaper under another Boohoo-owned business?

      "tags": "Minnesota,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "The US has been convulsed by nationwide protests over the death of an African-American man in police custody.\nGeorge Floyd, 46, died after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nFootage of the arrest on 25 May shows a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck while he was pinned to the floor.\nMr Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with murder.\nTranscripts of police bodycam footage show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained by the officers. \nThe key events that led to Mr Floyd's death happened within just 30 minutes. Based on accounts from witnesses, video footage and official statements, here's what we know so far. \nIt began with a report of a fake $20 (\u00a316.20) bill.\nA report was made on the evening of 25 May, when Mr Floyd bought a pack of cigarettes from Cup Foods, a grocery store.\nBelieving the $20 bill he used to be counterfeit, a store employee reported it to police. \nMr Floyd had been living in Minneapolis for several years after moving there from his native Houston, Texas. He had recently been working as a bouncer in the city but, like millions of other Americans, was left jobless by the coronavirus pandemic. \nMr Floyd was a regular at Cup Foods. He was a friendly face, a pleasant customer who never caused any trouble, the store owner Mike Abumayyaleh told NBC. \nBut Mr Abumayyaleh was not at work on the day of the incident. In reporting the suspicious bill, his teenage employee was just following protocol.\nIn a call to 911, made at 20:01, the employee told the operator he had demanded the cigarettes back but \"he [Floyd] doesn't want to do that\", according to a transcript released by authorities.\nThe employee said the man appeared \"drunk\" and \"not in control of himself\", the transcript says.  \nShortly after the call, at around 20:08, two police officers arrived. Mr Floyd was sitting with two other people in a car parked around the corner.\nAfter approaching the car, one of the officers, Thomas Lane, pulled out his gun and ordered Mr Floyd to show his hands. In an account of the incident, prosecutors do not explain why Mr Lane thought it necessary to draw his gun.\nMr Lane, prosecutors said, \"put his hands on Mr Floyd, and pulled him out of the car\". Then Mr Floyd \"actively resisted being handcuffed\".\nOnce handcuffed, though, Mr Floyd became compliant while Mr Lane explained he was being arrested for \"passing counterfeit currency\". \nCourt transcripts from police body cameras show Mr Floyd appears co-operative at the beginning of the arrest, repeatedly apologising to the officers after they approach his parked car.\nMr Lane asks Mr Floyd to show his hands at least 10 times before ordering him to get out of the vehicle.\nIt was when officers tried to put Mr Floyd in their squad car that a struggle ensued. \nAt about 20:14, Mr Floyd \"stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic\", according to the report. \nMr Chauvin arrived at the scene. He and other officers were involved in a further attempt to put Mr Floyd in the police car.\nDuring this attempt, at 20:19, Mr Chauvin pulled Mr Floyd away from the passenger side, causing him to fall to the ground, the report said. \nHe lay there, face down, still in handcuffs.\nThat's when witnesses started to film Mr Floyd, who appeared to be in a distressed state. These moments, captured on multiple mobile phones and shared widely on social media, would prove to be Mr Floyd's last.\nMr Floyd was restrained by officers, while Mr Chauvin placed his left knee between his head and neck.\nFor more than nine minutes, Mr Chauvin kept his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, the prosecutors say. The duration was initially given as eight minutes and 46 seconds but Minnesota prosecutors have since revised the time.  \nThe transcripts of bodycam footage from officers Lane and J Alexander Kueng show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained. He was also pleading for his mother and begging \"please, please, please\".\nAt one point, Mr Floyd gasps: \"You're going to kill me, man.\"\nOfficer Chauvin replies: \"Then stop talking, stop yelling. It takes heck of a lot of oxygen to talk.\"\nMr Floyd says: \"Can't believe this, man. Mom, love you. Love you. Tell my kids I love them. I'm dead.\"\nA female bystander told the police: \"His nose is bleeding, come on now.\"\nAbout six minutes into that period, Mr Floyd became non-responsive. In videos of the incident, this was when Mr Floyd fell silent, as bystanders urged the officers to check his pulse.\nOfficer Kueng did just that, checking Mr Floyd's right wrist, but \"couldn't find one\". Yet the other officers did not move. \nAt 20:27, Mr Chauvin removed his knee from Mr Floyd's neck. Motionless, Mr Floyd was rolled on to a gurney and taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance. \nHe was pronounced dead about an hour later.\nOn the night before his death, Mr Floyd had spoken to one of his closest friends, Christopher Harris. He had advised Mr Floyd to contact a temporary jobs agency.\nForgery, he said, was out of character for Mr Floyd.\n\"The way he died was senseless,\" Harris said. \"He begged for his life. He pleaded for his life. When you try so hard to put faith in this system, a system that you know isn't designed for you, when you constantly seek justice by lawful means and you can't get it, you begin to take the law into your own hands.\""

The mansion-block apartment at 60 Coleherne Court was an 18th birthday gift from her parents.\nOnly 14% of the plaques in the capital honour women and these new ones are intended to help address the imbalance, English Heritage said.\nDame Kathleen Lonsdale, Caroline Norton, Jean Muir, Ellen Craft and Helena Normanton are the five recipients not famous for marrying into the royal family.  \nHere are the potted histories of their achievements.\nPlaque location: Central London\nJean Muir was a designer famous for her outfits with long, fluid lines, classic cut and simple yet skilful tailoring. She taught herself to sew at boarding school, and her favourite fabrics included jersey, crepe and suede, usually in dark, plain colours - midnight navy in particular.\nShe also argued for the importance of British fashion manufacturing and appealed for it to be recognised and valued as a skilled industry.\n\"We must combat once and for all the idea that there is something lowly about working with one's hands. Hands need the mind,\" she said.\nPlaque location: Central London\nMrs Norton brought about one of the first pieces of feminist legislation in the UK by dint of fighting for the custody of her children after she left her abusive husband.\nShe was also determined to keep the rights to her own property, such as profits from her published writings. \nShe had great influence on the Marriage and Divorce Act of 1857. The Matrimonial Causes Act meant wives could now allege cruelty and desertion, in addition to the husband's adultery, in order to obtain a divorce.\nPlaque location: Hammersmith\nBorn in 1826, Ellen Craft was an American woman who had been kept in slavery. Because her skin was pale, she managed to disguise herself as a white man. She and her husband fled their homeland, arriving in England in 1850.\nTo avoid suspicion and evade their former masters, who were chasing them, Mr Craft - who had darker skin than his wife - pretended to be her slave. Once in England, the couple toured the country lecturing against slavery, before settling in Hammersmith.\nPlaque location: Seven Kings, Redbridge \nDame Kathleen was born in 1903 in County Kildare, the youngest of 10 children. She and her mother and siblings moved to Essex, England in 1908. A bright girl, she won a scholarship to Ilford County High School, but she had to go to maths and science lessons at the local boys' school as her girls' school didn't teach those subjects.\nShe entered Bedford College for Women, part of the University of London, aged 16, where she got the highest marks not just of her peers, but of anyone in the previous 10 years. She specialised in crystallography, which is the science of working out the arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids.\nShe later became a professor and (along with biochemist Marjory Stephenson) was one of the first female Fellows of the Royal Society. \nDespite her academic brilliance, the spotlight seemed aimed at her gender, with one newspaper article beginning \"Dame Kathleen Lonsdale at 67 is so tiny she hardly reaches the top drawer of her filing cabinet at London's University College.\n\"But 14 years ago she was game enough to receive her D.B.E. from the Queen Mother in a hat she'd bought for ninepence.\" It's hard to envisage a man being described in those terms.\nYou can hear Dame Kathleen speaking about the role of science in society and balancing research and motherhood (she had three children) on a 1967 episode of Women's Hour on BBC Radio 4.\nThe scheme celebrates the link between significant figures of the past and the buildings in which they lived and worked. \nHere are the criteria:\nAnna Eavis, English Heritage's curatorial director, said Princess Diana's campaigns to highlight issues like HIV/Aids and landmines - along with her enduring appeal as \"an inspiration and cultural icon to many\"- were deciding factors in giving the go-ahead for her blue plaque. \nShe was nominated by the London Assembly after the body ran a #BackthePlaque campaign asking Londoners to suggest women worthy of the recognition.\nPlaque location: TBC\nBorn in East London in 1882, Helena Normanton was a woman of firsts - the first woman to join an Inn of Court, first woman to practice at the Bar, first woman to appear in the High Court, first woman to appear in the Old Bailey, first woman to prosecute in a murder trial and one of the two first women to become King's Counsel (KC) in England and Wales.\nShe fought for women's rights to vote and for married women to be allowed to keep their money and property instead of, upon marriage, it being subsumed into that of their husband.\nShe co-founded the Married Women's Association with the aim of promoting financial equality during marriage, giving mothers and children a legal right to a share of the family home, securing equal guardianship rights for both parents, and extending the National Insurance Act to give equal provision for women.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Unusual blood clots in the brain have been detected in a handful of people after they were injected with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThese \"cerebral venous sinus thromboses\" or CVSTs have led some countries - including Germany, France and Canada - to restrict who can be given the jab. The World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency say the benefits of the vaccine outweigh any risks.\nScientists and medicines safety regulators around the world are trying to figure out if the vaccine is genuinely causing these strokes, how big any risk might be and what that might mean for vaccination programmes. \nAt the moment, we do not know. \nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA), which has been reviewing the safety data, says it is \"not proven, but is possible\".\nThe organisation has to figure out whether the reported clots are a side-effect or a coincidence that would have happened naturally. This is incredibly hard when dealing with rare events. If, on the other hand, one in every 10,000 people was having serious blood clots then the answer would be obvious.\nI have spoken to respected scientists some of whom are sceptical, others increasingly convinced. \nSome point to the highly unusual nature of the clots as a sign something could be going on. They are often appearing at the same time as low levels of blood platelets, which are one of the main components of a clot, and antibodies linked to other clotting disorders appearing in the blood. \nOthers say there is not enough proof and the reported cases could plausibly be down to Covid, which itself is linked to abnormal clotting. \nIt remains entirely possible the risk is zero as vaccines are not proven to cause the brain clots. \nGermany's Paul Ehrlich Institute has reported 31 cerebral venous sinus thromboses and nine deaths out of 2.7 million people vaccinated there. \nThe most recent UK data reported 30 clots linked with low platelet counts and seven deaths out of 18 million people vaccinated. \nThe European Medicines Agency, which has assessed data from around the world, estimates there is around a one in 100,000 risk of a CVST in people under the age of 60 who have been given the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nThe organisation's head of safety monitoring, Dr Peter Arlett, said that was \"more than we would expect to see\". \nHowever, it is uncertain what the background rate of these blood clots in the brain truly is. Estimates vary from around two cases per million people every year to nearly 16 in every million in normal times and coronavirus itself may be causing them too. \nYou might expect to see the same numbers of CVSTs in different countries if they were genuinely being caused by the vaccine. Yet the UK has reported roughly the same number of cases despite giving the vaccine to nearly seven times as many people as Germany.\nOne argument is the type of people being vaccinated is different. \nThe UK has, largely, been working from the oldest age groups down, while Germany was one of the countries that initially refused to use the vaccine in the over 65s because of a lack of trial data. Instead nearly 90% of Germans given AstraZeneca are thought to be under 60.\nSide-effects in general tend to be more severe in younger people as they have a stronger immune response, which has been one speculated reason why the UK has had fewer cases. \nHowever, CVSTs are inherently more common in younger women and taking the pill increases the risk. So the natural risk levels - whether people are vaccinated or not - could have a role too. \nTeasing all this apart is challenging, but the EMA said it had found no specific risk factors such as age, gender or medical history. \nNothing in medicine in completely safe and even therapies that are highly toxic are used in the right circumstance. \nChemotherapy drugs can have brutal side effects, but are hugely valuable; and even over-the-counter painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen have severe side-effects, they are just incredibly rare. \nThe real decision is always whether the benefits outweigh the risks. \nThis is particularly challenging in a pandemic. Normally medicine would rely on the \"precautionary principle\" to prove adequate safety before giving a new medicine to large numbers of people. But in a pandemic, any delays in vaccinating people will also cost lives. \nBased on the Germany data alone, if you vaccinate a million people then you would expect 12 to have a blood clot and four of them to die. \nBut if a million 60-year-olds catch coronavirus then around 20,000 would die of Covid-19. If a million 40-year-olds catch coronavirus then around 1,000 die. It would be a few hundred people in their 30s.\nThe benefits of vaccination clearly increase with age and countries like Germany and Canada have allowed the AstraZeneca vaccine to be used in older age-groups. These decisions will also be driven by which alternative vaccines they have available and who still needs to be immunised. \nThe world is scrutinising the data intensely, but clarity will still take time. \nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "The use of so-called vaccine passports to decide whether people can enter pubs would go against the \"British instinct\", Sir Keir Starmer has said.\nThe Labour leader told the Daily Telegraph it would be \"wrong in principle\" to ask landlords to check customers' Covid jab certificates.\nA government review is looking at whether this system could help to reopen the economy in England.\nDiscussions have been taking place across the devolved nations.\nUnder the government's four-step plan to ease England's lockdown, legal limits on social contact could be lifted by 21 June, if strict conditions are met.\nBut the prime minister has suggested pub-goers could be asked to provide a vaccine certificate, after all adults have been offered a jab by the end of July.\nCurrently, anyone who gets an injection receives a vaccination card and the details go on to their medical records.\nThe \"passport\" could mean the information being added to the NHS app, allowing mobile phone users to prove to publicans that they have received their injections.\nBut Sir Keir said: \"My instinct is that\u2026 [if] we get the virus properly under control, the death rates are near zero, hospital admissions very, very low, that the British instinct in those circumstances will be against vaccine passports.\n\"I think that this idea that we sort of outsource this to individual landlords is just wrong in principle.\"\nHe added that \"this is really difficult and I'm not going to pretend there's a clear black and white, yes-no easy answer on this\".\nBut Labour would look at any government proposals before deciding whether to oppose them, he said. \nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the government seemed \"utterly incapable of making its mind up on Covid certificates\", adding: \"This latest wheeze is the worst of all worlds.\"\n\"As well as burdening struggling pubs with extra cost, the idea that businesses can voluntarily bar certain customers, who may not even have been offered a vaccine, is deeply illiberal,\" he said.\nPub industry representatives accused the government of \"backsliding\" over plans to allow venues to reopen.\nIn a joint statement, UK Hospitality, the British Beer and Pub Association and the British Institute of Innkeeping warned that vaccine passports could prevent \"millions\" of young people who have not received their jabs visiting the pub \"for months\".\nDowning Street said an ongoing review was looking at how testing or vaccination could be used to play a role in opening the economy, and would consider the ethical, privacy, legal and operational aspects.\nThe prime minister will give an update on the Covid situation on Monday."

      "tags": "Minneapolis,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "Witnesses to the arrest of George Floyd have given emotional testimony about being at the scene of Mr Floyd's arrest.\nMr Floyd's girlfriend, the teenager who filmed the viral video from the scene and a city fire-fighter who begged police to check Mr Floyd's pulse are among those who have testified they watched Mr Floyd under the knee of ex-police officer Derek Chauvin.\nThe former officer denies charges of murder and manslaughter, and his defence team heard from a police officer who responded to the scene of Mr Floyd's arrest, a use-of-force expert and a forensic pathologist. \nMr Chauvin has decided not to testify, invoking his Fifth Amendment right under the constitution to stay silent and avoid self-incrimination. \nHere's what we've heard so far.\n'I had lost a lot of faith in God when I met George'\nMr Floyd's girlfriend of the last three years, Courteney Ross, provided some of the most emotional testimony of the trial. She is, to date, the only witness to take the stand who personally knew Mr Floyd.\nShe described their first meeting in the lobby of a Salvation Army homeless shelter, where Mr Floyd worked as a security guard.\nMs Ross was waiting to see the father of her son, and she said Mr Floyd asked her to pray with him, a memorable and \"sweet\" gesture at a time when she \"had lost a lot of faith in God\".\nShe said it was \"one of my favourite stories to tell\". The couple shared their first kiss that night, she said.\nMs Ross also told the court they both suffered from chronic pain, which led to an off and on struggle with opioid addiction.\n\"We got addicted and tried really hard to break that addiction many times,\" she testified.\nShe did not specifically address whether Mr Floyd was using opioids on the day he died.\n'If I would have just not taken the bill, this could have been avoided'\nThe teenage store clerk who says he believes that Mr Floyd unknowingly paid for cigarettes with a fake $20 bill told the court he was grappling with feelings of guilt over Mr Floyd's death. \nMr Martin, 19, said he had also been living in the building above Cup Foods, but moved after the incident and stopped working at the store.\n\"I didn't feel safe,\" the teen said.\nHe said Mr Floyd \"appeared to be high\" that day because he struggled to respond to a simple question, but that he was lucid enough to hold a conversation. He described Mr Floyd as \"friendly and approachable\".\nMr Martin, who witnessed the arrest, said he felt \"disbelief and guilt\" because \"if I'd have just not taken the bill, this could have been avoided\".\n'I did call the police on the police'\nAmong those to testify was a security guard and former wrestler trained in mixed martial arts who was heard in the viral video of Mr Floyd's arrest calling the officers \"punks\" and \"murderers\".\nMr Williams, 33, had gone fishing with his son earlier that day, and had gone to Cup Foods to get a drink.\n\"I did call the police on the police. I believe I witnessed a murder. I felt the need to call the police on the police,\" he testified. \n\"That was bogus, what they just did,\" he told the 911 dispatcher, according to a recording of the call played in court.\nMr Williams alleged he witnessed Mr Chauvin use a \"blood choke\" to cut off the airway, and a \"shimmy\" hold to keep up the pressure on Mr Floyd.\nHe said he watched Mr Floyd's life \"fade away, like a fish in a bag\".\nUnder cross-examination, he took issue with the notion that he and the crowd were growing \"angrier and angrier\".\nHe said his words \"grew more and more pleading for life\", as Mr Floyd fell unconscious.\nWhen defence lawyer Eric Nelson repeated the question, Mr Williams again objected.\n\"I grew professional and professional,\" he said. \"I stayed in my body. You can't paint me out to be angry.\"\n'It's not part of our training and it's certainly not part of our ethics or values'\nThe Minneapolis police chief, who oversees around 800 officers in the city, was one of the most high profile witnesses for the prosecution.\nChief Arradondo, the city's first African-American police chief, fired Mr Chauvin one day after the arrest and previously condemned his actions as \"murder\".\nDuring the trial, he testified that Mr Chauvin violated police procedures.\nHe said that Mr Chauvin had shown some \"initial reasonableness\" when he used force on Mr Floyd as he resisting getting in the back of the police car.\nBut when Mr Floyd had stopped resisting and \"clearly when Mr Floyd was no longer responsive and even motionless, to continue to apply that level of force to a person prone out, hands cuffed behind their back - that in no way, shape or form is anything that is by policy,\" Chief Arradondo said.\n\"It's not part of our training and it's certainly not part of our ethics or values.\" \n'My instincts were telling me something is wrong'\nThe first witness called to testify was a 911 dispatcher who had sent police to Cup Foods, where Mr Floyd had allegedly bought cigarettes with a counterfeit bill.\nMs Scurry watched the arrest unfold on a live CCTV feed on a camera across the street from the shop, and thought that the video had \"frozen\" due to how long the three officers remained on top of Mr Floyd.\n\"They were still on the ground. That whole situation was still the same,\" she said, noting that she was also being distracted by other work matters at the time.\n\"My instincts were telling me something is wrong, something is not right. I don't know what, but something was not right,\" she said. \"It was an extended period of time.\"\nShe called a supervisory sergeant to report what she saw. \"Call me a snitch if you want to,\" she said according to audio of the call, adding \"all of them sat on this man\".\n'We're lucky it was video-taped'\nThe off-duty Minneapolis city fire-fighter was hoping to have \"a peaceful day\" and went for a walk, she testified. \nShe noticed the lights of the police car, and wondered if her co-workers were responding to a fire.\n\"As I got closer there was a woman across the street screaming that they were killing him,\" said Ms Hansen, 27, who is also a trained emergency medical technician (EMT).\n\"I was concerned to see a handcuffed man who was not moving with officers with their whole body weight on his back and a crowd who was stressed out,\" she said.\nMs Hansen described pleading with the officers to check Mr Floyd's pulse and to begin CPR. One officer, she said, told her that \"if you really are a Minneapolis fire-fighter you would know better than to get involved\".\nThere were several heated moments during Ms Hansen's cross-examination by the defence.\nWhen Mr Chauvin's attorney asked her if the crowd had been \"upset or angry\", she replied: \"I don't know if you've seen anybody be killed, but it's upsetting.\" \nIn another testy response after she was challenged over her recollection of the incident, she said: \"We're lucky it was video taped.\"\n'What I watched was wrong'\nThe first bystander on the scene of George Floyd's arrest was 61-year-old Charles McMillian, a self-described \"nosy\" resident.\nHe pled repeatedly with Mr Floyd to \"get up and get in the car\" and told him \"you can't win\". He also said the officers looked like they were trying to \"hogtie\" him.\nWhile viewing graphic footage of the arrest in court, Mr McMillian broke down in tears and was unable to continue his testimony for a while. In the video, the court heard him tell Mr Chauvin: \"Your knee on his neck - that's wrong man.\"\nHe described feeling \"helpless\" seeing the incident unfold.\nMr McMillian said that he confronted officer Derek Chauvin after Mr Floyd was taken away in an ambulance because \"what I watched was wrong\".\n\"I think I said to him: 'Five days ago I told you at the end of the day go home to your family safe, and that the next person go home to their family safe, but today I gotta look at you as a maggot,'\" he said.\n'I stay up apologising and apologising to George Floyd'\n\"When I look at George Floyd, I look at my dad. I look at my brothers, I look at my cousins, my uncles. Because they are all black,\" said the 18-year-old that filmed the viral video of the arrest. \n\"I look at that and I look at how that could have been one of them,\" said Darnella, the first of four witnesses who the judge permitted to speak off-camera because they were minors at the time of the incident.\n\"It's been nights I stay up apologising and apologising to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life,\" she continued.\n\"But it's not what I should have done. It's what he should have done,\" she said in a reference to Mr Chauvin.\n'I was sad and kinda mad'\nDarnella's nine-year-old cousin testified that Mr Chauvin did not take his knee off Mr Floyd's neck even after ambulance workers had told him to.\n\"I was sad and kind of mad, and it felt like it was stopping his breathing and it was hurting him,\" she replied when asked how the event made her feel.\n\"It sounded like he was hurting,\" she added.\n'I was failing to do anything'\nAnother teenager present that day said she felt powerless to help as she saw Mr Chauvin work to maintain pressure on Mr Floyd.\n\"I kind of saw him move his knee down more,\" said the 18-year-old, \"down onto Mr Floyd's neck.\"\n\"I felt like there wasn't really anything I could do,\" Alyssa continued. \"As a bystander I was powerless there, and I was failing to do anything.\"\nAsked why she shouted to Mr Chauvin to release Mr Floyd, she said: \"I knew time was running out or it had already... That he was going to die.\"\n'I was scared of Chauvin'\n\"He was like digging his knee into George Floyd's neck,\" testified the 17-year-old.\nShe added that Mr Chauvin \"did grab his Mace and started shaking it at us... I didn't know what was going to happen.\"\n\"I was scared of Chauvin,\" she added.\n'Derek Chauvin was justified and acting with objective reasonableness'\nThe use-of-force expert, called by the Chauvin defence team, said \"the imminent threat\" posed by Mr Floyd was a major factor in his detention.\n\"I felt that Derek Chauvin was justified and acting with objective reasonableness following Minneapolis police department policy and current standards of law enforcement in his interaction with George Floyd,\" he said.\n\"From a police officer's standpoint, you don't have to wait for it to happen. You just have to have a reasonable fear that somebody is going to strike you, stab you, shoot you.\"\nMr Brodd added: \"It's easy to sit in an office and judge an officer's conduct. It's more of a challenge to put yourself in the officer's shoes, to try to make an evaluation through what they are feeling, what they're sensing, the fear they have, and then make a determination.\"\nDefence lawyer Eric Nelson asked Mr Brodd: \"Was this a deadly use of force?\"\n\"No, it was not,\" Mr Brodd replied.\nCross-examining Mr Brodd, the prosecution maintained that the dangers of positional asphyxia - not being able to breathe in a certain position - were well known.\n\"Would you agree that that's something commonly understood in law enforcement?\" prosecutor Steve Schleicher asked.\n\"Yes,\" Mr Brodd replied, confirming it was not new information.\n'So many conflicting different potential mechanisms'\nThe forensic pathologist who was chief medical examiner for the state of Maryland until his retirement in 2019 said the cause of Mr Floyd's death was not clear.\nHe was questioned about the findings of the Hennepin County medical examiner, who ruled Mr Floyd's death a homicide.\n\"I would fall back to undetermined, in this particular case,\" Dr Fowler testified.\nHe said, in his opinion, the cause of death was not clear because there were \"so many conflicting different potential mechanisms\". These complicating factors, he said, could be considered homicide in some cases, and accidental in others.\nMr Floyd's consumption of fentanyl and methamphetamine, and his possible exposure to carbon monoxide poisoning from the police car's exhaust, were among the complicating factors cited by Dr Fowler.\nAsked about the cause of death, Dr Fowler said he believed Mr Floyd suffered \"a sudden cardiac arrest\" while struggling with the officers.\nDr Fowler said Mr Floyd's health problems contributed to an erratic beating of his heart, known as sudden cardiac arrhythmia.\n'Very aggressive crowd'\nThe Minneapolis Park Police officer responded to the scene of Mr Floyd's arrest and said the crowd of bystanders was \"very aggressive to the officers\". \n\"Did that cause you any concern?\" Defence lawyer Eric Nelson asked him.\n\"Concern for the officers' safety, yes,\" Mr Chang replied."

      "text": "Pupils in all primary and post-primary schools will return to school after the Easter holidays.\nIn a statement on Thursday afternoon, the Department of Education confirmed that face-to-face teaching will resume from 12 April. \nIt is one of a number of new lockdown easing measures agreed on Thursday. \nThe NI Executive has also decided to reopen some outdoor non-essential retail from that same date.\nIt will also extend reopening to motor home dealers, car washes, garden centres and plant nurseries.\nMeanwhile, the limit of 25 people at marriages, civil partnerships and funerals will also be lifted from 12 April.\nInstead it will be up to individual venues to determine how many guests they can safely accommodate. \nUp to four people will also be allowed at viewings of wedding venues.\nOutdoor sports training can also resume from 12 April for small groups of 15 people from sports clubs affiliated with recognised governing bodies. \nThe next formal review of the lockdown restrictions will take place on 15 April.\nOther previously announced measures to ease lockdown came into force earlier, including new rules to allow some meeting up outdoors and the return of some sports, such as golf and tennis.\nGarden centres are also now allowed to offer click-and-collect services.\nAn executive meeting to confirm the details around the future easing of restrictions took place earlier on Thursday.\nWith the exception of some pupils returning to school in March, the changes that take place on Thursday are the first since NI returned to full lockdown on 26 December.\nHowever most of the rules which have been in force have not been altered, including the stay-at-home rule.\nFrom Thursday, up to six people from two households are allowed to meet in a private garden.\nThe executive advises that people should maintain social distancing during these gatherings. \nIf there is no alternative route, people  are able to enter a garden by going through a house.\nOnly shops which are deemed to be essential retail are currently allowed to open, as has been the case for much of the pandemic.\nAs well as garden centres, plant nurseries are also able to offer click-and-collect services. \nUp to 10 people from no more than two households can now take part in outdoor exercise together in a public place or at a sports club.\nIt meant the return of sports such as golf and tennis on Thursday. \nHowever, clubhouses and any other indoor facilities - including changing rooms, showers, kitchens and meeting rooms - associated with these sports will remain closed. \nThe rule changes apply to all levels of sport and not just at the elite level.\nIn a tweet, Economy Minister Diane Dodds said it was \"good news that my Economic Recovery Action Plan will be funded in full, that outdoor retail can reopen on 12 April and that my proposal to continue to support large hospitality sector was agreed\".\nMrs Dodds said the news was \"another step towards reopening, recovering and rebuilding the economy\".\nFurther loosening of restrictions is due on 12 April, subject to being approved by the executive after the Easter weekend.\nDr Gerry Waldron from the Public Health Agency told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday that he understood the current restrictions were \"difficult\" for people, but urged them to \"keep the brakes on\".\n\"We are heading into our second Easter where we are severely restricted in terms of what we can do, but the reason for this is that we want to keep our people safe,\" he said.\n\"We are in a position at the moment where things are going reasonably well, the numbers are coming down, we have a vaccination programme in place that is very successful and we are getting to a better place, but we really don't want to be in a position after Easter where we see the numbers ramping up again.\"\nMeanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann has announced \u00a31.3m in additional funding for Northern Ireland hospices.\nThe one-off funding is in recognition of the impact of Covid-19 on the services delivered by the four hospices."

      "tags": "Minneapolis,US race relations,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "A Minneapolis court has been shown new police bodycam footage of George Floyd pleading with officers during his arrest, saying: \"I'm not a bad guy\".\nThe video shows police officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on Mr Floyd for more than nine minutes, and Mr Floyd begging not to be harmed.\nMr Chauvin, 45, who has since been fired from the police force, denies charges of murder and manslaughter.\nMr Floyd's death in 2020 sparked global protests over policing and racism.\nDefence lawyers have indicated they will argue that 46-year-old Mr Floyd died of an overdose and poor health, and the force used was reasonable. \nObservers on the third day of the trial said footage shown of Mr Floyd's actions before and during the arrest may be an attempt by prosecutors to deal with the allegation that drugs played a part in his death.\nIf convicted of the charges, Mr Chauvin could be jailed for decades in the trial, which is expected to take about one month.\nThe court has been shown footage from the body cameras belonging to officers Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao. Mr Chauvin's camera fell to the ground as the arrest unfolded and so did not give a visual recording of the event. \nIn Mr Lane's footage, Mr Floyd is seen being confronted by police. He begs them: \"Please don't shoot me... I just lost my mom.\"\nMr Floyd is handcuffed and continues to plead with Officers Lane and Kueng, saying he is not resisting them and \"will do anything you tell me to\".\nA scuffle occurs when police try to get Mr Floyd into a vehicle, and he starts crying and resisting while saying he is claustrophobic and has anxiety.\nMr Chauvin and his partner Mr Thao arrive as the arrest goes on.\nAs the police officers drag him out of the car and restrain him on the ground, Mr Floyd can be heard calling for his mother and telling his family members he loves them.\nBystanders begin to shout at officers to check Mr Floyd's pulse and stop restraining him.\nMr Chauvin is standing trial separately from the other three police officers because of Covid restrictions on space. The others are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and will come before the courts in August.\nShop employee Christopher Martin, 19, told the court he briefly interacted with Mr Floyd as a customer inside Cup Foods shortly before his arrest. \nHe said Mr Floyd \"appeared to be high\" because he struggled to respond to a simple question, but he was lucid enough to able to hold a conversation. He described Mr Floyd as \"friendly and approachable\".\nIn the shop's surveillance video, Mr Floyd can be seen laughing, talking to people, and walking around.\nMr Martin told the jury he had sold Mr Floyd a packet of cigarettes, and received a counterfeit note as payment. Mr Martin described knowing the bill was fake by its colour and texture, but added that Mr Floyd \"didn't seem to know it was a fake note\".\nHe said he had considered letting the shop deduct it from his wages instead of confronting Mr Floyd, but then decided to tell his manager. Another employee went on to call the police. \nMr Martin, who witnessed the arrest, said he felt \"disbelief and guilt\" because \"if I'd have just not taken the bill, this could have been avoided\". \nCharles McMillian, 61, was another witness who took the stand on Wednesday. \nBased on CCTV footage, Mr McMillian appears to have been the first bystander on the scene of Mr Floyd's arrest. He told the court he engaged in conversation with Mr Floyd, urging him to get into the police car.\nMr McMillian said he remembers feeling \"helpless\" seeing the incident unfold. He can be heard on video telling Mr Chauvin: \"Your knee on his neck, that's wrong man.\"\nAs the court was shown footage of the arrest, Mr McMillian began to sob, and the judge called for a brief recess.\nThe court was also shown separate footage of Mr McMillian from Mr Chauvin's own body camera.\nIn the footage, Mr McMillian confronted Mr Chauvin about the arrest after Mr Floyd was taken away in the ambulance.\n\"We had to control this guy because he's a sizeable guy,\" Mr Chauvin told Mr McMillian, as he got back in his squad car. \"It looks like he's probably on something.\"\nIn opening statements on Monday, Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell told the jury that Mr Chauvin had \"betrayed his badge\" by kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck, and using \"excessive and unreasonable force\" to detain him.\nMeanwhile, Mr Chauvin's lawyer Eric Nelson said the case was about the evidence, not about a \"political or social cause\". He said Mr Floyd had ingested drugs at the time of his arrest \"in an effort to conceal them from the police\", and suggested this had contributed to his death.\nFour young witnesses took to the stand on Tuesday. Darnella - the teenager whose film of Mr Floyd's death sparked global protests - said she \"stays up apologising\" to him for \"not doing more\".\nShe told the court she had started filming on her phone because she \"saw a man terrified, begging for his life\".\n\"It wasn't right - he was in pain,\" she said. \nOne witness, Donald Williams II, who is trained in mixed martial arts, was questioned for more than an hour by the prosecution and defence on Monday and again on Tuesday. He told the court Mr Chauvin had used a dangerous technique called a \"blood choke\" and was moving his knee back and forth to increase the pressure on Mr Floyd's back and neck.\nHe rejected defence suggestions that he and other bystanders' interactions with police had been threatening to the officers there.\nGenevieve Hansen, a Minneapolis firefighter and emergency medical technician who was off duty at the time of the arrest, said she was \"desperate to help\" Mr Floyd but officers would not let her. \nMr Chauvin has been silent but remained engaged during the proceedings, taking almost constant notes on a yellow legal pad while listening to the evidence.\nThe video footage of Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck last May was watched around the world.\nTo many, Mr Floyd's death in police custody became a symbol of police brutality - particularly against people belonging to ethnic minorities  - and it sparked mass demonstrations for racial justice.\nBut despite the global outcry this is not an open and shut case. In the US, police are rarely convicted for deaths that occur while they are on duty, if they are charged at all.\nThe verdict in this case will be widely seen as an indication of how the US legal system treats deaths that occur while in police custody."

      "text": "The family of a British man missing in Mozambique after an attack by Islamist militants have said a body has been found.\nPhilip Mawer, 58, was working in Palma, in the north of the country, when it was stormed by militants last week.\nHis family said it appeared he died while trying to escape the siege.\nIn a statement, they called him an \"outgoing character\" with a wonderful sense of humour and \"who had something of the lovable rogue about him\". \nThe body has yet to be formally identified, the family said.\nDozens of people were killed following the attack in Palma, as hundreds of militants targeted shops, banks and a military barracks, and more than 5,000 people have fled from the town.\nMilitants linked to the Islamic State (IS) group are behind the conflict.\nEyewitnesses reported seeing Mr Mawer at the Amarula Palma Hotel last week, when the offensive began. \nOn Friday, he joined dozens of others who crammed themselves into vehicles and tried to flee the town but they were ambushed and that was the last time Mr Mawer was seen alive.\nMr Mawer's employer - RA International, where he managed the building of camps for workers involved in a natural gas project - said he was one of seven people missing following the attempt to escape.\nA statement issued by RA International on behalf of his family said he was a \"much-loved son, brother, uncle, and friend\".\n\"Although formal identification has yet to be completed, we have now been made aware that the body of a man matching Philip's description has been found,\" they said.\n\"Philip was an ebullient, outgoing character who had something of the lovable rogue about him. He had a wonderful sense of humour and could be relied on to find a humorous take on the most difficult of situations. \n\"The family is devastated by the loss and he will be sadly missed.\"\nThe statement said Mr Mawer had been in Mozambique for 18 months and he had previously worked in Somalia, Sierra Leone, Algeria, Afghanistan, and Yemen.\n\"It was the nature of his chosen line of work to be in the more dangerous corners of the world,\" they said. \"His ability to get things done in the most hostile of environments made him a valued colleague.\n\"Earlier in his life, Philip overcame a period of compulsive gambling and went on to write the book Overcoming Problem Gambling: A Guide for Problem and Compulsive Gamblers, using his personal experience to help others to overcome this destructive addiction. He would often receive letters of thanks from people helped by the book.\"\nFollowing the attack in Palma, hundreds of people have taken refuge at a nearby natural gas facility operated by the French company Total - according to the medical charity M\u00e9dicins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.\nMany have shown up injured including a baby who had been shot and a mother who had just given birth.\nThe fighting in the region has left more than 2,500 people dead and 700,000 displaced since the insurgency began in 2017.

      "tags": "Tigray People's Liberation Front,Tigray crisis,Ethiopia",
      "text": "An investigation by BBC Africa Eye has uncovered evidence that a massacre in northern Ethiopia was carried out by members of the Ethiopian military. It also reveals the precise location of the atrocity, in which at least 15 men were killed.   \nIn early March, a series of five video clips surfaced on social media showing armed, uniformed men leading a group of unarmed men to the edge of a cliff, shooting some at point blank range, and pushing dead bodies over the cliff.\nThe BBC has confirmed that the massacre took place close to the town of Mahbere Dego in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region, where the Ethiopian army is fighting the forces of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), previously the region's ruling party.\nThe fighting began last November when the government launched a military offensive against the TPLF, which Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed accused of attacking a government military base. The TPLF is opposed to efforts by Mr Abiy to increase the power of the federal government, and has said it is committed to \"extended resistance\".\nThe conflict has so far displaced more than two million people, according to Tigray's interim administration, and left more than four million people in need of aid.\nThe BBC Africa Eye investigations team, working together with analysts from the media outlets Bellingcat and Newsy, set out to establish where the massacre took place. \nThe first people to post the clips to social media claimed they were filmed near  Mahbere Dego. Africa Eye analysed geographical features seen in the videos, including a dirt road, a plateau, and an escarpment with a distinctive profile, and compared them with satellite imagery of the area around the town.\nThe direction and length of shadows cast by the armed men helped to pinpoint the likely time of day and showed that the escarpment was oriented north-south, allowing Africa Eye to identify a likely location.\nA ridgeline in the video footage was then overlaid on a topographical map of the location to confirm it was an exact match. A dry riverbed, band of vegetation, and pattern of trees further confirmed the match.\nThe BBC spoke by phone to a resident of Mahbere Dego, who said the Ethiopian army took away 73 men from the town and surrounding area in January this year, including three of his relatives. He said none of them had been heard from since.\nThe BBC also spoke to a resident in a neighbouring village who said that his brother was among those killed in this massacre. He said that the killings took place in Mahbere Dego, and gave the same month: January 2021 - the government had declared victory in the conflict in November.\n\"They killed them at the cliff,\" he said.\nAfrica Eye was not able to confirm the identities of the armed men seen in the video footage, but the details of their uniforms - including the camouflage pattern and arm badge in the colour of the Ethiopian flag - appear to match those worn by the Ethiopian National Defence Force (ENDF). \nOther features also match the ENDF uniform, including the cut and style of the pockets. One of the armed men wears a green beret bearing an insignia that appears to closely match the colour and insignia of the ENDF beret.\nThe armed men are speaking Amharic, the main official language of Ethiopia. In the first of the five video clips, they can be heard speaking to one another as they stand around the group of unarmed men, who are seated on the floor.\n\"We should not free these people. Not even one of them should be spared,\" says a voice off camera.\n\"We have to get this on video, how these people die,\" says another voice. \nMore about the conflict in Tigray:\nThe next four clips show the unarmed men being led at gunpoint towards the cliff edge, and capture the armed men killing several prisoners and pushing the bodies of the dead over the cliff.\nIn some sections of the footage, the gunmen can be seen firing bullets from close range into the bodies. In others they can be heard insulting and mocking the dead.\n\"I wish we could pour gas over them and burn them,\" says a voice off camera in one clip.\n\"It would have been great if there was gas to burn these people,\" replies a second voice. \"Burn their bodies like the Indians do.\"\nThe identity of the victims, who are seen wearing civilian clothes, is not known. They can be heard speaking Tigrinya, the language of the Tigray region. In the footage, the killers appear to suggest they believe the victims belong to the TPLF.  \n\"This is the end of woyane,\" says a voice of one of the armed men, using a slang term for the TPLF. \n\"We don't show mercy.\"\nLaetitia Bader, the Horn of Africa director for Human Rights Watch, told the BBC that observers had seen \"a whole magnitude of very serious abuses\" in the region in recent months, but that this footage was \"obviously particularly alarming\". \n\"We see what appear to be unarmed detained men, who are being executed,\" she said. \"This is absolutely an incident that requires further investigation, because what we are seeing here in these videos could amount to war crimes.\"\nThe BBC put the evidence it had gathered to the Ethiopian government, which said in a statement that \"social media posts and claims cannot be taken as evidence\", adding that the Tigray region was \"open for independent investigations to be undertaken\".\nInvestigation by Aliaume Leroy, Giancarlo Fiorella (Bellingcat), and Jake Godin (Newsy).\nAdditional reporting by Daniel Adamson, Joel Gunter, Chiara Francavilla, Bertram Hill, Carlos Gonzales, Mohammed Osman, Samir, and Leila Nathoo."

Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests.\nFrom 28 January people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nUntil then, the self-isolation period was seven days, down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on day six and seven. \nThe Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive.\nIt is advising meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated.\nPeople, it said, should leave at least a day between social events.\nFrom 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. \nBut under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January.\nThe rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended.\nPeople are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped.\nWhile wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nLimits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August.\nFor important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures.\nAll guests will need to take a lateral flow test.\nPeople attending weddings, civil partnership or alternative wedding ceremony or reception, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero.\nHowever the Welsh government says it strongly advises people to wear a face covering indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nYou can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply.\nOn 25 January 2022, the Welsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidays for the first time since the start of the pandemic. \nNightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four stage plan, they have been allowed to open from 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. \nHowever, Covid passes are still needed for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. \nFrom 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500.\nOn 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. \nPupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January.\nA legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with \u00a360 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, has been scrapped from 28 January.\nHowever, the Welsh government has said it will remain important to work from home if you can.\nYou have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations.\nIt also means people from other parts of the UK can come here.\nAll holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May."

Profits slumped 74% to \u00a3194.7m. \nHowever, the company said it had not cut staff pay or laid off employees as a result of the crisis. It also did not make use of the furlough scheme.\nThe company also paid \u00a385m to Ms Coates's charitable foundation.\nMs Coates and her brother John took over the gambling business 20 years ago, which was run by their father. Ms Coates now owns about half of the company.\nShe has previously been described as one of the UK's \"most successful women\". \nMs Coates achieved a first-class degree in econometrics and later trained as an accountant within the family firm, building further on the knowledge of the then small chain that she picked up while working part-time during high school.\nThe chief executive's annual pay packet is likely to be the biggest in UK history.

      "text": "The formation of the NHS after World War Two should serve as a template for how healthcare is delivered post-Covid, the head of the NHS has said.\nSir Simon Stevens says the demands of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic led the NHS to change rapidly and find new ways of working.\n\"People have said this was the biggest health challenge since World War Two,\" he said.\n\"It was in preparation for the Blitz in 1939 that hospitals started working together in the embryonic emergency service and that became the embryonic NHS.  \n\"You could argue that over the last 12 months the way the NHS has mobilised for the vaccination programme, and also the way hospitals worked together to ensure patients got the intensive care they needed, with better working with community services and local government - that sets the blueprint for the next phase of what our NHS needs to be.\"\nSir Simon argues that the vaccination programme is a particular example of how different parts of the NHS came together with community organisations, and successfully targeted the groups in the population to offer jabs. \nIt's already happening in schemes including the Healthy Hearts project in Skipton, Yorkshire.\nThe scheme was designed to identify people at risk of heart and circulatory disease, but who have not been having regular blood pressure checks. They are invited to come in for monitoring and assessments of appropriate medication and advice on whether their lifestyles could be changed.\nOne of those who has been helped by the team is Ray Bartlett, 77, who has diabetes and was overweight. He used to struggle to walk for more than 15 minutes.  \nHis high blood pressure was noted, and he then got a letter from the GP practice asking if he wanted to join a course including advice on healthy eating.  As a result he lost three-and-a-half stone and 10 inches from his waistline.\n\"I thought drinking lots of orange juice was good for you, but I learned it was going straight into my kidney and that's having a bad effect,\" Ray said.\n\"It was chips with everything, but now we have cut out potatoes completely.\"\nRay's medication has been cut from 10 to two tablets for diabetes and related problems under the programme. \n\"I feel vastly fitter, usually walking for one to two hours a day. It's changed my life,\" he said.\n\"When the whole of the NHS comes together we can make a major difference,\" Sir Simon says. \"The vaccination campaign is succeeding - the health service has got to take some of the things which have worked so well in the vaccination programme and apply them to cancer screening, heart disease and other ways of helping prevent illness,\" \nSkipton GP Dr James Thomas says it's all about proactive intervention, and identifying people who might need help to reduce the risk of heart disease. He says Ray's example is \"wonderful\".\n\"It's not only the weight loss and his blood pressure is better controlled, his diabetes is better controlled, he's not breathless any more, not in pain with his knees and basically his wellbeing is a lot better.\"\nThe Healthy Hearts programme was instigated by the West Yorkshire and Harrogate Integrated Care System - and ICSs are now in place across England.  \nThe idea is to bring together hospital, community, mental health trusts, and GPs with local authorities and other care providers in each region to encourage a joined-up approach to dealing with the health needs of the local population."

That was never my attention,\" Ms O'Neill said. \n\"For that, I offer my heartfelt and unreserved apology to those families who have lost a loved one.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in Finance Minister Conor Murphy, who also attended the funeral, said he regrets the political division it caused. \n\"I want to say sorry to the wider community and more particularly to apologise fully and unreservedly to those families who were hurt by my actions.\"\nBut First Minister Arlene Foster said the wake and funeral procession were clear acts of \"premeditated breaches of the Covid regulations\".\n\"The message from Sinn F\u00e9in was clear: ourselves alone, ourselves first regardless of the cost of undermining the public health messaging,\" Mrs Foster said. \n\"The prioritisation of Roselawn (cemetery) over other grieving families was hurtful, ignorant and callous in the extreme, acts of arrogance, acts of self entitlement, acts of privilege. \n\"Sinn F\u00e9in calls for equality, respect and integrity, but actually demonstrates the opposite.\"\nMrs Foster said the police had \"abdicated\" their responsibility.\nThe motion, proposed by the SDLP, passed unanimously on an oral vote, but has no binding consequences. \nThe first speaker in the debate, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon of the SDLP, said Sinn F\u00e9in made the choice \"not to stand with the people but put themselves above them\".\n\"This is no longer about a funeral. It is now an issue of why Sinn F\u00e9in believes they are above the restrictions, above the law, above the public health advice,\" Ms Mallon said. \n\"We are here today, to hear Sinn F\u00e9in account for their actions, to answer the question countless citizens across the north are asking - why is it one rule for the political elite in Sinn F\u00e9in and one rule for the rest of us?\"\nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) MLA Doug Beattie said Sinn F\u00e9in had spoken for just four minutes in a two-hour debate. \n\"Not good enough. We needed to hear more, and we heard nothing. It was doubling down on the position you were in before we came here today. \n\"Policing and justice has been damaged. We cannot lay the blame on the rank and file police officer who gets a set of regulations that we write, interprets them, and then on the sharp end of justice, he has to deliver and he will make mistakes.\"\nJustice Minister Naomi Long appealed for Sinn Fein to \"step up\", make a fulsome apology and give \"some comfort at this late stage to the families affected\".\n\"There are many wrongs in this world that cannot be prosecuted in court, but we can still apologise for those wrongs,\" Ms Long said. \nThe assembly began sitting at 12:00 BST.\nThe motion, which recalled the assembly early from its Easter recess, called for assembly members (MLAs) to \"condemn\" Ms O'Neill and Mr Murphy, who attended the funeral, for \"their actions which have caused immense hurt and undermined the executive's public health message\". \nThe recall motion had the support of the DUP, Ulster Unionists (UUP), Alliance and the Green Party.\nOpening the debate, assembly Chair Alex Maskey, of Sinn F\u00e9in, said he was professional, competent and well within his abilities to preside over the debate, after a point of order raised by DUP MLA Jonathan Buckley. \nWe've had some heated and passionate exchanges in the chamber, not least from those MLAs who've lost loved ones and friends during the pandemic and were unable to attend their funerals. \nThey had pointed remarks for both Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Conor Murphy, both of whom attended Bobby Storey's funeral last year. \nEven before the debate started, Sinn F\u00e9in MLA and Speaker Alex Maskey was challenged for his impartiality, and that set the tone.\nMs O'Neill was challenged several times across the chamber floor to apologise for her attendance at the funeral. \nShe didn't do that, but she did say sorry for the hurt caused. \nThis is a non-binding debate which means there is a vote in the chamber, but there will be no effect on Sinn F\u00e9in because this simply registers other MLAs' anger at what happened. \nIn the absence of a court case, it's another chance for MLAs to deliver their verdicts.\nAhead of the debate, SDLP MLA Matthew O'Toole said the recall would provide a \"forum for accountability\".\nThe South Belfast MLA said the motion, which does not have any binding consequences, was not \"political game play\" but was about holding Sinn F\u00e9in ministers to account.\nHe said people who make the laws \"should be held to the same rules as the rest of society\".\nMeanwhile, Mr Byrne addressed a meeting of the Policing Board on Thursday afternoon, at which he expressed surprise at the conclusions of the PPS. \nOn Wednesday, Mrs Foster stopped short of saying whether DUP members of the board would step down, but did not rule it out.

      "tags": "UK National Minimum Wage,UK economy",
      "text": "About two million of the UK's lowest-paid workers will get a pay rise from Thursday as the minimum wage goes up.\nThe National Living Wage will rise 2.2% to \u00a38.91, the equivalent of more than \u00a3345 a year for a full-time employee.\nIt will also be given to 23 and 24-year-olds for the first time, not just those aged 25 and over.\nStatutory rates for apprentices and those aged between 18 and 22 will also rise, along with the voluntary \"Real Living Wage\".\nHowever, hundreds of thousands of low-paid workers on furlough will see no uplift at all after they were excluded.\nMinisters said the increases to minimum wages would particularly benefit workers in sectors such as retail, hospitality, cleaning and maintenance.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said it would be \"a welcome boost to families right across the UK\".\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng urged \"all workers\" to check their pay packets to ensure they were \"getting what they are entitled to, and remind employers of their duty to pay the correct wage\". \nWhat is the minimum wage?\nThe voluntary Real Living Wage will rise to \u00a310.85 an hour in London and \u00a39.50 outside the capital, but only a small minority of employers have signed up to pay it. \nThe foundation promoting it warned there was still a \"substantial gap\" between the statutory rates and one based on the actual cost of living.\nMuch of the UK's retail and hospitality industries remain closed because of Covid, meaning many of the lowest-paid workers are on furlough and will miss out on a pay rise.\nThey will continue to get 80% of their usual income, based on pre-pandemic rates for the minimum wage. \nAbout 800,000 of the lowest-paid workers were on furlough in February, according to the House of Commons Library. \nThe government said furloughed workers who returned to work after 1 April would move on to the new minimum wage rates for hours worked. \nBut shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds hit out at the \"pay freeze\" for furloughed workers.\n\"Hitting Britain's families in their pockets isn't just wrong - it's economically illiterate. If families have less money to spend, then businesses will suffer and the recovery will take longer,\" she said.\nFrances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, also said nobody should be expected to get by on less than the minimum wage.\n\"Low-paid workers on furlough have bills to pay like everyone else,\" she said.\n\"The government should guarantee that everybody will get at least the full rate of the minimum wage. And it should give all minimum wage workers a decent pay rise.\" \nMike Hawking of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation described the boost to the minimum wage as \"necessary\", but said that the pandemic had revealed the urgency of taking further steps to tackle in-work poverty.\n\"As we start to recover from the impact of the last year, too many workers are finding that minimum wage increases are being wiped out due to inadequate social security, insufficient hours available to them, and high housing costs.\"\nBryan Sanderson, chairman of the Low Pay Commission, which recommends the level at which the minimum wage should be set, said: \"This week's increase is our first step towards the government's target of two-thirds of median earnings.\n\"It is a real-terms increase, meaning that an hour's work can buy more than it could last year at the start of the pandemic. The level of the new rate, however, also reflects the need to protect workers from job losses.\"\nThe commission said its best estimate for the National Living Wage rate in 2022 was \u00a39.42, but this is subject to more uncertainty than usual and is likely to change.\nThis rise in the legal minimum wage will be welcome news, particularly as most households across the UK are also seeing their bills going up from the start of April. Planned price rises kick in for gas and electricity, council tax, water charges, the licence fee, TV and broadband rates, and NHS prescription charges in England. It'll be a stretch for many. \nFor those minimum wage staff who are on furlough at the moment, the news is even harder. Pay for those who would normally be working in bars, restaurants, hairdressers and hotels will continue to be based on 80% of their pre-Covid earnings. \nThey won't get the new pay rise until they start back to work again, but given the timetable on easing restrictions, many may be heading back to full employment soon."

      "text": "New rules to help pubs, cafes and restaurants reopen outdoors safely in England on 12 April have sparked anger from industry groups.\nAll customers will have to sign in on entry, not just one member of the group like before. It is also unclear whether payment at the bar will be permitted.\nUK Hospitality said it would burden struggling pubs and staff and risk customers deciding not to go out.\nThe government said it was providing as much flexibility as possible to venues.\nIt also said it had removed other unpopular requirements such as drinking curfews.\nUnder the new guidance, every customer aged 16 and over will have to check in to NHS test and trace before entering a venue, or give their contact details to staff.\nPubs and restaurants must take \"reasonable steps\" to stop people who won't comply from coming in, or they could face a \u00a31,000 fine.  \nCarl Ford, an accountant based in Tamworth, told the BBC he was frustrated and confused by the rules.\n\"I feel like it's almost like going back to school where I have to sign in and out,\" he said. \n\"I don't understand why I have to do this in a restaurant or pub, but I don't need to do this in a supermarket where you have a free for all. People don't have to sign in and they can pick up fruit with their hands.\"\nOthers were supportive of the idea, however, saying it could reduce transmission.\nIn a joint statement, UK Hospitality, the British Beer & Pub Association and the British Institute of Innkeeping said the rules would add \"more confusion and inconvenience for customers and staff\".\nThey also warned if indoors payments were not permitted from 12 April, then some pubs, particularly in rural areas with poor broadband, would be unable to take payments at all.\nWith the government also considering whether \"proof of immunity\" should be a requirement for entry, the groups warned that \"millions\" of people could be put off going to pubs and venues at a time when the hospitality industry is struggling.\n\"Pubs will already be trading at a loss when they reopen with all the existing restrictions and Covid-secure measures in place,\" they said. \n\"Adding further disproportionate and discriminatory measures threatens the very survival of thousands of businesses.\"\nHospitality businesses have been hit particularly hard by lockdown closures and restrictions. \nIn the year to February, 368,000 payroll jobs were lost in the accommodation and food service sectors. The next worst hit sector was retail where 123,000 jobs were lost.\nA government spokeswoman said: \"Public health rules are kept under constant review and we are providing as much flexibility for pubs and other hospitality businesses as possible. \n\"The roadmap [to reopening] set out that hospitality would open from step two, and removed any requirements for curfews or a substantial meal for customers.\"\nShe said no final decisions had been taken on whether Covid-status certification could play a role in reopening the economy.\nShe added that the government continued to support the hospitality sector through the pandemic with its new \u00a35bn Restart Grant scheme, the VAT cut, business rates relief, and by extending furlough."

      "tags": "Aung San Suu Kyi,Myanmar coup ,Myanmar,Save the Children",
      "text": "At least 43 children have been killed by armed forces in Myanmar since February's military coup, according to rights organisation Save the Children. \nThe group said the South East Asian country was in a \"nightmare situation\", with the youngest known victim just six years old. \nA local monitoring group puts the overall death toll at 536.\nMeanwhile, ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been charged with violating the country's official secrets act.\nMs Suu Kyi, along with four of her allies, were charged last week, but the alleged crime - which carries a prison term of up to 14 years - has only now come to light.\nThe new charge against Ms Suu Kyi is in addition to earlier charges of possessing illegal walkie-talkies, violating Covid-19 restrictions during last year's election campaign, and publishing information that may \"cause fear or alarm\".\nThe UN's envoy to Myanmar has warned of the risk of an \"imminent bloodbath\" as the crackdown against pro-democracy protests in the country intensifies.\nThe warning follows a flare-up in fighting between the army and ethnic minority militia in border areas.\nThe UN has become the latest organisation to urge the families of its workers to leave, but has said that some staff will remain in the country.\nThe unrest in Myanmar began two months ago, when the military seized control of the country after an election which Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party won by a landslide.\nWhen tens of thousands of people took to the streets nationwide to protest against the coup, the military used water cannon to attempt to disperse them. After a week, the response escalated, and rubber bullets and live ammunition were used.\nThe deadliest day of the conflict so far came on Saturday, when more than 100 people were killed. \nWitnesses say the armed forces have attacked people at random on the streets, and some people have even been killed in their own homes. \nThe family of six-year-old girl Khin Myo Chit told the BBC she was killed by police while she ran towards her father during a raid on their home in the city of Mandalay at the end of March.\n\"They kicked the door to open it,\" her sister, May Thu Sumaya, 25, said. \"When the door was open, they asked my father whether there were any other people in the house.\"\nWhen he said no, they accused him of lying and began searching the house, she said. \nThat was the moment when Khin Myo Chit ran over to their father. \"Then they shot and hit her,\" May Thu Sumaya said.\nAlso among the dead are a 14-year-old boy who is believed to have been shot while inside - or close to - his home in Mandalay, and a 13-year-old who was shot in Yangon while playing in the street. \nSave the Children has warned that the number of children injured in clashes is also likely to be significant, citing the case of a one-year-old baby who was reportedly shot in the eye with a rubber bullet.\nThe rights group warned that the violence was having an effect on children's mental health as they suffer fear, grief and stress. \n\"Children have witnessed violence and horror,\" it said in a statement. \"It is clear that Myanmar is no longer a safe place for children.\"\nLawyers representing Ms Suu Kyi said on Thursday that it was unclear whether their client was aware of how events were unfolding across the country. \n\"We couldn't say whether [Ms Suu Kyi] knows about outside situations or not - she may or may not know,\" lawyer Min Min Soe told Reuters news agency, adding that the ousted leader \"seems to be in good health\".\nThe violence has sparked an international outcry, with various countries - including the US and UK - announcing sanctions against the coup leaders and military-linked companies. \nOn Thursday, the UK announced further measures against the Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), a conglomerate that has provided funds to the Myanmar military. \n\"The Myanmar military has sunk to a new low with the wanton killing of innocent people, including children,\" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said. \"The UK's latest actions target one of the military's key funding streams and impose a further cost on them for their violations of human rights.\"\nWhen Ms Suu Kyi was ousted, military commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing took power."

      "text": "Pubs, restaurants and hotels in Wales may reopen indoors in time for the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford has set out a series of dates for easing lockdown, stretching into the next month.\nUnder the plans two households could meet indoors from 10 May, if Covid cases remained low.\nTravel into and out of Wales from the rest of the UK and Common Travel Area may go ahead from 12 April.\nRestaurants and bars could reopen outdoors from 26 April and from 3 May, outdoor wedding receptions with up to 30 people may be permitted.\nBut the changes could depend on the results of the Senedd election on 6 May, and whether the Welsh Labour leader is returned to power.\nThe Welsh Conservatives' own plans would see most rules on social contact scrapped by 17 May. \nBoth the Tories and Plaid Cymru called for gyms to reopen now, while Plaid said the Senedd should be recalled to discuss more economic help for businesses.\nUnder the Welsh plans gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities will also be able to reopen from 10 May. This will include individual or one-to-one training, but not exercise classes.\nSpring Bank Holiday Monday is 31 May, but the Welsh government has not specified an actual date for reopening hospitality indoors.\nIt said after 17 May it would \"consider enabling indoor hospitality and remaining visitor accommodation to reopen in advance of the Spring Bank Holiday\".\nOnly six people from two households will be able to meet in reopened beer gardens and should still socially distance.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said the public emergency is not over. \nHe told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: \"You see in the pattern a continuation of the step-by-step approach we've taken in Wales, doing the outdoor activities first because it's safer to be outdoors.\n\"But for the first time in the timetable we are now able to set out the first re-openings of indoor activities as well.\"\nHe added: \"The presence of the virus in Wales is the lowest in the United Kingdom, the rate of vaccination in Wales is the highest in the United Kingdom.\n\"On Saturday, we will complete the vaccination offer to everybody in the top nine priority groups, again the first country in the UK to get to that milestone.\" \nProvided cases remain low, the following things will be permitted:\nMonday, 12 April\nMonday, 26 April\nMonday, 3 May\nMonday, 10 May\nMonday, 17 May\nBeyond that date, ministers would consider reopening indoor pubs and restaurants, and remaining visitor accommodation ahead of the Spring Bank Holiday.\nTracy Lawler, who owns The Dressing Room Boutique in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, said she cannot wait to reopen on 12 April. \nShe said because her shop is \"is small and intimate I can keep it really ultra clean after each person has entered\".\n\"I'm probably one of the safest public places for people to come in and the government is saying to me that I can't open up [yet]\u2026 very frustrating.\" \nLucy Hywel, who owns That's Lovely That giftshop in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, was also looking forward to reopening, but said: \"We're hurt and we're still hurting.\n\"I myself have thrown out loads of food, thousands of pounds worth of stock, even last week, stock I thought I may have sold in the lead up to Easter got chucked away and that pain is there every time you do something like that.\"\nVictoria Hallimi, who owns Victoria's Driving School in Swansea, gave her last lesson on 13 December but can now reopen on 12 April.\nShe said: \"My phone was going a bit crazy last night as soon as the announcement was made.\n\"I was up until about 11, 11:30 last night scheduling everybody in.\" \nShe said the past few months had been \"really tough\" and her husband had been doing a lot of overtime to make up for her not being able to work. \"He can relax now,\" she added. \nKelly John, owner of KMW Beauty in Maesteg, Bridgend county, said she has not paid herself a wage since January to ensure she had enough money in her business account to buy supplies when she was allowed to reopen.\n\"Luckily my husband is working, otherwise I wouldn't have a house,\" the mother-of-two said.\n\"But being an independent woman, it is really hard. I can't do anything - it's Easter this weekend and I haven't bought anything.\"\nMeanwhile, the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective, which represents more than 400 Welsh hospitality firms, said it welcomed the move but \"continues to press for certainty and support\" about funding to support them while they remain closed.\nThe plans will move Wales into the \"alert level three\" stage of the government's control plan by 17 May.\nWhile parts of Wales' lockdown have eased quicker than elsewhere in the UK, the Welsh government had been reluctant to set out a full schedule for when different sectors would reopen.\nFriday's announcement is the most detailed list of dates given by the government since the winter lockdown began to be eased.\nIt does not go as far as England's tentative plans to scrap social contact restrictions by 21 June, although Mark Drakeford has previously said that's \"very optimistic\".\nMr Drakeford told a press conference the new \"indicative dates\" were are there \"to help businesses plan and prepare\".\n\"We have to remember that the pandemic isn't over - it's more important than ever that we continue to work together to keep this terrible virus under control so that we can go on unlocking Wales.\"\nSome sectors like cinemas and theatres have not been given a date to reopen in Wales.\nFollowing criticism of his plans for gyms and leisure centres, Mr Drakeford said the sector will be the first able to reopen indoors.\nPubs will be able to open outdoors two weeks after England. The first minister said he had considered bringing that forward, but \"the advice was very clear that that was not advisable on public health grounds\".\nThe Welsh Conservatives' Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said Mr Drakeford's roadmap was \"very late in the day\".\nHe said it was \"unfortunate\" that further funding had not been made available to hospitality sector - and said outdoor hospitality should be opening in line with England on 12 April.\nMr Davies told Wales Today: \"What's really dumbfounding is that despite his mental health minister's assurances that gyms will be one of the first facilities to open, they are now not going to open until May.\"\nPlaid Cymru Leader Adam Price said he would go faster on reopening gyms and indoor hospitality.\n\"We've also been calling for a much more accelerated timetable in terms of reopening gyms, because of their importance in terms of mental and physical well being. So I think it's disappointing to see that being delayed.\n\"There are dangers of course in moving too fast but there's an equal danger of being over cautious\".\nLeader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Jane Dodds said: \"Now that more and more of Wales is opening up and life is slowly returning to normal, it's time to put our recovery first. \n\"I want to see support for those individuals who will lose their jobs when furlough ends, those who are likely to lose their homes when the ban on evictions is lifted and those whose mental health has suffered as a result of this pandemic.\"\nA UKIP spokesman said: \"With the success of the vaccine rollout, lockdowns no longer have any major impact on case numbers. \n\"The Welsh economy must be reopened now. Not in a month's time. This apathetic timeline will be the final nail in the coffin for many businesses that have been just about clinging on.\"\nThe announcement comes as latest figures show admissions to hospitals of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases hit a record low - it stands at a daily seven-day average of 19.\nCovid hospital admissions are the lowest since the pandemic began with 17 confirmed and suspected Covid patients on Wednesday, with none at all in Swansea Bay hospitals.\nWales' case rate stands at 34.9 per 100,000 people over seven days - the lowest since mid-September."

I think the fact that we make steel in this country is of strategic long-term importance,\" he said.\n\"We have learned during the pandemic that it is not a good idea to be excessively reliant in times of trouble on imports of critical things,\" he added.\n\"It would be crazy if we were not to use this post-Brexit moment not to use the flexibility we have to buy British steel. So that's want we want to do.\"\nThe GMB union said Mr Gupta's comments were \"very welcome\" but making guarantees without showing financial backing \"just raises further questions\".\n\"To be able to give these guarantees with such confidence you have to assume he's found the financing required to keep the company going,\" said Ross Murdoch, GMB national officer.\n\"If that's the case he needs to let people know and stop workers worrying about their jobs.\"\nTime is ticking for Sanjeev Gupta's business empire.\nThe collapse of his main source of finance, Greensill Capital, leaves him dangerously exposed and in a race to find new sources of cash.\nGFG Alliance, the group of companies he runs, owes Greensill about $5bn, according to GFG's own evidence to court when Greensill was put into administration in February.\nGFG also told the court that Greensill's collapse would put it at risk of insolvency. Since then, it has been something of a phoney war, with little sign of the Greensill debacle causing greater damage.\nNow, however, winding-up petitions have been lodged against some of Mr Gupta's UK companies.\nThe investors that gave money to Greensill want their money back and Mr Gupta's business empire is firmly in their sights.\nOn the Today programme on Thursday, Mr Gupta said his companies were ready to defend their position in court and they were confident their loan deal with Greensill was a long-term arrangement that could not suddenly be terminated.\nHe must now hold off the winding-off threats for long enough - or defeat them - while he finds sources of finance to replace Greensill.\nThis might mean the sale of assets, or new borrowing, although the process is complicated by much of the Gupta business empire already being pledged as collateral against the loans advanced by Greensill.\nIt will be a complicated and time-consuming business - and Mr Gupta may not be given much time.\nMr Gupta said steel prices were at a 13-year peak, while aluminium prices were also high.\nHe said GFG had been streamlining the business and had a \"huge amount of interest from new financiers who are willing to back us\" and refinance the group.\nHe said it would take time to sort things out, but a short-term solution was an initiative called \"Project Athena\" which required each plant to make daily reports on how they were conserving cash.\nOn Wednesday, Citigroup, acting on behalf of the investment bank Credit Suisse, began legal action in London's insolvency court to recoup unpaid debts from Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance.\nMr Gupta said it was \"natural to some degree that lenders want to protect their own position\", but that GFG's position was that it had agreed debts with Greensill for three years and they were not due.\nHe said GFG was having \"positive discussions\" with Grant Thornton, the administrators for Greensill.\n\"It makes no sense for them, or any of the creditors, to destroy jobs, but more importantly to destroy value, because that is the value which will give them their recovery,\" Mr Gupta said.\nMr Gupta's business model centred on buying up failing or mothballed steel and aluminium plants around the world and starting production again, with the help of his main backer Greensill.\nIn 2015, production restarted at the Liberty Steel plant in Newport, and in 2016 Liberty reopened and the Dalzell steel mill in Scotland. In 2017, Liberty acquired Tata's speciality steels business and expanded into Australia. In the following year it expanded into the US.\nMr Gupta said: \"The UK has been a tough journey. It's because the UK steel industry has been decimated for decades. So that journey definitely has been a labour of love.\"\n\"But I'm committed to my UK steel plants. I started them, I believe in them, they have a great future. We've saved thousands of jobs here. We've shown that economically those businesses can work,\" he said.\nMr Gupta added that former Prime Minister David Cameron, who acted as an advisor for Greensill, had not made representations on behalf of GFG Alliance.\n\"I've not spoken to him, I think, since he was Prime Minister,\" Mr Gupta said.\nMr Cameron was cleared by a watchdog last week which looked at whether he had followed lobbying rules."

      "text": "The pace of Europe's Covid-19 vaccination campaign has picked up and in many countries infection rates have been falling.\nLockdowns are gradually being eased as the summer tourist season gets under way, and there are plans for an EU-wide digital vaccination certificate to be in place by 1 July.\nNationwide curfew ended on 20 June, 10 days earlier than planned. Face masks are no longer required outdoors. \nRestaurants, cafes and bars can serve customers indoors, with 50% capacity and up to six people per table.\nStanding concerts will resume on 30 June and nightclubs on 9 July (with 75% capacity). People attending will need a health pass which shows either full vaccination, a negative test within the previous 72 hours, or else a previous coronavirus infection.\nRestaurants, bars, beer gardens, museums, hotels and concert halls have reopened.\nMedical grade masks are compulsory in shops and on public transport.\nLocal authorities can impose stricter rules in high infection rate areas. \nFrom 30 June, working from home will no longer be compulsory.\nOn 21 June, Italy's curfew was scrapped and the whole country, except for the northwest region of Valle d'Aosta, became \"white zone\" - the country's lowest-risk category.\nAmong the measures still in place are social distancing (1m) and the wearing of masks indoors (and in crowded outdoor places), and a ban on house parties and large gathering. \nNightclubs and discos are also closed. \nAll indoor businesses, with the exception of nightclubs, are open. \nThe government introduced a \"corona pass\" in April, the first to do so in Europe. \nThis shows - either on a phone or on paper - that you have been vaccinated, previously infected or that you have had a negative test within 72 hours. \nPeople need to show it for entry to cinemas, museums, hairdressers or indoor dining.\nThe Greek government is welcoming tourists from many countries, if they are fully vaccinated or can provide a negative coronavirus test.  \nFace coverings must be worn in all public places and there is a curfew from 01:30-05:00, but bars, restaurants, museums and archaeological sites are all open.\nCinemas, theatres, museums and restaurants are open at 50% capacity. From 26 June, this increases to 75%. \nNightclubs and discos will also be allowed to reopen, with a limit of 150 people.\nFace coverings must be worn in enclosed spaces and 1.5m social distancing observed.\nShops, bars, restaurants and museums are open, although face coverings remain compulsory in most public places. \nNightclubs can now reopen in parts of Spain with low infection rates. \nIn Barcelona, they are restricted to 50% of capacity and can stay open until 03:30 - dancers have to wear masks.\nSpain began welcoming vaccinated tourists from 7 June. Most European travellers still have to present a negative Covid test on arrival.\nShops, cinemas, gyms, cafes and restaurants are open, with restrictions. Households can invite up to four people inside.\nFrom 1 July, working from home will no longer be mandatory, if the situation continues to improve. \nCultural performances, shows and sports competitions can also go ahead, with limited numbers, and more people will be allowed at weddings and other ceremonies and parties. \nPortugal has lifted many of its restrictions but face coverings must still be worn in indoor public spaces and some outdoor settings.\nBars and nightclubs remain closed, and it's illegal to drink alcohol outdoors in public places, except for pavement caf\u00e9s and restaurants. \nAlcohol cannot be sold after 21:00 unless it is with a meal.\nRestaurants, cafes and cultural venues have to close at 01:00 and have capacity limits. \nA weekend travel ban is in force in the Lisbon area, starting at 15:00 on Friday, with residents only allowed to leave for essential journeys. \nIn Lisbon and in Albufeira (Algarve), cafes, restaurants and non-essential shops have to close by 15:30 at the weekend and 22:30 on weekdays. \nRestaurants, cafes, museums and historic buildings have reopened with capacity limits. \nFrom 26 June, a number of restrictions are being lifted. \nAlcohol can be sold after 22:00, and nightclubs can open, with an entry pass system. \nEvents held in public venues such as cinemas, conference centres and concert halls will be allowed, subject to social distancing. \nMasks will no longer be compulsory except on public transport, airports and in secondary schools.\nOutdoor services in restaurants and bars returned in June. Theme parks, funfairs, cinemas and theatres, gyms and swimming pools, have reopened as well.\nFrom 5 July, restaurants and bars will be able to serve customers indoors. Weddings and other indoor events for up to 50 people will be permitted and the numbers at outdoor organised events will increase. \nSince June, pubs have been able to stay open until 22:30 and more people are now allowed at sports events, outdoor concerts, cinemas and markets.\nOn 1 July, limits on private gatherings will be raised, and the recommendation to interact with a small circle of people removed.\nFurther easing is planned on 15 July and in September.

      "text": "Pharmaceutical firms manufacturing the Covid-19 vaccine should make enough for everyone in the world or voluntarily hand their technology to developing countries, says the new WTO head.\nDr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said it was \"not acceptable\" to leave poorer countries at the \"end of the queue\" for vaccines.\nShe pointed to AstraZeneca's deal to transfer its know-how to a mass vaccine manufacturer in India.\nSuch \"voluntary licensing... could save many more people,\" she said.\n\"There is some capacity in developing countries unused now. Let's have the same kind of arrangement that AstraZeneca has with the Serum Institute of India,\" she told the BBC's Economics Editor Faisal Islam. \n\"Novovax, J& J and all the others should follow suit,\" she said, referring to other vaccine manufacturers.\nDr Okonjo-Iweala, who became director general of the World Trade Organization earlier this month, acknowledged that members were split on the issue of relaxing WTO rules on intellectual property so that more drug manufacturers can make the jabs. \nThe issue has been pushed by India, South Africa and dozens of poorer countries who want to freely replicate the vaccines. \nWealthier countries have resisted such a move although the Biden administration in the US has signalled it is considering the plans.\nSouth Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa this week described the hoarding of vaccines and refusal to freely share vaccine-making blueprints as \"vaccine apartheid\".\nBut Dr Okonjo-Iweala said the issue, known as the Trips waiver, is for the next pandemic and all efforts now must be focused on increasing manufacturing capacity.\nShe said the world must avoid the decade-long wait many developing countries faced to get anti-HIV drugs.\n\"I'm very concerned,\" she said. \"The kind of inequities we see in vaccine access are really not acceptable, you can't have a situation in which, you know, 10 countries have administered 70% of vaccine doses in the world, and there are countries that don't have one single dose\".\nUntil the end of last year Dr Okonjo-Iweala, Nigeria's former finance minister, chaired the global vaccine alliance, Gavi, which aims to increase access to vaccines around the world.\nMany nations in the developed world, which began their own vaccinations months ago, have faced criticism for buying or ordering more vaccines than they need.\nThe World Health Organization said in January that over 39 million vaccines had been given in 49 wealthier countries, while one poorer nation had just 25 doses.\nBut many of the wealthier countries placed orders for doses with pharmaceutical companies before knowing whether the vaccine in development would be effective. They were hedging their bets - placing multiple orders in the hope that at least some of them would work out.\nThe UK, which has ordered 400 million vaccine doses and will have many left over, has said it will donate most of its surplus vaccine supply to poorer countries."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nFewer than one in five people request a Covid-19 test if they have symptoms, while the number who follow full self-isolation rules is low, a large study of the test and trace system suggests. The report, published in the British Medical Journal, also finds only half of people know the main Covid symptoms. Experts say the findings suggest the impact of the \u00a337bn NHS Test and Trace system is \"limited\". but the Department for Health and Social Care said test and trace had saved \"countless lives\", adding that the latest ONS data found the \"overwhelming majority\" self-isolated when asked to.\nUnusual blood clots in the brain have been detected in a handful of people after they were injected with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. These \"cerebral venous sinus thromboses\", or CVSTs, have led some countries - including Germany, France and Canada - to restrict who can be given the jab. The World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency say the benefits of the vaccine outweigh any risks. Scientists and medicines safety regulators around the world are trying to figure out if the vaccine is genuinely causing these strokes, how big any risk might be and what that might mean for vaccination programmes.\nPharmaceutical firms manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines should make enough for everyone in the world or voluntarily hand their technology to developing countries, says the new WTO head. Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala says it is \"not acceptable\" to leave poorer countries at the \"end of the queue\" for vaccines. She pointed to AstraZeneca's deal to transfer its know-how to a mass vaccine manufacturer in India. Such \"voluntary licensing... could save many more people,\" she adds.\nIt has been just over a year since the UK had its first national lockdown. Since then, preliminary research has found many people who say their memories have been affected, and that they've lost some of their skills. But is this true? Neuropsychologist Catherine Loveday told the BBC how our ability to remember may have been impacted, and what we can do to improve it.\nTogo in West Africa has found a high-tech way to find people who need financial help in the pandemic - and then send them emergency cash.

      "text": "Pupils in all primary and post-primary schools will return to school after the Easter holidays.\nIn a statement on Thursday afternoon, the Department of Education confirmed that face-to-face teaching will resume from 12 April. \nIt is one of a number of new lockdown easing measures agreed on Thursday. \nThe NI Executive has also decided to reopen some outdoor non-essential retail from that same date.\nIt will also extend reopening to motor home dealers, car washes, garden centres and plant nurseries.\nMeanwhile, the limit of 25 people at marriages, civil partnerships and funerals will also be lifted from 12 April.\nInstead it will be up to individual venues to determine how many guests they can safely accommodate. \nUp to four people will also be allowed at viewings of wedding venues.\nOutdoor sports training can also resume from 12 April for small groups of 15 people from sports clubs affiliated with recognised governing bodies. \nThe next formal review of the lockdown restrictions will take place on 15 April.\nOther previously announced measures to ease lockdown came into force earlier, including new rules to allow some meeting up outdoors and the return of some sports, such as golf and tennis.\nGarden centres are also now allowed to offer click-and-collect services.\nAn executive meeting to confirm the details around the future easing of restrictions took place earlier on Thursday.\nWith the exception of some pupils returning to school in March, the changes that take place on Thursday are the first since NI returned to full lockdown on 26 December.\nHowever most of the rules which have been in force have not been altered, including the stay-at-home rule.\nFrom Thursday, up to six people from two households are allowed to meet in a private garden.\nThe executive advises that people should maintain social distancing during these gatherings. \nIf there is no alternative route, people  are able to enter a garden by going through a house.\nOnly shops which are deemed to be essential retail are currently allowed to open, as has been the case for much of the pandemic.\nAs well as garden centres, plant nurseries are also able to offer click-and-collect services. \nUp to 10 people from no more than two households can now take part in outdoor exercise together in a public place or at a sports club.\nIt meant the return of sports such as golf and tennis on Thursday. \nHowever, clubhouses and any other indoor facilities - including changing rooms, showers, kitchens and meeting rooms - associated with these sports will remain closed. \nThe rule changes apply to all levels of sport and not just at the elite level.\nIn a tweet, Economy Minister Diane Dodds said it was \"good news that my Economic Recovery Action Plan will be funded in full, that outdoor retail can reopen on 12 April and that my proposal to continue to support large hospitality sector was agreed\".\nMrs Dodds said the news was \"another step towards reopening, recovering and rebuilding the economy\".\nFurther loosening of restrictions is due on 12 April, subject to being approved by the executive after the Easter weekend.\nDr Gerry Waldron from the Public Health Agency told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday that he understood the current restrictions were \"difficult\" for people, but urged them to \"keep the brakes on\".\n\"We are heading into our second Easter where we are severely restricted in terms of what we can do, but the reason for this is that we want to keep our people safe,\" he said.\n\"We are in a position at the moment where things are going reasonably well, the numbers are coming down, we have a vaccination programme in place that is very successful and we are getting to a better place, but we really don't want to be in a position after Easter where we see the numbers ramping up again.\"\nMeanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann has announced \u00a31.3m in additional funding for Northern Ireland hospices.\nThe one-off funding is in recognition of the impact of Covid-19 on the services delivered by the four hospices."

      "text": "University leaders are lobbying for a return to campuses this month for all students in England - from 12 April rather than suggestions of 17 May.\nMany students \"feel they have been forgotten by government\", said Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of universities.\nAbout a million students are still only studying online.\nThe Department for Education says return dates will be reviewed \"by the end of the Easter holidays\".\nThis timetable is understood to mean by the end of next week. \nBut students have been promised at least a week's notice, which would mean a decision for a return from 12 April would have to be announced over the Easter weekend.\nUniversities UK says \"concerns are growing that the next stage of student returns will be delayed until 17 May at the earliest\".\nThat would mean that many students, paying full fees and in some cases rent, would see their summer term on campus shrinking to a few weeks, before ending in June.\nIt would add pressure to calls for students to be given refunds after a second year of disruption.\nWhile schools and colleges had a big back-to-school return in March, much of university teaching has remained off-campus and online, with no date for a return.\nSome practical courses, requiring hands-on training, have returned, with Universities UK estimating that half of 2.1 million students do not have any indication of when they might go back.\nIn some universities, teaching is going to remain online for the rest of the academic year.\n\"There are university students across the country on courses such as business, maths and languages who are still waiting to find when - or even if - they will be able to return to in-person teaching this year,\" says Dr Bradshaw, head of the Russell Group of 24 leading research universities.\n\"We are particularly concerned about the impact on student mental health,\" he says.\nDr Bradshaw urged ministers to allow students to go back for in-person teaching from 12 April - arguing that there was little evidence that it would threaten a significant increase in infections.\nA survey from the Higher Education Policy Institute found that two-thirds of students have been staying in their term-time accommodation, even if studying online, suggesting there would be less of a mass migration than at the start of the academic year.\n\"We have shared comprehensive evidence with the government on the clear benefits of a 12 April return to in-person activities for students' mental health and wellbeing,\" said a Universities UK spokeswoman.\nDebra Humphris, chair of the University Alliance group of universities, said an earlier return would be particularly important for those students graduating this year - who want the \"face-to-face employability support\" before entering an \"uncertain job market\".\nBut the UCU lecturers' union has rejected calls for a campus return this month - saying it \"smacks of self-interest and risks the safety of staff, students and the wider public\". \nJo Grady, the union's general secretary, said \"vice-chancellors lured students to university with the promise of a relatively normal campus experience, only for them to be left facing long periods in lockdown. \n\"Universities should not now be asking hundreds of thousands of students to return for in-person teaching after Easter when most courses will only have revision classes and exams left,\" said Dr Grady.\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"We will be reviewing options for the timing of the return of all remaining students by the end of the Easter holidays. \n\"Decisions will take into account the need to protect progress across the wider roadmap out of the pandemic, including the spread of the virus in communities and pressures on the NHS.\""

even one minister awkwardly said they'd never heard of him this morning.\nBut his resignation is a difficult moment for the government on the sensitive, divisive topic of race.\nDowning street has denied any suggestion his departure is linked to Wednesday's report.\nWithout Samuel Kasumu's version of events, it's hard to know why and when he chose to resign - having changed his mind about quitting earlier in the year.\nBut his departure leaves questions about the confidence some in government, let alone the public, have about the prime minister's approach to tackling racial inequality.\nLast year Boris Johnson said he wanted to \"change the narrative\" on this subject  - but this is unlikely to be what he had in mind.\nMr Johnson said he had \"worked closely\" with Mr Kasumu - who will leave his role next month - and he had \"done some great stuff and I thank him very much\".\nThe adviser had previously handed in a resignation letter in February, accusing the Conservatives of a \"politics steeped in division\".\nHe had asked to keep working on a project to combat disinformation on Covid vaccines, with \"the view to leaving at the end of May\".\nBut Mr Kasumu went on to retract this letter, following talks with vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi.\nMr Kasumu has declined to comment, but sources told the BBC there has been an \"awkward silence\" hanging over Downing Street, with little discussion or movement since he first threatened to resign. \nThe Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities (CRED) was launched last summer in the wake of anti-racism Black Lives Matter protests last summer.\nIn its report published on Wednesday, it concluded the UK was not yet a \"post-racial country,\" but family structure and social class had a bigger impact than race on people's life chances. \nIt argued that racial discrimination has often been misapplied to \"account for every observed disparity\" between ethnic groups.\nAnd it said references to racism in the UK being \"institutional\" or \"structural\" had sometimes been used without sufficient evidence. \nDr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a member of the commission, said the report was not denying institutional racism existed, but said they had not discovered evidence of it in the areas they had looked.\nThe commission made 24 recommendations, including urging more research into school performance and for organisations to ditch unconscious bias training. \nSpeaking on Thursday, Mr Johnson said the commission had suggested several \"interesting ideas\" and the government would respond in \"due course\".\n\"I don't say the government is going to agree with absolutely everything in it, but it has some original and stimulating work in it that I think people need to read and to consider,\" Mr Johnson added. \n\"There are very serious issues that our society faces to do with racism that we need to address.\n\"We've got to do more to fix it, we need to understand the severity of the problem, and we're going to be looking at all the ideas that they have put forward\".\nThe commission's chairman Tony Sewell, an education consultant and ex-charity boss, has meanwhile defended himself from criticism over comments he made in the report about how the British Empire should be taught in schools.\nIn his foreword to the report, he wrote: \"There is a new story about the Caribbean experience which speaks to the slave period not only being about profit and suffering but how culturally African people transformed themselves into a re-modelled African/Britain\".\nHalima Begum, chief executive of race equality think tank the Runnymede Trust, said his comments were \"out of kilter with where British society is\" - and Labour's Ms de Cordova accused him of \"putting a positive spin on slavery\".\nBut in a statement on Thursday, Dr Sewell said it was \"absurd to suggest that the commission is trying to downplay the evil of the slave trade\". \n\"The report merely says that, in the face of the inhumanity of slavery, African people preserved their humanity and culture,\" he added.

      "text": "Nike has won its lawsuit against Brooklyn art collective MSCHF over their controversial 'Satan Shoes' that contain a drop of real human blood in the soles.\nThe $1,018 (\u00a3740) trainers are modified Nike Air Max 97s that feature an inverted cross, a pentagram and the words \"Luke 10:18\".\nMSCHF produced the shoes in collaboration with rapper Lil Nas X.\nIt said only 666 pairs were made and all but one have already been shipped.\nNike claimed trademark infringement, asking a federal court in New York to stop MSCHF from selling the shoes and prevent them from using its famous Swoosh.\n\"MSCHF and its unauthorised Satan Shoes are likely to cause confusion and dilution and create an erroneous association between MSCHF's products and Nike,\" the sports shoe giant said in the lawsuit.\nLawyers for MSCHF countered that the 666 pairs it created were \"not typical sneakers, but rather individually-numbered works of art that were sold to collectors for $1,018 each\".\nSiding with Nike, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order on Thursday.\nThe impact of the ruling remains unclear as MSCHF had indicated it has no plans to produce any more pairs of the shoe.\nMSCHF \"dropped\" the black and red shoes on Monday, coinciding with the launch of Lil Nas X's latest song Montero (Call Me By Your Name), which debuted on YouTube last Friday.\nThe song features the rapper, who came out as gay in 2019, celebrating his sexuality and rejecting attempts to shame him. \nIn a heavily stylised music video, he slides down a pole from heaven to hell before dancing provocatively with Satan, then snaps his neck and steals his horns.\nThe imagery and the shoes both reference the Bible verse Luke 10:18 - \"So He told them, 'I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven'.\"\nEach shoe also features a signature Nike air bubble cushioning sole, containing 60 cubic centimetres (2.03 fluid ounces) of red ink and a single drop of human blood, donated by members of the MSCHF art collective. \nIn its filing with the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Nike said it did not approve or authorise the customised Satan Shoes.\n\"There is already evidence of significant confusion and dilution occurring in the marketplace, including calls to boycott Nike in response to the launch of MSCHF's Satan Shoes, based on the mistaken belief that Nike has authorised or approved this product,\" it said.\nThe lawsuit cited a tweet by popular shoe influencer @Saint from last Friday, which teased the upcoming release of the shoes and drummed up publicity over the weekend on social media and in the media in the US.\nSome conservatives, including South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, and some religious followers, took offence at the controversial design of the shoes and criticised Lil Nas X and MSCHF on Twitter. \nLil Nas X hit back at the governor and other critics on Twitter, tweeting several memes on his profile in response to the Nike lawsuit.\nJoseph Rasch of Tennessee, who paid $1,080 for the trainers, says he is worried the conflict means his money will be lost.\n\"I'm hoping I'll receive them since I paid for them,\" he told BBC OS on World Service radio, adding that he made the purchase not because he definitely planned to wear them but as a political statement.\n\"I wanted to support a black gay man who is attempting to show a different narrative in a majority Christian country that currently is dealing with a lot of issues with black people. So what better way to do that than to buy shoes that this person has collaborated with?\" he said.\nBuyer McKenzi Norris of South Carolina, a longtime follower of the MSCHF art collective, said Nike's lawsuit had disrupted his plans to resell the trainers for $2,500 on eBay, which removed his listing.\n\"In general I think Nike's lawsuit and their intervention is pretty ridiculous considering how much damage it can cause to everyday people like me who just like to customise and resell their products legally,\" he said."
