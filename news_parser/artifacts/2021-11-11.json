      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the COP26 climate change conference on Thursday.\nThere's been a cautious welcome by activists and politicians to the unexpected announcement that the US and China would work together to tackle climate change. The EU and UN say the declaration is encouraging, and an important step, while Greenpeace believes the two nations need to show greater commitment to reaching climate goals. The US-China declaration was announced as COP26 in Glasgow nears its end sees the two countries - the two biggest carbon dioxide, CO2, emitters in the world - vow to boost climate co-operation over the next decade. The global rivals say they will work together to achieve the 1.5C temperature goal set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Keep up with the day's events here.\nDespite promises to invest in green energy, many governments still financially back the fossil fuel industry - emissions from which are one of the primary causes of global warming. According to the UN Development Programme, the world spends more than $420bn (\u00a3313bn) a year subsidising non-renewable energy. But what are fossil fuel subsidies and which countries are spending the most? Find out here.\nMitzi Jonelle Tan from the Philippines, Gaston Tenembaum from Argentina, and Dominique Palmer from London are passionate about the environment. They are all attending COP26 and we've asked them some questions about climate change, their hopes for the conference and their advice for dealing with eco-anxiety. Watch what these climate activists have to say.\nEvery year the Artivist Network - a group of artists and activists - find a space to paint a mural during COP, to leave something permanent and thought-provoking behind after negotiations. It's so people don't  forget that this happened in their city, says Daniel Rupaszov, 25, from Hungary. The group visits COP every year to create art that highlights the climate crisis, he says, as he tells us about the murals he's painting.\nInstead of fearing floods, one man has come up with an idea to embrace them by creating sponge cities to soak up rainfall. Inspired by a near death experience where he was swept into\u00a0a river, Yu Kongjian decided to use the environment to soak up water, like a sponge. It's been rolled out in cities across China and Yu thinks other places could adopt it too, in the face of more extreme floods linked to climate change. So can sponge cities help combat extreme weather? Take a look.\nCOP26 PUSH NOTIFICATIONS: If you want to keep up with the latest around the climate summit, tap here to receive alerts on your phone.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nWith just days to go until COP26 finishes, here's a reminder of the UK's climate change strategy. The government wants to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a number of ways including a new push towards electric vehicles. The UK's made progress in cutting emissions compared with the levels in 1990, and experts are analysing whether this strategy is enough to meet the 2050 target. They've already pointed out eating less meat or reducing demand for flying - both big sources of emissions - are missing. \nWe have more details about the plan here.\nYou can find further information on our climate page.\nWhat questions do you have about changes in our climate? \nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Forty percent of people have been targeted by a scam in the past three years, the Consumer Council has said.\nChief executive Noyona Chundur said scammers were finding new ways to target people.\nThe PSNI said despite the perception that older people are the main victims of scams, the age group most affected is 20 to 49 year olds.\nThey said there had been a increase in scams targeting people through social media and online shopping.\nOn the fifth anniversary of the Scamwise NI Partnership, Supt Gerard Pollock said there had been a \"significant rise in the number of reported scams\" since 2016.\nIn the 2015/16 financial year, the PSNI said 2,230 fraud offences were reported. In the 2020/21 year, that figure had risen to 5,825.\n\"Whilst there has been a rise in general around the UK and further afield, we are pleased that through our commitment to raising awareness, more and more people are spotting and therefore reporting scams,\" he added.\n\"Fraudsters are continually coming up with more sophisticated and convincing ways of duping people out of money and possessions so partnerships like ScamwiseNI are vital in ensuring they do not succeed.\" \nScamwise NI was started by a number of organisations including the PSNI, Department of Justice, The Commissioner for Older People for Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Policing Board, in response to the growing number of scams circulating in Northern Ireland.\nEddie Lynch, the commissioner for older people for Northern Ireland, said the scheme had had a positive impact.\n\"We are living in a society where scammers will go out of their way to dupe people out of their money in lots of different ways,\" he added.\n\"Anyone can become a victim of a scam which is why I... will continue to work with and promote the partnership's efforts to ensure our older citizens are well informed.\"\nMs Chundur said the Consumer Council's research showed how important initiatives to combat scamming were.\n\"As we become more reliant on the internet, scammers are finding new ways to target people, meaning our work in protecting consumers has never been more important,\" she added."

      "text": "Forget Tinseltown, Manhattan or London's Primrose Hill, over the last two weeks Glasgow has been the place to spot some of the world's most famous celebrities. \nFrom Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the hunt for Irn Bru, Barack Obama's trip to the student union or Leonardo DiCaprio dining out on the town - COP26 has brought some of the world's biggest names to Scotland.\nAs well as bringing a touch of glamour to proceedings, the celebrities used their profiles to shine a light on environmental projects close to their hearts.\nPresident Obama grabbed all the headlines with his summit speech on Monday, when he called on young people to \"stay angry\" in the fight against climate change. \nAnd he highlighted the plight of island nations which are already suffering due to climate crisis. They are \"in many ways the canary in the coal mine,\" he said. \nBut he didn't avoid gaffes. Apparently unsure of his geography, he referred to being in the \"Emerald Isles\" and described Shakespeare as \"the Bard\" - in Scotland, that title is reserved for Robert Burns.\nIt didn't affect his reception at a visit to the University of Strathclyde later however. Ahead of a meeting with COP26 youth leaders at the student union, he received a rapturous reception. The union gave the former president a lifetime membership to mark the occasion.\nUS congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been chronicling her trip to Scotland on Instagram, set social media alight on Wednesday during her COP26 visit with an appeal to taste Irn Bru.\nThe Democrat - who is known as AOC - had attended an event on gender and the climate crisis with Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi.\nResponding to questions from followers on social media, she said her schedule was \"jammed\" but she hoped to see more of Scotland during. \n\"I want to find some Irn Bru, touch Harris Tweed and see a castle,\" she said.\nLater, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted a photo of herself and Ms Ocasio-Cortez, saying she now had a \"supply\" of the fizzy drink.\nIrn-Bru met with her approval, with the New York Representative saying it reminded her of Kola Champagne - another \"soda\" popular in Latin America.\nThe Titanic actor and environmental campaigner is a UN climate change representative. He attended the Kew Carbon Garden exhibit in the first week of the conference.\nThe night before he was spotted at a fringe event, posing with film producer Paul Goodenough, founder of charity Rewriting Extinction. He also dined out in the city's popular Finnieston area.\nDiCaprio has donated millions to environmental organisations and backed ventures such as those producing trainers made from natural materials.\nThe 46-year-old was recently photographed flying commercially rather than by private jet.  It is believed he also travelled to Scotland with a commercial airline.\nThe British actor is a goodwill ambassador for the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). He addressed the COP26 summit last Saturday, admitting in his speech that he understands why \"people might be a little irritated\" to see celebrities weighing in on climate change.\nThe star of the TV shows Luther and The Wire, and films including Avengers: Infinity War and Fast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw said he believed he could amplify the conversation around food supply and climate change saying: \"One thing I've got is a big mouth.\"\nThe 49-year-old discussed the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the supply chain, especially on families who were forced to queue for food due to food shortages.\nThe 31-year-old Harry Potter star hosted a panel discussion with several climate change campaigners including Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate at the New York Times Climate Hub. \nOn her Instagram account, she said of the experience: \"There is no doubt in my mind that we witnessed a piece of history in Glasgow. I would feel honoured to be in the presence of just one of these women individually (they are all actual superstars who are quite literally making the world a better place) - but to be with them altogether - was almost overwhelming.\"\nWhile in Glasgow, the actor hid books around the city as part of the book fairies movement. She chose titles related to climate activism for the week-long Book Fairies event.\nOne of the lucky places where she left several was the Heart of Scotstoun community centre in the west end, where the \"fairy\" was snapped with staff.\nFashion designer Stella McCartney brought her vision of the future of fashion to Glasgow with a showcase at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. Her mission is to make fashion more sustainable.\nMcCartney has never used leather, feathers, skin or fur in her designs and she showed Prince Charles around her exhibit which showcased the innovative materials she is introducing to the fashion world.\nThese included Bolt Threads' Mylo mycelium leather, regenerative cotton from Soktas and Econyl regenerated nylon sourced from waste and ocean plastics. \nThe designer also showcased the world's first vegan football boots, that she created with footballer Paul Pogba and Adidas.\nMusician Ellie Goulding spent a day in Glasgow with friend and fellow activist Princess Eugenie. \nThe 34-year-old singer last year signed an open letter to the UK government calling for more women in decision-making roles at COP26 .\nThe letter, which was also signed by actor Emma Watson, said the gender balance was \"incomprehensible\".\nGoulding posted to her Instagram account, saying: \"Our future generations shouldn't have to inherit a broken planet because we didn't take the opportunity to fix it when we could! Let's go\"\nAcademy award-winner Matt Damon did not visit Glasgow in person, but took part virtually from New York in a panel discussion about water supply in developing countries.\nThe 51-year-old is co-founder of Water.org, a charity which brings water and sanitation to deprived communities. \nThe actor travelled with his mother as a child and saw first-hand extreme poverty in developing countries.\nWhile filming a movie in Africa in 2006, he spent time with families in a Zambian village and after seeing how they lacked access to water and toilets, he founded H20 Africa Foundation to raise awareness about safe water initiatives on the continent.\nSupermodel, actor and activist Lily Cole was spotted at Glasgow Green on Saturday after about 100,000 people marched in the biggest protest of the climate summit.\nShe also hosted an event with indigenous communities which Prince Charles attended. Her focus is on helping indigenous people affected by climate change to have a voice.\nThe star has written a book, Who Cares Wins: How to Protect the Planet You Love and told BBC Women's Hour that she was choosing to be optimistic because the data in the climate change situation is terrifying.\nShe said: \"I think there are so many solutions, policies, technologies, value systems and wisdoms that we can tap into to find a way through and only by focusing on solutions will we actually overcome the obstacles we need to\"\nHe might not have the same star power of Obama or DiCaprio, but TV chaser Mark 'the Beast' Labbett arrived in Glasgow to attend a pub quiz during week one of COP26.\nThe star of The Chase was pictured at Central Station adopting a climate-friendly mode of travel. He was not taking part in COP26 events, but made the day of two British Transport Police officers from Nottingham in Glasgow to help keep the city safe.\nRead more about the COP26 summit here."

Businesses are not running at full capacity.\n\"So if we don't have that support then many businesses now, before the end of the year or after this year, could collapse because of that support disappearing. And we absolutely need it, going forward.\"\nHe said business rates \"should remain at zero, because we are in such uncertain times\".\nCerys Furlong is a restaurant and pub owner from Cardiff and a member of the Welsh Independent Restaurants Collective.\nShe said: \"It's not just about closing your doors and then re-opening your doors. \n\"Every time we do that there are costs included and of course when there are long periods of closure like there has been over the past 18 months many businesses have incurred vast amounts of debt that they're also trying to pay back. \n\"It's not just about getting back to normal but about getting us in a position to thrive again.\"\nThe Celtic Collection's latest development, the Parkgate Hotel, opened in October on Westgate Street in Cardiff at a challenging time for the hospitality industry.\n\"It's a risk opening any business at any time, no matter what is going on,\" Mr Edwards said, adding \"but it is even more of a risk opening a hospitality business during a pandemic.\n\"Hospitality has probably suffered more than any other industry during this pandemic.\"\nWales' Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said the Welsh government understood that businesses were asking for further support with business rates from next April.\nHe said he was discussing with Finance Minister Rebecca Evans \"the sort of support we will be able to provide to businesses in the future\", ahead of the Welsh government's budget on 20 December.\n\"We're going to need to make choices in the next couple of months with our budget,\" Mr Gething said, appearing before the Senedd's economy committee on Thursday.\nStaff shortages have hit many hospitality businesses, with restaurants and hotels having to limit their opening times or reduce the number of rooms on sale in order to deal with a recruitment crisis.\nIt is an issue that students at Coleg y Cymoedd in Rhondda Cynon Taf are acutely aware of, with some already working in the sector before finishing their qualifications.\nNicholas Schindler, 19, from Ystrad Rhondda is studying cookery at college and working in a pub.\n\"I would love to work in a proper, professional kitchen in the near future,\" he said.\n\"I have been working up in a pub kitchen for about five months, and it is incredibly busy.

These are pressures that existed in the NHS even before Covid - yes Covid has exacerbated the problems, but let's not pretend they started with Covid.\"\nLib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said the situation was having a \"traumatic\" impact on health staff, accusing the government of \"grasping at straws and blaming the pandemic\" instead of supporting them.\nMr Swinney said he recognised there was \"enormous pressure\" on Scotland's health service - pointing to a sharp increase in the number of emergency callouts.\nHe said: \"In August 2018, the ambulance service responded to 5,788 immediately life-threatening incidents. By October 2021 that figure had reached 10,733 - it had almost doubled.\n\"The government has provided increased investment of \u00a320m to support staff, and staff recruitment is under way. \n\"We will continue to invest in the work of the Scottish Ambulance Service to ensure it has the capacity to undertake the tasks it needs to undertake, and to ensure that other families don't have the experience of Mr Brown's family.\"\nMr Swinney said the impact of the pandemic on the health service meant that a \"series of measures\" was needed across the system to alleviate pressure.\nHe said: \"We have to have whole-system solutions in place. It's about boosting social care capacity, so people are better supported in their own homes and have less need to use the ambulance service. \n\"Or about ensuring we have improvements in the level of delayed discharges, so our hospitals are less congested - and crucially, that we can make sure people have a swift journey through accident and emergency when they require to be there.\"\nHe also said he valued the contribution by all healthcare staff, and that \u00a312m had been invested in staff wellbeing due to the \"significant impact\" of Covid on the NHS."

      "tags": "South Africa,Nelson Mandela",
      "text": "For some in South Africa, FW de Klerk was a great statesman - the Nobel Peace Prize winner who helped end the system of legalised racism which he inherited.\nFor others, he benefited enormously from that same system and deserved to be prosecuted for its many crimes.\nIn truth, he was a man of many parts. \nThe 85-year-old was South Africa's last apartheid president. During his time in office, security forces meted out extreme violence against black South Africans who simply wanted an end to rule by the country's white minority - fighting for the release of Nelson Mandela and other leaders from prison. \nApartheid was not that long ago and it remains extremely raw in South Africa, not least because no-one has been criminally prosecuted for the violence of the time. Crimes were committed - its victims traceable - but there were no criminals, it seems.\nSome people believe De Klerk could and should have done more to change that - to ensure accountability for what the apartheid system did to the lives of black people and the violence of his government, and even that he should have faced justice as well.  \nHe was, after all, on the inside for many decades - he had a front-row seat on the apartheid machinery at work and had benefited from it for many years. \nA trained lawyer, who served as a National Party MP since 1972, De Klerk had a firm understanding of the party which created apartheid, and found a way of working within its structures to rise to the top, although he was undoubtedly more moderate in his views than his predecessors. \nIt is perhaps this that made it possible for him to carefully steer even the most visceral defenders of the apartheid system within his party to the negotiation table where Mandela was offering a chance to help rebuild the country - a negotiated way out of what many believed would have been a bloodbath. \nThe Archbishop Desmond Tutu Foundation acknowledged his contribution to the democratic transition: \n\"The late FW De Klerk played an important role in South Africa's history. At a time when not all of his colleagues saw the future trajectory of the country unfolding in the same way, he recognised the moment for change and demonstrated the will to act on it.\"\nThe custodians of the legacy of Nelson Mandela, with whom De Klerk shared the Nobel Peace Prize, pointedly described him as someone with a \"big\" legacy but also one that was \"uneven\". \nDe Klerk chose to negotiate with the African National Congress (ANC) at a time when many countries around the world and former allies had turned their back on the National Party and their government was all but bankrupt. Sceptics say he was more of a pragmatist than an idealist - that he had little choice. \nIn his book, Long Walk to Freedom, Mandela was pretty clear: \"Despite his seemingly progressive actions, Mr de Klerk was by no means the great emancipator. \n\"He did not make any of his reforms with the intention of putting himself out of power. He made them for precisely the opposite reason: to ensure power for the Afrikaner in a new dispensation.\"\nHowever, this decision alienated him from many in his party and years later some in his Afrikaner community still saw De Klerk as a traitor.\nA few years ago I visited the whites-only town of Orania - home to people disenchanted with the \"rainbow nation\" dream, choosing instead to live in isolation. \nThere on a hill, in the small town where a flag inspired by the old apartheid standard continued to fly and bronze statues of past leaders of the apartheid government were proudly displayed, De Klerk was missing - erased from their list of \"heroes\". \nThe people I spoke to saw him as a coward, and believed he had sold them out. \nEven to the end, De Klerk seemed to be unsettled with his own place in South Africa as he battled illness. \nIn the video message released by his foundation soon after his death, a frail-looking De Klerk said that, while he had once supported the \"separate development\" project as he called apartheid, in the 1980s he had \"changed completely\". \nHe described this change of heart as a conversion and said this is why he agreed to negotiate with Mandela and other political leaders.\nHe added that in the years since the end of the oppressive regime he had done what he could to continue to denounce it, even amidst scepticism. \n\"Let me today in this last message repeat: I, without qualification, apologise for the pain and the hurt and the indignity and the damage that apartheid has done to black, brown and Indians in South Africa,\" De Klerk said in a video dubbed his \"final message\".\nFor the majority of South Africans, the legacy of apartheid has led to millions of people living in poverty and persistent inequality. \nSome here believe redress has not happened largely because there is no shared acknowledgment that apartheid has continued to go unpunished - De Klerk's passing leaves uneasy questions about how to reckon with this.\n\"De Klerk sat in on the meeting of the State Security Council where they had discussed the fate of Matthew Goniwe and Fort Calata in 1984 and 1985,\" said Lukhanyo Calata of the Fort Calata Foundation.\nHis father, Fort Calata, was an anti-apartheid activist, and was murdered alongside Matthew Goniwe and two other men by apartheid police in 1985 - the so-called Cradock Four.\nHe's been working for years get them justice and in June this year approached the courts to help prosecute the apartheid-era murders. A ruling is still pending. \n\"It is sad that yet another apartheid criminal has died without having accounted for the crimes he helped to perpetrate against our humanity\" said Mr Calata. \nMore about FW de Klerk:"

      "text": "Lives are at risk because patients are facing unacceptably long waits for a 999 response, the College of Paramedics has told the BBC.\nIt comes as NHS data shows callouts for problems such as heart attacks and strokes are taking nearly three times as long as they should in England.\nTargets are being missed in the rest of UK too, with some seriously-ill waiting up to nine hours for an ambulance.\nInvestigations are ongoing into deaths linked to delays in a number of areas.\nThese include: \nWith ambulance services under their highest states of alert patients are being told to make their own way to hospital where possible.\nThe BBC has spoken to ambulance staff across the UK about their experiences, with one saying they felt patients were at risk on every shift and another describing the situation as \"horrendous\".\nThe College of Paramedics, the professional body for the sector, described the situation as \"unacceptable\" and said lives were at stake.\nThe BBC has found reports of numerous serious incidents.\nCases involve both waits for crews to reach patients, as well as delays when ambulances arrive at A&E but spend hours queuing outside, because the hospital is too overcrowded to accept the patient.\nMargaret Root, 82, waited nearly six hours for an ambulance to come following a stroke, and she then waited for another three hours outside hospital.\nWhen she was finally admitted, her family was told it was too late to give her the drugs needed to reverse the effects of the stroke.\nHer granddaughter Christina White-Smith said her grandmother had been \"hugely let down\". \nShe said she did not blame the staff because they were \"amazing\" when they got to her grandmother, but said she is angry the NHS is not getting the help it needs.\n\"I don't think people are aware of the severity of the situation.\"\nDetails have also emerged of a 66-year-old man who spent four hours lying face down on the floor at home with a punctured lung.\nAnd in another case a man waited nine hours for help to arrive following a stroke one evening last month. His family called six times before a response finally arrived the following morning.\nRichard Webber, a spokesman for the College of Paramedics and a working paramedic, said the waits patients were experiencing were \"unacceptable\".\n\"We have members who have been working for 20, 30 years, and they have never before experienced anything like this at this time of the year. \n\"Every day services are holding hundreds of 999 calls with no-one to send. \n\"The ambulance service is simply not providing the levels of service they should - patients are waiting too long and that is putting them at risk.\"\nHe said the delays in handing patients over to hospital staff were causing havoc.\nMr Webber said waits of three or four hours were not uncommon.\n\"It means on a 12-hour shift we can only attend two or three incidents, whereas previously we would do six, seven or eight,\" he added.\nHis evidence is supported by data collected by the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, which shows the number of hours lost to handover delays lasting more than an hour, is now more than twice as high as it was in January.\nThe impact on response times is clear. The latest data for October shows in England category one cases classed as immediately life-threatening, such as cardiac arrests, took more than nine minutes on average to reach. \nThe target is seven minutes and research shows every one-minute delay reduces the chances of survival by 10% for cardiac arrests.\nCategory two cases cover emergencies including heart attacks, strokes and burns. They are meant to be reached in 18 minutes on average, but took nearly 54.\nResponse targets are also being missed in other parts of the UK. \nIn Wales, the Healthcare Inspectorate recently warned delays were presenting a risk to patients.\nShortly afterwards the ambulance service there requested help from the military.\nThere appear to be numerous reasons behind the problems.\nThere are also signs that the pandemic and the disruption it has caused to health care and everyday life, has meant the health of frail and vulnerable people has deteriorated, leading to more demand on services.\nCalls to the ambulance service are up by around a quarter on the numbers seen before the pandemic.\nHospitals are also reporting problems trying to discharge patients who are medically fit to leave but cannot because there is no social care available to support them in the community.\nThis is causing significant delays admitting patients onto wards, and in turn is leading to long waits for ambulance crews arriving with patients.\nThe head of the Scottish Ambulance Service, Pauline Howie, recently made an apology to the public, describing the pressures being faced as \"unprecedented\".\nChris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents both ambulance and hospital bosses in England, said the system was \"severely stretched\". \n\"What is worrying now is that they are all operating right at their limits and we are not yet into winter, when there's every chance these pressures could step up still further.\"\nProf Stephen Powis, medical director of the NHS in England, praised the work of staff, saying they were going \"above and beyond\".\nHe pointed out the ambulance service had had to deal with the highest number of 999 calls ever in a single month, while major A&E's had experience their busiest October.\n\"There is no doubt pressure on the health service remains incredibly high.\"\nAdditional reporting by Tim Vizard and Katherine Roberts"

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "The UK presidency team have set out an ambitious stall in their first attempt to capture progress here at COP26.\nAs well as the specific items mentioned in the document, it also gives us a sense of how the negotiations are going more generally.\nIt's clear that there's a sense of urgency, and a willingness to go high on the key question of cutting carbon more rapidly.\nIf this idea survives the next couple of days, then Glasgow may well be seen as a success.\nBut there's a long way to go until the final gavel comes down.\nThe idea of getting countries to come back more regularly started with the most vulnerable nations.\nThis meeting floated the idea of countries coming back with new plans every year - and this draft nods to that by asking everyone to come back next year with a new nationally determined contribution (NDC), which outlines their pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\nBut there are some interesting wrinkles in that request.\nParties are urged to come back in 2022 with plans that \"align with the Paris temperature goal\".\nWhich one do they mean - 1.5C or 2C?\nThat will need clarifying in the hours and days ahead. \nThe UK have attempted to copper-fasten the idea of rapid improvement in national plans by asking all countries to attend a high-level ministerial meeting on climate change every year.\nThey've also asked the UN Secretary-General to convene a world leaders meeting in 2023, just ahead of a global stock-take, which will examine how countries are performing on restricting emissions.\nThat all sounds like a nice day out for presidents and prime ministers, but doesn't commit them to do anything.\nThere is also some quite progressive language in this draft decision that will hearten campaigners, specifically the mention of coal. \nAccording to seasoned observer this is the first mention of the \"c\" word in a UN climate change document. \nHowever, before everyone gets carried away, the give and take nature of the drafting process means that there is no end date given, meaning it is an aspiration and not a timeline. \nThe same paragraph also mentions the phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies, but there's no specific mention of oil and gas.\nIs that to try and keep Saudi Arabia, Russia and other major producers on board?\nThere is some nice language on doubling the amount of finance given for adaptation. \nBut there's no baseline against which to measure the increase and no timeline for delivery.\nThe issue of loss and damage finally gets its own significant section in the draft decision. This is the idea that rich nations bear a historical responsibility for global warming and should compensate poorer ones for the harms visited on them. \nIts inclusion will hearten many developing nations, which have been asking for a clear financial commitment to tackle the impacts of climate change that they can't adapt to. However, the document is very woolly on this question.\nNow that the UK has played its main negotiating card, much will likely change over the next two days of hardball negotiations.\nThere will be pressure from countries like Saudi Arabia, Russia, China and India to water down the idea of coming back next year with a new plan.\nStrangely there are many developing nations who might also oppose this - the time, effort and costs associated with a new NDC should not be underestimated. \nDeveloping nations will also seek more clarity on two key issues. \nThey will want a strengthening of the language around finance so that a new goal for 2025 represents a significant increase on the much derided $100bn. \nThey will also want to see a stronger emphasis on spending up to half that money on adaptation.\nThe other question is over the loss and damage issue.\nRight now, the UN's response to this amounts to a single website for countries affected. \nEmerging economies will want to see this strengthened in the draft decision, with a new secretariat dedicated to the question - and most importantly a separate stream of funding. \nThe serious horse trading has already started.\nMatt McGrath has been covering climate change for the past 15 years, reporting from 10 COPs along the way.

      "text": "A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit.\nIt aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough.\nThe agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade:\nEmissions\nIt was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a greenhouse gas which causes climate change.\nThis is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a \"climate catastrophe\". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. \nCoal\nFor the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.  \nHowever, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to \"phase down\" rather than \"phase out\" coal after a late intervention by China and India. \nDeveloping countries\nThe agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy.\nThere's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (\u00a372bn) a year by 2020 was missed.\nWhile some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the \"start of a breakthrough\", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. \nFossil fuel subsidies\nWorld leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas.\nHowever, no firm dates have been set.\nA flurry of other announcements were made:\nThe world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, pledged to cooperate more over the next decade in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy.\nChina has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. \nLeaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - promised to stop deforestation by 2030.\nThis is seen as vital, as tress absorb vast amounts of CO2. \nSimilar initiatives haven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed.\nA scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030 was agreed by more than 100 countries. \nMethane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. \nThe big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.\nFinancial organisations controlling $130tn agreed to back \"clean\" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries.\nThe initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets.\nHowever, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. \nMost commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed.\nOnly a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. \nCOP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 Paris Agreement. \nSix years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming \"well below\" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.\nCOP stands for \"Conference of the Parties\", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. \nThe goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach net zero by mid-century.\nNext year's COP27 summit is in Egypt.\nTop image from Getty Images.

      "text": "The Duchess of Sussex has apologised to a court for making a misleading statement in her privacy case against the Mail on Sunday's publishers.\nThe Appeal Court heard she had asked an aide to pass on information to the authors of a biography - despite having earlier said she \"did not contribute\".\nMeghan said she had forgotten the events and had not intended to mislead.\nAssociated Newspapers is trying to overturn a ruling after it published a letter from the duchess to her father.\nMeghan, 40, won her privacy case against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday earlier this year, when the High Court found its publication of the letter was unlawful.\nAssociated Newspapers' legal team are now seeking to overturn this judgement at the Court of Appeal, disputing that this was simply a private and personal letter - and have argued that it was crafted with the \"possibility of public consumption\" in mind.\nA spokesman for the Sussexes had previously said the couple \"did not contribute\" to the Finding Freedom biography, written by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand.\nBut in new evidence heard on Wednesday, Jason Knauf, the couple's former communications secretary, said the book was \"discussed on a routine basis\" and \"discussed directly with the duchess multiple times in person and over email\".\nHe also discussed planning a meeting with the authors to provide background information and said Meghan had given him briefing points to share with them, including information on how she had \"very minimal contact\" with her half-siblings during her childhood.\nTwo of the arguments put forward by Meghan's lawyers in her battle with the Mail on Sunday would appear to have been compromised by these latest revelations. \nShe has always claimed that she did not co-operate with the authors of the book Finding Freedom, but she has now remembered that she provided \"briefing notes\" to one of her key aides who she knew was in touch with the book's authors.\nThe second strand of her case that would appear to have been undermined is her assertion that she had an \"expectation of privacy\" when she sent her handwritten letter to her estranged father Thomas Markle, which was partially published by the Mail on Sunday.\nIt has now emerged in previously unpublished texts that she accepted the possibility the letter might be leaked.\nShe had used language, she said in one text to her head of communications, that \"would pull at the heartstrings\".\nIt will now be for the Court of Appeal to decide whether to stand by or overturn the original finding that was in favour of the duchess.\nIn the second day of the appeal hearing, lawyers for Associated Newspapers had also challenged the extent to which the letter from Meghan to her father - at the centre of the case it is trying to overturn - was \"private\".\nThey quoted an exchange of text messages between the duchess and Mr Knauf in which Meghan said: \"Obviously everything I have drafted is with the understanding that it could be leaked, so I have been meticulous in my word choice.\"\nMr Knauf's evidence to the court also included emails with the Duke of Sussex, discussing the proposed meeting with the authors and the need to conceal any involvement by Prince Harry and Meghan.\nThe former aide said Prince Harry replied: \"I totally agree that we have to be able to say we didn't have anything to do with it.\n\"Equally, you giving the right context and background to them would help get some truths out there.\"\nIn a witness statement to the court the duchess said she accepted that her aide did provide information to the authors of the book with her knowledge but she said the \"extent of the information he shared is unknown to me\".\n\"When I approved the passage... I did not have the benefit of seeing these emails and I apologise to the court for the fact that I had not remembered these exchanges at the time,\" she said.\n\"I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the defendant or the court.\"\nThe duchess added that she would have been \"more than happy\" to refer to the exchanges with Mr Knauf if she had been aware of them at the time, but said they were \"a far cry from the very detailed personal information that the defendant alleges that I wanted or permitted to put into the public domain\".\nAnother reason the duchess gave for not discovering the emails between her and Mr Knauf sooner was that the disclosure stage of the litigation had not yet been reached, and in October last year her lawyers applied to adjourn the trial date as she was pregnant.\nShe said she was advised to avoid stress after a recent miscarriage, which came shortly after Associated Newspapers Limited indicated it wished to reveal the identities of her five friends who gave an interview to the US magazine People, in which they referred to her relationship with her father.\nMeghan said: \"I was in the first trimester of my third pregnancy at the time, having suffered a miscarriage a few months prior, and was feeling very unwell.\n\"My doctor advised me to avoid stress, particularly given the recent miscarriage days after the defendant threatened to break the confidentiality of the original 'sources' for the People magazine article, which resulted in my having to make an urgent application for an anonymity order.\n\"This was granted... but I found the process extremely stressful, and it took its toll physically and emotionally.\n\"I have at all times wanted to protect the privacy of those friends, while the defendant was, it seemed to me, doing everything it could to make this litigation as intrusive as possible.\" "

      "text": "Pupils will not be allowed school meals if they are more than a penny in debt, according to a letter to parents.\nThe cook at secondary Ysgol Dyffryn Nantlle, in Penygroes, Gwynedd, has been \"instructed not to give food to any child\" if debts are not cleared. \nStrategic head teacher Neil Foden's letter said the decision was due to a deficit in the school meals budget.\nGwynedd council said anyone \"having difficulty\" paying for school meals should get in touch.\nMr Foden's letter said he was \"very surprised to learn at the end of the last half term that there was an unexpected deficit in our school meals budget\". \n\"Closer inspection revealed that this was because a handful of pupils had run up debts totalling more than \u00a31,800.\"\nMr Foden said the debt had been run up by parents of some 70 pupils, with nine parents owing more than \u00a350 and three owing more than \u00a3100. \nHe added parents whose accounts were in debt were texted on a weekly basis and, ultimately, letters were sent, but in most cases there was no response and in several the debts increased.\nPupils from the most financially disadvantaged families are eligible for free school meals. \nFather-of-five Darren Owen, 43, said he was \"absolutely fuming\" after his wife showed him the letter they had received.\n\"I understand that people should pay their bills but, at the same time, people are struggling,\" he added.\n\"We owed 36p and we had a letter,\" said Mr Owen, from Penygroes, who has two children at the school.\n\"Surely they know who the parents are. Can't they help them?\"\nThe letter said all debts over \u00a310 would be transferred to the council and parents would be invoiced by the authority.\nAnd those with debts over 1p would receive a message from the Welsh medium school and asked to \"clear its debts and credit the system\" by 19 November.\nMr Foden's letter said the cook has been instructed not to give food to any child from 22 November if the \"debt has not been cleared, or, in the future, to children whose accounts do not have enough money to pay for lunch\".\n\"I am sorry that we have had to take these steps but the scale of the default means that something clearly has to be done,\" he wrote.\nMr Foden added: \"This was a matter we raised with the council as an issue of concern, and the approach was recommended by them, but is one that I support.\"\n\"The letter has gone out to all parents, not just those with debts. Those with the largest debts are being dealt with by the education authority. \nHe said that he has not had a single complaint from a parent and he is aware that this has been an issue in other schools in north Wales and they have adopted a similar zero tolerance approach. \n\"Any shortfall in the budget for school meals will have to be made up by the school which could mean fewer books and resources for all pupils  because of debts run up by a few.\"\nFootballer Marcus Rashford, who recently received an MBE for his drive to ensure no child in need went hungry during the pandemic, expressed concern about the letter on Twitter.\nA spokesperson for Gwynedd council said: \"In terms of payment of school meals, an online system has been introduced on which parents should ensure that sufficient funds are in place to pay for their child's school meals. \n\"The payment system offers some flexibility for parents who may for whatever reason not be able to make payment for a short period of time. Reminder messages are sent as required to ensure that no significant debts are incurred.\n\"We do not operate a blanket policy of refusing meals to pupils, and will discuss this matter directly with the school.\""

      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson is proposing to ban MPs from acting as paid political consultants.\nThe Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer has been calling for this to happen, saying the ban would help end \"dodgy lobbying\". \nThe planned shake up of the rules comes after Owen Paterson was found to have broken lobbying rules - which led to the issue of MPs' second jobs coming under scrutiny.  \nQuestions have been raised about the Conservative MP and former attorney general Sir Geoffrey Cox who earned around \u00a3900,000 last year through his work as a lawyer. \nYes, as long as they are not a minister.\nMore than 200 MPs have received earnings in the last year on top of their \u00a381,932 annual salary. The extra earnings range from \u00a350 a year to almost \u00a31m.\nMPs must publicly declare any additional income, along with gifts, donations and shareholdings over 15%.\nThose who leave government must consult the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments about any jobs they want to take up in the two years after leaving their post. They are banned from lobbying the government for two years.\nAll MPs are \"strictly forbidden\" from getting paid \"in return for advocating a particular matter\" in Parliament.\nHaving MPs with second professions has previously been seen as a good thing.\nIn 1995, the standards committee said that not having them would \"not serve the best interests of democracy\". It argued that Parliament needed \"a wide range of current experience which can contribute to its expertise\".\nThe current debate is mainly regarding MPs who earn money as consultants or advisers. Less controversial second jobs range from doctors and nurses, to referees and musicians.\nThe following MPs have registered income from consultancy work on the Register of Members' Financial Interests in the last year. There is no suggestion that any of the MPs listed below have broken any rules.\nMost of the MPs who have second jobs are not consultants.\nSome of the highest earners in the House of Commons are lawyers. \nSir Geoffrey Cox, who was attorney general during the height of the Brexit negotiations, has registered almost \u00a3900,000 in the last year for around 1,000 hours of legal work. \nThis included travelling to the British Virgin Islands (BVI) to advise on a corruption inquiry. He was there for a number of weeks, meaning he was carrying out his work as an MP - including voting - from the Caribbean.\nSir Geoffrey has been referred by Labour to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards for apparently taking part in a virtual meeting for a client while in his Commons office. \nThe Conservative MP has denied breaching the rules.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who is also a barrister, has made more than \u00a3100,000 for legal work, writing and making speeches since becoming an MP in 2015. There is no suggestion he has done anything against the rules, and Sir Keir says all the work was carried out before he became leader last year.\nA number of MPs are also employed as doctors and nurses. Some have continued to work on the NHS front line during the pandemic."

Andrew will be on that list.\"\nMr Graham-Dixon said he had intended to \"underline the utterly evil nature of Hitler\" during his speech but apologised if anyone found it distressing.\nOn Wednesday, John Cleese said he was \"blacklisting myself\" and cancelled a scheduled talk at Cambridge Union, as he had previously impersonated Hitler on Monty Python.\nFollowing Cleese's announcement, Mr Bradwell said: \"The Cambridge Union does not have a blacklist.\n\"I misspoke, and should not have used the term.\"\nThe society president, whose term ends in December, said he would still recommend to his successor \"that Andrew Graham-Dixon ought not be re-invited back\".\nHe added: \"Our speakers may say what they wish in our chamber, and absolutely never need to fear that anything they say will put them on a list of any sort.\"\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "The government needs to \"do better than we did last week\" in handling MPs' standards, Rishi Sunak has said.\nMinisters were forced to do a U-turn after widespread outrage over their attempt to block the punishment of Tory MP Owen Paterson for paid lobbying. \nThe chancellor told the BBC that correct processes should be \"followed to the letter\" in such cases.\nIt comes amid ongoing controversy over Tory MPs being paid large sums to do extra work. \nIt follows a report in the Times that former attorney-general Sir Geoffrey Cox conducted paid legal work from what appears to be his Commons office. \nThe Torridge and West Devon MP, who continues to practise as a barrister, was participating in a virtual hearing for an inquiry into alleged corruption in the British Virgin Islands.\nMPs can have second jobs, but are not allowed to use their Commons offices for personal benefit under their code of conduct. Sir Geoffrey denies any wrongdoing.\nSir Geoffrey, who has been referred to Parliament's standards commissioner, is reported to have made at least \u00a36m from his work as a barrister since entering Parliament in 2005, including almost \u00a3900,000 in the last year.\nHe has also been claiming \u00a322,000 a year in parliamentary expenses to cover the rent of a home in London while he also owns, and earns income from, another property in the city.\nIn Parliament's Register of Members' Financial Interests the MP lists \"joint ownership of a property\" worth more than \u00a3100,000. \nThe register shows that he has been earning over \u00a310,000 a year from letting out the property.\nThis practice is not against House of Commons rules as MPs, who represent constituencies outside of London are allowed to claim up to \u00a323,290 per year to cover accommodation costs.\nAsked about Sir Geoffrey's earnings, Mr Sunak told BBC economics editor Faisal Islam: \"I'm not familiar with specific details of that case. It wouldn't be right for me to comment on individuals.\n\"But we do have established independent parliamentary processes that govern all of these things and it's absolutely right that those are followed to the letter.\n\"Reflecting on all of these things over recent days, for us as a government, we need to do better than we did last week and we know that.\"\nThe code of conduct prohibits:\nMPs must also declare:\nAsked if the situation surrounding Sir Geoffrey was embarrassing for the UK as it hosts the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow, business minister Paul Scully said it was \"frustrating\" that it was \"taking away from the really important things at hand for our planet, let alone our country and government\".\nLord Evans, chairman of the committee on standards in public life, said that \"nothing that an MP does should get in the way of their ability to work in support of their constituents\".\n\"If somebody is spending a huge amount of their time on a second job, then they can't be maintaining support for their constituents,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, facing the world's media at COP26, said the UK was \"not remotely a corrupt country\" and that MPs who broke the rules should face \"appropriate sanctions\".\nMr Paterson, a former cabinet minister, resigned as an MP last week after he was found to have done this on behalf of two firms.\nMr Paterson denies breaking the rules, and says an investigation into his conduct by Parliament's standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, was conducted unfairly.\nLast week the government blocked a proposal to suspend him from the House of Commons for 30 days, instead suggesting that the system for investigating MPs should be reviewed.\nBut ministers U-turned the next day, amid fury from opposition MPs and some Tories.\nOn Thursday, Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government's botched attempt to rewrite the rules had been \"shameful\".\nHe added that his party would bring \"decency back to Downing Street\" and introduce \"strict rules around MPs' outside earnings\".\nOn Wednesday, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said the controversy had been a \"dark day\" for Parliament - and urged MPs from different parties to help \"move Parliament to a better place\"."

      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Queen Elizabeth II",
      "text": "The Queen will attend the upcoming Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph in central London, Buckingham Palace has confirmed. \nDoctors had advised the monarch to rest until mid-November after medical checks in hospital last month. \nThe palace said the Queen, 95, would view the service from the balcony of a Whitehall building as she has done in previous years.\nPrince Charles will lay a wreath on her behalf as has been custom since 2017.\nHowever, palace officials said she had been \"mindful of her doctors' recent advice\", deciding not to attend the Church of England's General Synod at Westminster Abbey next week.\nThey had previously said it was the Queen's \"firm intention\" to attend the annual Remembrance service to honour the country's war dead.\nEarlier today, the Queen's son and the heir to the throne, the Prince of Wales, was asked about his mother's health by a bystander during an engagement in Brixton, south London. Prince Charles gave him a pat on the arm, and appeared to say: \"She's alright, thank you.\"\nOn Tuesday, the Queen returned to Windsor Castle following a long-planned weekend away at her Sandringham home in Norfolk.\nWhen the cancellation of a fortnight of engagements was announced almost two weeks ago, the palace went out of its way to say it was the Queen's \"firm intention\" to be in Whitehall on Remembrance Sunday.\nIt is the most important day in her calendar - her tribute to those who gave the most extraordinary service, in war.\nIt can be a hard day, with a fair amount of standing at a cold time of year. We are so used to the Queen just getting on with the job that some may forget that she is 95 years old.\nBut she remains at the heart of the National Service of Remembrance, a day she has barely missed in almost seven decades as sovereign.\nHer withdrawal from the General Synod will have been been a difficult decision.\nThe palace stresses that it is as a result of recent medical advice. They have given no details, but it's not unreasonable to suspect that it may be the start of somewhat slower pace of engagements for the Queen.\nIt will be the Queen's first Remembrance Sunday since the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, in April.\nThe UK's longest-reigning monarch spent a night in hospital in October for preliminary medical checks, after cancelling an official visit to Northern Ireland. \nIt was her first overnight stay in a medical facility for eight years and was said to be for practical reasons.\nSince then she has undertaken a handful of public duties, including holding a Privy Council meeting with government ministers via video link on Wednesday.\nShe also recorded a video message for world leaders at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow after deciding not to attend in-person, held her weekly meeting with the prime minister via telephone, and spoke to ambassadors via video call. \nLast week, she was spotted driving her car near Windsor Castle, in an area where she is known to take her Corgi dogs out for walks. She was photographed in a headscarf and sunglasses behind the wheel of a green Jaguar estate car."

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Owen Paterson,COP26,Geoffrey Cox",
      "text": "When the organisers of one of the UK's most important international events in years conceived of the COP26 summit, the prime minister himself told colleagues he wanted to create the same kind of buzz as the happy 2012 Olympics summer.\nSo I'm not entirely sure they imagined Boris Johnson would end up, on a stage visible to the world's media, reassuring people that he \"genuinely believes\" the UK is not a corrupt country - moments after exhorting his counterparts to crack on with helping to tackle climate change. \nBut to absolutely no one's surprise, the PM's press conference after his brief return to the Glasgow conference was dominated by questions about the story that's been occupying so many minds in Westminster this week.  \nFour hundred miles wasn't enough to provide political distance for the prime minister from the mess in London SW1.  \nThat's partly because the allegations keep coming. \nOne of his former cabinet colleagues, Sir Geoffrey Cox, was revealed today not just to have been paid hundreds of thousands of pounds for legal work in the past few years, something which was widely known and had been declared publicly. \nBut footage of some of the MP's lucrative work, posted online seems to show him taking part in a session in his Commons office - he even apologises for leaving because the division bell rang.\nIn other words, he had to nip out to go and vote. \nThat took the accusations against him into a different territory, because while MPs are allowed to have second jobs, they are not allowed to use taxpayer-funded resources, or premises, to do so. \nThere's now likely to be an investigation about what he got up to, even though in his first public statement since claims about his sojourn in the Caribbean emerged, he denied breaking the rules.\nNor is there an easy exit from the tangle for the prime minister because unlike his colleagues, he has repeatedly refused to apologise for trying last week to rip up the rules that govern MPs' behaviour and protect another senior MP, Owen Paterson. \nHe was asked repeatedly if he was sorry on Monday, and refused to say so. \nUnshockingly, the same thing happened on Wednesday, which leaves the sore running. \nThe other awkward truth for Downing Street is that even though it's the behaviour of just a few dozen MPs that's being called into question, most of them are Conservatives, which is a fact they cannot avoid. \nAnd as we talked about on Monday, the prime minister's own handling of what's happening and his own attitude to the rules has infuriated many of his own colleagues, and that feeling has not gone. \nLast, by mentioning the allegations of corruption laid at the government's door, Boris Johnson has perhaps reinforced the criticism from the opposition, even if, by international standards, it is important to say the UK is nowhere near the top of the list. \n(According to one measure, by campaign group Transparency International, the UK is just outside the top 10 of the world's least corrupt countries.) \nForty-eight hours ago, Downing Street was hoping that the political explosion around Mr Paterson's case was fading. \nBut there's little sign of that, and if Boris Johnson's trip to Glasgow, was, as some suspected, partly an attempt to distract attention from the sleaze saga, it hasn't worked. \nPS Downing Street may be aware that all is not entirely well.  \nFile this under niche, but interesting to political obsessives. Ben Gascoigne, a long-standing staffer who quit Number 10 not so long ago, is returning as a new deputy chief of staff. \nHe worked with Boris Johnson for years before Number 10, with no particular allegiance to either Vote Leave or the more recent circle in Downing Street, who are often seen as close to Michael Gove or Carrie Johnson. \nHe's one of the few people in Westminster without visible enemies and his return this week is being seen by some as an acknowledgement that there have been gaps in the team in charge. \nIt's not entirely clear what it means for the existing pecking order in the Downing Street machine."

It also urged markets and grocery stores to increase food supplies and reduce prices. \nChina's north-east region was one of the areas particularly affected by rolling power outages in September this year, with rising costs contributing to a short supply of coal, said local media outlets. \nBut though the power crunch has eased, China's State Grid Corp had earlier still warned of an \"overall tight balance with partial gaps\" between power supply and demand through the winter.\nChina is highly dependent on coal for power, though Chinese leader Xi Jinping has pledged that his country will reach peak carbon emissions within nine years."

      "text": "Belarus's leader has threatened to cut off gas supplies to Europe if sanctions are imposed over an escalating migrant crisis at the country's western border.\nThousands of people, mostly from Iraq, Syria and Yemen, are at the border with Poland, enduring freezing conditions in the hope of crossing into the EU.\nEU officials have accused Belarus of provoking the crisis to undermine its security, an allegation it denies.\nIn retaliation, the EU is reportedly planning a fresh package of sanctions.\nBut on Thursday the country's long-time authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko warned: \"If they impose additional sanctions on us... we must respond\".\n\"We are heating Europe, and they are threatening us,\" he said, referring to a Russian gas pipeline that runs through Belarus and into the EU.\n\"And what if we halt natural gas supplies? Therefore, I would recommend the leadership of Poland, Lithuanians and other empty-headed people to think before speaking.\"\nHis comments raised fresh fears amid worsening natural gas shortages and rising prices in Europe. \nThe EU's economy commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said the 27-member bloc \"should not be intimidated\". Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya accused the president of \"bluffing\" over his gas ultimatum.\nBut Katja Yafimava, from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said Mr Lukashenko's threat should be taken seriously.\n\"If the EU pushes Belarus too hard, it may act on this threat,\" Dr Yafimava said, adding that this could push up gas prices across Europe, including in the UK.\nMore EU sanctions could be introduced as early as Monday. Possible measures include stopping international airlines carrying migrants from landing at the airport in the Belarusian capital Minsk. \nTurkey's national carrier Turkish Airlines has said it will be restricting the sale of tickets on some routes for citizens of Iraq, Syria and Yemen.\nIraq has said it is organising repatriation flights for Iraqi nationals from Belarus.\nThe EU is also reportedly considering sanctions against the Russian state airline Aeroflot for transporting migrants to Belarus, an allegation Aeroflot denies.\nBelarus' Belavia national carrier was in May banned from EU skies after a Ryanair flight was forced to divert to Minsk and a dissident journalist arrested.\nThe EU has accused Belarus of mounting a \"hybrid attack\" on its territory by encouraging thousands of people to cross into Poland.\nIt claims the country's leadership had enticed them with the false promise of easy entry to the EU as part of an \"inhuman, gangster-style approach\". \nMr Lukashenko, who was declared the winner after last year's discredited election, has repeatedly denied that Belarus is sending migrants over the border in revenge for existing EU sanctions.\nAnastasiia Stognei, BBC Russian, Moscow \nIt is hard to tell how realistic Alexander Lukashenko's threats are.  \nOn the one hand, he's a leader known for extravagant antics. In August last year, during mass protests opposing his re-election, he was pictured arriving at his Minsk residence by helicopter, wearing a flak jacket and carrying an assault rifle.  \nAt the same time, when Mr Lukashenko says that he won't stop at anything to protect his country's \"sovereignty and independence\", he might indeed try to implement his threats. \nNonetheless, shutting off the gas transit would be disastrous for Belarus' impoverished economy - though Mr Lukashenko has made economically irrational decisions before. \nBut it is also a question of international politics. The gas Mr Lukashenko is threatening to shut off is not his - it belongs to Russia. Any decisions about its fate will be taken in Moscow. And the Russian capital is a far more pragmatic place than Minsk.  \nMr Lukashenko has no incentives to argue with the Kremlin - after all, his authority is propped up by financial support from Russia.  \nJudging from what Moscow had said about the future of Nord Stream-2 pipeline, the question of gas supply to Europe can be used for leverage. But that is a question of supply, not of shutting it off altogether. \nIn other developments on Thursday:\nMeanwhile at the Polish border, stranded migrants threw rocks and attempted to break a razor wire fence.\nPoland has been accused of pushing people back across the border into Belarus, contrary to international rules of asylum.\n\"There's no way to escape,\" 33-year-old Shwan Kurd told the BBC, who described arriving in Belarus at the start of November. \n\"Poland won't let us in. We are so hungry. There's no water or food here. There are little children, old men and women,\" he said.\nThe migrants are mainly young men - but there are also women and children. They are camping in tents just inside Belarus, trapped between Polish guards on one side and Belarusian guards on the other.\nAt least seven people have died on the Polish side of the border, many from hypothermia in recent months."

      "text": "Firmus Energy is putting gas prices up by 38% from 3 December across its Ten Towns network area.\nThe company said rising global energy costs had \"forced\" its hand to put prices up for the third time this year.\nFirmus gas prices increased by 35% in October and by 18% earlier in the year.\nThe move will affect about 55,000 customers in the Ten Towns area, which includes Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Coleraine, Craigavon, Londonderry and Newry.\nThe Consumer Council said the increase would mean the annual bill of a typical household will rise by about \u00a3268 a year or \u00a3255 a year for those with a prepayment meter.\nFirmus customers in Greater Belfast and in the Gas to the West network area will not be affected by the tariff change.\nFirmus chairman Dr David Dobbin said: \"This is a not a Firmus issue but a challenge faced by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity all of whom, sooner or later, will have to further increase their prices to meet the huge upsurges which have taken place in wholesale energy costs.\n\"We know this is an unwelcome increase, which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable.\"\nFirmus said it would be introducing a support scheme to offer targeted help to those most in need, which would open at about the same time as the increase takes effect.\nWholesale costs make up 50% of customers' gas bills, which is why global increases have such a big effect locally.\nRising gas prices this year come in stark contrast to last year's low prices, which were described by one economist at the time as a \"consumer sweet-spot\".\nThe Utility Regulator has warned that high prices are likely to continue throughout the first half of next year.\nSome analysts have warned the volatility could last for between 18 to 36 months while others have suggested that the short answer is: we don't really know.\nOne thing most are agreed on is that while prices will come down they aren't likely to fall by as much as they have risen.\nThere are only two gas suppliers in Northern Ireland, which is why the Utility Regulator has to agree any price increase before it is passed on to customers.\nThe regulator caps suppliers' profits at 2%.\nNatasha Toman is a mum of four in Craigavon, County Armagh, and is a Firmus customer worried about what the price rise will mean for her.\n\"This is two price rises in such a short space of time - it's going to be a tough winter,\" she said.\n\"I topped my card up with the maximum amount, which is \u00a349, before 1 October so I would be getting it at the cheaper rate and now it is going up again.\n\"We don't have the luxury to change suppliers - there is only Firmus in this area.\n\"So you just have to get on with it and make the money stretch but it's tough going and it's going to be cutting in other areas as your home needs to be warm, particularly with four young children.\"\nThe Utility Regulator has capped the amount of profit gas providers can make at about 2%.\nBut it has no control over wholesale energy costs, which is one of the key reasons for the price rises.\nSo although a company's profit is capped that doesn't stop prices going up as the cost of commodities increases.\nThe actual cost of the energy makes up about half of our bills and the rest goes to the companies that manage the pipes and to cover other expenses.\nSo if the price of energy goes up the amount companies have to charge to make that 2% profit also increases.\nRead more: Why are energy bills going up?\nEddie Lynch, the commissioner for older people, said there was a \"real growing fear\" among elderly people about the increasing cost of household bills.\nMore than 50,000 pensioners in Northern Ireland are living in poverty, he said.\n\"What really concerns me is the perfect storm our older people are facing with higher energy bills and on top of that they have less opportunities to get out of the house because there are a lot less social activities since Covid hit,\" said the commissioner.\n\"That's how many of them actually managed their energy bills in the past - it was about getting out of the house so they didn't have to put the heat on.\n\"We're now at a stage where people have to spend much more time at home and are faced with huge bills coming down the line.\"\nUlster Unionist assembly member Andy Allen said the Stormont executive had to intervene \"swiftly and robustly\" to deal with the winter cost-of-living crisis.\nThis month he put a motion before the assembly asking members to create a winter energy emergency fund - it was passed unanimously.\n\"We welcome the confirmation from the minister for communities that she will be bidding for the entirety of the \u00a313.7m derived from UK Vulnerable Households fund in order to try and bring forward a support package,\" Mr Allen told BBC News NI.\n\"We need to see this in days, weeks - not months, not after Christmas. People on the ground need this now.\"\nHe said that charities were already having to support people in topping up gas and electric meters.\nThe Utility Regulator, which regulates the suppliers in the market, had warned that substantial rises in the price of gas were coming.\nIts chief executive John French said: \"Unfortunately over the last six months we have seen unparalleled increases in the cost of wholesale energy at a global level.\n\"If wholesale prices begin to reduce our system of regulation in Northern Ireland allows us to act to make sure that reductions are fully passed onto consumers as quickly as possible.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in MLA Caoimhe Archibald said the UK government should remove VAT\u00a0on energy bills, cutting the costs by 5%.\nDemocratic Unionist Party MP Carla Lockhart said anyone who was struggling with their bills should check whether they were eligible for the universal credit benefit."

      "text": "The head electrician on the film set where Alec Baldwin accidentally shot dead cinematographer Halyna Hutchins last month is suing the actor and other crew members over the incident.\nSerge Svetnoy, a friend of Hutchins, is alleging negligence that resulted in \"severe emotional distress\". He says the bullet narrowly missed him.\nThe authorities are still investigating the 21 October incident in New Mexico.  \nNo criminal charges have been brought against anyone.\nAssistant director Dave Halls has told investigators he failed to check all the rounds in the gun before handing it over to Mr Baldwin, according to a court document.\nMr Halls reportedly called out \"cold gun\" as he gave it to the actor, meaning he believed it to be safe.\nA film director was also injured in the shooting on the set of the Western film Rust.\nMr Svetnoy's civil lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles. It names nearly two dozen defendants.\nDuring a news conference on Wednesday, Mr Svetnoy, 63, said he had seen guns sitting unattended in the dirt a few days before the fatal shooting, adding that he had warned the people responsible for them. \nHis lawsuit alleges that on the day of the shooting he \"felt a strange and terrifying whoosh of what felt like pressurised air\", when the gun went off.  He was struck by \"discharge materials from the blast\". \nAt the news conference, Mr Svetnoy said he had kneeled down to try to help Ms Hutchins.\nNeither Mr Baldwin, 63, nor other defendants named in the lawsuit have so far publicly commented on the latest developments.\nMeanwhile, a lawyer for the film's armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was responsible for the guns and ammunition on set, issued a statement on Wednesday reiterating that she did not know how a live round came to be there.\n\"We are asking for a full and complete investigation of all of the facts, including the live rounds themselves, how they ended up in the 'dummies' box, and who put them in there,\" attorney Jason Bowles said.\n\"We are convinced that this was sabotage and Hannah is being framed. We believe that the scene was tampered with as well before the police arrived.\"\nHowever, in an interview on Wednesday, Santa Fe county district attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said investigators \"do not have any proof\" of sabotage.\nAsked on ABC TV's Good Morning America whether she thought it was a possibility, she replied: \"No.\"\nThe question of how live rounds got on set \"will be one of the most important factors\" when deciding whether to bring charges, she added."

      "tags": "Foreign & Commonwealth Office,Iran nuclear deal,James Cleverly,Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe case",
      "text": "The UK has urged Iran to back a deal that would revive the international agreement curbing the country's nuclear activities, at a meeting in London. \nUnder the original 2015 deal, Iran said it would curb its nuclear ambitions in return for other countries lifting economic sanctions.\nThe agreement collapsed when the US pulled out in 2018, but President Joe Biden has said it could rejoin.\nTalks are set to resume in Vienna on 29 November after a four-month hiatus. \nAhead of those talks, Iran's deputy foreign minister and lead negotiator, Ali Bagheri Kani, came to the UK Foreign Office to set out his country's demands.\nAt the meeting, Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly told his counterpart that Iran should take the opportunity of the new talks to conclude a deal that he said was already on table. \nThe Iranians said merely the nuclear deal was discussed, without noting any specifics. \nThey want the focus of the Vienna negotiations to be on lifting sanctions, and getting guarantees from the United States that it will not pull out of the deal again. \nBut Western countries want the talks to pick up where they left off in June, including on how to tackle Iran's growing stockpile of enriched uranium. \nThe potential deal being discussed in June centred on lifting sanctions against Iran, while also curbing its nuclear programme. \nWhat was still to be agreed was which sanctions, which nuclear activities, in what order and when. \nToday's meetings at the Foreign Office were a chance for Iran to set out its stall ahead of crucial talks later this month. \nThere is not a huge upswelling of optimism that these new talks in Vienna will succeed. \nIran has a new hardline government since the election of new president Ebrahim Raisi.\nJoe Biden is under political pressure in the United States not to concede too much.\nAnd the more time passes, the value of resuming the nuclear deal diminishes - because it contains many time limited provisions. \nIran has always insisted its nuclear programme is peaceful. But there are suspicions, particularly in Israel, that the country wants to develop a nuclear bomb.\nIsrael opposes the deal, and earlier it warned it was \"speeding up its plans\" to deal with what it called \"Iran's nuclear threat\".\nHostilities between the two countries have escalated recently, with Iran blaming Israel for the assassination of its top nuclear scientist last year and an attack on one of its uranium enrichment plants in April. \nThe UK government says Mr Cleverly also raised the case of British nationals detained by Iran with the country's deputy foreign minister, including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.\nThe 43-year-old mother-of-one from London has been held in Iran for five years on spying charges, which she has always denied.\nHer husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has been holding a hunger strike outside the Foreign Office for over a fortnight to put pressure on the government to do more to secure her release.\nThe Foreign Office says Mr Cleverly met Mr Ratcliffe on Thursday \"to reaffirm our commitment\" to reuniting Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe with her family.\nAfter the meeting, Mr Ratcliffe told reporters the meeting had been \"depressing\", and he didn't have \"any hopes\" of a breakthrough.\n\"I don't feel they moved forwards today,\" he added.\n\"It may be that there are parts of the conversation I am not privy to, and there are parts the minister shares down the line.\""

This was the stark reality for Manon and Chris.\nThe couple spent \u00a314,000 on fertility treatment to conceive a second child.\n\"Secondary infertility is when you've experienced a natural pregnancy and you struggle to conceive a second,\" said Manon.\nThe condition affects about 5% of the UK population, the British Fertility Society said.\nAnd Manon, 33, from Bala, Gwynedd, said there needs to be more support for parents like them.\n\"It's really hard to cope with, and frustrating,\" she said.\n\"And guilt comes in as well, when you have a child already, because you feel guilty that you can't provide them with a sibling.\"\nThe couple have been trying to conceive for the last seven years, enduring miscarriage, and IVF.\nManon said: \"You're paying so much for it, you think it is sure to work.\n\"IVF is not an easy road at all to take. I hadn't read up on it, as I should have really, I had no idea what was in front of us.\"\n\"There's a stigma around secondary infertility,\" she said.\n\"People are afraid of talking about it, because of that fear that people will judge them.\"\nChris said: \"I'm a quiet person generally and find it hard to talk about anything, let alone something as personal as infertility.\n\"I feel I have to be strong for her, as she had struggled with her mental health after the first round of IVF.\n\"It was hard. Seeing your wife going through IVF and the effect the medication was having on her body.\"\nManon said she went into \"quite a dark place\" after the first round of IVF.\n\"Secondary infertility takes a toll on your mental health, your physical health, your emotional health,\" she said.\n\"I struggled with depression and anxiety and I'm just lucky to have the most amazing husband and family and friends, that were with us every step of the way.\"\nEmbarking on a second round of IVF treatment last year, Manon was more prepared.\nShe had found support, especially from online communities willing to talk about secondary fertility and share their own experiences.\n\"I found great comfort in community groups and pages on Facebook and Instagram,\" she said.\n\"Secondary infertility groups where I could be myself and be open and honest with them, and tell them exactly how I felt going through secondary infertility.\nThe couple believe those in a similar position to them should be receiving more help.\n\"I find the fact that couples suffering from secondary infertility have to pay \u00a37,000 for one round of IVF is absurd,\" said Manon.\n\"Why can't they offer a round for half the price if the first round doesn't work? \n\"Not everyone in a financially stable position has IVF as an option, which means that those couples are completely ruled out.\"\nThe criteria for infertility and IVF treatment has been developed by the Welsh government's specialised health services.\nNHS treatment is only available to couples where one partner has no biological or adopted children.\nA spokesman said the issue of secondary infertility had not been raised as a matter in the Senedd in recent years.\nBut after two failed IVF rounds themselves, Manon and Chris have decided they will not be going for a third attempt.\nThey have considered adoption, but for now are more focused on enjoying life as a family of three.\n\"We've started to accept that we're going to have one child, and we're fine with that,\" added Manon. \n\"Because, to be honest, we couldn't ask for a more special child than Efa, she is a special little girl and we are very proud of her every day.\""

      "text": "Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has sold around $5bn (\u00a33.7bn) of shares in the electric carmaker.\nIt comes days after he asked his 63 million Twitter followers whether he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla.\nThe company's shares fell by around 16% in the two days after the poll came out in favour of him selling shares, before regaining some ground on Wednesday.\nTesla is the world's most valuable carmaker, with a stock market valuation of more than $1tn.\nMr Musk's trust sold almost 3.6 million shares in Tesla, worth around $4bn.\nHe also sold another 934,000 shares for about $1.1bn after exercising options to acquire nearly 2.2 million shares, according to filings with the US stock market regulator.\nThe documents showed that the sale of about a fifth of the shares was made based on a pre-arranged trading plan set up in September, long before Mr Musk's social media posts at the weekend about selling some of his shares.\nHowever, the regulatory filings also showed that the sale of the remainder of the shares had not been scheduled.\nMr Musk has highlighted that he is not paid in cash by Tesla and only has stock. \nPart of the latest transaction saw him exercising stock options that he was awarded as part of his pay package in 2012, which is due to expire in August next year.\nMr Musk has one option to buy 22.86 million Tesla shares at $6.24 each, but if he doesn't exercise the stock option then the shares would become worthless after the expiry date.\nSuch transactions trigger income taxes, which are typically settled using money raised from immediately selling some of the newly acquired shares.\nHis move also comes as US Democrats have proposed a so-called \"billionaires tax\", which could the richest taxed on \"unrealised gains\" even if they do not sell any of their stock.\n\"Elon Musk doesn't take a salary, he's paid in big chunks of stock. At some point in time you have to take some of that concentration down,\" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York, told Reuters.\n\"This is not novel. It just gets more attention because it's such a high market-cap type, attention grabbing kind of company.\"\nBefore selling some of his shares, Mr Musk owned a 23% stake in Tesla.\nThe shares he sold equate to about 3% of Musk's total holdings in the carmaker, though it has not been confirmed if the sale was related to his weekend Twitter poll, or if he intends to stagger further sales.\nOn Saturday, Mr Musk posted a poll asking his followers to vote on whether he should sell part of his stake in Tesla to meet his tax obligations.\n\"Much is made lately of unrealised gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock,\" he tweeted. \n\"I will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes.\"\nThe poll attracted more than 3.5 million votes, with nearly 58% voting in favour of the share sale, but Mr Musk has been silent regarding any share sales since the poll.\nIt was Mr Musk's first sale of shares since 2016, when he last exercised stock options. At the time he also sold some of the shares to cover an income tax bill of close to $600m.\n\"The reason that we're seeing stock rebound is because there does seem to be a method in his madness,\" AJ Bell analyst Danni Hewson said.\n\"It's about making sure that the market understands this isn't something done on a whim, or because his Twitter followers told him he should. He's had his decision already made, rubber stamped.\"\nMr Musk is the world's richest person, with a fortune estimated to be more than $280bn."

      "tags": "Belarus border crisis,Belarus,European Union,Poland,Migration",
      "text": "For almost two weeks, Shwan Kurd has been stuck in limbo. The 33-year-old from Iraq is one of thousands of migrants currently stranded at the Belarus-Poland border.\nThey have been caught up in a political tussle between the European Union and Belarus's leader, Alexander Lukashenko. He has been accused of funnelling migrants through Belarus to destabilise EU nations in revenge for sanctions - something his government denies.\nCold, hungry and exhausted, Mr Kurd is convinced Poland will let him cross the border, allowing him to seek a new life of opportunities in the EU.\nBetween him and that life stands a forbidding barbed-wire fence and hundreds of Polish soldiers. In a landscape reminiscent of a war zone, the crisis on the Poland-Belarus border has reached a chaotic stalemate.\n\"We're still at the border line,\" Mr Kurd told the BBC on Thursday. \"There are so many Polish soldiers.\"\nThose soldiers have markedly increased in number since a large group of migrants attempted to cross the border on Monday. The group came from the capital, Minsk, and converged on a crossing at Kuznica, near Grodno in north-west Belarus.\nThere, some migrants tried to force their way through Poland's barrier, using tools to cut the barbed wire. \nPoland accused Belarusian border guards of helping them, calling it a major provocation. While some migrants managed to slip through, most did not, leaving them with few options.\nPoland won't let them cross but, according to some migrants, nor will Belarusian border guards allow them to return to Minsk either. Unsure about where to turn next, many of the migrants have settled in a make-shift camp near the Kuznica crossing.\nMr Kurd spoke to us from the camp, where he had been sleeping for days in freezing overnight temperatures, metres from Poland's barbed-wire fence.\n\"We need supplies, there are children here. No food has been given to us,\" Mr Kurd said.\nJournalists and aid groups say they have not been able to access the area since Poland declared a state of emergency on its border with Belarus in September. The measure gave Poland powers to restrict the movement of people along the frontier.\nAras Nader, a British-Iraq, has been working as an interpreter for Grupa Granica, a network of Polish NGOs. He told the BBC he attempted to reach the border recently to find his wife and children, who were on the Belarusian side.\n\"I begged the police because my family is stuck. I told them on the phone, they are hungry, they don't have anything,\" he said. \n\"I just asked them to let me through with food and water. But they didn't let me and asked me to pay a fine.\"\nHis family eventually managed to get through the border despite the strict controls, which haven't stopped migrants arriving in ever-greater numbers.\nMr Kurd said he flew to Minsk from the Iraqi capital Baghdad at the start of November. \nHe said there was no work for him in his country, which has been ripped apart by war in recent decades and has an economy that's heavily dependent on oil.\n\"We have nothing. There's no life in our country,\" he said. \"We hope to arrive and enjoy life, that's all. We want to do our jobs. We have so many good people - doctors, scientists, teachers.\"\nMr Kurd may soon be followed by many others. Some 300km (186 miles) from the Polish border in Minsk, many more migrants are preparing to tread the same uncertain path.\nBy Tuesday morning, about 300 mostly Iraqi migrants had gathered in Minsk's central square.\nBBC journalist Will Vernon spoke to several of them in the square. Their stories were all the same. They were waiting, they said, to go to the Polish border - a four-hour drive away, at least.\nThey said they had paid for a visa and flights as part of a package costing several thousand dollars.\nMazyar and his friends, from Iraq, said they paid about $3,000-4,000 (\u00a32,200-2,900). \"We want to get to Germany or the UK,\" he said.\nOthers on the square alleged they had been beaten and badly treated by Belarus police officers and soldiers, who had tried to force them towards neighbouring Lithuania instead of Poland.\nOne man said he had been sleeping on the street, braving Minsk's sub-zero night-time temperatures.\nThe EU has accused Belarus of enticing these migrants with the false promise of easy entry to its member states. They are flown in and pushed towards the border by Belarusian forces as part of an \"inhuman, gangster-style approach\", the EU has alleged.\nThis week, as the crisis reached fever pitch, the EU listed some 20 countries from which migrants have flown into Minsk, mainly on tourist visas. Many have come from countries in Asia and the Middle East, particularly Iraq.\nEarlier this year, the BBC followed the journey of one group from Iraq to the EU via Belarus. They bought their visas and flights from a travel agency in Iraq before paying smugglers to take them to the border.\nThey made it to EU countries, but others are not so fortunate.\nOn the Belarusian side of the border, the mood flickers between hope and desperation. For Mr Kurd, the new life he covets is so close, yet so far.\n\"So many people's lives are in danger if we don't arrive,\" Mr Kurd said.\n\"So many little children and old people. Some people are sick, some people can't walk. But there are no supplies and no medicine here. Every night, the temperature is under zero. It's so, so cold.\""

On Monday 13 February, McNeill put him on a bus, paid his fare and left him to his fate. \nBlake travelled on two buses and was seen slumping down at a bus stop.\nA bus driver raised the alarm but despite desperate attempts to save his life, the teenager died in Edinburgh's Sick Kids Hospital.\nLord Weir said it was clear McNeill was a \"very high risk of causing sexual harm to children\".\n\"The nature and circumstances of the crime you were found to have committed, coupled with your record, the many risk factors identified, and the lack of any discernible protective factors, are such as to satisfy me that there is a likelihood that, if at liberty, you will seriously endanger the lives, or the physical or psychological well-being, of members of the public at large,\" he added.

      "text": "A man who murdered an elderly Jewish woman in her Paris apartment has been sentenced to life in prison.\nYacine Mihoub, 32, was convicted of stabbing 85-year-old Mireille Knoll 11 times and then setting her body alight during a botched robbery in March 2018.\nHer killing sparked public outcry over anti-Semitism in France.\nKnoll, who had narrowly escaped a round-up of Parisian Jews to Nazi death camps during World War Two, was suffering from Parkinson's disease.\nAn accomplice, Alex Carrimbacus, 25, was jailed for 15 years for robbery, motivated by anti-Semitism.\nKnoll lived next door to Mihoub's mother, and the court heard that she had acted as a surrogate grandmother to her killer when he was a child. \nThe court said the attack was fuelled by a \"context of anti-Semitism\" and \"prejudices\" about the purported wealth of Jewish people. This led Mihoub to believe Knoll had \"hidden treasures\" in her home.\nCarrimbacus claimed he heard Mihoub shout \"Allahu Akbar\", meaning \"God is greatest\", while stabbing her. \nBoth Mihoub and Carrimbacus blamed each other for the murder.\nKnoll's murder shocked France's Jewish community and prompted anger over anti-Semitism in the country.\nTens of thousands of people, including government ministers, took part in a silent march in memory of Knoll.  \nThe trial took place against a backdrop of rising violent acts against French Jews perpetrated by radical Islamists.\nKnoll's death came just a year after Sarah Halimi, a 65-year-old Jewish woman, was thrown to her death from her Paris apartment by a man shouting \"Allahu Akbar\".\nHer killer, Kobili Traor\u00e9, was deemed not criminally responsible in April because his mind was affected by regular consumption of cannabis."

      "text": "Re-flooding coastal wetlands could provide an opportunity to \"work with nature\" and use sea level rise to fight climate change, scientists say. \nAn ongoing study of a coastal marsh in Scotland has shown the potential to lock carbon emissions into mud. \nA stretch of the Skinflats RSPB reserve near Falkirk was restored in 2018. \n\"It's now pretty much indistinguishable from the saltmarsh that's been here for hundreds of years,\" said the RSPB's Allison Leonard.\n\"We carried out lots of surveys and studies before we did it, but then when it actually came to breaching the seawall, it's really quite simple. You get a digger and just go for it.\"\nOnce the water found its way in, Ms Leonard explained \"nature just did its thing\".  \n\"We're really seeing the wildlife respond,\" she said. \nProf William Austin from the University of St Andrews, who has been studying the site's natural restoration explained that \"allowing the sea to come back in\" created habitat and an opportunity to store what is known as blue carbon.  \n\"That's the carbon stored in plants and soils,\" he explained. \"These [saltmarshes] are places that will build up stores of carbon that would otherwise be in the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas.\n\"We can count the plant species here, we can count the animals, we can look at the wading birds that start to come in and use the site,\" he told BBC News. \n\"But as well as nature positive changes, we're starting to see an accumulation in the soil of organic material that is rich in carbon. This is why these habitats are such great interest to us.\"\nAs the COP26 climate summit draws to a conclusion in Glasgow, he suggested that the protection, restoration and even the creation of new wetland habitat could be a valuable part of Scotland's efforts to reach net-zero emissions. \n\"These sites take in some of this greenhouse gas for us. So we need to work with nature to achieve that balance of net zero,\" he said. \"But of course, we have to reduce our emissions in the meantime.\"\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"

      "text": "Climate activists say they have deflated tyres on \"luxury\" vehicles parked in Glasgow, to raise awareness of carbon emissions during COP26.\nA number of SUVs in the city's upmarket West End were left with flyers that branded them a \"climate violation\".\nPolice Scotland said it was aware of the incidents and it had upped patrols in the area.\nThousands of campaigners travelled to Glasgow in recent weeks for the UN climate summit, which ends on Friday.\nPharmacist Jamie MacConnacher discovered the two front tyres of his Land Rover had been flattened on Thursday morning.\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme  that several other cars in the area had been targeted.\nHe said: \"I don't think targeting individuals that have these vehicles is the right way to do it. They don't know what the reason for somebody having that car is.\"\nHe added: \"I understand that there is a need for change, I'm totally for that. I would have an electric car but it's the logistics in the west end of Glasgow. \n\"There's nowhere to charge outside your flat so it just doesn't work for me.\"\nA flyer left on Mr MacConnacher's vehicle said it was \"driving the climate breakdown\", particularly in poor countries.\nThe activist group Tyred of SUVs later claimed responsibility, saying they had deflated tyres of around 60 vehicles in the \"rich neighbourhood\".\nThe group said: \"If 4x4 drivers were a nation, they'd be the seventh biggest polluters on the planet. If the 1% won't take responsibility for the climate destruction they wreak, we'll make them.\" \nTyred of SUVs member, Fin, told BBC Radio Scotland: \"We feel we need to do this because we need to point to the people who are responsible - rich people in the global north.\n\"This is a minor inconvenience that is not going to disrupt them in a huge way. What is really going to disrupt people's lives and kill them is the climate crisis caused by rich people -  basically SUV owners.\"\nShe added: \"The importance of this message made it necessary and warranted this disruption.\"\nMr MacConnacher, who drives 25 miles to Aberfoyle, Stirlingshire, each day for work, said he needs a large car as he often faces \"challenging conditions\" on the road in winter.\nOn Thursday he was 45 minutes late for work as he had access to a tyre pump - but said there could have been consequences for his patients.\n\"It's not something that's going to cost me any money, but it's still tampering with someone else's vehicle,\" he added.\n\"I have to get to my patients - fortunately I wasn't that late for work but if I hadn't had a pump I could have been hours late.\n\"The knock-on effect of that could be quite significant. We could have a lot of antibiotics needing given out, we've got palliative care patients that need access to care at end of life.\"\nPolice Scotland said: \"We are aware of these incidents and there will increased patrols in the  area to provide reassurance to local residents.\""

      "text": "Police officers have \"routinely\" taken people to hospital in the back of police vehicles because an ambulance was unavailable, it has been claimed.\nThe Scottish Police Federation (SPF) said officers were having to help relieve strain on under-pressure ambulance crews.\nIt has provided records to Scottish social affairs magazine, 1919, on about 30 incidents in the past three months.\nThe Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) has denied the claims.\nLast month, the military was called in to help drive ambulances in a bid to ease the \"unprecedented\" pressure on the NHS.\nSAS chief executive Pauline Howie said at the time the impact of Covid had placed the service at its \"highest level of escalation\".\nThe Scottish Police Federation said police reports show that officers stepped in to help when: \nAnother report records that a single paramedic dealing with an injured man asked police to drive his vehicles so he could continue treating the patient en route to hospital. \nAnd in another incident a family concerned about a relative contacted their GP and ambulance service, but were told to call the police instead. Officers took him to hospital. \nGordon Forsyth, of the SPF, said: \"Cops out there are taking people to hospital in the back of police cars simply because the ambulance is going to be hours, or there isn't anybody suitable to leave the person with and stand down.\n\"I've got a list of 30-odd examples, various things where the cops have been sent to calls because an ambulance hasn't been available, or having to wait for a significant period of time for an ambulance to get there.\"\nIn a statement to 1919, the ambulance service said police officers were only requested to attend cardiac arrest calls as a first response in the north of Scotland and they were immediately backed up by an ambulance resource.\nSAS said: \"In no other situation would police officers attend ambulance 999 calls or be asked to transport patients to hospital\".\nIn a statement to BBC Scotland, Police Scotland referred to comments made by Chief Constable Iain Livingstone to a meeting of the Scottish Police Authority Board last week.\nMr Livingstone said policing was \"so often the service of first and last resort\" and officers would \"never step away from those who are in crisis\".\nHe said: \"I recognise the pressures which exist across many other services, agencies and sectors. We know that when the health service, local authorities and other key partners come under significant strain, demand is diverted to policing. \n\"Additionally, delays in service provision by other agencies also mean officers and staff can spend longer dealing with an incident than would otherwise be the case.\n\"Covid is still with us and the global pandemic continues to put the National Health Service under critical pressure.\""

      "tags": "Wisconsin,United States",
      "text": "A US teenager charged with shooting three people during civil unrest on the streets of Wisconsin last year has taken the stand in his own defence.\nKyle Rittenhouse broke down in tears, forcing a brief recess, as he described how he was \"cornered\" by several men and acted in self-defence.\nProsecutors say Mr Rittenhouse, 18, was looking for trouble that night.\nThe teen has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.\nBut the entire case was thrown into jeopardy on Wednesday when the defence called for a mistrial after the judge angrily accused the prosecution of improper questions to the defendant.\nMr Rittenhouse is facing counts of reckless, intentional and attempted homicide after he shot two men dead and wounded another in the city of Kenosha on 25 August 2020.\nRiots had erupted on the streets of the city two days earlier, after police shot a black man, Jacob Blake. Mr Rittenhouse had travelled to the city from his home in Illinois and, with a semi-automatic rifle in tow, he said he sought to help protect property from unrest on the streets.\nTaking the stand in a risky move for any defendant in a murder trial, Mr Rittenhouse said: \"I didn't do anything wrong. I defended myself.\"\nDescribing scenes of chaos to the jury, he said he had heard people shouting \"get him\". \nVideo evidence shows the gun-toting teen shouting out \"friendly, friendly, friendly\" to the crowd.\n\"The person that attacked me first threatened to kill me,\" he said of Joseph Rosenbaum, the first person he shot. He told the jury he believed Mr Rosenbaum was carrying a chain with him at one point, though he later learned it was a plastic bag. \nThe judge called for a break after Mr Rittenhouse burst into tears as he began to describe to the jury the moments before the fatal shootings. His mother was also seen sobbing in the gallery.\nUpon his return to the stand, the teen said he had nowhere to run at the time, later adding: \"I didn't intend to kill. I intended to stop the person who was trying to kill me and trying to steal my gun.\"\nMr Rittenhouse said he shot and killed Mr Rosenbaum after Mr Rosenbaum laid a hand on his rifle.\nVideo from the scene shows the teen fall to the ground as he is chased. Mr Rittenhouse said it led him to fear for his life even more, as several men converged upon him.\nHe testified that Anthony Huber, the second person shot by Mr Rittenhouse, hit him with his skateboard and also tried to grab his rifle.\nHe said Gaige Grosskreutz, the man he wounded in the arm, had approached him with a pistol pointed at his head.\nMr Grosskreutz, the third person to be shot by Mr Rittenhouse, testified this week he thought Mr Rittenhouse was an \"active shooter\" when he drew his own gun and advanced on him.\n\"I brought the gun for protection but I didn't think I would have to use the gun in defending myself,\" Mr Rittenhouse responded.\nProsecutors argue that Mr Rittenhouse inserted himself into the situation and intended to kill everyone he shot that evening.\nIn a testy cross-examination, prosecutor Thomas Binger contested the teen's right to possess a rifle and sought to cast doubt on the extent of his medical training.\nMr Binger - the assistant district attorney of Kenosha - also questioned the sincerity of Mr Rittenhouse's tears, making specific reference to a social media post in which Mr Rittenhouse said he was \"just trying to be famous\" and photos prosecutors say show him posing with far-right provocateurs.\nBut Mr Binger's line of questioning drew several furious reprimands from Judge Bruce Schroeder, who accused him of violating pre-trial rulings on introducing evidence not relevant to the trial.\n\"You're an experienced trial lawyer,\" yelled the judge. \"I don't know what you're up to.\"\nThe legal teams continued to butt heads into the afternoon, as prosecutors continued to raise issues with Mr Rittenhouse's testimony and accused him of changing his story to fit a narrative.\nDefence attorneys argued \"prosecutorial overreaching\" and called for a mistrial with prejudice.\nA successful motion for mistrial with prejudice cannot be appealed by prosecutors. \nJudge Schroeder did not rule on the motion on Wednesday, but agreed to take it \"under advisement\" based on the future behaviour of the prosecution team.\nLead attorney Corey Chirafasi even suggested that prosecutors may have been angling for the mistrial because the case was \"going badly\" for them.\nMr Rittenhouse said on the stand he was in town because he had seen the destruction caused by the unrest. In particular, he mentioned seeing on social media that a police officer had a brick thrown at his head.\nHe detailed how he had joined up with other armed civilians to protect a series of local car dealerships, adding the owner \"was happy we were there\".\nBefore the shootings, Mr Rittenhouse claimed, he provided medical assistance to at least two people. He said he had worked as a firefighter and first responder cadet in his hometown, so he was able to administer first aid and basic emergency care.\nHe also testified that he and others had been moving around to put out fires and clean up graffiti.\nThe state rested its case on Tuesday. Mr Rittenhouse is the third witness on the stand for the defence and his testimony may be pivotal in deciding his fate."

      "tags": "Economics,GDP,Economic growth,UK economy,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "UK economic growth slowed between July and September as supply chain problems hindered the recovery, latest official figures show.\nThe Office for National Statistics said consumer spending increased as Britain continued to emerge from lockdown.\nBut that was offset by falls in other areas of the economy, leaving growth for the three months at 1.3%.\nIt means the economy is 2.1% smaller than in the final three months of 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic hit.\nSterling fell to its lowest level of 2021 against the dollar on Thursday following the news.\nGrant Fitzner, ONS chief economist, said service growth expanded, helped by house buyers rushing to do deals before the end of the stamp duty holiday. \n\"However, these were partially offset by falls in both the manufacture and sale of cars.\n\"Notably, business investment remained well down on pre-pandemic levels in the three months to September,\" he said.\nGrowth slowed significantly from a 5.5% rise recorded between April and June when many Covid restrictions were lifted.\nThe ONS said that the UK expanded by less than it initially thought in July and August, leading them to revise down growth figures for both months. \n\"What happened earlier in July and August was that we had the pingdemic.\" said Sarah Hewin, head of research for Europe and the Americas at Standard Chartered. \"And that ended up essentially holding the economy flat.\" \nIn contrast, the economy grew by 0.6% during September. \nChancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures showed his economic policies were working.\n\"The economy continues to recover from Covid and thanks to schemes like furlough, the unemployment rate has fallen for eight months in a row and we're forecast to have the fastest growth in the G7 this year,\" he said.\nKirsty Davies-Chinnok, from Professional Polishing Services (PPS), told the BBC that the company, which polishes metals such as stainless steel and aluminium, had been \"very busy\" throughout 2021 so far.\n\"We have had some bespoke projects, but we have seen general work has increased,\" she said.\nThe managing director said the manufacturing industry \"didn't really stop through most of 2020 and it has continued to increase\".\nIt has led to PPS deciding to invest further in its operations despite initially thinking it was \"too risky\" due to the pandemic, Ms Davies-Chinnok added.\nHowever, rising material and supply costs had led to the firm increasing its prices to customers.\n\"We have had three price increases this year, which is unheard of,\" said Ms Davies-Chinnok. \"But we can't finance doing business with our customers when our suppliers are increasing their costs to us.\"\nShe added that PPS, which is very energy intensive business, was \"incredibly lucky\" by the fact it had renewed its energy contracts last December, before wholesale gas prices surged worldwide.\nLonger term, Ms Davies-Chinnok said the biggest threat to her sector \"has to be climate change\" and said industry and government had to look at ways to make greener energy.\nBusiness leaders expressed caution about the outlook, with Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, saying the data points to the UK economy \"only likely to return to its pre-pandemic level next year, behind many of our international competitors\". \n\"Although monthly output rebounded through the quarter from July's contraction this is more likely to reflect a temporary boost from restrictions easing, rather than a meaningful improvement in the UK's underlying growth trajectory,\" he said.\nThe ONS highlighted the impact of supply chain problems, which businesses have been struggling with for several months as they adjust to labour shortages and disruption at container ports.\nStocks held by manufacturers fell during the July-to-September quarter, the ONS said. And a slowdown in new UK car sales was in large part due to a global shortage of microchips. The ONS also noted that retailers were reporting \"lower than usual\" stock for the time of year.\nAs expected, the UK economic rebound from the coronavirus restrictions slowed in the third quarter of the year between July and September. \nThe fact that this was a little lower than expected, and lower than other G7 European economies, reinforces some concerns about the strength of the recovery in the face of supply chain challenges and consumer weakness.\nThe economy has still not caught up with its losses during the pandemic. On a quarterly basis, the gap is still 2.1% and will not be filled until into next year. Using monthly data, it is smaller.\nThe good news is that the service sector has now almost made up its pandemic losses, reflecting the success of the vaccine programme in reopening the economy. \nThe challenge now is in navigating some global and local headwinds, while the Bank of England will be starting to raise rates, and taxes and energy bills are heading up.\nThe latest growth figures were weaker than many economists had expected, and Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the data suggested \"the best of the recovery is now behind us\". \n\"We think progress is going to slow over the next six to nine months as shortages remain an issue and the real spending power of businesses and households is reduced by higher taxes and rising utility prices,\" he added.\nThe economic slowdown comes after the Bank of England held off from raising interest rates last week despite rising inflation.\nIt wanted to see how the jobs market and wider economy was holding up after the end of furlough support.\nThe Bank had already said it expected growth to slow to 1.5% in the July-to-September quarter and forecasts it will pull back further to 1% in the final three months of 2021.\nMr Dales said the slower growth probably would not stop the Bank raising interest rates slightly in December, but could limit further rises next year.\nSeparately, Britain's trade deficit in goods widened by \u00a39bn in the third quarter to \u00a342.3bn, the ONS said, driven by rising imports from EU and non-EU countries as exports fell - especially to non-EU countries."

This is compared with pre-industrial temperatures.\nAt Paris in 2015, world leaders pledged to try to keep the world from warming by more than between 1.5C to 2C through sweeping greenhouse gas emissions cuts. Latest projections are for a rise of 2.7C.\nMr Guterres warned that promises to reduce emissions were meaningless while governments continued to invest in fossil fuels.\n\"Promises ring hollow when the fossil fuels industry still receives trillions in subsidies,\" he said.\nHe called the announcements made so far in Glasgow \"far from enough\", adding: \"We know what must be done.\"\nBut he said hope remained \"until the last moment\".\nMeanwhile, Mr Sharma called on negotiators to find solutions to difficult issues before the official closing of the summit scheduled for 18:00 GMT.\n\"Whilst the window on keeping 1.5 within reach is closing, it is still possible to get there,\" he said. \nMr Sharma also said more work was needed on Article 6, which is about carbon markets and how countries balance their fossil fuel use.\nMary Robinson, former Irish president and head of a group of senior political leaders on climate, accused some of the world's major carbon emitters of sabotaging any attempts to secure a more ambitious action-plan at COP26.\nShe told the Associated Press that Russia and Saudi Arabia were \"pushing back hard\" to block any mention in the final deal out of Glasgow of working to phase out coal, or to reduce government subsidies to fossil fuels.\nCOP26 is the biggest climate change conference since the landmark Paris talks. Some 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions - which cause global warming - by 2030.\nOn Thursday, a small group of countries announced an alliance to phase out oil and gas production. Led by Denmark and Costa Rica, Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance also includes France, Wales and Ireland - but not the UK.\nActivists and politicians cautiously welcomed Thursday's surprise declaration from the US and China to try to keep warming limited to 1.5C - but campaigners said both countries needed to take concrete action.\nMeanwhile, representatives from Ghana, Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Tuvalu held a press conference claiming that the US was blocking progress at COP26. They say the US is dismissing the concerns of the poorest and most vulnerable nations over climate finance.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "text": "French vaccine maker Valneva is seeking an apology from the UK government for casting doubt on whether its Covid jab would get approval. \nValneva said it would not rule out seeking \"legal recourse\" for loss of earnings and damages.\nThe UK government had about 100 million doses of Valneva's vaccine on order before it dropped the deal in September. \nThe vaccine would have been produced in Livingston, West Lothian.\nUK Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the House of Commons that the vaccine would not have gained UK regulatory approval. \nValneva's chief financial officer David Lawrence told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime that Mr Javid's comments had a devastating impact on the business. \n\"We had to do a lot of work to rebuild and restore confidence in the vaccine\" he said.\nHe said Mr Javid's comments were \"very clearly wrong\" and \"we'd love to hear an apology from him.\"\nOn Wednesday, the European Commission agreed a contract to supply up to 60 million doses of the Valneva jab, subject to approval by the European Medicines Agency.\nMr Javid's addressed parliament the day after the UK vaccine deal was scrapped, which Valneva said could have been worth up to \u00a31.2bn. Valneva's share price dropped 35% at the time.\nMr Javid said it was \"clear to us that the vaccine in question that the company was developing would not get approval by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency here in the UK\". \nHowever, he later amended his comments in the parliament's official record to say that Valneva's vaccine had not yet got and may not get approval. \nMr Lawrence acknowledged that Mr Javid had later corrected himself, but said the damage he did to the company was \"significant\". \nThe results of Valneva's clinical trial have since been published. Mr Lawrence described them as \"absolutely phenomenal\". \nHe added: \"Our clinical data wasn't ready and available at that time, and we've since reported it to show that our vaccine looks great. \n\"That apology would help many potential customers understand he made a mistake and there was nothing wrong with our vaccine.\"\nMr Lawrence said Valneva was still seeking an amicable resolution with the UK government.\nBut he added: \"As to legal recourse, we haven't ruled out any of our options yet.\"  \nThe Valneva vaccine uses inactivated Covid-19 virus in a similar way to flu vaccines, and is seen by some as having the potential to win over people wary of vaccines that use new technology.\nTrial results suggested those who received the Valneva jab had high levels of neutralising antibodies against Covid - with the jab outperforming the AstraZeneca vaccine on this measure in head-to-head tests.\nValneva has also met Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Mr Lawrence said it was with a view to supplying doses directly to Scotland in the future. \nThe Scottish government has said it would continue to engage with Valneva on a regular basis\nThe UK Department of Health and Social Care said it could not comment on commercial decisions but added its decision would have no impact on vaccine supplies for the autumn.\nA spokeswoman added: \"Every step has been taken to ensure we have the supplies we need to keep building our huge wall of defence against this virus.\n\"Clinical trials for the Valneva candidate vaccine have not yet been completed. \n\"As such, our independent medicines regulator - the MHRA - has not approved the Valneva candidate vaccine for use in the UK.\"\nShe added the vaccination programme is continuing to make \"phenomenal progress\" with four out of every five adults now fully vaccinated against Covid."

      "text": "Boris Johnson has hit back at sleaze allegations, insisting the UK is not \"remotely a corrupt country\".\nThe prime minister said MPs faced \"tough\" scrutiny - and those who broke the rules should be punished.\nHe was speaking to the world's media at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.\nIt comes amid controversy over Conservative MPs with second jobs - and an investigation into Sir Geoffrey Cox doing paid outside work in his House of Commons office.\nThis, as well as paid lobbying - attempting to influence government policy in return for money - is banned under MPs' rules.\nAsked if he had a message to voters concerned by headlines about the return of Tory sleaze, Mr Johnson said: \"I genuinely believe that the UK is not remotely a corrupt country and I genuinely think that our institutions are not corrupt.\n\"We have a very, very tough system of parliamentary democracy and scrutiny, not least by the media.\n\"I think what you have got is cases where, sadly, MPs have broken the rules in the past, may be guilty of breaking the rules today. What I want to see is them facing appropriate sanctions.\"\nBut he added that MPs had been allowed to do other jobs, such as lawyers and doctors, for \"hundreds of years\", and \"on the whole\" this had strengthened British democracy by giving them \"some experience of the world\".\nAn awkward truth for Downing Street is that even though it's the behaviour of just a few dozen MPs that's being called into question, most of them are Conservatives, which is a fact they cannot avoid.\nThe prime minister's own handling of what's happening and his own attitude to the rules has infuriated many of his own colleagues, and that feeling has not gone.\nBy mentioning the allegations of corruption laid at the government's door, Boris Johnson has perhaps reinforced the criticism from the opposition, even if, by international standards, it is important to say the UK is nowhere near the top of the list.\nRead more from Laura \nSir Geoffrey, 61, the MP for Torridge and West Devon since 2005, is facing questions after video footage emerged of him carrying out paid legal work from what appears to be his Commons office.\nThe former attorney-general, who continues to practise as a barrister alongside being an MP, was participating in a virtual hearing for an inquiry into alleged corruption in the British Virgin Islands.\nMPs are allowed to have second jobs but their code of conduct says they cannot use public resources, including parliamentary offices, for \"personal or financial benefit\". Sir Geoffrey denies any wrongdoing.\nLast month, Tory MP Owen Paterson was found to have broken rules by lobbying the government on behalf of companies who were paying him - and for using his Commons office for business meetings, which is prohibited. He resigned from Parliament last week.\nMr Paterson has denied breaking the Commons lobbying rules, and says an investigation into his conduct by Parliament's standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, was conducted unfairly.\nLast week the government blocked a proposal to suspend him for 30 days, instead suggesting that the whole system for investigating MPs should be reviewed. \nBut ministers U-turned the next day, amid a furious backlash from opposition MPs and some Tories.\nOn Wednesday, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said the controversy had been a \"dark day\" for Parliament - and urged MPs from different parties to help \"move Parliament to a better place\". \nMr Johnson has been repeatedly asked if he will apologise for his botched attempt to rewrite the rules last week, but has declined to do so.\nOn Wednesday, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said his failure to say sorry \"proves that he doesn't care about tackling the corruption that has engulfed Downing Street, his government and the Conservative Party\".\n\"Instead of taking responsibility, the prime minister is taking the mickey out of the British people and won't clean up his mess.\"\nMr Johnson has himself been found to have broken MPs' standards rules on several occasions. \nIn 2019, he was judged to have failed to declare a financial interest in a Somerset property in time. \nIt followed a similar finding in 2018, when he was ordered to apologise over the late declaration of \u00a352,000 in book royalty payments. \nThe code of conduct prohibits:\nMPs must also declare:"

Cash tips, on the other hand, are legally the property of staff.\nAs well as requiring all employers to pass on all tips, service charges and gratuities in full without any deductions, the new legislation will introduce a code of practice, which will set out exactly how tips should be distributed fairly.\nWorkers will also get the right to request information on their boss's tipping record, in case they want to bring a claim to an employment tribunal.\nWhile the move was welcomed by the Living Wage Foundation, it said that the focus should be on improving wages in lower-paid sectors instead.\nIts interim director, Graham Griffiths, said: \"If this work is to be truly valued we need to see more people lifted onto a real Living Wage. \n\"To build a stronger and more dynamic economy, our focus should be on increasing the number of businesses doing the right thing and committing to pay a Living Wage\".\nKate Nicholls, UKHospitality chief executive, added the new rules would strengthen the sector's ability to create jobs.\nBut she pointed out: \"For hospitality businesses, though, customers tipping with a card incurs bank charges for the business, and many also employ external partners to ensure tips are fairly distributed among staff. \n\"With restaurants, pubs and other venues struggling to get back on their feet... we urge the government to continue to work closely with the sector as it introduces this legislation to ensure this works for businesses and employees.\"\nHave you worked somewhere that kept your tips?

      "text": "\"I swear to God, guys, gathering is the best thing.\"\nWith winter approaching and frustrations rising in the forests of western Belarus, the word went out among thousands of desperate would-be migrants.\nThe best way to get to Poland, the messages said, was to try going en masse, rather than in furtive groups, creeping through the forest, hoping to cross into the European Union (EU) unnoticed.\n\"All immigrants go to this site,\" the messages said, complete with images of the Azs-16 Belorusneft petrol station, just over 1.6km (one mile) from the border.\n\"Many immigrants here.\"\nAnd so, last Monday, thousands of migrants converged on the petrol station close to the Belarusian village of Bruzgi and started walking to the nearby border. Their target area was a crossing at Kuznica, where they believed they could enter Poland, hopefully unimpeded.\nThe crowd was mostly made up of Iraqi Kurds, escaping political and economic hardships at home in the hope of finding better lives in the EU.\nVideos from Monday show Belarusian soldiers standing by, unwilling or unable to stop the crowd reaching the border.\nThe country's authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, stands accused by the EU of orchestrating this entire crisis, which has been building since the summer.\nHis neighbours call it a form of \"hybrid warfare\" against the EU, waged in revenge for successive waves of sanctions against his repressive regime.\nIt's a charge he denies, despite warning, back in May, that he would no longer attempt to stop migrants and drugs passing into Europe.\nBut while there is now ample evidence that the Lukashenko regime has encouraged tens of thousands of migrants to fly to Minsk and then pointed them in the direction of the borders with Lithuania and Poland, it's clear that social media is playing a significant role in shaping the actions of the migrants.\nOn Monday, Poland accused Belarus of sending a large group of migrants to breach the border, calling it a major provocation. But it appears the mass move to a single crossing point may have been orchestrated by the migrants themselves, not the Belarusian authorities.\nOver a period of several days from late last week, Kurdish Telegram and Facebook groups with thousands of members were full of messages, telling migrants to head for a single location, with a specific purpose in mind.\n\"The convoy of hope stands here on the map, marked with a red balloon,\" read one message, repeated several times in a group called Iraqi Immigrants.\n\"Tomorrow at 9:30 behind the station all be ready for a few hours then leave,\" read another. \"Please join. It's the only solution.\"\nMigrants and family members contacted by the BBC say that the convoy consisted of some who travelled directly from the Belarusian capital, Minsk, but also large numbers who had been trapped in the nearby forest for days, unable to find a way across the border.\nShwan Kurd, a 33-year-old from Iraq, was among those who were already in the forest. He witnessed Monday's rush to the border but didn't know if it was planned.\n\"Everyone came to one place,\" he said. \"Maybe people came because of the social media posts.\"\nA large crowd, they reckoned, would be impossible to ignore.\n\"For those in Belarus,\" another Telegram message read, \"thousands of people have gathered to create a mass influx.\"\nThe migrants have an eye on past precedent.\n\"The refugees said 'let's repeat 2015',\" Barwa Nusreddine Ahmed told me from his home in the northern Iraqi city of Sulaymaniyah. From there, he's closely following the progress of his brother, who's travelling with his pregnant wife and three children.\nIn 2015-16, hundreds of thousands of migrants poured into Europe from Turkey, triggering a major crisis. There were dramatic scenes as desperate people pushed their way through the Greek-Macedonian border.\nThe German chancellor, Angela Merkel's decision to open Germany's doors contributed to the stampede and won the fierce admiration of migrants. The gesture has not been forgotten, and those flooding into Belarus this year hope, even believe, that the gesture will be repeated.\n\"They said we must do that thing again, so the world will see us,\" Mr Ahmed said.\n\"The refugees say\u2026 we want to show the world how many people we are. Everybody is waiting for Germany to take action.\"\nBut the historical parallels don't stop there. \nThe Kurds, as a stateless and frequently persecuted people, have not failed to notice that 2021 marks a grim anniversary.\nIn 1991, 1.5 million Kurds fled Iraq into neighbouring countries as former President Saddam Hussein sought to punish them for rising up in the wake of that year's Gulf War. It was an epic, harrowing struggle, as desperate refugees fled through the mountains in appalling conditions.\nIn recent days, social media posts have noted the 30th anniversary of this traumatic event, and made explicit parallels with what is happening now.\n\"It's not something new to the Kurds,\" Mr Ahmed said."

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "As the COP26 climate summit enters its second week, negotiations in Glasgow have hit a critical phase. \nThe conference is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. So we asked more than a dozen climate scientists, negotiators and economists from around the world what they wanted to see agreed this week.\nThe scientists all wanted to see more countries commit to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Yet many said changes in the next decade would be the most impactful.\nGovernments must agree to \"cut emissions by half in the next 10 years\", says Prof Mark Maslin, who researches the impact of humans on the environment at University College London.\nThe Paris climate agreement in 2015 committed countries to reach net zero between 2050 and 2100. But reaching net zero is not easy and means big changes to transport, manufacturing, food supplies, construction and almost every aspect of life. \nAnd many of the scientists think 2050 might be too late, particularly if countries don't cut emissions drastically before then. \n\"The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050,\" says Prof Martin Siegert, who researches changes in glaciers at Imperial College London. \nMore than 100 countries have made the 2050 commitment, yet dozens have not. Others big emitters, such as China and Saudi Arabia, have made a net zero commitment - but by 2060, not 2050. One of the world's largest emitters, India, says it will get to net zero by 2070 - 20 years later.\nThe scientists said countries must sign up to go quicker. \"We've got to get international consensus at least in principle around the notion of net zero by 2050,\" says Prof Siegert. \"If that can be done at least in principle at Glasgow, it will be a major step forward.\" \nThe scientists we spoke to said investment in fossil fuels also had to be stopped, with money instead going into renewables like solar and wind. \nLast week at COP, there were announcements on cuts to coal and methane, but many scientists say they don't go far enough. \n\"There needs to be a blanket stop on any foreign investment that builds and supports coal power plants or any other fossil technology\" says Prof Malte Meinhausen, of the University of Melbourne.\nAnd Dr Natalie Jones, a specialist in existential risk at the University of Cambridge, says countries need to publish robust plans and policies on how they will achieve their targets.\nHaving plans on paper, or in law, makes it easier to get countries to stick to their word, she says. \"It provides a kind of hook that you can use to hold countries accountable because you can say, 'well, you've promised this. This is your policy statement'.\" \n\"The UK, for example, has this relatively ambitious emissions reduction targets but it's concurrently trying to open a new oil field at the moment,\" she added. \"The science tells us these things are fundamentally incompatible.\"  \nOne proposal from the scientists was for every country to have a limit on how much it can emit. \nHowever, what the limits for countries might be, and how any scheme might work in practice, is likely to lead to difficult negotiations. Previous attempts to reach an agreement have failed. \nAn alternate solution, suggested by some we spoke to, was a global carbon tax system where consumers and companies, rather than governments, pay a tax on emissions. \nBy making business as usual more expensive, they argue, companies will be more likely to invest in cleaner technologies, which is essential to lowering emissions around the world. \n\"A carbon tax needs to happen,\" says Danae Kyriakopoulou a senior policy fellow at the London School of Economics. \"We have to create incentives and create change in behaviour.\"\nThere is support for the idea. The head of the World Trade Organization recently called for a coordinated approach to taxes on emissions. However, higher costs could be passed on to consumers who use fossil fuels to drive their cars or heat their homes. \nMs Kyriakopoulou thinks this could be managed by taking the money raised by a tax and redirecting it to reduce costs. A country could subsidise home insulation to keep homes warmer and reduce the cost of bills, for example. \nMany people in developing countries, are suffering, says Dr Aditya Bahadur, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development. \n\"They need resources to adapt to these changes. They need knowledge and information. They need new kinds of technologies. They need protective infrastructure.\"\nThe developed world had pledged to provide $100bn a year to poorer countries by 2020, but this has slipped to 2023. \nThe US is already pledging more money, but the scientists we spoke to said reaching the commitment as soon as possible was important.\nDr Bahadur says a focus on adapting to climate change would allow countries to share technologies and advice on how to cope with extreme weather. \nFor example, a country that experiences droughts or floods frequently could give advice to others that have just started experiencing extreme weather events. \n\"I have a colleague in Bangladesh who says Bangladesh has a lot teach to Germany about how to deal with floods.\"\nThere is optimism for collaboration and knowledge-sharing among those we spoke to. The Covid-19 pandemic was given as an example for how countries can find ways to work together. \n\"I am optimistic that a lot of good things will come out of COP26,\" says Dr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist at the university of Ghana, in Accra. She contributed to a major UN report on climate change, published this year.   \n\"Everyone wanted to fight this pandemic. The whole world kind of became one.\" She added: \"This is how I want to see the fight against climate change. The world must come together to have this fight, with a common goal.\""

      "text": "A woman with Alzheimer's has been left stranded in hospital because of a lack of carers to help look after her at home, her husband says.\nBrenda Devine, 57, from Greysteel, County Londonderry, was admitted to the Waterside Hospital seven months ago.\nHer family said she had been told she was ready to go home, but could not leave due to a shortage of carers. \nHer husband Terence said it felt like his wife was \"in a prison and I can't get her out\".\n\"She has been released but I can't get her home,\" he told BBC Radio Foyle.\nA Department of Health (DoH) spokeswoman said demand for home-based care currently \"outstrips supply\".\n\"There is immediate work to be done given the crisis that we find ourselves in, but there is clearly also a need to address issues in the long term,\" she said.\nA number of measures are in place or planned to help address the current shortage, she added.\nThat includes asking health trusts to waive the usual care home fees where domiciliary care packages are not available but a care home placement is.\nThe Western Health and Social Care Trust said it did not comment on individual cases.\nMr Devine said his wife was first admitted to Altnagelvin Hospital on 16 April after suffering severe abdominal pain at home.\nShe was transferred to the Waterside Hospital, where social workers carried out a care package assessment.\nCare packages are required by elderly, disabled or vulnerable people who need help with washing, dressing or cooking, or who need adaptations to their home.\nThe assessment determined Brenda could leave hospital and be cared for at home with the help of professional carers, Mr Devine said.\nBut that has not happened.\n\"This is going on and on,\" Mr Devine said.\n\"I am up against a brick wall with nowhere to turn. I thought Brenda would have been home months ago, every week is precious to me and to the family.\n\"The social workers have said there are no carers. The social workers, the hospital and the nurses have been doing a fantastic job, but there is no communication (with the trust).\"\nHe said it was a \"guessing game\" as to when his wife might return home.\nDue to Covid-19 visiting restrictions, visiting has been limited too.\nMrs Devine has not seen her son, granddaughter or wider family since she was first admitted to hospital.\nMr Devine said the situation was \"soul-destroying... heartbreaking for the whole family\".\n\"When Brenda was here, my mind was full. I enjoyed helping her, if it was the other way around she would do anything for me,\" he said.\n\"The hospital at the minute is not the place for her, and we have a home for her.\"\nIn August, figures from each of Northern Ireland's health trusts showed almost 2,000 people were waiting for care packages, mainly so they could be supported to live in their own homes.\nThe latest figures from the Department of Health show that as of October the number of people waiting for a care package, many of whom are in care homes, has dropped to 1,657.\nThat includes:\nBBC News NI understands that many front-line care staff feel the number waiting on care packages could be much higher.\nBernadine McCrory, operations director of the Alzheimer's Society, said Brenda's situation was not an isolated case.\n\"We have had reports [of shortage of carers] from all of the trusts so this is across all of Northern Ireland,\" Ms McCrory told BBC Radio Foyle.\nShe said cases like Mrs Devine's should be addressed urgently.\n\"While she may be in a hospital ward, she is socially isolated from her family as she can only see her husband and her daughter,\" she said. \n\"We really have got to start thinking of the value of the family carers because they are saving our health service thousands a week, but we aren't getting investment in the system to allow family carers to continue to do this.\" \nThe Department of Health said a range of measures had been taken to try and address the shortage of carers in Northern Ireland.\nThat includes ongoing recruitment drives and the establishment of a social care forum. A publicity campaign promoting social care as a career is also planned.\n\"Whilst these have been successful in recruiting new workers, this has not been in the numbers required to address the increasing demand,\" the spokeswoman said.\nHow care at home will be provided in the longer term, the spokeswoman said, will be shaped by the work of the Reform of Adult Social Care."

      "tags": "China,COP26,Climate change,John Kerry",
      "text": "China and the US have agreed to boost climate co-operation over the next decade, in a surprise announcement at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.\nThe world's two biggest CO2 emitters pledged to act in a joint declaration.\nIt says both sides will \"recall their firm commitment to work together\" to achieve the 1.5C temperature goal set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement.\nThey called for stepped-up efforts to close the \"significant gap\" that remains to achieve that target.\nScientists say that limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C will help humanity avoid the worst climate impacts. This is compared to pre-industrial temperatures.\nAt Paris in 2015, world leaders pledged to try to keep the world from warming by more than between 1.5C to 2C through sweeping emissions cuts. \nChina's top climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua told reporters that on climate change \"there is more agreement between China and US than divergence\".\nUS President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are expected to hold a virtual meeting as early as next week. The two countries are seen as global rivals on a number of issues.\nIn Wednesday's rare joint declaration, there were steps agreed on a range of issues including methane emissions, the transition to clean energy, and de-carbonisation.\nBut China refused to join an agreement earlier this week to limit methane - a harmful greenhouse gas. The agreement was signed by nearly 100 other countries. China has instead pledged to develop a \"national plan\" to address methane. \nMr Xie was followed by John Kerry, the US climate envoy, who said the US and China \"have no shortage of differences, but on climate, co-operation is the only way to get this job done\".\n\"Every step matters right now and we have a long journey ahead of us,\" he said.\nPerhaps the most important clue as to the significance of this statement is in the last bit of the title - a joint declaration on enhancing climate action in the 2020s.\nIf the world wants to keep the 1.5C temperature threshold in sight, then the steps taken to limit carbon emissions in the next nine years are absolutely critical.\nWhile China has been reluctant to tackle its domestic coal emissions in the short term, this statement is a recognition of the urgency of action.\nSo the joint steps agreed - on methane, forests and technology transfer - are important symbolically and also potentially in emissions terms.\nThe agreement is also a recognition by both sides that there is a massive gap between the efforts of countries to limit emissions to date, and what science says is necessary for a safer world.\nClosing that gap means a strong agreement here in Glasgow.\nThe optics and timing of this statement, regardless of the contents, certainly give that a boost.\nGreenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan welcomed the declaration between China and the US, but warned that both countries needed to show greater commitment to reaching climate goals. \n\"Ultimately their statement falls short of the call by the climate vulnerable countries demanding that nations come back to the table every year with greater ambition until the 1.5C gap is closed\", she said. \nEU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said it was \"really encouraging\" to see China and the US working together. \"It shows also that the US and China know this subject transcends other issues. And it certainly helps us here at COP to come to an agreement\", he added. \nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the announcement was \"an important step in the right direction.\" \nCOP26 is the biggest climate change conference since landmark talks in Paris in 2015. Some 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming, by 2030.\nIn other developments at the COP26 climate summit today:\nLast week, US President Joe Biden criticised Chinese President Xi Jinping for not turning up to the summit in person. \n\"The fact that China is trying to assert, understandably, a new role in the world as a world leader - not showing up, come on,\" Mr Biden said, adding that Xi Jinping's absence was a \"big mistake\".\nChina is the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, followed by the US. In September Mr Xi announced that China will aim for carbon neutrality by 2060, with a plan to hit peak emissions before 2030. The US is aiming for net-zero by 2050. \nRead more about the COP26 summit here\nSimple guide to climate change\nWhat will climate change look like for you?\nWill the UK meet its climate targets?\nHow extreme weather is linked to climate change"

We will continue to monitor this situation closely and will update our guidance to pet owners should the situation change.\"\nSome coronaviruses that infect animals can be spread to people and then spread between people, but this is also very rare. \nIt has been suggested that the Covid-19 virus probably originated in bats. \nThere have been reports of other animals infected with Sars-CoV-2. \nDenmark killed millions of mink in November 2020 amid concerns about a mutated form of coronavirus detected in this species. \nA few cases of Covid in pet cats, dogs and ferrets have been recorded around the world too. \nAnd four lions, along with two keepers, tested positive at Barcelona Zoo. \nThe list of animals which have been infected includes:\nAccording to the UKHSA, there have been documented cases of humans catching Covid from mink and from ferrets. \nIf you're concerned about your pet because it has respiratory or digestive problems and a temperature, you should contact your vet who will decide if it needs a Covid test.\nAnd if you are self-isolating because of Covid, do not kiss or cuddle your pet or let them sleep in your bed. \nBut do think about arranging for someone else who is not self-isolating to care for your animals. If there is no-one to help but you need assistance, you should contact your vet.\nCovid spreads from person to person through small droplets, aerosols and through direct contact.

Salzburg also plans new measures.\nChancellor Alexander Schallenberg said a national lockdown for the unvaccinated was \"probably inevitable\".\nTwo-thirds of people should not suffer because others were hesitant, he said.\nUpper Austria, which borders Germany and the Czech Republic and has a population of 1.5 million, has the country's highest level of infection and the lowest vaccination rate. \nNationally, a record 11,975 Covid-19 infections were recorded in the past 24 hours and Austria's coronavirus commission has warned of a threat that \"must be taken seriously\".\nAustria is currently seeing the highest daily infections since the pandemic began, and it is keen to avoid a lockdown for the vaccinated.\nIt has already banned the unvaccinated from going to restaurants, cinemas, ski lifts and hairdressers, but things are about to get even tougher in Upper Austria.\nThe province is introducing a lockdown for the unvaccinated. \nThe chancellor says this means that people who have not been vaccinated won't be able to leave home, unless it is for essential reasons like going to work, buying food or exercise.  \nCritics say the lockdown will be very hard to enforce. \nIf infections continue to rise, the authorities say lockdowns for the unvaccinated could be introduced in other areas. \nThe far-right opposition Freedom Party has been campaigning on a platform of vaccine scepticism, a message that has found favour with many Austrians. It says the move will create a group of second-class citizens. \nAustria's seven-day incidence rate is far higher than in neighbouring Germany, where Health Minister Jens Spahn recently warned of a pandemic of the unvaccinated. \nOn Thursday, Germany recorded more than 50,000 daily infections for the first time. Germany's 67.3% vaccination rate is higher than in Austria, but not by much.\nUnvaccinated people will in effect be barred from restaurants, hotels, cinemas and theatres in the state of Brandenburg from Monday, by a \"2G\" rule limiting access to people who have been vaccinated or have recovered from Covid.\nThe Netherlands is also facing a surge in cases and hospital admissions, with a record 16,364 daily infections announced on Thursday.\nThe caretaker Dutch government is expected to announce Western Europe's first partial lockdown of the winter later on Friday.\nReports suggest a three-week tightening of restrictions is planned, with non-essential shops along with cafes, restaurants and hotels required to shut at 19:00.

      "tags": "South Africa,Nelson Mandela,Obituaries",
      "text": "FW de Klerk was a major force in South Africa's transition from racist state to fully fledged democracy.\nWhile the tide of history would probably have made the change inevitable, it was De Klerk who accelerated the pace of reform.\nEssentially a conservative by nature, the last president of a segregated nation came to believe that white-minority rule was not sustainable.\nHis ending of the ban on the African National Congress and freeing of Nelson Mandela were the steps that triggered the move to majority rule.\nFrederik Willem de Klerk was born on 18 March 1936 in Johannesburg, into a line of Afrikaner National Party politicians. His father, Jan, had been a cabinet minister. \nHe went to Potchefstroom University, known for its conservatism, and by the time he took his law degree, apartheid was firmly established. After 11 years as a lawyer in 1972 he won a safe parliamentary seat for the National Party, which had introduced the system of apartheid in 1948. \nA series of ministerial posts, the last in education, took him to the top of his party. At the time he was a firm believer in apartheid and its legal architecture: separate residential areas, schools and institutions for different race groups. \nNevertheless, De Klerk was a relative outsider when he became party leader in February 1989, after President PW Botha suffered a stroke. \nSix months later, after a bitter row with Botha, he took over as president. \nThe arch-conservative Botha had often spoken of the need for reform, but he had resisted calls for the removal of the ban on anti-apartheid groups, and his government had responded with force to the protests that engulfed the country in the late 1980s.\nAfter just a few months in power, De Klerk demonstrated that he was prepared to tread where Botha had never dared. He publicly called for a non-racist South Africa and late in 1989 he freed top African National Congress (ANC) official Walter Sisulu and other political prisoners as a preliminary move ahead of his more sweeping reforms. \nOn 2 February 1990, President De Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and released Nelson Mandela nine days later. \nIt must have been apparent to De Klerk, as he watched Mandela walk to freedom, that his own days in power were numbered.\nThe remainder of his term in office was dominated by the negotiations that were to eventually lead to majority rule.\nBut talks about a new constitution opened old wounds. There was appalling violence between the ANC and its rivals in the Inkatha Freedom Party. \nIn April, De Klerk announced that security forces would be sent back into the townships. He stressed his government's desire to \"finally close the old books and start on a clean page\". \nThose clinging to the armed struggle and insisting on continued domination \"must realise that we are deadly serious about building the new South Africa without brutality and without unrest. Violence and armed struggle are misplaced\".\nMandela's authorised biographer, the journalist Anthony Sampson, later suggested that De Klerk had connived with the security forces in an attempt to split the two main anti-apartheid factions. It was an accusation Mandela himself made in his book, Long Walk to Freedom. \n\"Despite his seemingly progressive actions, Mr. de Klerk was by no means the great emancipator,\" Mandela wrote. \"He did not make any of his reforms with the intention of putting himself out of power. He made them for precisely the opposite reason: to ensure power for the Afrikaner in a new dispensation.\"\nSampson also alleged De Klerk allowed ministers to secretly support pro-apartheid organisations which collectively became known as the Third Force.\nDe Klerk strongly denied the allegations, saying he had no power over those taking violent actions against the move to democracy but later admitted in a 2004 interview that security forces had conducted undercover activities. He also accused the ANC of harbouring extremist elements intent on disrupting the peace process.\nAlso agitated were white extremists - upset at the prospect of a black government. De Klerk sensed the threat and outmanoeuvred them by offering a \"whites only\" referendum in 1992, in which a majority of white voters endorsed further reform. \nThe pace of change now seemed unstoppable and world attitudes to South Africa were changing. In 1993, De Klerk was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela, the man who would replace him as president. \nHe served as deputy president after the first all-race vote in 1994 and retired from politics in 1997 saying: \"I am resigning because I am convinced it is in the best interest of the party and the country.\" \nAlthough the relationship between De Klerk and Mandela was often punctuated by bitter disagreements, the new president described  the man he succeeded as someone of great integrity.\nIn 1998, De Klerk and his wife Marike divorced after 38 years when he was discovered to be having an affair with Elita Georgiades, the wife of a shipping tycoon, whom he later married. \nHis actions were strongly condemned by Calvinist Afrikaners, one of the more conservative sections of white South African society.\nThree years later, Marike was murdered during the course of a robbery. A 21-year-old security guard was later convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the killing.\nDe Klerk did not abandon politics. He founded the FW de Klerk Foundation to promote peaceful activities in multi-community countries and travelled the world as an advocate for democracy. \nIn 2004 he quit the New National Party because of a planned merger with the ANC. He professed himself broadly satisfied with the changes in South Africa but admitted there were \"a number of imperfections\".\nWhen Nelson Mandela died in 2013, De Klerk paid tribute to the country's first black president. \"He was a great unifier and a very, very special man in this regard, beyond everything else he did. This emphasis on reconciliation was his biggest legacy.\"\nIn 2015 he waded into the row at Oxford University, criticising the demand of activists that a statue of Cecil Rhodes at Oriel College should be removed. \"Students,\" he said, \"have always been full of sound and fury signifying nothing.\"\nFW de Klerk remained loyal to his Afrikaner heritage. Some former colleagues complained he'd been opportunistic, simply seizing a moment because he saw the inevitability of change.\nBut, whatever his motives, his role in the relatively peaceful transition to majority rule in South Africa assures his place in the history books of the 20th Century."

      "text": "Houston police have walked back from a claim that an Astroworld Festival security guard was pricked in the neck at the event, potentially with drugs.\nPolice chief Troy Finner said officers had interviewed the guard, who said he was hit in the head, fell unconscious and woke up at a medical tent.\nThe initial allegation led officials to look into a possible drug-spiking incident at the Travis Scott festival.\nEight people were killed and hundreds others injured after a crowd surge.\nSpeaking at a news conference, Chief Finner said organisers were told by police to end the event on Friday night when one person in the crowd was being given cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\nBut he declined to provide an exact timeline of how events unfolded.\nChief Finner estimated the investigation, which is being led by the Houston police department, could take weeks or months to complete, and said he did not believe an independent probe was needed.\nThere have been concerns about possible conflicts of interest as the police department deployed about 500 officers to the concert, and because of the relationships Scott, who is from Houston, has with local authorities. \nChief Finner dismissed those worries, saying he had only met the singer twice and that there was no \"close relationship\" between the two.\nThe crowd surge began when panic broke out as the crowd pressed towards the front of the stage during the rapper's headline set. About 50,000 people were at the festival at the city's NRG Park complex.\nAs the crush began causing injuries to people, panic grew and the casualties quickly overwhelmed the on-site first aiders, officials said. Two of the injured, including a nine-year-old boy, remain in a critical condition in hospital.\nInvestigators are reviewing video from the scene to explore the causes of the surge and what had prevented people from being able to escape. They are also working to interview victims and witnesses. \nMore than 40 lawsuits have already been filed against Scott and festival promoter Live Nation because of deaths and injuries related to the event."

      "tags": "BAME communities,Pregnancy",
      "text": "Black women are more than four times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth than white women in the UK, a review of 2017-2019 deaths shows.\nThe Mbrrace report found women from Asian backgrounds are almost twice as likely to die as white women. \nSome 495 individuals died during pregnancy or up to a year after birth, out of 2,173,810 having a child.\nThe charity Birthrights is concerned that overall \"this bleak picture has not changed in over a decade\".\nUniversity of Oxford researchers say for the vast majority of people, pregnancy remains very safe in the UK.\nBut despite slight decreases in the maternal death rate in recent years, there have been no significant improvements to these rates since the 2010 to 2012 period.\nTheir current report shows heart disease, epilepsy and stroke continue to be the most common causes of death.\nAnd they say in some 37% of cases, improvements in care may have made a difference to the outcome. \nThe report shows the risk of dying in pregnancy or the year after childbirth, for women is:\nThe report does not look directly at the individual reasons behind the disparities.\nHowever, researchers acknowledge that addressing \"wider cultural and structural biases affecting women's care on the basis of their pregnancy, or the potential to become pregnant, is fundamental to the prevention of maternal mortality\".\nLead researcher, Prof Marian Knight, said: \"Pregnant women get inequitable care for several reasons. \n\"Healthcare professionals often attribute their symptoms to pregnancy alone and they do not always end up getting the treatment they need because people can be incorrectly concerned about giving them medication.  \n\"On top of that is the unconscious bias that black and Asian women can experience. It all adds up. \n\"We know from other studies that the disparity in death rates cannot be fully explained by socio-economic factors and other medical conditions for example.  We need to look for other reasons.\"\nAmy Gibbs, chief executive of Birthrights, said the organisation remained deeply concerned that black and brown people's \"basic human rights to safety, dignity and equality in pregnancy and childbirth are not being protected, respected or upheld\". \nShe added: \"Emerging themes from our own inquiry, backed up by testimony from healthcare professionals, include feeling unsafe, their concerns being ignored or dismissed, denial of pain relief due to racial stereotypes, and pervasive microaggressions causing harm or distress.\"\nThe comprehensive Mbrrace study - which also looks at mental health and cancer care for pregnant women - shows other inequalities continue to grow, with women living in the most deprived areas twice as likely to die than those who live in the most affluent areas. \nSeparately, the review looks at the care of women who give birth over the age of 45.\nFor the 37 births examined closely, fewer than a third of women received care that was fully in line with current guidance. \nResearchers make a number of broad recommendations, including ensuring women have documented conversations about the risks of pregnancy when older than 45, and that mothers-to-be receive cancer and mental health care promptly. \nAnd they advise women to be as healthy as possible before and during pregnancy, and to take folic acid supplements.

      "tags": "China,Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "China's carbon emissions are vast and growing, dwarfing those of other countries. \nExperts agree that without big reductions in China's emissions, the world cannot win the fight against climate change.\nIn 2020, China's President Xi Jinping said his country would aim for its emissions to reach their highest point before 2030 and for carbon neutrality before 2060. \nHis statement has now been confirmed as China's official position ahead of the COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow.\nBut China has not said exactly how these goals will be achieved.  \nWhile all countries face problems getting their emissions down, China is facing the biggest challenge. \nPer person, China's emissions are about half those of the US, but its huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions. \nChina became the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2006 and is now responsible for more than a quarter of the world's overall greenhouse gas emissions. \nIt is expected to come under intense scrutiny at the COP26 summit over its commitments to reduce these. \nAlong with all the other signatories to the Paris Agreement in 2015, China agreed to make changes to try to keep global warming at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and \"well below\" 2C.\nChina strengthened its commitments in 2020, but Climate Action Tracker, an international group of scientists and policy experts say its current actions to meet that goal are \"highly insufficient\".  \nGetting China's emissions down is achievable, according to many experts, but will require a radical shift.\nCoal has been the country's main source of energy for decades.\nPresident Xi says China will \"phase down\" coal use from 2026 - and will not build new coal-fired projects abroad - but some governments and campaigners say the plans are not going far enough. \nResearchers at Tsinghua University in Beijing say China will need to stop using coal entirely for generating electricity by 2050, to be replaced by nuclear and renewable energy production. \nAnd far from shutting down coal-fired power stations, China is currently building new ones at more than 60 locations across the country, with many sites having more than one plant.\nNew stations are usually active for 30 to 40 years, so China will need to reduce the capacity of newer plants as well as close old ones if it is to bring emissions down, says researcher Philippe Ciais of the Institute of Environment and Climate Science in Paris.   \nIt may be possible to retrofit some to capture emissions, but the technology to do so at scale is still developing, and many plants will have to be written off after minimal use. \nChina argues it has a right to do what Western countries have done in the past, releasing carbon dioxide in the process of developing its economy and reducing poverty.\nIn the short term, Beijing has ordered coal mines to increase production to avoid power shortages over the coming winter. Surging demand from heavy industry in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to shortages in several regions of the country in recent weeks.\nTsinghua University researchers say 90% of power should come from nuclear and renewables by 2050.\nIn moving towards that goal, China's lead in the manufacture of green technology, such as solar panels and large-scale batteries, may be a big help. \nChina first embraced green technologies as a means to tackle air pollution, a serious problem for many cities. \nBut the government also believes they have enormous economic potential, providing jobs and income for millions of Chinese, as well as reducing China's dependence on foreign oil and gas.\n\"China is already leading the global energy transition,\" says Yue Cao of the Overseas Development Institute. \"One of the reasons we are able to deploy cheaper and cheaper green technology is China.\" \nChina generates more solar power than any other country. That might not be so impressive given China's enormous population, but it is a sign of where the country is heading.\nChina's wind power installations were more than triple those of any other country in 2020.\nChina says the proportion of its energy generated from non-fossil fuel sources should be 25% by 2030, and it is expected by many observers to hit the target early. \nChina ranks seventh in the world for its percentage of car sales that are electric, but given its huge size, China makes and buys more electric cars than any other country by a considerable margin. \nCurrently, about one in 20 cars bought in China is electric-powered.\nBy 2035, Chinese officials and car industry representatives are predicting that almost all new vehicles sold in China will be fully electric-powered or hybrid.\nWorking out by how much the shift to electric vehicles reduces emissions is not straightforward - particularly when taking into account manufacturing and charging sources. \nBut studies suggest that emissions over the lifetimes of electric vehicles are typically below those of petrol and diesel equivalents. \nThis matters because transport is responsible for around a quarter of carbon emissions from fuel combustion, with road vehicles being the largest emitters. \nChina will also by 2025 be producing batteries with double the capacity of those produced by the rest of the world combined.\nObservers say that will enable the storage and release of energy from renewable sources on a previously impossible scale.\nGetting to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions doesn't mean that China will stop producing emissions.\nIt means China will cut emissions as much as possible and absorb what's left, through a combination of different approaches.\nIncreasing the area of land covered in vegetation will help, as plants absorb carbon dioxide.\nHere again, there is encouraging news. China is getting greener at a faster rate than any other country, largely as a result of its forestry programmes designed to reduce soil erosion and pollution.\nIt is also partly a result of replanting fields to produce more than one harvest per year, which keeps land covered in vegetation for longer. \nThe world needs China to succeed. \n\"Unless China decarbonises, we're not going to beat climate change,\" says prof David Tyfield of the Lancaster Environment Centre.\nChina has some big advantages, particularly its capacity to stick to long-term strategies and mobilise large-scale investments.  \nThe Chinese authorities are facing a colossal task. What happens next could hardly be more important."

      "text": "Activists and politicians have cautiously welcomed an unexpected US-China declaration that vowed to boost climate co-operation. \nThe EU and UN described the move as encouraging and an important step, but Greenpeace said both countries needed to take concrete action.\nThe US and China are the world's two biggest CO2 emitters.\nThey said they would work together to achieve the 1.5C temperature goal set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement.\nScientists say that limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C will help humanity avoid the worst climate impacts. This is compared with pre-industrial temperatures.\nWhile the latest pledge is short on detail, analysts say it is a tacit acknowledgement by China that the crisis warrants urgent attention and that it will play a bigger role in confronting the global challenge.\nThe announcement by the two global rivals was made on Wednesday at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, which officially ends on Friday.\nUS President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are now expected to hold a virtual meeting as early as next week. \nAccording to China's climate envoy, the declaration was agreed following some 30 meetings with the US over the past 10 months. \nIt pledges close co-operation on cutting emissions, while a joint working group will also \"meet regularly to address the climate crisis\" over the next decade.\nThe reaction to the surprise agreement has been largely positive, but experts and activists have warned that policies must now be enacted to support the promises.\nGenevieve Maricle, director of US climate policy action at pressure group WWF, said the announcement offered \"new hope\" that the 1.5C limit might be achieved.\nBut she added that \"we must also be clear eyed about what is still required if the two countries are to deliver the emission reductions necessary in the next nine years\".\nGreenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan warned that China and the US needed to show greater commitment to reaching climate goals.\nFormer Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who is president of the Asia Society which works on global climate change agreements, told the BBC that the agreement was \"not a gamechanger\" but was a big step forward.\n\"The current state of geopolitics between China and the United States is awful, so the fact that you can extract this... agreement between Washington and Beijing right now is [important],\" he said.\nThe US-China declaration calls for increased efforts to close the \"significant gap\" that remains to achieve that 1.5C target.\nThere were steps agreed on a range of issues including methane emissions, the transition to clean energy and de-carbonisation.\nChina's top climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua told reporters that on climate change \"there is more agreement between China and US than divergence\".\nChina refused to join an agreement earlier this week to limit methane - a harmful greenhouse gas, but has instead pledged to develop a \"national plan\" to address the issue. \nMr Xie was followed by John Kerry, the US climate envoy, who said that while US and China had many differences, co-operation on climate was vital.\n\"Every step matters right now and we have a long journey ahead of us,\" he said.\nChina is the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, followed by the US. In September Mr Xi announced that China would aim for carbon neutrality by 2060, with a plan to hit peak emissions before 2030. \nThe US is aiming for net-zero by 2050. \nIn other developments at the COP26 climate summit on Wednesday:\nWhat will climate change look like for you?\nWill the UK meet its climate targets?\nHow extreme weather is linked to climate change"

      "text": "One of Germany's top virologists has warned that a further 100,000 people will die from Covid if nothing's done to halt an aggressive fourth wave. \nCase numbers have soared and Germany on Wednesday registered its highest rate of infection since the pandemic began, with almost 40,000 cases in a day. \n\"We have to act right now,\" said Christian Drosten, who described a real emergency situation.\nDoctors in the intensive care Covid ward at Leipzig University Hospital warn this fourth wave could be the worst yet. \nOne patient here, a woman in her 20s, has just given birth. Her baby is fine, but staff say they don't know whether she'll survive. \nThis state of Saxony has the highest seven-day infection rate in Germany at 459 cases per 100,000 people. The national rate is 232.\nIt also has the lowest take-up of vaccine: 57% of the population here have been vaccinated. \nThere are 18 patients on the Covid ward. Just four were vaccinated. \n\"It's very difficult to get staff motivated to treat patients now in this fourth wave,\" says Prof Sebastian Stehr, who heads the department. \"A large part of the population still underestimates the problem.\"\nBy now, Prof Sehr says, most people will know someone who's had Covid and should, therefore, be aware of the risk of infection. \"Nevertheless,\" he adds, \"we are still seeing so many patients who are not vaccinated.\"\nGermany's health minister has publicly blamed those people for the soaring cases, describing the current situation as a \"pandemic of the unvaccinated\".\nAt the start of this week, Saxony banned unvaccinated people from bars, restaurants, public events and sport and leisure facilities. At least several other states are expected to follow suit. \nGermany's anti-vaxxers are furious. Several thousand protested last weekend in Leipzig. \n\"This is discrimination, and we want to express vehemently that we do not accept this in our society,\" said Leif Hansen, who represents anti-vax \"Bewegung Leipzig\" (Leipzig Movement). He doesn't trust the companies that made the vaccine or the authorities who approved it. \n\"They say the vaccination is ok, that I should give it to my children? Never!\" he told me. \"I have a feeling that it should never go into my body, and I will fight all I can to prevent it coming into my body.\"\nSixteen million Germans over the age of 12 have not been fully vaccinated. The German government has admitted it's unlikely to persuade many of those people now, and politicians worry that social divisions might deepen. \nWhat many fear is another lockdown. Nadine Herzog's bar in Leipzig barely survived the last one. She deftly prepares cocktails as she tells us that even before the authorities required it she and her co-owner banned unvaccinated drinkers. \n\"My business is dying. My dreams came true and now they suffer from people who don't do logical things to prevent others from getting ill or dying and I'm so angry,\" she told the BBC.\nA long queue formed outside a vaccine centre in the city earlier in the week. Evidence, perhaps, that some have changed their minds. But Germany is also now rolling out booster jabs amid concerns about waning protection in those who have been vaccinated. \nOn the intensive care Covid unit they fear the damage is done. Operations have already been cancelled, procedures postponed to make way for Covid patients. \nDoctors here told us that nearly half of the people who end up here will die. \nFor Germany, which invented one of the world's first Covid vaccines, that is a source of great shame.

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you on Friday.\nLives are at risk because patients are facing unacceptably long waits for a 999 response, the College of Paramedics says. In England, callouts for serious health issues like heart attacks and strokes are taking nearly three times as they should - and targets are being missed in the rest of the UK too. The BBC has heard reports of long waits for crews to reach patients, and ambulances queuing for hours outside A&E due to hospital overcrowding. The College of Paramedics' Richard Webber says: \"We have members who have been working for 20, 30 years, and they have never before experienced anything like this at this time of the year.\"\nFrench vaccine maker Valneva wants the UK government to apologise for casting doubt on whether its Covid jab would get approval. Ministers had about 100 million Valneva vaccine doses on order - which would have been made in Livingston, West Lothian- before dropping the deal in September. The firm is not ruling out seeking \"legal recourse\" for loss of earnings and damages after Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs the jab vaccine would not have gained UK regulatory approval. He later amended his comments in parliament's official record, but Valneva says his remarks had a devastating impact on the business.\nThere is a \"moral\" need for a Wales-specific public inquiry into the pandemic as bereaved families' questions must be answered, a Labour MP says. Chris Evans says as the NHS was devolved to Wales, the response to the pandemic was managed via Cardiff. Mr Evans' calls echo those made by the Covid-19 Bereaved Families Justice Cymru group. Unlike the Scottish government, Labour Welsh ministers are not planning an inquiry separate from the UK-wide one. The Welsh government says First Minister Mark Drakeford has written to a UK minister about what issues the inquiry must focus on to address the Welsh government's actions.\nBillions of pounds and thousands of jobs were lost in the East of England's tourism sector during the pandemic - with the value of tourism in Norfolk shrinking from \u00a33.4bn in 2019 to \u00a31.5bn in 2020, according to Visit East of England. Traders in the seaside resort of Great Yarmouth tell the BBC how Covid has affected their businesses - including Terry Burch, who runs Nicky's Cafe and Diner. He says they made enough money to stay afloat but not to make a profit. \"But everyone was employed so we could keep the staff on and we could get by and pay the bills... we kept going which was a lot more than a lot of other people,\" he adds.\nA dog has tested positive for Covid-19 in what officials say is the first recorded case of its kind in the UK. They think the pet, who is recovering at home, caught the virus from its owner. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says cases like this are very rare and there is no strong evidence to suggest that dogs, cats or other pets are passing on the virus to humans. Owners or people who work with animals are advised to wash their hands regularly and not to share food, food bowls or utensils with pets. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nThe weekday morning coronavirus briefing is being paused for two weeks to tell you five things you need to know about the COP26 climate summit.\nThe government has announced that NHS staff in England will have to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 by 1 April.

      "tags": "Companies,Business rates,Retailing,UK economy,Restaurants,Pubs,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Restaurants and pubs are warning that prices will go up due to a rise in VAT rates, which takes effect from Friday.\nOwners said the increase from 5% to 12.5% was badly timed, with one restaurant chain owner saying businesses were already \"hanging by a thread\".\nTrade bodies have called for a halt to any further rises in VAT, to help the industry recover from the pandemic.\nThe government said hospitality had received \"extensive support\".\nVAT - the tax paid when buying goods or services - has been levied at a reduced rate in pubs, restaurants and other hospitality businesses since July 2020 to help them stay afloat during the pandemic.\nThe sales tax won't return to its pre-pandemic rate of 20% until April 2022.\nHowever, Salima Vellani, founder of restaurant chain Absurd Bird, told the BBC she was \"extremely concerned\" about the increase to 12.5%, which she said was a blow to the hospitality industry.\n\"It's just one thing after the other that we are being hit by,\" said the chief executive, who runs five chicken restaurants across the country.\n\"We are all hanging on by a thread. We are going to have to put prices up.\" \nChancellor Rishi Sunak said the 5% rate was designed to \"get the sectors moving and to protect jobs\". \nThe hospitality and tourism sectors have been hit hard by the pandemic, with many venues closed altogether during lockdowns, and then catering to limited numbers due to social distancing measures. Now staff shortages are preventing some making the most of the recovery.\nDavid Moore, the founder of Michelin-star restaurant Pied \u00e0 Terre, said he had already told one customer who had a \u00a395 voucher for a 10-course menu, that their meal would now cost \u00a3105.\nHe said the government \"could not have picked a worse time\" to implement the VAT increase, with his business having to cope with rising import, energy and staffing costs.\n\"It just does not feel like life is back to anywhere near like normal,\" he added. \n\"We just have so many price rises across the board. The utilities are horrendous. The VAT [rise] is not something I can absorb. Every single supplier has increased prices.\n\"It's not just vegetables, or just meat, everything is more expensive than it was two years ago.\"\nHis restaurant was also currently \"massively understaffed\" he said, sometimes meaning table numbers had to be reduced at peak times.\nFor Sue Whiston, finance and operations director at Kuula Poke, a Hawaiian restaurant in Birmingham, the VAT increase was \"premature\". She believes the 5% rate should have been extended for another six months.\nShe said shipping costs to source Kuula Poke's produce, from countries such as Japan, China and Thailand, had \"shot through the roof\".\n\"Mango is something that we buy in hundreds of kilograms at a time, (it) has suddenly overnight increased by 20%,\" she said. \"We have had problems with food availability.\n\"Only this week along our main Japanese wholesaler has turned around and said to us they can't make any deliveries to us this week because of the shortage of diesel fuel.\n\"So right now we are  in this perfect storm of inflationary pressure and VAT is about to go up.\nShe expects prices for diners to rise across the sector.\nRob Pitcher, the chief executive of Revolution, predicts there will be further price increases next spring when the VAT rate increases to 20%.\nThe boss of the bar chain, which has 66 venues and employs about 3,000 staff, said businesses could not afford to take on the extra cost, and so it would be passed on to the customer.\n\"The consumer is going to end up paying twice,\" he said.\nTrade bodies, including UK Hospitality, the British Beer and Pub Association, and Tourism Alliance have called on the government to make the 12.5% VAT rate permanent, rather than increasing the rate again in the spring, to safeguard the future of businesses and protect jobs.\nIn a joint statement, they said returning VAT back to 20% would have \"serious consequences\", with six in 10 businesses noting in a survey that it would \"likely lead to cutbacks and job losses\".\nKate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said keeping the VAT rate at 12.5% would be the \"most effective\" move by the government to \"secure a more rapid recovery and rebuild resilience faster\".\nBut a Treasury spokesman said the government had \"always been clear\" that lower VAT rates were a \"temporary measure to support businesses as they recover from the pandemic\".\n\"The hospitality sector has benefited from extensive support throughout the pandemic through our \u00a3400bn Plan for Jobs, with the furlough scheme, grants, tax cuts and deferrals,\" he added."

      "text": "Aircraft enthusiasts are building a World War Two Spitfire using original pieces of a plane recovered from where it crashed in a Norwegian peatbog almost 80 years ago.\nAuchterarder-born pilot, Flt Lt Alastair \"Sandy\" Gunn, had flown the aircraft out of RAF Wick in Caithness on 5 March 1942 on a secret mission to photograph the German battleship Tirpitz.\nGunn's aircraft was shot down. He was captured, interrogated, imprisoned and later executed after the Stalag Luft III \"Great Escape\".\nHis plane, Spitfire AA810, is being restored after the crash site was located on a mountainside near the village of Surnadal, south west of Trondheim, three years ago.\nParts of the Spitfire are still being found and many have been added to the giant jigsaw puzzle.\nThe plane is being put together in a hangar at Sandown on the Isle of Wight by the Spitfire AA810 Project. It hopes to have the machine airworthy by 2024.\nNew parts of the plane are being manufactured to replace sections that are missing or too badly damaged to use.\nTony Hoskins, of the Spitfire project, said: \"Whilst it is sometimes more laborious to recover, repair and treat original parts compared to making new, every possible part recovered that can be used, will be used. \n\"We recovered a huge amount of material from the crash site, all of which had to be cleaned and sorted. \n\"Once organised the salvaged items can be compared to drawings and any missing or damaged bits replaced or repaired.\"\nThe work comes amid calls from the project team to erect a memorial to Flt Lt Gunn and his fellow pilots of the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (PRU).\nAberdeenshire MP Andrew Bowie brought a debate to the UK parliament earlier this month to support the campaign.\nFundraising for the memorial is due to be launched soon.\nThe Spitfire project also hopes to find out more about Flt Lt Gunn's \"Penny\". The woman, believed to be his girlfriend, sent him a photograph taken in Algiers when he was a prisoner of war.\nMr Hoskins said: \"On the reverse of Penny's photo a stamp shows it has been passed by the camp censor and would have accompanied a letter now sadly since lost. \n\"We are still looking for her.\"\nPRU flew on clandestine reconnaissance missions and the photographs they took of infrastructure, troop movements and weapons sites were used in the planning of operations such as the D-Day landings.\nThe pilots' aircraft were stripped of guns and armour to make them lighter and also to carry photographic equipment and additional fuel.\nFlt Lt Gunn was one of five pilots to fly Spitfire AA810. Built in Reading, the aircraft was first flown from Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire on 17 October 1941.\nThe Germans believed Flt Lt Gunn's Spitfire had been flown from a secret air base in Norway or Sweden and used various techniques, including denying him food, during his interrogation.\nFlt Lt Gunn gave details of his ordeal in letters and diaries he wrote. His interrogators even took him to a pub and poured drink down his throat in their efforts to make him talk.\nThe pilot, who refused to give details of his missions, was later moved to Stalag Luft III in Poland and was a key figure in the prisoner of wars' escape tunnel digging.\nFlt Lt Gunn was among those to escape the camp, but he was captured after two days on the run and shot. He was 24.\nMr Hoskins said records showed the survival rate of PRU pilots was the second lowest of any Allied aerial unit during World War Two. \nHe said: \"These crews have never been officially recognised, their sacrifices largely unknown. In total 452 men would be casualties flying with the PRU.\"\nAll images are copyrighted. "

      "text": "A couple are campaigning for a change in the rules after being denied NHS fertility treatment because one of them already has a child.\nRebecca Wainwright and partner Rhys, from Sheffield, have had two ectopic pregnancies and a miscarriage during six years of trying for a baby.\nMs Wainwright, 34, said the decision had been devastating for them. \nThey are being supported by MP Olivia Blake who said the \"postcode lottery\" provision needed to urgently change. \nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence fertility guidelines make recommendations about who should have access to IVF treatment on the NHS in England and Wales.\nBut individual NHS clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) make the final decision about who can have treatment in their area.\nEligibility can vary from region to region, with many CCGs not allowing couples to access IVF if one of them has a child from a previous relationship.\nMs Wainwright said: \"I think it's a disgusting rule. I think it's discrimination.\n\"I don't understand why I shouldn't be allowed helped to have a child as I've never had my own biological child.\"\nIn what she believes is her \"last chance\" to become a mum, the couple have set up a GoFundMe page to pay for private fertility treatment.\nMr Wainwright, who has a 16-year-old son from a previous relationship, said it was hard not blame himself.\n\"It's my past that is stopping Becca's future and she wants more than anything to be a mum and we want nothing more than to be a family together,\" he said.\nSheffield Hallam MP Ms Blake has written to the Gillian Keegan, the minister responsible for women's health, \"to call out this inconsistency\".\nNHS Sheffield CCG said the policy was agreed in 2020 along with other commissioning groups across Yorkshire and in line with NHS guidance.\nThe Department for Health said that guidance was under review and work on that had started.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "A temporary reduction in VAT to 5% for certain hospitality businesses introduced during the pandemic, has come to an end. How are firms preparing for the increase in \"lifeline\" government tax again?\nThe value added tax relief applied to theatres, circuses, amusement parks, pubs, museums, zoos and cinemas, among others.\nThe reduction from 20% was introduced by the government in July 2020 and was extended twice - to 31 March this year, and then again until 30 September.\nWhen he announced the first extension, chancellor Rishi Sunak said it would help \"support more than 150,000 businesses\" through winter.\nIt has now increased to 12.5%, and is due to return to the pre-pandemic level of 20% in April.\nShepreth Wildlife Park in Cambridgeshire says it will \"just have to bear the brunt\" of the rises.\nIts director, Rebecca Willers, says the lockdown periods have been \"horrendous\".\n\"It's been dark times - as it has been for everyone,\" she says.\nLast year the park \"lost out on hundreds of thousands of pounds [in revenue] ... and to date we're 40% down on this year\".\nShe says the government's VAT cut to 5% has been \"absolutely phenomenal\" and has saved the park \"tens of thousands of pounds\".\nIt was a \"huge lifeline\" which enabled them to cut the admission fee to the park to encourage more visitors when they reopened in April, she adds.\n\"Now [the VAT] is going up - more than double - so technically what this means is that... we cannot increase our price to reflect the increase in VAT simply because we're not as popular in the winter as we are in the summer,\" says Ms Willers.\n\"The last thing we want to do is put [visitors] off by putting the price up. \n\"We're just going to have to bear the brunt of this.\"\nAlex Clarke's pub company runs The Red Lion in Hinxton and The Black Bull in Balsham, both in Cambridgeshire.\nHe says government support, which also included the furlough scheme, has been \"vital\".\nHe has been a publican for 15 years and says he has \"never seen anything like it - it's been an extraordinary year\".\n\"We would not be here without that help that we got. But I do feel we're now moving on and we need to start getting back to reality again.\" \nA rise in the VAT rate to 12.5% \"seems bearable\", he says.\n\"The 5% has been fantastic to help us get going again. The 20% - I am a bit nervous about - that's always seemed high. \n\"Going back to that will definitely hurt. The risk is, it might have to be put onto the prices. \n\"It's going to be hard.\"\nIn a statement, a Treasury spokesman says: \"The hospitality sector has benefited from extensive support throughout the pandemic through our \u00a3400bn Plan for Jobs, with the furlough scheme, grants, tax cuts and deferrals.\n\"We've always been clear that the lower rate of VAT for tourism and hospitality was a temporary measure to support businesses as they recover from the pandemic.\"\nTrade body UK Hospitality's chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said the \"most effective\" way to help the hospitality sector recover and rebuild resilience would be for the government to retain the 12.5% VAT rate. \n\"It would bolster businesses' ability to navigate the mounting challenges in the labour market and food supply chain, would improve job creation, productivity and investment, and ensure the UK remains competitive in a global tourism market, along with providing consumers with continued affordable prices,\" she said.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Despite doctors' efforts, the patient was not saved.\nIn a statement on Monday, Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust and the ambulance service said they were \"aware\" of a case of a patient dying \"shortly after\" being taken into A&E on 5 October.\nThey added: \"We have launched a joint investigation into the circumstances. \n\"While that investigation is ongoing it would be inappropriate to say anything further at this stage, other than to express our condolences to the patient's family, who are being kept fully informed.\"\nAmbulances are supposed to be able to offload patients within 15 minutes of arrival at hospital. \nIn September, 622 waited more than an hour to discharge their patients at Worcestershire Royal, according to latest figures.\nTo ease pressure on A&E there, the trust decided to pilot a scheme in the same month. It saw some patients, including those from Stourport, who otherwise would have gone to the Worcester-based hospital, sent instead to the sister site, Alexandra Hospital, in Redditch. \nPreviously, bosses decided that patients from Kidderminster should permanently be diverted to Redditch A&E.\nThere have been ongoing issues for several years around the emergency department in Worcester.\nHealth bosses were forced to bring in a doctor in 2015 who is usually on call for major disasters to cope with problems in the under-pressure A&E.\nIn 2017, then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the hospital was the one he was most worried about after the BBC reported two patients had died waiting on trolleys.\nAnd in the latest ratings, dated February 2020, both A&Es at the Worcestershire Royal and Alexandra Hospital were ruled to be \"inadequate\" after inspectors found patients on trolleys waiting too long for treatment.\nThe Care Quality Commission (CQC) found the departments \"overwhelmed\" and criticised delays in assessing patients arriving by ambulance.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "Boeing has reached an agreement with the families of the 157 people who died in the Ethiopia 737 Max crash in 2019.\nThe plane maker accepts liability for their deaths, according to court documents in Chicago.\nIn return, families of the victims will not seek punitive damages from the company.\nLawyers for the victims' families said Boeing would still be held \"fully accountable\", welcoming the agreement as a significant milestone.\nBoeing shares fell 1% to $218.50 on the news. \nThe agreement opens the way for families outside the US, in countries such as Ethiopia and Kenya, to claim compensation through the US courts, rather than in their home countries, which might be more difficult and result in lower payments.\nMark Pegram in the UK, whose son Sam was one of the victims, said: \"The main positive for us is that Boeing is admitting liability, and not diverting blame onto Ethiopian Airlines or the pilots... we wanted them to hold their hands up.\"\nSam's mother Debbie told the BBC: \"All we are looking to do with any compensation is set up a charity in Sam's name. It's what we want to do and it's what Sam would have wanted us to do.\"\nAt the time of the crash, the 737 Max was Boeing's best-selling plane. \nBut two fatal accidents within five months - the Ethiopia Airlines flight out of Addis Ababa and before that a Lion Air jet that came down into the sea off Indonesia - signalled there were serious faults with the aircraft.\nThe planes were grounded for 20 months, while investigations took place, but have since been allowed to return to operations after the firm made significant changes to their software and training.\nWords are important and in this agreement Boeing accepts responsibility for the crash of ET302 - a disaster which claimed the lives of 157 people from 35 different countries. \nThe world may have moved on and the 737 Max may be flying again, but for many of the families of those who died, the grief and sense of loss remains very raw indeed. \nIn the period since the two accidents involving the 737 Max, Boeing has faced criticism for appearing to deflect blame elsewhere, for example by questioning the abilities of the pilots. \nSo that admission of liability really does matter.  \nFor Boeing, the agreement provides some protection, by removing the possibility of relatives seeking potentially very high punitive damages and by making it unlikely current or former executives will be called to testify in court.\nAlongside the settlement reached in a lawsuit bought by shareholders last week - who had been suing the company over unsafe business practices - it removes much of the legal jeopardy the aerospace giant had been facing. \nBut the company has made a significant concession. It has agreed that all compensation claims can be made under US law, which provides for much higher levels of compensation than would apply in many other countries. \nThe agreement reached in Chicago, Illinois, where Boeing is headquartered, opens the way for compensation claims to be made. \nWhile it does not stipulate any specific level of compensation for the victims' families, the agreement will limit the scale and scope of any further procedures.\nLegal experts say it makes the prospect of current or former Boeing executives testifying in court much less likely.\n\"Boeing is committed to ensuring that all families who lost loved ones in the accidents are fully and fairly compensated for their loss,\" the plane maker said in a statement.\n\"By accepting responsibility, Boeing's agreement with the families allows the parties to focus their efforts on determining the appropriate compensation for each family.\"\nLawyers for the victims released a statement saying that under the agreement, Boeing admitted \"that the 737 Max had an unsafe condition, and that it will not attempt to blame anyone else\" for the crash.\n\"This is a significant milestone for the families in their pursuit of justice against Boeing, as it will ensure they are all treated equitably and eligible to recover full damages under Illinois law, while creating a pathway for them to proceed to a final resolution, whether through settlements or trial,\" the lawyers said.\nIn January, Boeing agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice, including $2.5bn (\u00a31.9bn) in fines and compensation stemming from the 737 Max crashes, including the Lion Air crash in October 2018."

I may have killed someone.\"\nDarnton had said he disabled a fire alarm and started the blaze because he did not want Gregory to suffer any longer from dementia, the court heard.\nHis friends had thought the student was joking, but Darnton went on to tell a counsellor in May 2019 about a friend \"who could send me to prison cos of what he knows\".\nHe added that he had felt \"powerful\" at an event involving a person who had died - thought to be Mrs Gregory's funeral - as he \"knew what had happened and everyone else in the room didn't\".\nThe counsellor ended the session by saying to him \"I'm not really clear what you're saying but I think you're trying to tell me you've killed someone\", to which Darnton mouthed \"Yes\". \nShe passed the information to police and he was arrested.\nDetectives found searches on his mobile phone and computer from June 2018 which read \"murderer filled with despair\", \"I'm a murderer\" and \"I'm a monster and I'm going to hell\".\nDarnton will be sentenced on Friday.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "Genome",
      "text": "Hundreds of patients with rare diseases have been given a diagnosis for the first time, thanks to a study which involved analysing their entire genome.\nMore than 2,000 families took part and were recruited through the 100,000 Genomes Project, which started in 2013.\nScientists behind it say the approach can lead to better care, more focused treatments and can save NHS resources.\nOne in four received a new diagnosis, including Terri Hedley, who inherited a kidney condition from her father. \nLeslie had endured years of treatment for serious kidney disease which led to two kidney transplants - and was worried that his granddaughter Katie, in addition to his daughter, was going to be affected.\nBut through sequencing of Leslie and Terri's whole genome, it was discovered she did not have the kidney problem.\n\"It was fantastic to know that it stops with me,\" 41-year-old Terri said.\n\"She [Katie] doesn't need to get regular tests now. We were so worried about her.\"\nTerri's daily life is not affected by the kidney condition, but her kidney function has deteriorated in the last 20 years.\nA 10-year-old girl with a rare, unknown condition also received a diagnosis through the study which meant she was able to have a bone marrow transplant. She had been admitted to intensive care multiple times and visited hospital on more than 300 occasions.\nTesting of her siblings revealed no other family members were at risk.\nThe study, led by Genomics England and Queen Mary University of London, marks the first time that whole genome sequencing has been used in a healthcare system and applied to large numbers of patients with rare diseases.\nQueen Mary's Prof Sir Mark Caulfield, former chief scientist at Genomics England, said it was a \"major advance\" which could be rolled out worldwide at the first sign of symptoms.\nHe said the study paved the way for the technique being used in the NHS.\nIt's the process of analysing entire genomes - or all the genes plus the DNA that make up a human being.\nYour genome is unique, is more than three billion letters long, and is found in almost every cell in your body.\nSequencing someone's genome involves donating a sample of DNA, normally from a small blood sample.\nOne human genome can be sequenced in about a day - but the analysis of it takes much longer.\nPicking out the differences between one person's genome and a \"reference\" genome is the goal and there are often millions.\nMost are harmless, but they are the reason we are different from each other.\nUsing clever software, scientists work out exactly which differences could be the cause of disease, and these are then fed back to the NHS and the patient.\nWhole genome sequencing led to a new diagnosis for a quarter of those who took part. \nThey were then able to receive better care, such as change of diet, provision of vitamins and other appropriate therapies. Screening of other family members for the same diagnosis could also take place. \nA total of 14% of those diagnosed were found in regions of the genome which would have been missed by other methods of testing.\nMost of the rare diseases identified were: \nThe genes of 4,660 people from more than 2,100 families were analysed between 2014 and 2016 for the study, published in New England Journal of Medicine.\nMany had gone through years of testing and appointments without getting any answers about the disease affecting their family. All were part of the 100,000 Genomes Project, led by Genomics England.\nAbout 6% of the population in Western societies is affected by approximately 10,000 rare disorders.\nMore than 80% of these have a genetic component, and they are often disabling and expensive to manage. \nOne third of children with a rare disease die before their fifth birthday.\nProf Damian Smedley, from the Queen Mary research team, said the new approach \"was key to us being able to solve the 'needle in a haystack' challenge of finding the cause of a rare disease patient's condition amongst the millions of variants in every genome\".\nProf Chris Inglehearn, professor of molecular ophthalmology, at the University of Leeds, said the results showed \"beyond doubt\" that human genome sequencing \"can revolutionise medical care for a wide range of human diseases\".\nBut he added that the 100,000 Genomes Project, which provided the data used in the study, \"can prove difficult for clinicians and researchers to access\" and that needed to be addressed.\nAnother challenge, scientists say, would be deciding how whole genome sequencing could and should be used to identify rare conditions within the NHS."

      "tags": "Wisconsin,United States",
      "text": "Lawyers for a teenager charged with shooting three people amid civil unrest in Wisconsin last year have called for a mistrial.\nKyle Rittenhouse's defence asked that the case be dismissed after the judge angrily rebuked prosecutors for airing apparently inadmissible evidence.\nMr Rittenhouse, 18, sobbed earlier in court as he took the stand.\nHe testified that he killed two men and injured a third on 25 August 2020 on the streets of Kenosha in self-defence.\nMr Rittenhouse is facing counts including intentional and reckless homicide, reckless endangerment and illegal possession of a firearm after he fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, 28. He could get life in prison. \nRiots erupted on the streets of the city two days earlier after police shot a black man, Jacob Blake. Mr Rittenhouse - who was 17 at the time - travelled to the city from his home in Illinois. That night, with a semi-automatic rifle in tow, he said he sought to help protect property from unrest on the streets.\nOn Wednesday, day seven of the trial, lead prosecutor Thomas Binger and Judge Bruce Schroeder loudly quarrelled in court. Mr Binger's questioning about Mr Rittenhouse's decision to remain silent until now, as is his right, incurred furious reprimands from the judge.\n\"That's basic law, it's been the basic law in this country for 40 years, 50 years. I have no idea why you would do something like that,\" the judge said. \"So I don't know what you're up to.\"\nJudge Schroeder also accused the prosecutor of violating pre-trial rulings on introducing evidence the judge had ruled not relevant to the trial - a video recorded two weeks before the shootings in which Mr Rittenhouse commented about shooting men he thought were shoplifting at a pharmacy.\n\"Don't get brazen with me,\" Judge Schroeder told the prosecutor. \"You know very well that an attorney can't go into these types of areas when the judge has already ruled without asking outside the presence of the jury to do so.\"\nThe judge added: \"When you say you were acting in good faith, I don't believe you.\"\nDefence attorneys argued there had been \"prosecutorial overreaching\", and called for a mistrial with prejudice, which would mean Mr Rittenhouse could not be retried.\nJudge Schroeder did not rule on the motion on Wednesday, but agreed to take it \"under advisement\" based on the future behaviour of the prosecution team.\nLead defence attorney Corey Chirafasi even suggested that prosecutors may have been angling for a mistrial because the case was \"going badly\" for them.\nTaking the stand is a risky legal move for any defendant in a murder trial, Mr Rittenhouse said: \"I didn't do anything wrong. I defended myself.\"\nHe said he was walking towards a used-car dealer's forecourt with a fire extinguisher to put out a fire when he heard somebody scream: \"Burn in hell!\"\nVideo evidence shows the gun-toting teen shouting out \"friendly, friendly, friendly\" to the crowd. He said he heard people shouting \"get him\" and began running. \n\"The person that attacked me first threatened to kill me,\" he said of Mr Rosenbaum, the first person he shot. \nHe told the jury he believed Mr Rosenbaum was carrying a chain with him at one point, though he later learned it was a plastic bag. \nThe judge called for a break after Mr Rittenhouse burst into tears as he began to describe to the jury the moments before the fatal shootings. His mother was also seen sobbing in the gallery.\nUpon his return to the stand, the teen said he had nowhere to run at the time, later adding: \"I didn't intend to kill. I intended to stop the person who was trying to kill me and trying to steal my gun.\"\nVideo from the scene shows the teenager fall to the ground as he is chased. Mr Rittenhouse said he feared for his life as several men converged upon him. The defendant said he shot and killed Mr Rosenbaum after Mr Rosenbaum laid a hand on his rifle.\nMr Rittenhouse told the court that Mr Huber, the second person he shot, hit him with his skateboard and also tried to grab his rifle.\nHe also said Mr Grosskreutz, the man he wounded in the arm, had approached him with a pistol pointed at his head.\nMr Grosskreutz testified this week he thought Mr Rittenhouse was an \"active shooter\" when he drew his own gun and advanced on him.\nProsecutors argued that Mr Rittenhouse was a vigilante who wanted to kill everyone he shot that evening.\nIn a sharp cross-examination, prosecutor Thomas Binger contested the teen's right to possess a rifle and sought to cast doubt on the extent of his medical training."

      "text": "The Valneva Covid vaccine that the UK cancelled a 100m dose order for last month, works well at priming the immune system to fight coronavirus, phase three trial results suggest. \nBlood results from volunteers who received the jab had high levels of neutralising antibodies against the pandemic virus. \nIt outperformed the AstraZeneca vaccine on this measure in head-to-head tests. \nValneva is seeking regulatory approval for its jab, manufactured in Scotland. \nIt is an inactivated whole virus vaccine, meaning it contains a dead version of coronavirus that cannot cause disease. This is the same way that flu and polio vaccines are made. \nFrench pharmaceutical company Valneva said the vaccine had a \"neutralising antibody seroconversion rate above 95%\" and there were no severe cases of Covid seen in the trial despite variants, such as Delta, being in circulation. \nLead investigator Prof Adam Finn, of the University of Bristol, said the results, shared in a press release, were both \"impressive and extremely encouraging\". \n\"These results suggest this vaccine candidate is on track to play an important role in overcoming the pandemic,\" he said. \nValneva hopes to initially get the jab approved for those aged between 18 and 55, based on the age range of people in the trial.\nThe company said it has begun the vaccine approval process with the UK's health regulator, and is preparing to submit a request with the European Medicines Agency.\nValneva said the UK government had served a notice to the firm, over allegations of a breach of the agreement. The vaccine manufacturer \"strenuously\" denied any breach.\nProf Penny Ward, a pharmaceutical expert at King's College London, said: \"As we know the UK government is in dispute with Valneva having cancelled the UKs order of up to 100million doses, placed by the Vaccines Taskforce in 2020, in September.  \n\"The results today suggest that this decision might yet be regretted, but because of it Valneva might be able to provide an immediate supply of this vaccine for other countries struggling with the freezer shipping requirements of other, more expensive, vaccines. Good news for Covax and countries still awaiting supplies.\" "

We will continue to monitor this situation closely and will update our guidance to pet owners should the situation change.\"\nSome coronaviruses that infect animals can be spread to people and then spread between people, but this is also very rare. \nIt has been suggested that the Covid-19 virus probably originated in bats. \nThere have been reports of other animals infected with Sars-CoV-2. \nDenmark killed millions of mink in November 2020 amid concerns about a mutated form of coronavirus detected in this species. \nA few cases of Covid in pet cats, dogs and ferrets have been recorded around the world too. \nAnd four lions, along with two keepers, tested positive at Barcelona Zoo. \nThe list of animals which have been infected includes:\nAccording to the UKHSA, there have been documented cases of humans catching Covid from mink and from ferrets. \nIf you're concerned about your pet because it has respiratory or digestive problems and a temperature, you should contact your vet who will decide if it needs a Covid test.\nAnd if you are self-isolating because of Covid, do not kiss or cuddle your pet or let them sleep in your bed. \nBut do think about arranging for someone else who is not self-isolating to care for your animals. If there is no-one to help but you need assistance, you should contact your vet.\nCovid spreads from person to person through small droplets, aerosols and through direct contact.

      "text": "A Covid-19 vaccine slated to be made in Scotland by French firm Valneva would not have gained UK regulatory approval, health secretary Sajid Javid has said.\nMr Javid was speaking in parliament the day after the UK government scrapped a deal for Valneva's Covid-19 vaccine.\nThe UK had about 100 million doses on order before dropping the deal.\nMr Javid said the Westminster and Scottish governments would work together to \"see what more we could do\" for the factory in Livingston.\nHe said: \"There are commercial reasons that we have cancelled the contract, but what I can tell her is that it was also clear to us that the vaccine in question that the company was developing would not get approval by the MHRA [The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ] here in the UK,\" he said in response to a question from Scottish National Party MP Hannah Bardell, whose constituency is Livingston.\n\"Obviously she is not recommending that we administer vaccines that do not get approval,\" he said, adding that the Livingston vaccine facility was \"very important\" to the UK and Scottish governments.\n\"That is something that we will be working together on to see what more we can do,\" he said. \nThe Financial Times reported that in a recent UK trial looking at potential booster jabs, the Valnera vaccine was found to be less effective than some rivals.\nHowever, the vaccine has not yet completed clinical trials.\nThere was also a report in the Scotsman that the dispute was connected to delivery concerns amid supply chain problems that hauliers attribute to Covid and Brexit.\nValneva, the Department of Health and Social Care and the MHRA have not yet responded to a request for comment.\nMs Bardell said she and the firm were in \"shock\" that the UK had cancelled the Valneva contract \"with very little notice or consultation\" and that the UK had provided \"very little clarity and reasoning\" as to why it had taken that decision.\n\"Valneva is playing a crucial role in the global fight against Covid, and have worked incredibly hard to augment and adapt their work on a vaccine as new variants have emerged,\" she said. \"This is a shocking way to treat a company working tirelessly on a vaccine.\"\nIn September 2020 Valneva announced that the UK government had ordered 60 million doses of its vaccine, and had invested in its Livingston manufacturing facility.\nThe Valneva vaccine uses inactivated Covid-19 virus in a similar way to flu vaccines, and is seen by some as having the potential to win over people wary of vaccines that use new technology.\nShares in Valneva plunged 35% on Monday after it said the UK government had ended a Covid-19 vaccine supply deal that could have been worth up to \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a31.2bn).\nVaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said on Tuesday that the British government had the right to cancel the deal.\n\"There are commercial sensitivities around this but we have a right to cancel the Valneva vaccine and that's what we've informed the company we would do,\" Mr Zahawi said.\nThe government said the decision would have no impact on vaccine supply in the UK.\n\"The comments from the company will not have any impact on our vaccine supply and did not form any part of our vaccine rollout in autumn and winter,\" a spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.\nThe firm said on Monday that results from its phase three trials were due later this year.\nIt added: \"Valneva has worked tirelessly, and to its best efforts, on the collaboration with HMG including investing significant resources and effort to respond to HMG's requests for variant-derived vaccines.\""

      "tags": "Afghanistan,British Army,Ministry of Defence",
      "text": "Senior military officers buried evidence that British troops were executing detainees in Afghanistan, the High Court has been told.\nMinistry of Defence documents reveal UK Special Forces officers suspected their men were killing unarmed Afghans who posed no threat.\nThey also show the allegations were kept secret and not reported to the Royal Military Police (RMP).\nThe MoD says the evidence is not new and has already been investigated.\nThe court case follows a 2019 investigation by BBC Panorama and the Sunday Times that raised allegations of unlawful killings by special forces during the war in Afghanistan.\nThe High Court is considering whether the allegations were investigated properly by the armed forces.\nThe man bringing the case, Saifullah, claims four members of his family were assassinated in the early hours of 16 February 2011. \nHis lawyers were asking the court to order the defence secretary to release more documents before a full judicial review hearing.\nDocuments already disclosed were presented to the court. They showed nine Afghan men were killed in a raid on 7 February 2011 and eight more were killed by the same special forces assault team two days later. \nMore than a dozen detainees were killed after they were taken back into buildings to help search them. British troops claimed they were forced to shoot them after they reached for hidden weapons. \nThe documents show that in one email, a British lieutenant colonel expressed disbelief at the official accounts.\nHe said it was \"quite incredible\" the number of prisoners who decided to grab weapons after being sent back into a building. \nA fellow officer replied: \"I find it depressing it has come to this. Ultimately a massive failure of leadership.\" \nA week later, the four members of Saifullah's family were shot dead in similar circumstances by the same special forces assault team. \nThe documents show the killings were described as \"astonishing\" by a senior officer. \nAnother senior officer later dismissed a soldiers' description of events, saying \"the layers of implausibilities\" made the official account \"especially surprising and logic defying\". \nThe court heard a British officer provided a written statement to a commanding officer after a member of the special forces told him all fighting-age males were being killed regardless of the threat they posed. \nThe officer said: \"It was also indicated that fighting-age males were being executed on target inside compounds, using a variety of methods after they had been restrained. In one case it was mentioned a pillow was put over the head of an individual being killed with a pistol.\" \nAll the anecdotal reports of unlawful killings were locked away in a top secret \"controlled-access security compartment\", the court heard. \nThe court documents show the allegations were raised with a \"very senior officer\" at UK Special Forces headquarters. \nThe special forces leadership did not notify the RMP. Instead, the high-ranking officer ordered an internal review. \nIt examined 11 raids where the special forces unit had killed people in similar circumstances in the previous six months. \nThey had all been taken back inside buildings to help with the search after surrendering. \nThe final report was written by the commanding officer of the special forces unit accused of carrying out the executions. He accepted the version of events given in the official accounts of the raids. \nIn 2014, the RMP started investigating the alleged executions after receiving reports from Afghan families and whistleblowers from the British military. \nIts investigation, called Operation Northmoor, was closed in 2019 without resulting in any prosecutions. \nThe MoD claimed at the time the RMP had \"found no evidence of criminal behaviour by the armed forces in Afghanistan\". \nBut the documents quoted in court suggest there were serious weaknesses in the investigation. \nA summary of Operation Northmoor states it only investigated three of the original 11 incidents in detail and two senior officers identified as suspects were later dropped without being interviewed. \nThe summary also shows a decision was taken not to view video footage of special forces raids.\nThe MoD maintains the four members of Saifullah's family were killed by British troops in self-defence. \nIt has previously said: \"These documents were considered as part of the independent investigations, which concluded there was insufficient evidence to refer the case for prosecution. \n\"The Service Police and the Service Prosecuting Authority of course remain open to considering allegations should new evidence, intelligence or information come to light.\" \nMr Justice Swift ordered the defence secretary to release additional documents related to the allegations. \nThe MoD had argued the defence secretary had adopted a duty of candour and that requests for documents should be proportionate.

      "tags": "Medical research,Vaccination,James Gallagher,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "Understanding how some people naturally resist Covid infection, despite clearly being exposed to the virus, could lead to better vaccines, say researchers. \nA team at University College London said some people had a degree of Covid-immunity before the pandemic started.\nThis likely came from the body learning how to fight viruses that are related to the one which has swept the world. \nUpgrading vaccines to copy this protection, could make the jabs even more effective, the team said. \nThe scientists were closely monitoring hospital staff during the first wave of the pandemic - including by taking regular blood samples. \nDespite being in a high-risk environment, not everyone in the study came down with Covid. The results, published in the journal Nature, showed some people just managed to avoid the virus.\nBut around one-in-10 had signs of being exposed, but never had symptoms, never tested positive and never developed Covid-fighting antibodies in their blood. \nPart of their immune system was able to get on top of the virus before it managed to take hold - what's known as an \"abortive infection\".\nBlood samples showed these people already had (as in before the pandemic) protective T-cells, which recognise and kill cells infected with Covid. \nDr Leo Swadling, one of the researchers, said their immune systems were already \"poised\" to fight the new disease. \nThese T-cells were able to spot a different part of the virus than the bit most of the current vaccines train the immune system to find. \nVaccines are largely aimed at the spike protein, which covers the outer surface of the Covid virus. However, these rare T-cells were able to look inside the virus and find the proteins that are necessary for it to replicate. \n\"The healthcare workers that were able to control the virus before it was detectable were more likely to have these T-cells that recognise the internal machinery before the start of the pandemic,\" Dr Swadling added. \nThese internal proteins are very similar in all related species of coronavirus, including the ones that are widespread and cause common cold symptoms. \nIt means targeting these proteins with a vaccine could give some protection against all coronaviruses and new Covid variants. \nThe team said the current vaccines were doing an excellent job of preventing people from becoming severely ill, but were not as good at stopping them catching Covid.\nProf Mala Maini told me: \"I think we could all see that they could do better.\n\"What we're hoping, by including these T-cells, is that they might be able to protect against infection as well as disease, and we hope they would be better at recognising new variants that arise.\"\nWhile nearly everyone will have caught these common cold coronaviruses, not everyone will have developed the right kind of protective T-cells. It may be that healthcare workers are more regularly exposed to the viruses through their work and that is why some of them had protection. \nDr Alexander Edwards, from the University of Reading, said: \"Insights from this study could be critical in the design of a different type of vaccine. \n\"Hopefully this study will lead to further advances in vaccine development, as we need all the types of vaccine we can get.\"\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "A former police officer says he is keeping his promise to his friend and colleague PC Yvonne Fletcher, as a civil trial opens into her murder, which happened nearly 40 years ago.\nPC Fletcher, 25, was killed by shots fired from the Libyan People's Bureau in London on April 17 1984.\nAs she lay dying, fellow officer John Murray promised her he would find those responsible and bring them to justice.\nHe has brought a civil case against Salah Ibrahim Mabrouk, who is in Libya.\nThe allegation is not that Mr Mabrouk fired the actual shots but that he was jointly liable for the events that took place. \nMr Murray told the BBC that he was determined to stand by his commitment to PC Fletcher. \"I am keeping that promise. My job is nearly over. My job was to get someone in a court of law and I think I've done it.\"\nAdding it was a \"wonderful feeling\" to see the case begin. \"It's taken a long, long time to get here\". \nThe murder was described in court as \"state sponsored act of terrorism\" for which \"no one has ever been brought to justice\". \n\"This is a very strange trial,\" Philippa Kaufmann QC, acting for Mr Murray, acknowledged, since Mr Mabrouk is not defending the case and also because the events are more than 37 years old. \nShe said there had been a \"total lack of accountability for the murder\". \nThe shots, the court was told, came from two Sterling sub-machine guns within the embassy and were aimed at protesters against the then-Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi. \nIt heard that PC Fletcher collapsed into fellow officers when she was shot. \nMr Murray carried her to an ambulance and accompanied her to hospital where she died.\nLater Mr Murray was asked to identify her body. In written submissions, the court heard he has since suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\"It was tough,\" he said of the opening day of the court hearing where video of the immediate aftermath was shown. \"There's some things I couldn't look at and some things I couldn't really listen to.\" \nMr Mabrouk had been detained by police earlier on the morning of the shooting. He had been involved in a confrontation as barriers were being put up in advance of the protest. \n\"We have guns here today, there is going to be fighting,\" he was alleged to have told one of the men putting up the barriers, the court heard.\nIn written submissions, the court was told it was \"inconceivable\" that Mr Mabrouk was not at the heart of decision-making over the use of violence and that the \"orchestration\" of the shooting was \"entirely consistent\" with his role at the building.\nThe court was shown pictures taken by a police photographer inside the building showing pistols and ammunition.\nMr Mabrouk was deported after the shooting, but later returned to the UK.\nPolice arrested him in 2015 in connection with the murder. But the case was dropped in 2017 when the Crown Prosecution Service said that evidence could not be admitted for reasons of national security. \nThat has led to today's civil case. Mr Murray, a close friend as well as colleague of PC Fletcher, is only seeking \u00a31 in vindicatory damages.\nMr Mabrouk has since been excluded from the UK and is not represented in court. \nIn a statement to Mr Murray's lawyers he said: \"I cannot apologise for something I didn't do\u2026 I had no role in the sad killing of WPC Fletcher.\" \nMr Murray said it was \"disappointing\" that Mr Mabrouk wasn't present. \"He's been given every opportunity to be here... I would really like to look him in the eye.\"\nThe case continues and is expected to last three days."

The hospital said it typically offers parents compassionate care in such situations, allowing them to hold their tiny infants for what little time they may have left together.\nBut with a less than one per cent chance of survival, Curtis clung on in intensive care.\nHe was taken off a ventilator after three months and discharged this April following 275 days in hospital. \nTherapists had to help him learn how to breathe and use his mouth to eat.\nMrs Butler, of rural Eutaw, Alabama, said in a statement: \"Being able to finally take Curtis home and surprise my older children with their younger brother is a moment I will always remember.\" \nCurtis - who has three older siblings - still needs supplemental oxygen and a feeding tube, but doctors say he is in good health.\nDr Brian Sims, the University of Alabama at Birmingham neonatologist who oversaw the delivery, told Guinness World Records: \"I've been doing this almost 20 years, but I've never seen a baby this young be as strong as he was.

It will be held this Sunday.\nThe Queen is expected to pay tribute at the ceremony, alongside other members of the Royal Family, serving and former members of the armed forces, representatives of Commonwealth nations and senior British politicians. \nLike Armistice Day, Remembrance Sunday will see the nation fall silent at 11:00 to remember the war dead.\nIn London, hundreds of wreaths have travelled to major stations from around the UK and overseas from locations including the Falkland Islands, as part of the Poppies to Paddington and Routes of Remembrance campaigns by The Veterans Charity.\nOne has already toured the UK and on Thursday travelled up the Thames, before being taken to the Tower of London on board HMS Belfast - a surviving World War Two Navy warship. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson posted a photograph on social media showing him observing the two-minute silence at Downing Street.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who observed the silence at the Cenotaph, and tweeted thanking \"everyone who has served, and continues to serve, in our armed forces\".\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge tweeted a photograph of the Field of Remembrance at the National Memorial Arboretum - with William and Catherine adding a message \"remembering the armed forces, and their families, from Britain and the Commonwealth, for the vital role played by the emergency services & those that have lost their lives as a result of conflict\".\nOn Saturday, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall will lead other members of the Royal Family at the Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall.\nThe Queen has confirmed she will not be at the annual event organised by the Royal British Legion forces charity, after doctors advised her to rest for two weeks. But she said it was her \"firm intention\" to attend the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph the following day.\nDuring an engagement in Brixton, south London, for his Prince's Trust charity, a man asked the Prince of Wales about the Queen.  Prince Charles gave him a pat on the arm, and appeared to say: \"She's alright, thank you.\""

      "tags": "South Africa,Nelson Mandela",
      "text": "FW de Klerk, the former president of South Africa and the last white person to lead the country, has died.\nThe 85-year-old had been diagnosed with cancer earlier this year. \nHe came to power in 1989 under apartheid, a system of legalised racism, but later became a key figure in the transition to democracy.\nHe ordered Nelson Mandela's release from prison, leading to historic polls where the anti-apartheid leader became the first black president.\nDe Klerk shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela for helping to negotiate an end to apartheid. But his legacy divides opinion in South Africa. \nFollowing his death, the FW de Klerk Foundation released a video recording - dubbed his \"final message\" - in which he talks about apartheid.\n\"Let me today, in the last message repeat: I, without qualification, apologise for the pain and the hurt, and the indignity, and the damage, to black, brown and Indians in South Africa,\" he says.\nThe foundation said De Klerk had died peacefully at his home following his struggle against mesothelioma - a cancer that affects the lining of the lungs. \nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa said De Klerk's death \"should inspire all of us to reflect on the birth of our democracy\". \nAfter working for more than a decade as a lawyer, De Klerk won a parliamentary seat for the National Party, which had introduced the system of apartheid in 1948.\nHe served in several ministerial posts before taking over as the head of the party in February 1989, and months later becoming president. \nDe Klerk had been a firm believer in apartheid, but after coming to power\u00a0he publicly called for a non-racist South Africa.\nIn a famous speech to parliament in 1990, he announced that he was removing the ban on parties that included Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) and said he was ordering Mandela's release from prison after 27 years. \nHis actions helped bring an end to apartheid-era South Africa, and he became one of the country's two deputy presidents after the multi-party elections in 1994 that saw Mandela become president. \nDe Klerk retired from politics in 1997, saying: \"I am convinced it is in the best interest of the party and the country.\"\nAlthough the relationship between De Klerk and Mandela was often punctuated by bitter disagreements, the new president described the man he succeeded as someone of great integrity.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the Nelson Mandela Foundation said De Klerk would \"forever be linked to Nelson Mandela in the annals of South African history\".\n\"De Klerk's legacy is a big one. It is also an uneven one, something South Africans are called to reckon with in this moment,\" it added.\nMany have blamed De Klerk for violence committed against black South Africans and anti-apartheid activists during his time in power.\nLast year, he became embroiled in a row in which he was accused of playing down the seriousness of apartheid, after saying he was \"not fully agreeing\" with a presenter who asked him to confirm that it was a crime against humanity. De Klerk later apologised for \"quibbling\" over the matter.\nHuman rights lawyer Howard Varney on Thursday described him as an \"apologist for apartheid\", while the Fort Calata Foundation - which campaigns for justice for people killed by the former white-minority regime - called him an \"apartheid criminal\".\nIn the video message released following his death, De Klerk said he had on many occasions \"apologised for the pain and the indignity that apartheid has brought to persons of colour in South Africa\".\nIn his message, Mr Ramaphosa praised De Klerk for the \"vital role\" he played in South Africa's transition to democracy, despite \"severe pressure to the contrary from many in his political constituency\". \nSouth Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, said De Klerk's contribution to the country's transition to democracy could not be overstated.\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson said De Klerk would be remembered for his \"steely courage and realism in doing what was manifestly right\".\nThe reactions here in South Africa echo the divisions that have stalked FW de Klerk for decades. Some see him as a decent man, a rare politician who took the unusual step of negotiating a path - for himself and for his party - out of power, and in doing so, helped to steer the country away from the racial civil war that many feared would engulf South Africa in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nBut others, including Nelson Mandela, were more guarded, seeing de Klerk as a political opportunist, a conservative Afrikaaner, who realised that with the Cold War over and international sanctions biting, he had no alternative but to negotiate with the black majority.\nIn recent years, a younger generation of South Africans - some encouraged by populist politicians - have sought to question the compromises that accompanied South Africa's transition to democracy, and have argued that De Klerk and other apartheid leaders should be held responsible for the death squads that targeted members of the liberation movement."

      "text": "An ex-aide to the Duchess of Sussex \"regretted\" not giving evidence in her High Court case against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday, the Court of Appeal has heard.\nMeghan won the privacy case when a judge found the publication of a letter to her father was unlawful - a ruling the publisher is trying to overturn.\nPapers released on the appeal hearing's final day revealed the regret of Jason Knauf, her ex-communications secretary.\nThe ruling is due at a later date.\nAssociated Newspapers' legal team have been seeking to overturn the High Court judgement at the Court of Appeal, disputing that Meghan's letter to her father Thomas Markle - sent in August 2018 - was simply a private and personal letter.\nIn written evidence, Meghan denied she thought it likely that her father would leak the letter and said she did not want any of it to be published.\nOn Wednesday Mr Knauf - who is due to stand down from his current role as the chief executive officer of the Royal Foundation at the end of the year - said in a witness statement that the duchess had written the letter with the understanding that it could be leaked.\nAlso on Wednesday, a statement from Meghan contained an apology to the court for not remembering an email exchange in which she agreed Mr Knauf could provide information to the authors of the Finding Freedom biography, written by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand.\nOn Thursday, documents were released revealing that a confidential source contacted the publisher with the information that Mr Knauf regretted not giving evidence during the High Court case.\nKeith Mathieson, solicitor for Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), said in a witness statement that, in April, Mr Knauf's then legal team contacted ANL's lawyers to say his position was \"strictly neutral\" and he did not wish to have any involvement in the proceedings.\nBut after Meghan won the case, ANL was contacted by the source in July and approached Mr Knauf, who wished to provide a statement for the appeal.\n\"Mr Knauf was plainly a central figure in the events he describes,\" Mr Mathieson said, saying the former aide was a \"senior and trusted member of the royal household staff\".\nMr Mathieson described Mr Knauf's witness statement as \"measured in tone\" and \"honest and credible\".\nHe said the former aide had been \"careful not to include evidence of matters beyond his own personal knowledge\".\n\"Given the high profile nature of this litigation and the likelihood of his evidence (if admitted) being widely reported, as well as the position he holds, it is hardly conceivable that he would say anything he did not believe to be true,\" he said.\nAndrew Caldecott QC, representing ANL, told the court on Thursday that Mr Markle had faced \"nasty and untrue\" allegations in an article published by People magazine in the US and there had been a public interest in correcting them.\nDescribing the allegations, he said: \"In the teeth of his daughter being always dutiful and supporting him throughout with incredible generosity, first he cold-shouldered her at the wedding, in one of the most important parts of her life.\n\"He gave a cynical and self-interested response ignoring her pleas for reconciliation in a loving letter.\"\nHe said the letter to Mr Markle from Meghan was \"not a loving letter, not a generous letter\", contrary to how it was presented in the People article.\n\"When we come to the very first allegation about cold-shouldering her at the wedding... this allegation is demonstrably false, we say,\" Mr Caldecott said.\nJustin Rushbrooke QC, for Meghan, previously described the case as \"very straightforward\" and said her human rights were \"triply engaged\" by the publication of part of the letter.\nIn her written evidence, Meghan said she did not think her father would sell or leak the letter \"primarily because it would not put him in a good light\".\nShe \"merely recognised that this was a possibility\".\n\"To be clear, I did not want any of it (the letter) to be published, and wanted to ensure that the risk of it being manipulated or misleadingly edited was minimised, were it to be exploited,\" she said.\nThe duchess said the \"main purpose\" of the letter was to encourage her father to stop talking to the press.\nThe Court of Appeal judges - Sir Geoffrey Vos, Dame Victoria Sharp and Lord Justice Bean - said they will give their ruling at a later date."

      "tags": "Economics,GDP,Economic growth,UK economy,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "UK economic growth slowed between July and September as supply chain problems hindered the recovery, latest official figures show.\nThe Office for National Statistics said consumer spending increased as Britain continued to emerge from lockdown.\nBut that was offset by falls in other areas of the economy, leaving growth for the three months at 1.3%.\nIt means the economy is 2.1% smaller than in the final three months of 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic hit.\nSterling fell to its lowest level of 2021 against the dollar on Thursday following the news.\nGrant Fitzner, ONS chief economist, said service growth expanded, helped by house buyers rushing to do deals before the end of the stamp duty holiday. \n\"However, these were partially offset by falls in both the manufacture and sale of cars.\n\"Notably, business investment remained well down on pre-pandemic levels in the three months to September,\" he said.\nGrowth slowed significantly from a 5.5% rise recorded between April and June when many Covid restrictions were lifted.\nThe ONS said that the UK expanded by less than it initially thought in July and August, leading them to revise down growth figures for both months. \n\"What happened earlier in July and August was that we had the pingdemic.\" said Sarah Hewin, head of research for Europe and the Americas at Standard Chartered. \"And that ended up essentially holding the economy flat.\" \nIn contrast, the economy grew by 0.6% during September. \nChancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures showed his economic policies were working.\n\"The economy continues to recover from Covid and thanks to schemes like furlough, the unemployment rate has fallen for eight months in a row and we're forecast to have the fastest growth in the G7 this year,\" he said.\nKirsty Davies-Chinnok, from Professional Polishing Services (PPS), told the BBC that the company, which polishes metals such as stainless steel and aluminium, had been \"very busy\" throughout 2021 so far.\n\"We have had some bespoke projects, but we have seen general work has increased,\" she said.\nThe managing director said the manufacturing industry \"didn't really stop through most of 2020 and it has continued to increase\".\nIt has led to PPS deciding to invest further in its operations despite initially thinking it was \"too risky\" due to the pandemic, Ms Davies-Chinnok added.\nHowever, rising material and supply costs had led to the firm increasing its prices to customers.\n\"We have had three price increases this year, which is unheard of,\" said Ms Davies-Chinnok. \"But we can't finance doing business with our customers when our suppliers are increasing their costs to us.\"\nShe added that PPS, which is very energy intensive business, was \"incredibly lucky\" by the fact it had renewed its energy contracts last December, before wholesale gas prices surged worldwide.\nLonger term, Ms Davies-Chinnok said the biggest threat to her sector \"has to be climate change\" and said industry and government had to look at ways to make greener energy.\nBusiness leaders expressed caution about the outlook, with Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, saying the data points to the UK economy \"only likely to return to its pre-pandemic level next year, behind many of our international competitors\". \n\"Although monthly output rebounded through the quarter from July's contraction this is more likely to reflect a temporary boost from restrictions easing, rather than a meaningful improvement in the UK's underlying growth trajectory,\" he said.\nThe ONS highlighted the impact of supply chain problems, which businesses have been struggling with for several months as they adjust to labour shortages and disruption at container ports.\nStocks held by manufacturers fell during the July-to-September quarter, the ONS said. And a slowdown in new UK car sales was in large part due to a global shortage of microchips. The ONS also noted that retailers were reporting \"lower than usual\" stock for the time of year.\nAs expected, the UK economic rebound from the coronavirus restrictions slowed in the third quarter of the year between July and September. \nThe fact that this was a little lower than expected, and lower than other G7 European economies, reinforces some concerns about the strength of the recovery in the face of supply chain challenges and consumer weakness.\nThe economy has still not caught up with its losses during the pandemic. On a quarterly basis, the gap is still 2.1% and will not be filled until into next year. Using monthly data, it is smaller.\nThe good news is that the service sector has now almost made up its pandemic losses, reflecting the success of the vaccine programme in reopening the economy. \nThe challenge now is in navigating some global and local headwinds, while the Bank of England will be starting to raise rates, and taxes and energy bills are heading up.\nThe latest growth figures were weaker than many economists had expected, and Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the data suggested \"the best of the recovery is now behind us\". \n\"We think progress is going to slow over the next six to nine months as shortages remain an issue and the real spending power of businesses and households is reduced by higher taxes and rising utility prices,\" he added.\nThe economic slowdown comes after the Bank of England held off from raising interest rates last week despite rising inflation.\nIt wanted to see how the jobs market and wider economy was holding up after the end of furlough support.\nThe Bank had already said it expected growth to slow to 1.5% in the July-to-September quarter and forecasts it will pull back further to 1% in the final three months of 2021.\nMr Dales said the slower growth probably would not stop the Bank raising interest rates slightly in December, but could limit further rises next year.\nSeparately, Britain's trade deficit in goods widened by \u00a39bn in the third quarter to \u00a342.3bn, the ONS said, driven by rising imports from EU and non-EU countries as exports fell - especially to non-EU countries."

      "tags": "Music",
      "text": "Abba singer Anni-Frid Lyngstad has said \"don't be too sure\" that their comeback album Voyage is their last, in her first interview about the reunion.\nThe Swedish superstars released the LP, their first for 40 years, on Friday.\n\"I have learned to say never to say never,\" she told BBC Radio 2's Zoe Ball about the prospect of future projects.\nLyngstad said going back into the studio with bandmate Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog felt like \"coming back home again, having fun with my little sister\".\nThe album received mixed reviews from critics but is set to go to number one in the UK on Friday.\nIt is on course to be the fastest-selling album of the year so far and outsold the rest of the top 40 combined in its first two days of release, according to the Official Charts Company.\nLyngstad and F\u00e4ltskog rarely give interviews, and their bandmates Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus have said one condition of the comeback was that the singers would not need to talk to the media.\nHowever, Lyngstad, known as Frida, appeared on Radio 2's breakfast show on Thursday and said she was pleased with the response to the release - but was less worried about what people think than in the band's heyday. \n\"Of course we are pleased because we didn't expect anything, actually,\" she said. \"It's always like you're a bit nervous when you release something new.\n\"But if I compare it to how it was 40 years ago, it's a bit of a difference because I would personally say I don't take it that seriously as I would do earlier on, when I was younger, because then it meant so much.\n\"But as Benny said in an earlier interview, we don't have to prove anything. So we have just done it for the fun of it. And that's a good feeling, actually. And then, when people like it, as they seem to do, then of course it's wonderful.\"\nThe quartet have stayed in touch over the years but she said she was a little apprehensive when they went back into the studio, originally with the aim of recording new music for a forthcoming virtual stage show.\n\"Benny suggested that we maybe should have a couple of new songs on that show. So that's how it started,\" she explained.\n\"And of course with anticipation, I went to Sweden into the studio to meet with the others, because it's always fun to work together with them. So that was the feeling I had - I mean, comfortable, a little bit tense maybe, but we also decided if it doesn't go well then we don't have to release it.\"\nShe and F\u00e4ltskog \"have something special, not only voice wise, but also as friends\", she said.\n\"Once we closed the door behind us in the studio, we felt at home, both of us.\"\nAndersson recently told BBC News that he said he thinks Voyage will be the quartet's swansong. \"I've said that's it,\" he said last week. \"I don't want to do another Abba album.\n\"But I'm not alone in this. There are four of us. If they twist my arm, I might change my mind.\"\nUlvaeus added: \"I never say never, but I agree with Benny. I think that was our goodbye.\"\nIt will take Lyngstad and F\u00e4ltskog to twist their arms if Abba are to continue, the pair said.\nIn her interview on Thursday, Lyngstad, 75, suggested that might not be out of the question.\nShe told Zoe Ball she was \"very surprised that Benny and Bjorn\" had said that Voyage was the end of Abba.\nShe said she \"cannot remember\" having that conversation with them, but added: \"Yeah, we have probably said it must be the last thing we do because also thinking of our ages, we are not young any longer.\n\"But I would say again, you never know. So don't be too sure.\"\nShe also discussed the Eurovision Song Contest, which was Abba's launchpad to global success when they won with Waterloo in 1974.\nAsked whether she still watches the contest, she replied: \"I'm sorry to say no, I don't. I'm not so interested because it has changed so much over the years.\n\"It's not what it was at that time. Now it's more like a show. It's very technical. There are some good songs coming out of it, but I cannot say I'm a fan of Eurovision. Maybe I shouldn't say it.\""

I'm afraid the bell went off.\"\nThis appears to be a reference to the division bell, which rings when MPs are summoned to the Commons to vote.\nA statement on behalf of Sir Geoffrey, posted on his website, says: \"He does not believe that he breached the rules but will of course accept the judgement of the Parliamentary Commissioner or of the Committee [on Public Standards] on the matter.\"\n\"Sir Geoffrey regularly works 70-hour weeks and always ensures that his casework on behalf of his constituents is given primary importance and fully carried out.\"\nAnd it adds: \"Sir Geoffrey's view is that it is up to the electors of Torridge and West Devon whether or not they vote for someone who is a senior and distinguished professional in his field and who still practises that profession.\n\"That has been the consistent view of the local Conservative Association and although at every election his political opponents have sought to make a prominent issue of his professional practice, it has so far been the consistent view of the voters of Torridge and West Devon. Sir Geoffrey is very content to abide by their decision.\"\nSir Geoffrey is also under fire for voting from the British Virgin Islands, while working there during the period when MPs were permitted to vote by proxy, or remotely, because of the pandemic.\nIn his statement, he says he consulted the Conservative chief whip \"specifically on this issue and was advised that it was appropriate\".\nTorridge and West Devon Conservative Association chairman John Gray said: \"Geoffrey Cox is a superb constituency MP.\n\"He combines a strong ethos of public service with an astonishing work ethic and valuable legal expertise.\"\nMeanwhile, it has also emerged that Sir Geoffrey - who was sacked from the cabinet last February - spoke at a webinar on Brexit, hosted by Withers, the law firm he was working for, in November 2020.\nHe had been told by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, the watchdog that is meant to police jobs taken on by former ministers, not to offer \"privileged insight\" from his time in government, including on Brexit negotiations, to the law firm.\nDuring his remarks, Sir Geoffrey talked in general terms about his experience preparing for Brexit in cabinet committees.\nA spokesperson for Withers said: \"In all activities in connection with Withers - whether it be at speaking engagements or in his legal advice - Geoffrey Cox QC has not disclosed any privileged information from his time in Government and has been very conscious of the constraints that apply to him.\"\nSir Geoffrey's lengthy statement is a clear attempt to offer a thorough defence of his actions. \nHe makes the point that he's never sought to hide his highly paid work as a barrister and that voters in his constituency have so far not seen it as a problem. \nLocal Tories talk in glowing terms about the \"astonishing work ethic\" of their \"superb\" MP. \nBut Labour won't let this go and have zeroed in on Sir Geoffrey's reported use of his office while undertaking additional paid work. \nOn that he seems to believe he's done nothing wrong. \nInterestingly, he draws into this drama a couple of government figures whose approval he sought along the way. \nThe Conservative chief whip Mark Spencer, who Sir Geoffrey says he consulted about voting by proxy while abroad and was told it was \"appropriate\". \nAnd the Attorney General Suella Braverman whose office advised there was no conflict of interest around his work in the British Virgin Islands. \nThe code of conduct prohibits:\nMPs must also declare:\nDeputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said: \"A Conservative MP using a taxpayer funded office in Parliament to work for a tax haven facing allegations of corruption is a slap in the face and an insult to British taxpayers.\n\"The prime minister needs to explain why he has an MP in his parliamentary party that treats Parliament like a co-working space allowing him to get on with all of his other jobs instead of representing his constituents.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has himself earned more than \u00a3100,000 from legal work since he became an MP in 2015, performing some legal work while he was a shadow cabinet member. He stopped in 2019 when he stood to be party leader.\nAsked about MPs working outside Parliament, Sir Keir said Labour wanted consultancies and partnerships ruled out, but that some types of employment, such as doctors working in hospitals, should be allowed.\nHe said the independent Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards should be the person to decide which jobs were allowed, saying: \"I think there has to be a bit of common sense on this, which side of the line cases fall.\""

      "text": "Lives are at risk because patients are facing unacceptably long waits for a 999 response, the College of Paramedics has told the BBC.\nIt comes as NHS data shows callouts for problems such as heart attacks and strokes are taking nearly three times as long as they should in England.\nTargets are being missed in the rest of UK too, with some seriously-ill waiting up to nine hours for an ambulance.\nInvestigations are ongoing into deaths linked to delays in a number of areas.\nThese include: \nWith ambulance services under their highest states of alert patients are being told to make their own way to hospital where possible.\nThe BBC has spoken to ambulance staff across the UK about their experiences, with one saying they felt patients were at risk on every shift and another describing the situation as \"horrendous\".\nThe College of Paramedics, the professional body for the sector, described the situation as \"unacceptable\" and said lives were at stake.\nThe BBC has found reports of numerous serious incidents.\nCases involve both waits for crews to reach patients, as well as delays when ambulances arrive at A&E but spend hours queuing outside, because the hospital is too overcrowded to accept the patient.\nMargaret Root, 82, waited nearly six hours for an ambulance to come following a stroke, and she then waited for another three hours outside hospital.\nWhen she was finally admitted, her family was told it was too late to give her the drugs needed to reverse the effects of the stroke.\nHer granddaughter Christina White-Smith said her grandmother had been \"hugely let down\". \nShe said she did not blame the staff because they were \"amazing\" when they got to her grandmother, but said she is angry the NHS is not getting the help it needs.\n\"I don't think people are aware of the severity of the situation.\"\nDetails have also emerged of a 66-year-old man who spent four hours lying face down on the floor at home with a punctured lung.\nAnd in another case a man waited nine hours for help to arrive following a stroke one evening last month. His family called six times before a response finally arrived the following morning.\nRichard Webber, a spokesman for the College of Paramedics and a working paramedic, said the waits patients were experiencing were \"unacceptable\".\n\"We have members who have been working for 20, 30 years, and they have never before experienced anything like this at this time of the year. \n\"Every day services are holding hundreds of 999 calls with no-one to send. \n\"The ambulance service is simply not providing the levels of service they should - patients are waiting too long and that is putting them at risk.\"\nHe said the delays in handing patients over to hospital staff were causing havoc.\nMr Webber said waits of three or four hours were not uncommon.\n\"It means on a 12-hour shift we can only attend two or three incidents, whereas previously we would do six, seven or eight,\" he added.\nHis evidence is supported by data collected by the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, which shows the number of hours lost to handover delays lasting more than an hour, is now more than twice as high as it was in January.\nThe impact on response times is clear. The latest data for October shows in England category one cases classed as immediately life-threatening, such as cardiac arrests, took more than nine minutes on average to reach. \nThe target is seven minutes and research shows every one-minute delay reduces the chances of survival by 10% for cardiac arrests.\nCategory two cases cover emergencies including heart attacks, strokes and burns. They are meant to be reached in 18 minutes on average, but took nearly 54.\nResponse targets are also being missed in other parts of the UK. \nIn Wales, the Healthcare Inspectorate recently warned delays were presenting a risk to patients.\nShortly afterwards the ambulance service there requested help from the military.\nThere appear to be numerous reasons behind the problems.\nThere are also signs that the pandemic and the disruption it has caused to health care and everyday life, has meant the health of frail and vulnerable people has deteriorated, leading to more demand on services.\nCalls to the ambulance service are up by around a quarter on the numbers seen before the pandemic.\nHospitals are also reporting problems trying to discharge patients who are medically fit to leave but cannot because there is no social care available to support them in the community.\nThis is causing significant delays admitting patients onto wards, and in turn is leading to long waits for ambulance crews arriving with patients.\nThe head of the Scottish Ambulance Service, Pauline Howie, recently made an apology to the public, describing the pressures being faced as \"unprecedented\".\nChris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents both ambulance and hospital bosses in England, said the system was \"severely stretched\". \n\"What is worrying now is that they are all operating right at their limits and we are not yet into winter, when there's every chance these pressures could step up still further.\"\nProf Stephen Powis, medical director of the NHS in England, praised the work of staff, saying they were going \"above and beyond\".\nHe pointed out the ambulance service had had to deal with the highest number of 999 calls ever in a single month, while major A&E's had experience their busiest October.\n\"There is no doubt pressure on the health service remains incredibly high.\"\nAdditional reporting by Tim Vizard and Katherine Roberts"

      "text": "Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has written to Labour and the SNP after three of their MPs were accused of getting drunk on a flight to Gibraltar.\nThe BBC understands that officials complained about the behaviour of the SNP's Drew Hendry and David Linden and Labour's Charlotte Nichols.\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called the claims about the SNP MPs \"false\", but Labour has yet to comment.\nThe Tories rejected reports two of their own MPs drank heavily later.\nA party source told the BBC the accusations some Conservatives had turned up to subsequent events with a hangover were \"quite clearly a desperate attempt by those involved in the flight incident to deflect attention away from their behaviour\".\nThe MPs were in a group of 15 taking part in the trip to Gibraltar.\nCoinciding with Armistice Day, it was organised as part of the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme. set up to give politicians an insight into military life so they can \"make a more informed and useful contribution to defence debates\".\nSeveral witnesses said the three MPs had been inebriated when the plane touched down at Gibraltar.\nOne witness claimed they had been drinking before departure from Heathrow and had drunk heavily on the flight.\nTwo military chaperones who were accompanying the group of MPs on the flight were so concerned by their behaviour they reported it to the Ministry of Defence in London, the BBC understands.\nThe claims of drunkenness were first reported by the Times and Sun newspapers.\nMr Hendry and Mr Linden are said to have become argumentative when officials queried their Covid documents.\nAnd Ms Nichols returned to the UK early after what has been described as a \"mental health episode\". \nIt is understood the MP for Warrington North has post-traumatic stress disorder and is on medication.\nMr Wallace's letter has been sent to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle and Tory MP James Gray, who chairs the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme.\nThe defence secretary said the scheme provided \"an opportunity for both parliamentarians and the military to understand each other.\n\"This behaviour puts military personnel in a difficult position and risks undermining respect for Parliament,\" Mr Wallace added.\nBut Ms Sturgeon rejected the claims against Mr Hendry and Mr Linden as \"completely unfounded and false\", describing them as a \"disgraceful attempt\" to divert attention from sleaze allegations against Conservative MPs.\n\"I know both Drew and David extremely well and if they say these allegations are false I have confidence in that,\" she added.\nGlasgow East MP Mr Linden said he was \"incredibly disappointed\" by the \"bizarre Tory smear campaign\".\nMr Hendry, MP for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, accused Conservatives of making \"false claims\", saying: \"That is a matter for their conscience. I'll focus on doing my job and respecting our troops as we mark Armistice Day.\"\nA Government of Gibraltar spokesperson said there had been \"no reports of shouting or any sort of aggressive behaviour\" at the airport.\nThe Army has had a presence in Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory with a population of 30,000, for more than 300 years."

      "title": "China's Xi Jinping cements his status with historic resolution",
      "tags": "Xi Jinping,China,Communist Party of China",
      "text": "The Chinese Communist Party has passed a \"historical resolution\", cementing Xi Jinping's status in political history.\nThe document, a summary of the party's 100-year history, addresses its key achievements and future directions.\nIt is only the third of its kind since the founding of the party - the first was passed by Mao Zedong in 1945 and the second by Deng Xiaoping in 1981. \nIt was passed on Thursday at the sixth plenary session, one of China's most important political meetings.\nAs only the third Chinese leader to have issued such a resolution, the move aims to establish Mr Xi as an equal to party founder Mao and his successor Deng.\n\"Just like the previous two resolutions, [this resolution] will play an important role in helping to unite the theory, will and action of the party - to achieve future progress and in realising the second centenary goal and the great Chinese dream of rejuvenation,\" senior party official Qu Qingshan said at a press conference on Friday.\nThe party has previously set two centenary goals: that China would become a \"moderately prosperous\" society by 2021, and the second, that it would be a \"fully developed, rich, and powerful\" nation by 2049. \nSome observers see the resolution as Mr Xi's latest attempt to turn back decades of decentralisation by Chinese leaders that began under Deng and continued through other leaders like Jiang Zemin - a sign that China might be moving back to a so-called cult of personality.\nThe four-day closed door session gathered more than 370 full and alternate members of the party's 19th Central Committee - the country's top leadership.\nIt was the last major meeting of party leaders ahead of the national congress next year, where Xi is expected to seek a historic third term as president. \nIn 2018, China scrapped the two-term limit on the presidency, effectively allowing him to remain in power for life. \nEssentially, it cements Mr Xi's hold on power, experts told the BBC. \n\"He is trying to cast himself as the hero in the epic of China's national journey,\" said Adam Ni, editor of China Neican, a newsletter on Chinese current affairs. \n\"By pushing through a historical resolution that puts himself at the centre of the grand narrative of the Party and modern China, Mr Xi is demonstrating his power. But the document is also a tool to help him retain this power,\" he said.\nDr Chong Ja Ian from the National University of Singapore said the latest move set Mr Xi apart from other previous Chinese leaders. \n\"[Former leaders] Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin never had as much consolidated authority as Mr Xi. However, it is unclear whether they had the inclination to do so even if presented with similar opportunities,\" said Dr Chong. \n\"There is certainly a lot of emphasis on Mr Xi as a person at present. The degree to which it becomes more formally institutionalised is what many are watching out for at the moment.\"\nBoth Deng and Mao, who passed previous resolutions, used it as a way to break with the past. \nThe first resolution, adopted at a party plenum in 1945, helped Mao consolidate his leadership so that he had full authority when he declared the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949. \nWhen Deng took over as leader in 1978, he initiated the second resolution in 1981 where he criticised Mao's \"errors\" during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, which led to millions of deaths. Deng also set the foundations for China's economic reforms. \nUnlike the former resolutions, however, Mr Xi is looking instead to emphasize continuity with his resolution, said Mr Ni. \nAfter all, Mr Xi's report comes at a time when China has become a global power - something scarcely imaginable just a few decades ago.\n\"The country stands at a point where it can now look back at significant growth in its economy, military, and recognition of its status as a major power, with the CCP as well as its leadership deeply entrenched with no opposition domestically,\" said Dr Chong.\n\"In some ways, the CCP with Mr Xi at its helm has reached a pinnacle of achievement for the party and for China.\"\nStill, politics can be \"surprising\", experts said, and despite all the evidence of Mr Xi retaining leadership for the foreseeable future, anything can happen. \n\"China's elite politics is opaque, so there is much we don't know,\" said Mr Ni.
